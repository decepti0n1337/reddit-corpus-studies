I watch him pretty actively, along with some others. But since nothing in the PTS is guaranteed to port as/is over to the live servers, I don‚Äôt follow those specifics too much. 
---

---
For example, they‚Äôve already changed the legendary perks themselves from what I saw.
---
My friends and I used to play Warhammer 40k, models and tabletop terrain and all.  
---
One day decades ago my tank was butted up against an big tyranid abomination, took aim with it's main cannon, and completely missed. Missed so bad we started joking the gunner saw a bird to shoot at instead.  
---
Ever since that night, whenever one of us is playing something and misses the broadside of a barn from point blank we start shouting "BIRD!" like my little gunner did.  
---
  
---
I can't even count how many times I've shouted bird while playing 76 recently...
---
I just jumped servers and things popped back in, but nothing ever disappeared ü§î maybe try scraping your vendors and see if your items jump back into your stash

My melee build does fairly well. Ballistics not so much.
---
Lol OPee doesn‚Äôt even have a bottle next to his battlestation
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve always carried explosive rifles/shotguns, my Tesla and the Gauss Shotgun still get me sometimes when I‚Äôm not careful...but I carry an Instigating Fire Axe go switch to in cramped spaces like Golf Club
---
Any of the bugged / magic heavy weapons.  I've solo'd it a few times using mine.
---
I‚Äôve set up a new page, obviously it won‚Äôt be as good, and no where as many people, but I‚Äôm gonna try and make it a good place
---
that randomly booted from the public team I test it and it is a bug, if I stay 1hr+ in a group (or in the group I made) it will randomly kick all people or dismantle the group.
---
You are correct. PTSD is the result of a singular trauma experience like the ones you described, C-PTSD is about repeated and/or ongoing trauma as well as new traumas being piled on, trauma that never stopped or stopped recently leaving a person deeply damaged and in a constant cycle of fight, freeze or flight.
---
I killed it a few times with a Bloodied FFR minigun, other times a TS+Limb Damage Gauss Mini, I don‚Äôt know if it counts as ‚Äòmagic‚Äô, since there‚Äôs no sudden drop of its HP, but rather a steady and fast drop.

If you have a few extra power armor frames you can block the ghouls from coming out shoot them jump over the frames and collect the uranium.

Same! Either the Deathclaw, the Behemouth, or the Lurk Queen.

Right.  Before the legendary run, we could earn 150 atoms a week through weekly challenges alone.  The legendary run goes for 10 weeks and we can earn the same amount we would if we did old weeklys for 10 weeks; 1500 atoms.  BUT, before the legendary run, we also got small amount of atom from doing daily quests on top of this.  Now, we no longer get those extra atoms from dailies.  So in the long run, we're still losing out on atoms that we used to be able to get in the form of daily challenges.  Back in the day we were able to earn about 50-60 atom a day just from the dailies alone (350-420 atom a week).  It'd be nice to still be able to earn small amounts outside of the account-bound challenges after we've completed most of them.  Now if I want to earn some more, I have these unreasonable expectations to meet like play for 7600 hours for 20 atom.  Don't pretend like you don't feel my pain.
---
What weapon? The gauss weapons are borked in VATS, at least the rifle and shotgun.
---
59 caps
---
I agree with all the flaws the system has but I don't understand why you had to buy boiled water.  Couldn't she have put the weapon in trade window for the same amount of caps you were paying her with?
---
jeez that's expensive but thank you anyways. Do you know of any other way to get a lot of Nuka Quantum?
---
A piece of junk in a scrap box isn't a physical item in the world, hence its so much less strain than adding more budget to camps would be.
---
Bethesda doesn't even surprise me anymore. They literally test nothing.
---
S I'm sure it will get a little better when I upgrade to the new Xbox but all my other games run fine
---
Not completely but, it's in the way. I use it too.
---
I haven't heard of this, how does it work if you don't mind telling me.
---
While i agree they need to change the seasons towards being more player friendly, you absolutely don't have to log in every day. I'm about 8-9 days away from rank 100 and there is still almost 5 weeks left of the season after that (we are on the 5th week now). Only time i have "grinded" was during double xp weekend. During which i played maybe 10-12 hours in total (across all 5 days). Rest of the score has come from doing daily/weekly challenges and normal daily acitivities for max 1h a day. So, i could have taken a lot of day-offs  and still be able to finish the season.
---
What if you already have 5 characters. Lowest is 110?????
---
Jumping servers didn't help, I'll be on later so I'm going to try some things then. Thanks for the ideas!
---
Not really just look for nuka cola machines or go to the plant
---
Yeah I'm excited to get the new Xbox hoping it fixes most of the performance issues
---
You can see enough sure. But It still annoys me so I use standard mag, it reloads so quick that it makes little difference.
---
Yeah that was her forgetting that I wanted to pay her. Haha But still, it should be simpler.
---
I fell for it recently. You get the blue effect, and the bonuses, but nothing happens until you fast travel voluntarily. It's not so bad. Run somewhere and punch things to death
---
Thanks, I appreciate the compliment. I wanted it to be an open floor plan so everything would be visible to people coming up. I actually quit playing a while back cuz of the camp glitch which wouldn't let me place it.
---
There is another low level Deathclaw spawn near White Powder Winter Sports up the slope near that electrical tower.

ah ok then thanks

Contrived as innnn the mysterious stranger comes to human nick valentine to save him from the bombs... The mysterious stranger dies in human nick's place, and it is taken that nick died when it was the mysterious stranger who dies in his place, after giving instructions to human nick valentine. Human valentine is somehow taken by a pack of friendly wendigos to a vault in west virginia........... Lol?
---
I‚Äôve crafted a few. It‚Äôs possible!
---
I buy her grape every day to stock pile
---
I‚Äôve already said I‚Äôd prefer Bethesda to increase the Atoms earned from the seasons. 2000 over ten weeks, even with the trade off of scrip, bullion, caps, etc and preset cosmetics, is less than I‚Äôd like to see. Make it around 4000 and that would feel balanced, in my opinion. 
---
But I also only spend Atoms on things that I plan to immediately and consistently use, or if they are on a large discount and I have at least some interest in them.
---
It‚Äôs all cosmetics and aesthetics, with some convenience items. That‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs 99% vanity stuff. So to be perfectly honest, if you want to get it all, then it‚Äôs reasonable to be prepared to spend some money. 
---
Your game experience isn‚Äôt dependent upon having a Clean Clown Suit to wear.
---
Thank you for the better explanation. Are you on Xbox? If so you're welcome to join me in exploring Appalachia. I feel like it's easier to play with others who have insight that way we don't take it the wrong way if someone gets upset or triggered.
---
Correct. Junk items that can be scrapped but Not auto scrapped cannot be inserted into the scrap box until broken down such as bug parts, Hallucigen cans, hardened mass, cooking oil, and a few other junk items used for crafting.
---
Also, if you have many heavy guns there's absolutely no reason to stash them (unless you are selling them) as they weigh significantly less when holding if you use bear arms and/or WWR armor.
---
Best thing you can do is block and/or unfriend these people.
---
I try but its hard when other games like apex have beautiful skins or like witcher 3 beautiful stories. Hell I have 15k atoms now from not playing...
---
You aren‚Äôt wrong, but not everyone plays that way.  I for one always stockpile the food that doesn‚Äôt spoil.  I never use gum and don‚Äôt farm it.  I‚Äôm newer too so I don‚Äôt know where everything is at and I‚Äôm only level 35.  So it kinda sucks for the lower levels that don‚Äôt really know the game that well and are trying to enjoy something new and fresh while also trying to not miss out on season stuff that we may or may not want.  Atoms, bullion, scrip, and caps are all nice to have and some of the gear and paints look fun.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôll take whatever is given but I do think there are some tweaks that could be done to make it a win for everyone.

Potentially player vendors. Usually run \~30 caps.

I heard it‚Äôs not scavengers alive but 100 ore that gets you the ability to roll for barrel plans and hazmat suits.

Ah, I never considered that. Problem with that is that it's not guaranteed, and I haven't really seen anyone sell Nuka Quantum recently.
---
IDK.  
---
The times I‚Äôve launched its been a weekend, so wasn‚Äôt worried about changed (or bad) codes.
---
not related but aight dude that's pretty good
---
Well if you don't want to delete the lowest one then level it instead (do you really need all your alts?). There is a big difference in xp needed per level if you compare a level 110 and lets say 400. Also, one tip i can give is to stop playing your main when you are near leveling up, and wait for the next day and possible new level up daily. Or if you actively play your alts, leave them at the brink of level up. It is not a perfect system but we gotto work with what Bughesda gives us.
---
Yep, several.
---
Burned through 130 leg modules and still can't get last Bolstering bit, left leg ..argggghhh
---
i swear every time bethesda makes a weapons, they fuck up the iron sights. they really dont understand the concept.
---
Haha don‚Äôt torture me anymore !!
---
I never aim down the sights I hip fire it.
---
People sitting there wasting precious time being manipulated into trying to spend money to get shit that was available for DLC in the game before it.  
---
The legendary run was just made to try to manipulate people into spending more ATX currency than they were putting into the system by releasing items that they don't have to put much effort into making. That's why so much of the shit released here is a shitty retexture,  or an asset from fallout 4 or already in 76
---
Absolutely.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say one ally is particularly better than others.
---
Beckett and commander Daguerre have actual quest lines , were the others seem to just give you daily miscellaneous missions.

10% chance in the Grove near Prime Fissure when it is in Blast Zone  Chance resets every time you clear the Grove of enemies and exit for 5-10 minutes and return.

---
It's a thing for deathclaws they added in Fallout 4.  They get compound fractures when you cripple most of their limbs. But in Fallout 4, you could also dismember the legs off a living deathclaw, which was pretty awesome.  Unfortunately all dismemberment for organic enemies was removed in 76.  Also, is your texture quality set lower? The quality of the wound looks muddier and uglier than I remember. Not sure if that's your settings/platform, or the game.
---
This one is good.  Helped me out today
---
Some sort of causal link between the mysterious strsnger and human nick valentine maybe
---
If they didn't make it harder and harder to do, you wouldn't get frustrated enough that you'd just drop Atoms on it. Thats the entire purpose of making it more frustrating to do.
---
Correct, no way to determine if "drinks" are alcohol or Quantums, unless you message the player. I sell them in my vendor when I accumulate 10+
---
The point was that multiple prizes are the exact same thing. 100 tiers with a dozen being virtually the same.
---
I bought this today, but can't seem to find him in my build menu under resources like it says. Am I missing something?
---
Edit: nvm I just realised I could side scroll on the scavenger one. Am dumb.
---
No problem! It took me months to figure out until someone else on Reddit helped
---
They want to keep you logging in daily so it pads their stats they show to their jabba the hut investors.  They don't care how long you play, and in fact encourage you to leave and quit wasting their bandwidth as soon as you're done and have reached your daily limits/caps.  Playing any longer illustrates the fact that there really is no content to do endgame, so everyone just logs in, does their chores, and leaves.  I'm rank 61 and don't even care about the rest of the shit on that board game.  Think I'll be putting this game away until there is actually some new quests/content other than a daily grindfest...
---
The southern cliffs by the Meditation Center has a fantastic overlook of the whole Toxic Valley.

do u have quantum by any chance? While we're here ofc
---
Cool site but says you need 3 NW camps today whereas you only need 1
---
I think I've been getting this when loading in, after about a minute I hear a little radio tuning type sound and then everything's there.
---
That is so true!! It‚Äôs as though when they enter the server , it‚Äôs all about them !! No I‚Äôm not an npc and I have my own challenges and farming to complete!!
---
I had mine within 24hrs
---
It's been bugged for a while with the Gauss weapons and the bows. Then the latest update hit and it seems it's spread to everything else to some degree.
---
I don't know if it is tradeable, but beyond that no. If it is tradeable you could trade it from someone, or transfer one from your alt character to main character.
---
You'll take your boiled water and you'll like it!

Not sure, I'd have to check. Will not be on for a couple of hours, Xbox.

Couple of different ones,  and none are gauss. Still missing multiple shots in a row with 95% chance to hit.... Hand-made is what I first noticed it on... Tried some others and same thing on marksman sniper rifle, auto laser rifle,  laser pistol and ski sword.
---

---
Other players used to be able to destroy your base by shooting at it too. Now the only worry is if someone nukes your camp while you're AFK.
---
I‚Äôm a hoarder too, but I do move stuff around like this commenter says. It‚Äôs pretty easy. I make sure both characters are at the same spot, usually the WS station. Log into the private server, place things to move in the blue suitcase, leave world, switch characters and log back onto private, grab your stuff. You could also drop it in a bag but that seems less reliable to me.
---
*"If you are going to AFK in Nuclear Winter, then don't have "Fill Team" ON."* \- No thx, i rather have 3 less people i have to worry about when i'm wookie bushing and trying to get those "level up on nw" challenges. Don't hate the player, hate Bughesda who forces people who don't like NW to play it. If you want to seriously play NW i would guess you can do so by making groups with friends. Or are you one of those people who think that their way of doing things is the only correct one, and rest of us should do things like you do?
---
I have seen a couple in players vendors recently. I may have 1 stashed away also. If I do, it's yours. What system are you on?
---
oh dear I'm on PC. Thank you anyways, I'll try checking player vendors for Quantum.
---
Hey someone just posted a winter jacket and jeans
---
It's a daily, not a weekly.  Weekly challenges reset tomorrow.
---
I was server hopping there to get one. 1st time it was just ants, that threw off my expectations. Next time I went I found all these dead blood bugs, I assumed someone had been there and killed them. I was right, it was the deathclaw and all I had ready was my little combat knife. Fortunately I was bloody, it was bloody and my knife is pretty is pretty op but I would've preferred a different weapon. Lol

Lovely. I suck at fps/tps games so I rely on vats quite a bit
---
Lol that‚Äôs a win in its own way!! The kids I‚Äôm dealing with can‚Äôt afford a night at the wayward !! Thankgod they can‚Äôt see our caps or they‚Äôd be asking for those too !!
---
Yeah, I did one today and some dude was one shotting everything. I‚Äôm only level 62 and I got swarmed by ghouls and he didn‚Äôt help me, and then when I tried to tag a legendary he blasted it in like 2 seconds. Like dude, I was literally a second away!!! I was doing my best to keep everything running and contribute but acting like that sucks. At the least he could have helped me out when I‚Äôm right next to him being attacked by five lvl 60 ghouls. Hasn‚Äôt happened much though, usually people are pretty good about letting others tag first.
---
That happens in my general inventory sometimes when I go to a vendor bot at a train station, but usually clears up when I go into my pip boy. This is with my vendors in my camp and I haven't had it happen before
---
I've had that before, I've figured it was something going on server side. Misses and damage not registering. I figured it was some type of lag issue. For me it was temporary, hopefully it will be for you too.
---
Take your meds schizo..
---
 Being a bush wookie is entirely different from being AFK. 
---
I had two friends, with one rando. Cool your jets, bud.
---
I‚Äôm sooooo hurt by your unoriginal recycled insult.
---
Yes, I have a 15%wb chest piece.  A shotgunner's pot of gold.
---
Just thick with'em. All shoulder to shoulder like a rock show. Writhing in a scaly mass, island barely able to stay afloat with the weight of them. That would be one hell of a sight.
---
I wouldn't say I've fallen out of love with it but the shine is wearing off as I get into the latter half. It's starting to get a bit grindy. That's only to be expected. Any new concept is bound to get stale after a while. I'll start to hit some nice rewards soon so that'll keep me going.
---
B2525 gauss minigun does great. Just sucks chewing all that ammo. aae Gatling plasma does well too. Explosive flamers deal good steady damage. Haven‚Äôt tried any other weapons but those. Yet.
---
Some of my spawn in times have been in excess of thirty seconds :(
---
Vault‚Äôs an idea I hadn‚Äôt thought of! Would be easy for instancing and not require a total overhaul of a current location. I really like the idea of Whitespring with everything they have inside the hotel, I just have a hard time visualizing how they would make a social hub that would be easy to access for different activities.
---
There‚Äôs a reason I‚Äôm not a dev though! I‚Äôm sure they could do something much simpler than I‚Äôm thinking.
---
sitting in a bush and hiding, moving when the circle moves and not actually fighting, is fine.
---
just standing there, not actually playing, and waiting for either the circle or a passing player to kill you is being afk, and is not fine if you waste a team slot.
---
I've definitely been leaning on this game pretty hard to give me day to day goals. Sad, but not as sad as if I didn't have this crutch.
---
character item transfer is a basic feature in the majority of online games with multiple character slots. nothing exploitative about it.
---
I'm quite calm, you are the one (your words) who is "aggravated" and whining about afk people and hoping they step on legos.
---
Haha good to know I‚Äôm not the only one. I don‚Äôt get how people can spend so much time playing this game and be so against it changing. When the whole world is ready to be rebuilt how can you not be bursting with ideas on how it can improve!
---
hopefully i wanna grind on a private server asap and that sweet ranger armor
---
Someone saw a YouTube video haha.

This.  Let the  legendary at least exit the cave.

I can't find the post.

###EXCUSE ME WHAT THE HELL

Haven't played much but if I remember it first started around Morgantown for the level.  Then they added the Forest area
---
Ohhh that may be true. It had been awhile in the group

I sprint to and from the bathroom during fast travel screens
---
I just got it the other day....

Maybe someone with suppressor perk hit the wendigo colossus.

INB4 " We have increased the budget cost of the red rocket prefab, which was bugged and only costing 3 flamingos instead of the correct 50 flamingos, we apologise for any inconvenience" LMAO
---
Ah crap. That was like the one thing I wanted. Ugh, stoopid seasons.
---
Congrats!
---
I launched my first one today as well. It was cool but then when I went to the Scorched Earth event, half the players there were level 30 or under, and the ones who could actually fight it, were barely trying. They‚Äôd sit at wait for her to come to them rather than chasing her, she ended up flying off a lot so that I was the only one constantly shooting her. I‚Äôve been in the event a lot before so it wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal but people just not trying when I launched the nuke really annoyed me :/
---
Tbh the vanilla Gatling gun with the high capacity drum blocks your view as well. Not as bad as this, but I know it‚Äôs been a complaint since beta. Shame.
---
I did the raiders once and the settlers twice because the Gauss Shotgun was the only thing I really wanted.
---
I think it's just because some items were made before they implemented certain camp and lighting optimizations and they just haven't had their budget consumption adjusted down yet. The fact that newer things are taking less budget is a good sign (no pun intended).
---
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a sweet gun, I want it‚Äù Oh man, thats so true lol. They have no sense of value and think we‚Äôve got plenty to spare !! No!! I have to put skins on just to hide them
---
‚ÄúIt just works‚Äù
---
those billboard were something i bitched about nearly a year ago, the nuka cola ones chew through nearly 15% of your budget on their own.
---
It is fine if i so choose. It's up to me, not anyone else, to choose how i play the game. Go ask bughesda to change the seasons so people who don't like doing NW can stay away from there. As long as they are putting NW challenges in, i'm doing them as i see fit. If you don't like it, you are free to form groups with friends. That way you don't have to worry about afkers.
---
Yeah my fallout 76 days are usually spent frantically trying to complete the dailies/weeklies and grinding out xp.  Then if I‚Äôm lucky enough to log back in later, I can chill out a bid and play it like normal.
---
Haha it‚Äôs like we‚Äôre just another NPC to be taken advantage of!!
---
PC is nice. Don't have to deal with nagging low level players. I do have some issues with really high level players one shotting legendaries or blasting the mic when they don't get a hit in on one though.

Don‚Äôt let it get to your head

Another thing about all the newbies, they are No Limit Soldiers! It doesn‚Äôt make any difference to them, they own the map. I was well over 150 before I felt confident enough to hit up Westek with regularity. These newbies go deep off in it with their veteran-given 300 stimpacks and ammo to burn and just go to town on the supermutants. They also know that a veteran is going to come along and clean them up for them. 
---
They are also messing up spawns and making everything lower level...it is what it is.
---
The only time I‚Äôve ever kicked a public team member... was when one of my irl friends wanted to get on the team. Other than that one time I don‚Äôt care if they are level 2 personally

Man screw the learning rate for the Radium Rifle mods.
---
With the same build and weapons and buffs a level 50 and a level 567 can do the same damage.

I love the low levels, They keep initiating PVP which makes the [Good Grief!](https://www.xboxachievements.com/game/fallout-76/achievement/162078-Good-Grief-.html) achievement a breeze

I'm not sure tho, last time I checked it's not there anymore ü§î
---
Same here. I read/saw two different posts about this. Is it true? Don‚Äôt know. But I did see it on here.
---
Any reason you didn't hop server instead of watching?
---
I think it was atom shop or NW reward idk
---
Yeah, there are really nice people in the FO76 community üòä I've been reading lots of similar stories, of people meeting each other through this game üòç
---
lol MCGA. Would love to see them have an NCR president with this slogan. Who needs New California currency anyways? 
---
Ideally, I‚Äôd hope an exchange could have a way to tell whether or not an item is duped and just keep it from being sellable. I said in an earlier post, but ppl had made it sound like Bethesda could tell if an item is duped upon inspection but didn‚Äôt want to remove them since a lot of players probably didn‚Äôt know they had bought duped gear. That way buying duped gear would at least be much harder and couldn‚Äôt change the legit item selling price but unsuspecting players weren‚Äôt just stuck with a duped weapon.
---
I 100% agree with your last point. it would take alot of the player base selling an item to crash the market so bad other people had to lower their prices. Otherwise your item just sells out right away and the guy selling at regular value just waits an extra hour or so. The only reason ppl are selling serums are 400 caps now for instance is because everyone kept saying ‚Äúthey‚Äôre only worth this much‚Äù until everyone was just convinced if they pay any more they‚Äôre getting ripped off. Meanwhile, god tier weapons are just expected to be worth 1k flux or other unreasonable amounts and isn‚Äôt sustainable unless you‚Äôre in the god tier club. Plus, I kinda like the idea that trader RP‚Äôers could theoretically make a fortune off just predicting item values and not having to participate heavily in combat to continue playing as a trader.
---
I did census violence there the other day. Had a total of about 20 spawn and I  was solo on my private server. I managed to complete it though. Junkies explosive Railway Rifle from sneak.

I usually will jump up on something high if out in the world. But a train station or somewhere safe, just find a dark spot out of the way to not bug others.

When i was going for the Ghillie suit i played with my friend, both have base PS4s no SDD, he always loaded in before me by like 10 seconds

I got it from mumbles junkies SS +s and thought the hell with ima try it out. And your comment is pretty much what happened.
---
Same, I am a gamepass noob, and sorry to hear this. Sounds like a bunch of horrible kids. :( which is pretty common on Xbox games.
---
I think a couple of lvl 100s tried to help me when I first started, but they made me nervous (hahah), so I ran away. I am pretty much a loner, which is why I didn‚Äôt start until it came on gamepass (although I am a big Fallout/Bethesda fan). It doesn‚Äôt make sense to play a game and get handouts though... seriously don‚Äôt see the fun in that, especially since dying is not a big deal. 
---
My favorite thing about the MMO aspect is finding player‚Äôs camps. It is always so interesting and fun to check out people‚Äôs creations. I also want to check out the trading system to buy stuff off of players (support local!) rather than going to train stations. I‚Äôm only lvl 28 but excited to get to the point of building cool camps.

It *is* an endless grind ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  
---
That's it. That's the game.
---
I agree with the delay, but...
---
Crossbow is actually very strong if you can hit. Especially with rifleman.
---
I haven‚Äôt played since they started these groups but makes me interested in playing again, gets old grinding solo all the time
---
Holy crap I‚Äôve seen that aswell !! They strip down and run around pistol whipping randomly. If you don‚Äôt get off the vendor when they want it they become agitated !!
---
they might have been bringing it to you so you could also get progress towards your daily "kill 3 deathclaws" objective.
---
Mate, on xbox it has never once showed me as online in the game since wastelanders.
---
Lfg posts are a pain with everyone telling me I'm offline.
---
I still can't work out why certain players use handheld weapons or slow firing weapons liken the gatling gun to try and stop the ghouls. Always missing one or two that kill the scavengers.
---
Looking forward to the resulting Mothman-CoA holy war when they find out.
---
September 2019. The old spawn system with the super mutants was super buggy and sometimes nothing would spawn during the event. Or enemies would just stop spawning midway through for whatever reason.
---
Bethesda fixed the spawns and changed the enemies to ghouls so now the event is worth doing. Nobody ever joined pre-patch.
---
Another north of the Red Rocket workshop. Behind the rocks to the north.
---
I spawned in last night took about 15 steps and got blasted by someone in PA with a gauss shotgun. I didn't even have anything on me. I'm on PS4.
---
That's really great! My fiance did the same to me, helped me when I was low level and actually built my camp for me üòä Despite the bugs and flaws, I'm glad this game brought a lot of people close üíï
---
It was in the atom shop. Not there now. Will probably come back around sometime.
---
Diaper up!
---
Still an issue and seems to only be getting worse.  Happens about every other event now for my friends and I.
---
I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to speed up the process. Have you learned to craft them? How many would you say it took.
---
I know full well about bugged effects, and even if they were to fix it all of a sudden the disparity would still be the exact same and the risk portion of the build would still not be challenged under any circumstance given a minimum of mechanical knowledge on the user's part.
---
It doesn't change anything not does it affect the absurd strength of bloodied pressing ctrl to completely negate the one downside bloodied is supposed to have while also boosting their efficiency even more.
---
If you were to follow me, "to tag along", I'd also either kick you from the group or join a different one.
---
But not because of your level, I'd rather play alone, outside those events I like.
---
As for you sharing the 15% exp... I don't care, XP comes really easy. My Specials are 12Str 31Perc 7End 15Chr 24Int 34Ag 25Lck. So your XP buff is actually really useless for me .)
---
But as long as you don't try to get close to me, I don't care what level you are and what perks you share, except for the rad sponge...
---
I've recently found out high level players sometimes have better odds at getting good rolls why those barely getting over 50 have a harder time finding legendaries and good drops.
---
I remember in 4 you could cut their tails off when they were still alive and they'd like have no balance and fall over a lot.
---
Yeah, I'm glad to know a lot of couples have met/bonded through this game, especially in these trying times üíï keep safe out there üòä
---
I make sure I'm topped off on food and water and just crouch on my toilet in my outhouse.
---
Imagine not enjoying the game enough you want people to just give you everything lol
---
Why are they even playing then
---
Oh, I was thinking you would need two consoles and you would need to be playing as both characters simultaneously. I didn't realize you could log out as character A and then log back in as character B and get the loot.
---
I cannot upvote this enough
---
I go inside a place with a load screen like the Whitesprings, the Overseer‚Äôs home or the main center of The Crater.
---
I literally join low level groups to help players out and they kept opening trade window and selling me dirty water for 2000 caps or some other junk for 2-3k. I kept closing the window since I don‚Äôt like cash begging when I was already there to offer my time.
---
After third window open and closed I get kicked from group. Which reinforced my choice to not cash award some random shit head. It‚Äôs funny how you can read player behaviors without chat or voice. I just knew his type, I‚Äôve seen it in a 100 other mmos. Beggers who just want a free boost and forget about you a second later. 
---
Another time I joined a group and dropped a bunch of nice items on the floor for each member of the group. I was shooting the floor trying to get the third persons attention and my explosive shots got the better of me on low health and I killed myself (so I dropped random pocket junk). They proceeded to loot that trash even after I gave them items worth thousands of caps...then when I got back they kicked me out of group.
---
This is all I the last 2 weeks.
---
Yes I‚Äôm officially done being nice to the latest wave of new players. They are all ungrateful assholes.
---
I think if you have acquired a paint you can favorite it for NE and it will apply it to your armors.
---
Yup. It's truly horrible
---
ty, finally someone who actually knows the answer before they reply
---
Shoutout to the ladies!! He just started this game! üòÅüòÅüòÅ
---
That makes sense because we did that
---
That log cabin was a piece of shit and designed by a toddler that doesn't know what log cabins look like.
---
And your guess about soon atom expenditure doesn't make sense when there's no new walls to choose from since the only one were only returns in a bundle.
---
The garbage thing about Beth in current Atmoic Shop days is that they're more concerned with gotcha schemes like making new items exclusive to bundles that you may not want splurge your atoms on. I've been wanting something sheepsquach related for a while and now that we finally have a mount, it's one, being sold for atoms when every other month is unlockable and two, it's exclusive to a bundle with shit I don't want like more wallpaper and floors. Let along a wallpaper/floor design that is the exact same texture with no variation. Did they not learn that you don't make your walls look the exact same as your floors in Minecraft? Fucking architecture 101? And that hunter's chair that's too small to be a hunter's chair, bleh.
---
No, paintjobs from the store don't matter in any form.
---
tag along wasn't ment in a literal sense, i'd already put above that it wouldn't normally impact you negatively since you wouldn't have contest for kill exp.
---
also rad sponge wont harm your rads as long as you aren't together, its sun kissed your thinking of that soaks all your rads without permission
---
Absolutely fucking not. Excuse the french. As far as i'm concerned FO76 has nothing to do with the real fallout universe. FO76 in it's travesty should be more like some parallel universe thing.
---
EDIT: That said, i think they will write the story around some new vault and new characters. That way they can be more free with the writing as they don't have to follow the already familiar plots and stories so closely.
---
Can you put on the SS ghillie and use this gun for maximum meme effect?
---
Go to the whitespring and play the piano while I run to the bathroom
---
Indeed. Took forever to unlock that mod only to immediately take it off
---
It should not a lot of the stuff in 76 contradicts lore
---
Bethesda said no one would use in game chat on pc. I find that hard to believe.
---
High level players have better odds because they play more..
---
Have you tried cancelling the quest and restart it
---
That's a flat out lie, you have the same chance at lvl 50 as someone 300+.
---
[deleted]
---
I hate that. I keep 3 or 4 weapons in my inventory. Because I use them and the only armor is,what I'm wearing. No I'm not trading any of it. Plus my weapons are worth more than max caps.
---
Thanks a lot!
---
I usually just let the ghouls attack the invincible speaker and get a free event while i sit in stealth cuz nobody ever does it
---
Aw, it's success stories like these that make me happy and look forward to mine üíï thanks for the inspiration üòä
---
It‚Äôs really off putting. There‚Äôs an expectation there for no reason !! Last time I gave a weapon to a lowbie he immediately tried attacking other lowbies. Little savages
---
Thanks. I wandered around for a while and finally walked to the train station.
---
I guess it all depends on who‚Äôs playing. I just started playing this weekend when i got it on game pass and I‚Äôve taken more of a single player approach, but I couldn‚Äôt even imagine asking people for handouts. It seems weird to me that others would rather annoy other players to get ahead or make the game easier instead of actually playing the way the game was designed to be played.
---
This!
---
I mean, I would just turn the feature off. New players are annoying as it is
---
I stopped playing after the first 3 weeks because of the bugs and the weird questline.
---
"Oh, here is a holotape saying to find X survivors!"
---
But I already know that the game has no NPC's. In fact I think that fact everybody has died should of been hidden.
---
It should of been a gradual realisation that even the Brotherhood and Enclave couldn't stand against the Scorched.
---
But it should of kept you hopeful that SOMEBODY might have made it
---
It‚Äôs not hard to server hop and find events, as many people have said.
---
The level up ones are annoying. I wish they didn‚Äôt so them every day, but I have managed to level up on my main (level 360) almost every day since the start of seasons. It‚Äôs not THAT bad. And you can just use a level 1 alt if you really want.
---
The NW tasks are usually a freaking joke. Deploy a camp? Kill 1 player? Kill 3 AIs? That‚Äôs ridiculously easy even to an entry-level NW player (assuming they aren‚Äôt a bush wookie). I don‚Äôt mind easy challenges, I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs stupid to complain. If anything, people who like NW (like me) should complain that there are such a high number of adventure challenges and only 1 NW challenge per day. I‚Äôm forced to play adventure even if I‚Äôd rather play NW. The challenges should be half NW and half adventure and only allow you to complete half of them so no one is forced to play either mode.
---
Wait...what? Is that really a thing? I‚Äôm over 100 hours in and haven‚Äôt seen this
---
In my opinion, I swear by it. It's personal preference I suppose. Unless you are doing a PA Build but honestly that almost completely defeats the point of bloodied.
---
I don't always run exactly 80% rads, I'll decrease it sometimes if I'm fighting ghouls or doing the SBQ in preparation for taking radiation damage. So for me, adamantium skeleton allows me to not have to worry about stimpacking and going above 20% health if I do break a limb. Plus the extra points in endurance brings my total health up.
---
There are other ways to operate a bloody build and everyone has their own way. Find what works for you bro.
---
If you want to see my build I can send you a link. It's unarmed melee but I can swap some cards and get by as a
---
2H PA if I'm going into a nuke zone, really need the tankiness for some reason, or just want to.
---
With the Scout Armors, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre paints. There‚Äôs the full set of Urban Scout Armor and then there‚Äôs a separate set of Forest Scout Armor.
---
100000000000% every bit this.
---
Raiders. I just found them more interesting.
---
I have a mule to hold all my weapons. I have around 1100.
---
Sun kissed, is also bad for bloodied, but not as bad as the sponge which heals up to 200 rads and can't be countermanded by toxic goo.
---
That's great you bridged the gap! Wish you both all the best üíï
---
Woah there buddy, you think the Lord almighty Godd Howard, He Who Can Do No Wrong, Prince of Perfection, God of Bug Features, Slayer of His Own Fansbase even bestows his shining blessing of presence upon this game?
---
No, us common rabble are too low of class to receive such miracles.
---
No thanks, I don't need any discussion with you.
---
&gt; **The build mode menu has and always will be a cluttered, confusing nightmare.**
---
i'd rather it take place in an area of the US we havent seen in any of the games.
---
The game I played with the best trade system was a browser based game called falllen sword. You could sell things for the in game currency or the purchasable currency. Since you could sell for purchasable currency - there was no need to do item for item trades. Oh, and it's auction house was just that; an auction house where you could put something on auction or sell it as a buy it now like ebay.
---
Why every game with a trading system falls short of a browser based game is beyond me.
---
I‚Äôd honestly feel bad saying that. I‚Äôm mild mannered most the time. This is probably part of the problem, you gotta be assertive with these kids !!
---
yeah I have learned to craft them. I don't know how many it took. I am on PS4 if you want a bunch of them.
---
such as?
---
You will, from the right person üíï wish you luck üòä
---
Still gotta hope people dont annihilate them
---
Friggin bloodieds
---
Nope.
---
Well done üëçüèª
---
ok thanks alot
---
Thank you sir
---
I can‚Äôt think of anything but Iam sure you‚Äôll find something like supermutants not being in Virginia at the time
---
Don‚Äôt forget the one just south of WestTek on the plateau.
---
I paid my way to victory the day it became an option. Now when I play I am back to being free to do what I want vs what I needed to cross of my chore list. 
---
I make decent money, so its no biggie to throw down $40 for the atom I needed to finish my run.
---
Always check ive the assaultron recall card thingie cost 1750 (lowest) ive not, okay maybe little more rad / do i wear my unyielding / hard bargain on?! When on 1750 i know im good to go to sell and/or buy!
---
Yeah, it still has its issues, no where near as bad as launch, but I've been around since Beta. I'm slowly working through whatever quest she decides to inbetween exploring, building etc. As I type we are doing retirement blues which I love and hate lol. She hasnt started on the main Wastelanders quest line yet but we will be soon. She's enjoying A BE .50cal and a BE laser, while not being bloodied ever because she dislikes being irradiated or low health lol.
---
I think you get like 15 minutes before a private server resets. 
---
Twice when i've done this in two months my game has crashed and when i went back into private the stuff was gone. So i wouldn't move anything too valuable. I lost a load of legendary weapons. most were scrap but there were a few worth 10k or so. I also lost like 20k 5.56 and loads of other ammo. 
---
BUT! nothing i was gonna miss
---
Honestly I see all these posts of people talking about the community being righteous people that have few or no toxicity but the truth is that there is a really decent size of the f76 community that is just overall toxic as hell and I'm tired of shit like a lvl 8 getting killed constantly or high levels destroying bases with explosive bait out of PvP, this game has a ton of bug that makes it really tilted in the advantage of trolls. I mean I still stumble upon trap bases that uses plans with stacked punji boards.
---
I got gunz, big ones!
---
PC unfortunately, but thanks for the offer, I appreciate it.
---
Yes.
---
That's awesome! I agree the FO76 community majority are nice people, no surprise people found their best friends or SO through this game üòª keep moving forward ok? ü§ó
---
Then it does insane damage for not having any pistol perks equipped
---
Gotcha. Thanks.
---
Ssds are a game changer. That's why next Gen of consoles use em.
---
That red rocket sign we got for free was actually a literal clone of the one you unlock.
---
Now there's two of the same item on there.
---
I got 3 to spawn in, dont know if it was because i was a group of 2 or what
---
I have an extra radiation barrel plan, I'm willing to trade
---
supermutants being in west virginia is explained. west tek were doing FEV experiments on the people of Huntersville. they also made the grafton monsters and snallygasters.
---
My playtime is now Only spent getting workshops, running two/three low level events to get them done, and at west-tek killing supermutants over and over and over and over and That's it. I don't even do the dailies at all anymore because all my playtime is spent doing that boring ass shit just so I can progress spaces and get the Atoms. And I only want the Atoms, they can shove the rest of the useless crap back up their bums where it came out of.
---
official sauce pl0x
---
Pro tip: 
---
- You don't have to do the dailies.
---
- You can do the dailies *after* killing legendary mobs.
---
You bring up a good point - *why don't dailies offer guaranteed legendary mobs?*
---
Ok I‚Äôm going to back away now and avoid eye contact
---
I agree. There should be a better system in place that protects both parties during a trade. This could help prevent stealing or ripping people off.
---
Seriously, they are all the same, like some sort of sci fi house made out of legos.  And then they want to be clever and have you walk through an excessivly large, multi floored house through all those toys and display cases to get to the fucking vendor machines that are just full of (known) plans, 1* legendares, and .38 rounds.  Thanks for this being parked in my spot.
---
Besides the atomic shop outfit, there is also a samurai helmet unlocked in NW. But its locked until lvl 80?
---
I have killed myself more with that weapon than I have killed other players. It's like guaranteed death
---
but it just works!  
---
the guy... **survives longer than the rest of the team, and until the fifth circle**
---
Possibly this. I was tagging the deathclaws at scorched earth rather than instakilling them.
---
This has only been an issue since Wastelanders.  Something they did with the patch/update really messed up NW spawns.  It used to be everyone more or less spawned at the same time (you could always bypass the round start freeze), but now it just makes people load in when they load in, which can be a MASSIVE advantage where people can literally have a 60 second head start.
---
76 is the restart of the fallout universe mark my words itll be about events around 76 and future
---
Yes I have a couple
---
Mine must be in a great spot. It has been in the same spot for about 6 months now. I move it occasionally to unload when I am overweight and then put it right back.
---
Not funny at all
---
Man, I‚Äôve played fallout before. I‚Äôm saying the crosshairs won‚Äôt close in at all, and I‚Äôm stuck hip firing. It sucks whenever a teammate is getting shot and I can‚Äôt do anything but hit one in 10 shots because it won‚Äôt aim in and the crosshairs stay super wide.
---
I heard you can toss a grenade behind the display case at the overseers house to get her fireman uni to fall out and then pick it up
---
There is 1 atomic shop paint. Called Nuclear Winter Camo, F1ST exclusive though. There is the ghillie, but weirdly isn't applicable to NW
---
You mean you can't solo it?
---
There are several contradictions they very very cheaply and amateurishly rewrote just so they can put things from old games into this one. Like super mutants, brotherhood of steel, caps as currency, power armor types and many many others.
---
I think starting with FO76 would be a bad idea. OK so chronologically it would be logical but the storyline in the game isn't the strongest when presented in a linear fashion, and I can't see a new TV series being very popular if it bounces around along the multiple quest lines.
---
F04 would be much better. The intro 'War Never Changes' sequence is very strong - I recommend watching the colourised version on YouTube to see just how how strong it would be as the pre-credit sequence. You have a pre-war intro, then down in to the vault with shock and awe, and a little darkness.
---
On in to the story itself reduce the npcs to Piper and Nick Valentine as the friendlies fighting for survival in a hostile wasteland using the rescue of the child as a group goal and a source of hope for the future.
---
End series 1 with the chrs siding with a friendly faction to take on the evil underground society closing on a Mushroom cloud...but was it underground, or launched from there..??? Leave it on a cliff edge. 
---
If successful then you could take subsequent seasons as related but individual arcs from across the continental battlefield. Based on the games, or new storytelling, but importantly with the freedom of not having to be follow the exact Lore or time lines.
---
Different uni afaik
---
I sell all golf clubs, regardless of legendary level, for 4 caps.
---
Same, time has been very slow when you're patiently waiting for something, but this game speeds it up a bit just because we're having fun and there are goals to achieve üíï anything to distract us from the negativity of this year ü§ó
---
That is the one I was thinking of.  Forgot it was a 1st exclusive.
---
This would be the best way to handle the series. And easiest to write.
---
It should honest start in California since that's where the originals started from, but before the Vault Dweller left Vault 13.
---
This right here. Hit it on a travel to 76 so even if you land before you're done peeing, you're just standing at 76.
---
I don't see the difference. If I'm sitting in a bush, relatively close to where the center of the circle is, and not moving because I'm in no danger, how is that any different than someone hiding in a corner somewhere totally afk?
---
a retcon by addition is not a contradiction, though. i didnt say it was well-written, but it does fit the lore.
---
There are some events you can afk or partially afk.
---
Just makes me think of two dirty scavvers hopped up on chems getting it on in Pulowski Preservation shelter
---
I made a post like this and all I got was butt hurt people down voting it.
---
Which is weird, a 1st player dropped the NW camp armor for me during a match and I could use it, even though I don‚Äôt have 1st.
---
Whitesprings nukes for that and cobalt flux
---
It is truly amazing that you couldn't see the prompt on the bottom of your screen.
---
Alright like I said I‚Äôm not sure don‚Äôt know why I got downvoted I don‚Äôt care about karma it‚Äôs just annoying
---
I always co fuse this event with Path to Enlightenment. Gotta dance with the Mothman
---
I sit my controller down, try to park my character somewhere safe-ish and pee. Junk might be lost if I die or some broken armour but I don't care IRL comes first. Go pee.
---
because the guy in the bush is going to move when the circle moves and attempt to stay alive. they're still actually playing.
---
the guy who goes afk as soon as the match starts just stands there in plain sight and will inevitably die. which again, on it's own is no issue, but when you dont turn off auto-fill team you become dead weight for people actually playing when they coulda had an actual teammate.
---
i dont even play NW, but when i do it for a quick challenge i turn off auto-team as a courtesy. nobody needs me to place a camp three times and then half-ass the rest of the game.
---
üëç
---
Aren't we all mutants irl atm lol covid joke
---
*But we have all the ammunition.  And the skill. And the infrastructure.*
---
This is obviously the correct form
---
Pu $$y
---
Try Junkies üòÅ I've always been in a PA and hated being low health too! My fiance made me choose between bloodied and junkies. I know bloodied build is considered the best, but in the wrong hands (mine), it could be a disaster üòÇ Junkies is the go to for me üíï
---
Tbh assassins needs the same buff
---
Unless you‚Äôre carrying mass amounts of food for some reason then the chemist backpack is the way to go
---
That's sweet. I wish you both well.
---
And far more interesting characters
---
Don't forget Project Paradise
---
9 times? Didn‚Äôt happen. Also don‚Äôt use the r word.
---
After episode 2 the audience would realize everyone is dead. 
---
I think Fallout 1 would be cool. You see a running vault, visit ransacked vaults, mutants, wastelands,  etc.  The twist at the end would be a good season ender.
---
Also flows nicely into Fallout with Arroyo.
---
It's been in the game files since launch. I doubt they will add it because they need to copy and paste a few things to get it working right. Too much work for overpaid dev
---
Honestly, it was impressive at the end. Dude got 7th overall. Still miffed, but you gotta have a small amount of respect for that level of sheer, dumb luck.
---
Thank you very much! üòä
---
Correct. If you are specced for pistols then it increases the physical damage but not the radiation damage. You can modify it, however to output 125 radiation per shot. These things are wicked tools if you get certain legendary attributes like quad or two shot, especially when modified to be automatic.
---
I use one to give myself radiation by shooting the floor if I am doing low health stuff or need a radicool boost.
---
Shotgun crippler or heavy gunner tank - depends on the occasion. Have quad explosive combat shotgun for 90% of the time  &amp; vamp gauss minigun for SBQ &amp; other big baddies üôÇ
---
I'll pop back to camp and sleep if convenient, otherwise I jump on top of a building and stealth.
---
I feel ya on that. I just got a magic weapon and noticed the dps i was dealing to sbq before it even landed. I always take pot shots at it just so that others can get hits on it.
---
I'll mark your words :D but i still disagree. There are more interresting things in atomic wastelands than there are in some silly green appalachia and vault 76.
---
No. All of these problems will continue to get worse and more exaggerated as you accumulate items in your inventory.
---
If you are running that poorly on a fresh toon, uninstall the game and save yourself from a headache.
---
Yeah it's really grimmy and greedy of them. All I know is what I'm buying for sure is the new Lever Action skin. Mothman Hunter outfit for the hat and any NCR gear/bundle the introduce, also the Thanksgiving Display.
---
That sounds like an amazing new euphemism for male genitals.
---
Settlers. They are assholes but at least they work for there stuff and are productive
---
I didn‚Äôt downvote you. Just wanted to have correct info here for people who may be searching through the thread.
---
9??? Ok, why didn't you just server hop ??  You would think that after the 3rd time in a row, you would change worlds, but 9... 9 is a lot.
---
He sold it for caps because the recent dupe required caps to do
---
happend to me idk what to do guess im gonna have to stop playing
---
Don't forget about quick swapping weapons so you can get that last tick of damage on the dude you're fighting, your game freezes, and when it finally unfreezes, you're dead.
---
Smart, mine is a junkies and it did 200 base damage with no attachments or perks
---
Like 99% of the playerbase is incapable of teamwork.
---
Higher level players are more likely to be more optimized with gear, mutations, etc, than a level 50. This is because they've spent a ton more time playing that character than the level 50. Their power cap is the same, however; If you take all their gear and slap it on the level 50 that character will do the same damage (barring any deficit from needing to max out a first-available-at-level-50 perk card).
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
By level 70 it's unlikely that any perk card choices will continue to improve your character (in combat, anyway - Things like crafting aside). Every level past 50 is time spent grinding out gear. A level 500 likely has their gear almost perfect to their desires due to having spent so much time grinding gear. A level 50 will not have that unless gifted or traded or very lucky.
---
There is no actual difference in power between those characters. A higher level is usually more powerful simply because more time has been invested in gathering gear that unlucky rolls are offset more.
---
Yeah but they're not actually fighting back, most times. So I don't see the difference. And yes, I almost always remember to turn autofill off. And yes lol, I'm one that if spotted I just squat there and die and don't fight back.
---
I love you
---
They want you to drop it and pick it up with physics and put it on the shelf. Oh wait that doesn't work on the commercial build.
---
I have my challenges done quickly now 
---
To level up in NW or the regular game I built a new player do 1 quest instant level up NW new player just play 1 game instantly level up
---
Other quest switch from first to regular about 2times I finish all
---
Brotherhood doesn't get formed for a few more years. If you listen to those holotapes and the ones at Camp Venture, you'll learn the story.
---
Sounds about right. They're okay for trash mobs but higher level creatures typically absorb radiation, and in the case of ghouls it heals them. The only practical use is for pvp or human type enemies.
---
Huh, maybe! That must have been nice to just knock the daily out all in one spot!
---
huh? So Because you see 300+ lvls around, you feel insignificant?  You know it's just a number right, meaning they are not more powerful, they have just grinded longer.  Why do you care about the grind or what others are leveled?   WoW... you may want to try to some introspection.
---
I usually go inside the garage, stand towards the back, face the opening and then rotate it till it snaps
---
I think the difference is that, even if the rest of the team is wiped, the bush wookie could possibly still win it. There's a reason to stick around and root for them. With an AFK, it is 100% dead weight.
---
VATS has always been broken, but the past 2 updates have made it much worse.
---
I always use natural locations.  I had one that used the ruined billboard by the monorail, could more by other fuined monorail sections.  A few in the Mire.  I try to make like they belonged there, not so much with the kitch. 
---
I've only seen one--just one--with a better camp than mine.  It was a spot on a lake that boarders between the Mire and Cranberry Bog beneath an overpass.  I had the area beneath with vendors and the whatnot, while the freeway was the workbenches and a 'camp.'  There's a bunch of natural stairs going all through that area, so I log in and fuck, can't be placed.  So I start looking.  He has no vendors, so I start poking around and go ABOVE the overpass, and there's a random encounter dog from the original Fallout game.  This dude found this spot, built a stone house around the area, with the dog under the floor.  That was better than mine.  I talked to him, super cool.  I moved to another spot.  His was better.
---
So am I do I judge?  Yes.  I am also humble, and thus bowed out.  He earned the obscure fucking spot that I had picked because who would build in this obscure fucking spot?
---
honestly though, some i've gone to are just a little shed and bed
---
That‚Äôs a good way to do it
---
I'm a level 300 and I just sit on the roof till the guy is ready. I try to hold all 3 pylons and maybe get a shot in but if they need alittle more fire power ill melt it after a while when everyone has a shot.
---
This is the best answer. The explosion is like 15x wider than the VFX.
---
Local gay bar should have a few prospects
---
I 100% approve the use of the Flamingo Scale....and if we're really upset about something, the Flamin' Flamingo Scale.
---
Carry on.  Excellent work!
---
That was a neat find. My sister and I stumbled across it awhile back. I‚Äôd love to see more random places like these to find on our journey.
---
I assure you,  it's not.
---
Those wanks will shoot you even if you leave the workshop and clearly have no intention of contesting
---
Delete his object. Poof!

Yep, A then B. I see the other comment about losing gear. I‚Äôve probably done it dozens of times and have been lucky up to this point and never lost anything, just be quick and efficient.

Episode 2 - everyone is dead.

Penultimate episode - everyone is alive again.

The miracle of TV.

For sure was especially after the deathclaw island one was invincible
---
Yeah it leaves a bad taste in my mouth too. I'll never put more money into the machine now.
---
I hear the loot table is garbage.
---
What ?!? "... I refused to shoot at the beast while it destroyed the lower half of my camp and told them to fight it on their own ..."     Then you can't complain about it busting your camp.  Just kill the thing, why so pompous? 
---
Also... "  ...probably in awe of my outfit or level... " 
---
Wow.. you really love you some you
---
RIght now mine is kinda boring, in the middle of the golf course, but I want the vendor foot traffic.  I'll move it in a week, because it bores me.  Gstting nuked is no big surprise there.
---
But I would pay CAPS to see that shit.

It is actually 1/5

---
Ammo machine before any gun.. it just makes your life a little easier.
---
HI WHALE! üê≥üêãüê≥
---
I'm not a game designer but I would simply make it work like you throw all your ammo via Inventory transfer and then you just use that cosmetic spin on AmmoConverter (as an confirmation). 
---
Because let's be honest whoever created this ammo-spin animation put more effort and resources into something you only use once or never ever. (than work that went into terminal management)
---
And there would be terminal attached to it where you could exchange points into ammo mags with 1x , 2x , X5 , X10 , xAll for each specific ammo type.
---
Quick and clean and pleasant.
---
They should know how to conduct honest business. Like Fortnite, all the skins are expensive but its a free game. Doom Eternal has seasons but the skins are free because they game was $60. If 76 was free yeah Atoms all the way. But its not free. Even on game pass its $15 just to have the subscription, plus 1st? Too greedy

She fell in love with the .50cal when she got a Junkies one from the purveyor she used until level 50. She hasn't decided on a build yet, and we're just getting new armor every day looking for stuff for carry weight. My personal Unyelding armor isnt god rolls, other than one piece, I like it because I love the look of Marine armor. She has a bunch of what would be considered God tier weapons I gave her.
---
Yea just got a one star suppressors knuckle
---
Fixed amount that stacks. That's why it is best used with fast firing weapon.
---
Sounds annoying but also be happy people are actually playing the game.
---
‚òùÔ∏è nonsense
---
I've got two -50fd scout armor pieces and I would have totally been willing to trade one.
---
All I need is a scout mask and basically ANY legendary scout left arm and I'll be set.
---
Seems like everyone always gets what someone else needs, and usually scrips it.
---
I've got three or four UNY pieces, but I'm not running bloodied, so I'm holding onto them for future trades.
---
That said, bird bones.
---
I forgot to put on my CSA (between that and bird bones, basically no fall damage. I was jumping off buildings in Watoga like nothing) for Path to Enlightenment earlier, and jumped off the top of the lighthouse in just my Enclave officer uniform and barely took damage.
---
Same.  Except right now while I'm living in the 'burbs of Whitesprings.  I'll move in a week, already bored with it.
---
Yeah.  I like overwatch's model the best.
---
Haha I‚Äôll rephrase that.... ‚Äúclever‚Äù way to do it?  I myself am not crafty enough to think about taking over workshops to setup turrets.  Although I was in a deadly match with a more powerful deathclaw as a very low level player once and lured it over to someone‚Äôs heavily fortified camp..
---
I was rolling unyielding for the longest time and I got Bolstering chest, left and right leg.
---
Would you (or anyone) happen to know the amount? And I assume it starts the Regen every shot so like a Minigun with a high ROF would be great
---
Same, haven't noticed any delays with cooking and I craft ginsy of soups
---
Happy to say I've only ever spent $40 on the base gsme
---
While I am highly thankful for all those very friendly vets in this game, I wanted to say that as a Game Pass noob. I like the challenge of having to struggle at first. You guys have blown my expectations out of the water on how kind you all have been and it has been great and I am sure there will be kids (like those mentioned in this post) that will try to suck the lifeblood outta ya because of your kindness.
---
 Just know that there are some noobs out there that are not at all like this and we do appreciate you, but also know that we don't need handouts. This community has made my first venture into the wasteland very enjoyable and far beyond what I had imagined. So keep your spirits up and maybe cut back a bit on the handouts unless you get to know some of the newer folks :D
---
Correct, and fast firing weapons are more effective with it, that or explosive as the 2nd legendary effect because it stacks from all the mobs it hits not just the bullet.
---
It also works with sentry bot helmet (robot armour)
---
Yup. I thought it was a pretty cool, hidden little place.
---
THIS! That is exactly what it feel like, WE ARE NOT NPCs!
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
Sorry for your luck friend...
---
That's impressive.  I get bored and move mine every other week.
---
Did it used to be about 1000 per week?
---
I don't know that I'm burned out, but I didn't work on the challenges at all yesterday and I only did enough to get the 5 done today. It just felt like too much when I had other shit to do.
---
I was sad that the bungalows were empty.
---
No prob.
---
This happens on consoles too. What the fuck?
---
I meant the only doable recipes button.  The experience points total lags for me but it doesn‚Äôt slow down making anything
---
Then Ward becomes a lovely sacrifice for the Moth. üòÇ
---
Maybe it's because I die usually just when the final combatants announcement hits, but you don't get any benefit if the wookie wins right?
---
Depends....
---
Ty
---
I don't remember the exact amount, but it was very small (like 2hp/sec for 5secs or something like that). On minigun it's a beast. Your health will jump to max almost instantly. I got a vampire 25%ffr 250dr minigun myself that i use to solo Encryptid. When you are firing, you can't die. So big magazine size is a big plus too.
---
What‚Äôs amazing is you are all buttsore because I thought the comment about how doing this won‚Äôt happen because it wouldn‚Äôt make them money was a weird comment.
---
You literally got all offended and freaked out. 
---
On a post about how Bethesda needs to fix something that‚Äôs a mess. 
---
Back on block for you.
---
Hold on to those, as unyielding is what I was after. It was worth a lot to me. The second piece I gave a BE25 Tesla for. I have been looking for so long for those. I would post once a day and it seemed hopeless. There definitely fancy IMO.
---
Lol Od√≠n was not with us.

Any other games or inputs have sound?

Have you tried doing the full system reboot for Xbox? Not just shut off console and turn back on but the actual full reboot?

What platform?

nice! for farming tech data, is it only lvl 3 safes, mostly in the power plants?
---
:D
---
She's the boss! üòÅ you're a great friend! This game can be confusing and difficult most of the time, at least for me when I started out and my fiance gave me a major boost in the game, so I can relate to you and your friend's in-game journey ‚ò∫ Is love in the wasteland air tho? üòÜ jk!
---
Not anymore. Tis gone for good unless someone trades it to you or you were a BETA player.
---
Sadly i got rid of mine not too long after BETA.
---
Still have my photos with it tho
---
edit: forgot about savage divide events but the rate is so low you have a better shot finding a trader

Settlers, just because I got really tired of the "aPpAlAcHiA bElOnGs tO uS" dialog line. Boy, I live here in real life, get outta here with that bullshit.
---
Assassins would still be useless with a buff because of the 110 PvP damage cap. Unless they allowed the assassins effect to break the damage cap up to like 125 or so.
---
Bloodied lightweight mutant gold clibs go for 4 caps?
---
Personally -  Melee build with a FSS ghoul slayers switchblade.... 1 hits L42s, 2 hits L58 - 62 bloated glowing ones.  
---
And if that breaks, its backup is a ghouls slayers Bowie.
---
This! But at the same time a massive glitch will pop up where one person gets both of the items or some shit.
---
The purveyor doesn‚Äôt sell that unfortunately
---
I am sure you've done this,  but just mentioning it because it happened to my friend.   He didn't know why I could never invite him,  but he had himself "appear offline" under profile&gt;set online status.   Double check yours hasn't changed to this somehow
---
Damn.  Is there a place to see how expensive it would be to buy off another player?
---
I had the animal machine and it takes forever to make ammo.
---
Yeah, they pretty much just replaced daily atoms with a grindfest for 25% or fewer of the atoms we got before, and some garbage you probably wouldn't have spent atoms/money on as compensation, to keep people grinding and missing the fact that there is very little content, and nothing of substance coming for a very long time.  I have about 28k atoms saved from challenges, and will never spend any money on subs or atoms for this dead game.  I'll just save them for more military/BOS content two seasons away from now, rather than throwing them away on whatever crap on a platter Bethesda wants to offer now to try to drain them.
---
Pc
---
The way it works everything you place must be rendered in game engine and it used processing power and server one too.
---
Each object is made with polygons and 3 vertices make up 1 polygon. And there is a limit of how many of those can be used in specific distance to offer stable FPS. Going beyond that causes lags, performce issues and lags. So yes bobblehead or weapon on display can be as taxing as 3 flamingos.
---
Camp budget exists for a reason, if there was no limit people around would experience FPS issues, global server would cause lag-spikes (because when you teleport to player vendor game needs to render it for you and server read it) every single time.
---
Imagine people hopping from shop to shop to camps if structure limit was lifted or made 10xbigger. Some camps already lower my FPS.
---
There is no solid way around that sadly.
---
No one uses it because you can‚Äôt hit damage cap with assassins weapons. If they have decent dr at all your no where near damage cap
---
Sounds like an eventful day in the Wasteland! :)
---
Bethesda doesnt let people lock terminals for obvious reasons
---
I hope you let him try by himself for a while.
---
Warzone is a free game mode within an already existing game that consist of multiple different game modes. And I'm 100% calling bullshit on playing 3 days a week for 3 hours a day and completing any battle pass. Shit send me a link to youtubers who have done it any game you play.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p\_2jw2yNRY8JIE7qTfUwXTgivFDcuy0Xltb4N8kct4o/htmlview](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p_2jw2yNRY8JIE7qTfUwXTgivFDcuy0Xltb4N8kct4o/htmlview)   All events/quests/dailies on Savage Divide can drop it. But it is a very small chance. Enclave events used to drop it all over the map. And also, you could find it occationally in enclave vendor (where i bought mine in 2018).
---
I have a few other characters that I build random stuff with around the map, I really love the base building in this game and Fallout 4. But my main character I made RP reasons for why they are where they are and also where they came from lol
---
Wait what?!?! What did the heart mean then? That‚Äôs why I ???‚Äôd at ya, so you could thumbs up or thumbs down! 
---
You throw a heart at me and I think it‚Äôs all good, sheesh! We can do it later via a robot vendor or something. I know there‚Äôs a way to do it.
---
Haha, not the same kind of love, more of, talk to each other all the time, and open up about stuff we've been through. As of right now, we are just friends and that's all either of us want, but it is possible that things could change for us in the future, but that's not something either of us plan on or anything. I've known her for almost a year now, but up until like three months ago, we rarely played and we would play borderlands 3 together, but we suddenly started playing and talking alot more, and I bought her Fallout when it was on sale like a month and a half ago, which was a pain in the ass because I'm in the US, and she isn't, and xbox likes to complicate things. But we've only been getting closer as we talk and play more and it's really nice. She's helped me mentally/emotionally alot since we've gotten close. And I dont know quite how much, but shes says I've helped her aswell in that regard.
---
You can use other people painted weapons/armor in NW. F1st, challenge earned, and regular purchases. Or else it be pretty fucked up as players with alot of skins/paints would basically drop nothing as people couldn't use em
---
I actually did shoot at every corner and room. This guys was just a fucking ghost! I still have no idea where he was hiding for the majority of the time.
---
Im on now, ill be on for a while. Let me know
---
I have a PC, been building my own for the past 30 years. Just don't own Fallout 76 on PC. Only reason I play on PS4 is I was given a PS4 pro a couple of years ago and bought the game when was on sale for $20.
---
lol sorry, I hearted you before I checked, just wanted to say thank you. 
---
Then I checked and was like ahh poo hahaha
---
It's all good, I just did the Herbologist tadpole i think it was, that took me like 30 minutes to complete start to finish and was able to unlock my backpack! :) Didn't realize that one was so easy haha
---
Thank you again for giving it a go!!! &lt;3 (see what I did there haha)
---
I'd rather them make "Super" versions of the other Cryptids instead.
---
We've had Mega Deathclaws (Like Rawr) in past Fallouts, let's give the newbies some time to shine.
---
-starting up Encrypted when you‚Äôre waiting for more participants
---
Kinda sounds like my last NW game. I basically just hid somewhere and waited it out. I got lucky on the storm closing in and I was inside the safe zone every time. Until the last one, I started moving and three of the last five noticed me and started throwing grenades in my vicinity. Then came to look for me and ended me. The rest of my team got yeeted in the first storm closure.
---
Wait you generally play with no mutations?
---
They‚Äôve been killed by someone else I believe
---
I have one, not the case. Also, im on Xbox with mostly standard HDD.
---
Funnily enough I actually want the dark matter pa skin, which is the last item.
---
When you take over a workshop there is a giant confirmation button that says "You can be attacked by other players, do you really wanna take this workshop over?".
---
So you do agree for PvP when you do that. Also you got nothing to lose if you stash your junk.
---
Directly inputting the numbers.
---
Using the keyboard for PC and native dialog prompts on PS4/Xbox (which can also accept keyboard input)
---
Compared to a combination style input, it would be equally as fast on controllers and great on keyboards.
---
I‚Äôve been hoarding bubblegum with all the leveling up I‚Äôve been doing. Just ate some of them right off.
---
I would rather they just buff deathclaws and make a megasloth prime/ alpha
---

You could always get the Vault 94 Scout Armor Mask plan from Regs.
---
Looks the same but is Yellow/Orange and has some vines on it. I'm not sure if paint jobs that apply to normal Scout gear work on it though, like the Atomic Camo or Ghillie Paints.
---
I am so used to holding it down that I only notice I have left VATS because I start jumping when I am firing.
---
Probably for the best. I prefer rational discussions based upon facts, not reactionary ones based upon false information and fear.
---
i want to fight a mega mummy cave cricket that is covered in normal cave crickets
---
inside a badly lit cavern with not much room to run never mind hide.
---
I like it because if an enemy is far away I can fire at them at 5% then fire at them at 15% then my crit is ready and even though it is still only at like 23% it will hit.
---
Thank you for this, you're god sent.
---
Well, I could say that's almost how me and my fiance started out üòÅ I'm happy things are going great between you and your friend and I wish you both happiness, wherever life may lead you üòÑ
---
I hate that I feel this so damn much. TWICE ALREADY.
---
What if assassin gave buffs for non mutants
---
Mutations are much more of a benefit than a downside. There's no reason not to run them. By bethesda logic, that means it should be on par with junkie's or bloodied
---
Yes I have
---
What doe you mean
---
fo76 marketplace or a discord.
---
People would still run Junkies because if you want a full health build it‚Äôs more damage for only marginally more downside. I‚Äôd rather they re-tooled Mutants to ignore a targets rad resistance (15% per mutation, max at 75%) and give some of those radiation builds a chance to shine.
---
Wise enough
---
Nothing tangible, but I stick around in most of my games if I die early so I can cheer on my team. I'd like to see them beat the odds and take home the gold.
---
The latter because of slow / bad servers. Enemies appear alive for a second or two, then die to show their real status.
---
Jeans, a BoS underarmor and a bomber jacket.
---
Only thing that can make this combo better is a nice pair of shades.
---
I'm really torn. On one hand, it is obviously not fair and probably not a very hard thing to fix. On the other hand, I have already waited several minutes for a match. A match that might not even last more than a few minutes depending on luck (such is the nature of Battle Royale). Waiting another 20-30 seconds for your potato computer to load is not something I am looking forward to.
---
Assassin weapons should deal poison damage. More thematic and gets around the PvP damage cap.
---
It's not intended.. that's for sure
---
You aswell. Have a great day!
---
It's an exploit
---
First time today I was killed in NW immediately after spawning into the game. Another player beat me in and was very close by but had already geared up before I could move. üò∑
---
I got it two weeks ago as a random event reward, came with both masks, BOS, Whitespring and Ski resort jumpsuits aswell.
---
I'm actually enjoying it simply because it gives me something to do in the game. With the content drops being so spread out, it's nice to have something to work towards.
---
With that said, I do hope they rework it for next season. It's pretty much the only pass that forces you to play every day. In most other games, they have challenges that you can go back and do later. That would help tremendously.
---
There are no plans for another double score weekend during this season. However, the extra two dailies are planned for the rest of the season.
---
I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll see a gauss shotty with a listed major effect as ‚ÄòBullets explode for area damage‚Äô. They come with explosive bullets as default already.
---
I realize other peeps are speaking to the bush wookie life as well, but even bush wookies should generally turn off the fill team as well. Granted, for both AFKers and wookies it makes sense to team up because it only helps and never "hurts" per se, but that's not an equitable relationship for those looking for a team to crush with.
---
Honestly, I think they should just make a "non-lethal" mode where you can't hurt each other, but instead have to navigate a bunch of deathclaws, mirelurk queens and scorchbeast who are wandering as you try to just stay alive until a Vertibird comes to the rescue in the final circle. That should allow for a way to help out those who don't want the competitive play, or who just want to rank up.
---
The scorched will rain down apon thee like crusty oozing rain if you (or anyone else) place your tent at the perfect location.
---
Great place to really vaccum up some xp!
---
200 5.56/hour is fast enough for a free resource.
---
Lol I feel ya though. I‚Äôve had some of the younger kids pester me a lot when trying to help them.
---
Are you sure? I read that they were removed from the enclave loot pool, but still have a chance to drop from savage divide events. I can‚Äôt find any official info regarding the mask whatsoever.
---
Not to mention the immensely high damage that I one shot things with it anyway!
---
Ever occur to you that deathclaws are fucking scary and they needed your *help* ?
---
It's an exploit. I highly recommend you stay away from using it.
---
Ya i edited my comment..
---
forgot about savage divide events...its just such a low chance. Im level 360 from BETA an ive never gotten it since i dropped it
---
The game dies.
---
Ok fake kanna
---
They are very rare drops on specific events so maybe you did the right event to get most of these
---
Ya see my edit...forgot that is still a way, albeit a very very low chance
---
Hi freeloader!
---
Lol
---
RIP ammo prices...
---
I make them and sell Nuka Vaccinated for like 50 caps so people can collect them. I've yet to find another person who sells the other brands I can't make.
---
Leader of the Pack comes up frequently and has the 3 easiest (and guaranteed) legendaries
---
I was playing gta when they appeared in my inventory
---
Ty for the update.
---
I spent all of last week getting rid of plans.
---
Garbage plans like the MM gauntlet that I had 20 plus of went in the river.
---
Recipes and usable plans (pocketed armour) were given away to new players near the wayward.
---
Plans that people like, CAMP accessories, were discounted to 5 or 10 caps.
---
I cleared out about 50lb stash and made some new vault dwellers very happy
---
In that case I would take a moment and ask myself what is it I‚Äôm expecting out of 76? I play to have fun with friends in the fallout universe :-) maybe once you figure out what it is your play fallout for then you‚Äôll be able to enjoy it again :-)
---
Who hurt you?
---
Then I am at a loss
---
Same, 270 from Beta, first time I ever got the drop lol
---
thats just how the drum mag works. it does it on the standard, non skinned gun too. and no heavy gun in the game actually lets you aim down sights. thats closer to it than the minigun or .50
---
Its nice of people to set up camps to help new players. I  have positioned my camp more for high level players. I have a lot of good stuff to sell though including weapons etc that new players can't afford. I think they find it disheartening to see a weapon selling for 25k caps in my vendor (which actually is a bargain not overpriced) and thinking how the hell could they ever afford that or get something like that. Maybe though they would see it as something to work towards. But some of us need to have camps that cater to high levels too and there are complaints there isn't enough of those.
---
It took me to level 200 to feel like I had a handle on the in‚Äôs and out‚Äôs of this game. You play and learn. Watch Angry Turtle to know what‚Äôs really up with the game mechanics.
---
I might just have to do that, I've got all plan plans in my vendors rn for 0-5caps per. I just wanted them gone lol
---
I ended up in a race with a guy to kill the one on deathclaw island
---
I did not win
---
As someone who runs enclave roleplay from time to time...im the shame of our group.
---
Its alright ill earn new stripes when the brotherhood DLC drops and I drop nukes on the brotherhood quests
---
Speaking of Deathclaw Island, is there any particular reason why when we fast travel to it we can't spawn ON the island itself? I get sick of having to swim across every time.
---
For some reason I found one in my inventory one day. Not the foggiest how...
---
But now I have two.
---
I got one to fight a Level 80 Scorchbeast.  That was pretty cool
---
EDIT:  They must have changed something to prepare for the future event because I‚Äôm coming across more and more threads about it the last couple days.  Always spawns in that spot.  I constantly go through that area after a nuke and I‚Äôve never seen one before until a couple days ago.  
---
Got downvoted in another thread for asking if it replaced the SBQ as the death from above as the even triggered yet no SBQ spawned and coincidentally found the Wendigo in the grove
---
Kinda sounds like the game Outlast, in a way. I think that could be a cool new mode that focuses on the stealth and survival parts of the game.
---
Don‚Äôt worry about the rumors on this thing too much when it comes to ghouls.  Pistol spec and it clobbers them (qffr)
---
This is brilliant thank you.
---
Its just making a blueprint of the ammo factory at a workshop and placing it at your CAMP
---
You can still get them in game, they are now super rare drop items like the leather coat and whatnot. I think you can get them from enclave events and Uranium fever.
---
Alrighty I‚Äôll have to give it it try I‚Äôm still working on my current build so it might take a while
---
This is game changer
---
I had gone sneak and vats so it was a super easy switch to commando sneak vats.  The sooner you realize pistols aren't going to happen the better off you'll be.   I was telling myself that if I just hit 45-50 I'll be good.   Yeahhh, no. I was fine against anything at my level and below but the level 60+ shit was rough.  Too rough. Even running a hybrid set up like I have now it makes a world of difference.  I only have like 6 levels of commando going and I chew through anything with ease.  I still run the pistols for most encounters under 50. It's very satisfying to run, jump, vats and just blow apart something with a .44 in a sort of quick draw action.
---
Home invasion most likely
---
I for one love the fireworks
---
Shut up. People want to talk
---
I dont know why you are "grinding it". Play to enjoy, incorporate the dailies into what you are doing where you can, legendary and events, and otherwise only do one offs as needed, gum prewar food or nw. I cant comprehend being 70 at this point, im at the target level and enjoying my gaming. If you grind, you'll burn out. Aim for the end instead of trying to sprint out ahead. In the end you will feel better while playing and not get that burn out trying to maximize every moment spent playing towards just this one thing.
---
Xbox game pass most likely if on PC or Xbox
---
I don't have an option to cancel it.
---
It depends on my mood.
---
 If I'm trying to grind XP I need my stranger in numbers perk activating so my mutations are boosted. It doesn't matter what level people in the party are, or their perks, I'm switching teams till I can super jump and have my DCG reliability swinging for 1000xp damage.
---
If I'm just hanging out I don't care whose in group.
---
I've actually been joining/prefer casual and roleplaying teams for 50% of my play.  They're full of new players and burt out veterans like me who aren't trying to grind events or westek for 3 hrs.
---
If you let the Chinese stealth suit break, it will have no damage resistance, you just can't take it off as doing so means you can't put it back on without repairing.
---
It's not exactly a common mob, but it does happen. Especially on some higher-level workshops as defense events.
---
I'm the weirdo who finds first person to be the exact opposite of immersive
---
There's a similar thing in Runescape as well. It's basically how trade windows should work, honestly ... they have a good trading system in TESO already so why not in FO76? I guess it was probably good back when there was no vending machines but now it's completely obsolete.
---
Can you share your source, please?  Every reputable information source I‚Äôm familiar with has never made that claim, and I‚Äôve seen testing done by players that strongly suggests the RNG is completely static, and only the pool changes as new related plans are learned.
---
We are nice mind your great aunt. We hired things, but run out of room in our houses so share our surplus with you. In the real world it is cat figurines, out of fasion clothing we call vintage, as seen on TV kitsch, readers digest abridged books and junk dishware. Fallout is exactly the same exactly the same but we also drop our overstock first aid items, and there are no fruit cakes in the apocalypse.
---
Game pass on PC/Xbox 
---
For awhile physical copies were sold for cheap or even just strapped to other purchases, ebay, craigslist, etc would also be a good idea
---
As another commenter suggested: home invasion is easy, fun, and will get you the game free
---
How would you know they appeared while you were playing GTA if you can't view your inventory unless you're in the game?
---
You almost certainly obtained them from Uranium Fever. They are an incredibly rare drop from the event. You get all those rare cosmetics at once.
---
Oh, that still works? I thought that was for the quest only (which I did ages ago).
---
Exactly. I quit like a year ago and just started playing when the fasnacht event happened because I obsess over apparel. Doing that dumb fucking event dozens of times and not even getting all of the masks as rewards combined with having to grind through some truly idiotic Reward ( hi Ghillie armor for 16 different kinds of armor is still just one reward not 16 rewards but okay)  has me aiming to finish off this board and then never look at this game again for another year or so if ever again.
---
Awesome photos! BTW do you use any effects in photo mode or in a 3rd party program? I can never get my pics to have that good lighting and contrast
---
Fallout 1/2 had a suitable barter system where both parties had to agree!
---
ESO also has a suitable trade menu!
---
Double xp was so much better. I hope we get another one.
---
 Easier to look stuff in first person, or else I'd always use third.
---
Wish there was a loot area function.
---
This is so weird to me. I just started 2 days ago and I would never think to ask other players for stuff. Frankly Im just happy to not be continuously slaughtered. That was my biggest fear of trying this game. Sorry that people are taking advantage. I‚Äôm really grateful for how awesome everyone has been in this community and actually letting people enjoy the game.
---
I can't even deal with this doubled up comment where everything is misspelled üò≥ü§£
---
I need it!
---
DAMN, thats a nice fuckin dragon bro
---
&gt; dude who hates possums
---
Not sure if we're talking about the same guy, but just the other day I encountered a guy who was yelling out "You are gonna taste so good!". Yesterday, I learned that was one of his (only) two lines. Someone had set a CAMP up apparently right beside the possum he was chasing (near Gauley Mine), because he just stood there hollering "You are gonna taste so good!" and "Get back here! You're my *dinner*!" *over and over and over again*.
---
I was wondering why the game would tell me to get drunk in the moening, but as the almighty todd commands.
---
There are numerous gaps in the invisible borders
---
Just another bug to add to the monument of sin that is this fever dream
---
I agree - I switch off to first person to get a better look at things. A loot area function would/could help with the missing bodies problem. 
---
First person just feels mad corny tbh.
---
I have hit him with explosive and non and he does take damage from explosive also Earl is an asshole.....
---
bro i bought it for 5k before wastelanders dropped and they became legacy lmao.
---
We need a double double. Or double triple.
---
NO fucking way. that is the deal of the year lmao
---
And steel. I run an explosive gatling gun with grenedear on and shoot the ground to tag everything. Came out with 1700 steel the other night.
---
I have a Bloodied one and it does 700+ dmg on top of the 125 rad damage when it's fully spec'd out.
---
i used to have a BE harpoon, but i sold it
---
Mine keeps drowning herself in the stream.
---
Her cries for help were distressing at first, but now I've grown accustomed to ignoring her pleas.
---
yikes
---
I scrapped my favorite weapon once while doing rapid E+Enter movements to scrap junk weapons at a bench. Now I make sure that my weapons are (1) favorited, (2) renamed so they are at the top of the list (usually with a . at the beginning of the name), and (3) preferably have a legendary effect so that they can't be scrapped anyway.
---
All those mentioned items are quite rae and drop very rarely as a 'package' from uranium fever
---
RIP
---
Holy crap these things are insane if only I was still a bloodied build I just switched because of the low health
---
You should go to Foundation, you'd fit in perfectly there.
---
First, does your friend have a Fusion Core, or is the PA empty?
---
If so, exit the armor and re-enter, then test again. 
---
You can also try removing the pieces and reattaching them.
---
Add me with a message
---
What's your system? I'm down for coordinating.
---
 The hell you say
---
Yeah, but the Internet connection speed in jail is really slow.
---
Yes he does have a Fusion Core in it, I made this post after 3 attempts, I'll tell him to try that last one
---
There also appears to be a hack that lets players take items from any orange case on the map. Happened to a buddy of mine as he was looting it, items just disappeared.
---
I'm about at rank 50 now, but I think I'm about 7 slots behind the opponent piece. Having said that, if they do bring in the "pay atoms to advance" mechanic, I have enough to jump about 10 slots (if the amount they said we would pay to jump a slot is still true). So I'm not particularly worried about being behind.
---
Edit: Downvotes? Hey I'm not an advocate of pay to win. I have not spent a cent on atoms. All of them I've obtained from completing challenges. I'm not a 1st purchaser. But if I am going to be allowed to spend atoms to move ahead? Others are going to do it, so why shouldn't I?
---
Miniguns and shotguns depending on your build
---
Shaft a spare dongle and you'll be right mate~
---
He never said they couldn‚Äôt have the mod or that it wouldn‚Äôt be useful, he just said hed turn it off. Shut up, he just wants to spread his opinion
---
I solo'd her with a Bloodied Prime LMG in about 8 minutes.
---
I feel you on that. I had some random dude request my QE Tesla the other day and I shook my head and laughed. I try to put skins on as many as possible too.
---
Actually quad xp would be better . What‚Äôs ur thought?
---
Radical Rad Toad with tons of worms shooting from the back craters that inspires fear until you log off.
---
I wait till about 7-10 mins in, then I let er rip
---
if you can't detect the sarcasm, I am truly sorry for you.
---
Then where am I supposed to put my console?  Think, man, think!!
---
Ironically, I used to be near the Wayward with intent on being a source of items for newbies, but it got too tedious not being able to place my CAMP because 39 other people had the same idea. So I moved into the Mire - I'm actually near the crashed airplane now, and I've only had my CAMP unable to place once out of a hundred or so logins now. I still get a bunch of visitors (and customers), particularly more than usual over the past 2 days for some reason.
---
I sell my nuka vaccinated too
---
Thank you for sharing your Survivor Story. 
---
*Best one so far!*
---
Yeah, strange request for Fallout score points, but who am I to disagree?
---
Sunnytop Station is also *really* close, so rip any camps near there.
---
Why not just buy it for $40 even at minimum wage that‚Äôs just a few hours of work lol
---
Basic item to item trading with confirmation on both sides has been a thing for **a couple of decades** in games that actually have competent people working on them.
---
Well, the thing is, these challenges have been in the game for a long time. This is just a new paint job on something that has been in the game forever. I seldom ever did the challenges prior to this, only if or when I wanted to earn some extra atoms. Now that they've taken many of the atoms rewards away from the challenges and made them into this 'Legendary Run' it promotes a feeling that you're going to be missing out on something, and you're not. 
---
By all means, feel free to ask questions here, there's a lot of smartasses, but there's also a lot of helpful people that will point you in the right and most efficient direction:)
---
Well done, and very creative!
---
Same here. Wish there were fixer skins though
---
Hopefully you get put into one of those cushy prisons with a gameroom and exfoliating shower gloves, otherwise you could try bundling the console with a welcome map and clipping it between the walls? Dunno~
---
Even Warframe does this. As well as Diablo 2 20 damn years ago.
---
The hell is bethesda's excuse?
---
Items in the atom store are underwhelming, over priced for me.
---
A day one player without Fallout 1st. I have close to 20k atoms. Only buy camp items on sale. If need be, I eventually will purchase repair kits when I run out.
---
Thanks! I just bought that thing and gave up trying to get the door attached
---
I fell into a burnin' ring of fire
---
I went down, down, down
---
And the flames went higher
---
And it burns, burns, burns
---
The ring of fire, the ring of fire!
---
Creative thinking. Now to make sure that I get the special lawyer that those Congressmen used.
---
Happy cake day. May the vending machine bless you with a perfectly preserved slice of pie.
---
To apply and remove the skin, select it in the atom shop in the camp category. You shouldn't have to rebuild anything. The only bug I've seen is it being selected and not changing. Either way, I would wait for beth to fix it and not rebuild your camp for it.
---
I think they tried to do something with the workshops but only deployed the change to certain servers, because it seems to be random as to whether you'll see the "normal" behavior or screwed-up behavior.
---
"Normal" behavior - the workshops have workshop icons and can't be clicked at all unless they're owned (by you or a teammate). No fast travel unless they can be clicked on.
---
Screwed-up behavior - workshops appear with normal icons if they're not owned, and can be clicked on and attempted to fast-travel to, but will always fail. If owned, they look (and perform) as they do when owned in "Normal" behavior.
---
Probably didn‚Äôt even know someone had to do shit to start the event... turd
---
Yeah I‚Äôve found more helpful fortunately.  Always gonna find smartasses so I just ignore them.  I get the wah wah wah all these people whining about a game and free stuff which is why I try to be constructive and suggest something different or listen to what people say about how to go about it differently.  It‚Äôs good to vent though because 1 it gets it off your chest 2 someone might offer better insight 3 developers might see comments and pivot to better suit the players
---
Dang nice
---
Thanks a lot üòä
---
Did you try logging out and logging back in?
---
I've only run into one other person that did this, their theory was that it became possible because they left Nuclear Winter and went back to another mode in the same session. It causes a few weird audio bugs (e.g. you hear an upright bass for your "notifications" in the top left). 
---
I managed to do it once but I don't think I had been in Nuclear Winter. The gap I found was just north of Deathclaw Island. I thought I was headed towards the island and when I realized it wasn't, I just kept walking. You're right, it was very pretty, just trees and rolling hills. 
---
I noticed that if I stopped walking I started to fall through the floor, so I walked until I got bored and fast traveled back home.
---
You're going to want Blocker. You will notice a huge difference from that perk alone. Even if you don't go Bloodied you should still consider Serendipity and Nerd Rage as they'll be there for you when it counts. As far as armor, Unyielding if Bloodied... Mix and match if full health. If you're just looking for survivability have a few Auto-Stim piece's.
---
I find it unusable even with standard skin. I cannot stand that much bs taking up my screen. I have to use a small magazine or whatever.
---
*SLOWMO*
---
Dear Bethesda, do NOT change the tab titles because I've just gotten used to the way things are now, but do group similar items together so all rugs (including animal skin ones) are all in the same line, instead of being spread out as separate items.
---
Gamepass has it. Such a great deal because I probably would never have played it if it wasnt on gamepass tbh
---
I tried server hop every single time, but the hack 50cal is very familiar now, in a server with more than 20 players, there is always always a guy with hack weapon going to ruin everything.
---
Idk.  You could try doing a strike thing.  Bethesda either loses a lot of money, or a little money, their choice.
---
Thanks! I am pretty sure I "bought" Blocker but haven't been using it. üòÖ I'll definitely try this!
---
The chat feature has categories/channels - people doing trade or being in other geographical areas (i.e. Europe) are able to be sequestered into their own channel. You can turn channels on or off. You can also mute individual people, and you can set it so that you will only get comms from people on your server, or local to you, or your team, etc.
---
If you set it up properly and tuck it into a corner of the screen so it's not covering up something you're trying to do, it works pretty well. I do get tired of the same guys blurting out N.E.BDOY W/PP, ENCRIPTD, SQD OR R.R HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?1 every 10-15 minutes, so I usually block them.
---
Just got it! Thanks King/Queen.
---
Greetings fellow Angry Turtle viewer
---
Oxhorn went there in his excellent YouTube video covering the Appalachian Brotherhood.
---
That's one thing I was concerned about: repair kits.  They're so convenient and I'll be sad to lose them.
---
Agreed. They should do a matte black set for all weapons we don't have paints on. This way we can hide the stuff we don't want to accidentally sell or scrip
---
Opening perk packs gives gum too if you have yours saved up, I just opened three for the gum
---
My computer is around 3 years old now, but I have f76 installed on to a SSD. My load times went from a minute to 10-15 seconds for the base game, and in NW I always load in very early
---
I‚Äôm hitting my stride
---
Like I said, the original base you unlock it on is fine but if you choose to build a new base like I did then the new base will not show up on the map, for me no matter how many times I selected and de-selected it. I had to deselect it and then build a further 3rd base for the bug to go away. So now I have the original skin selected and a new camp build operating as normal and I am not touching that skin again until I hear from Bethesda.
---
Ik but I wasnt going to level 15 times just for 3 gums lol im saving up my gums now because Ik how much of a hassle they can be to find.
---
I've got 5 of them. They're yours if you want them. The Wiki has a list of all the fixed Quantum spawns. :)
---
I‚Äôve never seen any outfit with a hood except the hooded rags but they‚Äôre super ghetto lol
---
Bartender in Whitesprings (near the restaurant entrance) always sells alcohol. Swung by and bought some for today‚Äôs challenge. I can‚Äôt see Bethesda putting in additional effort to make Seasons more grindy, it‚Äôs plenty grindy just the way it is.
---
For the longest time I thought that my CAMP was obliterated from "memory" if I said yes to stay on the server, not just prevented from appearing (and removed only if I moved the CAMP box), so I always said no. Now that I know if I don't move my CAMP, it comes back on next login, I do join in every now and then and see what's up.
---
Usually for me it's as someone else posted - a bare-bones place with some random quest stuff, or, more often, nothing on my spot, but close by, someone has something that would be 500m away from my CAMP zone boundary, which I guess Beth figures is too close.
---
So you get all the xp but never win
---
After 1400 hours
---
For free? I'll take them, thank you!
---
The regular Ranger Armor is always available.  It's the variants that were limited.
---
They can‚Äôt just ‚Äúget better servers‚Äù it‚Äôs all in the cloud lol
---
Not how viruses work
---
I sometimes load in before items have loaded into the containers. Its definitely unfair and I'd hate to get the opposite like you do
---
I got to my 6th bottle of beer around 1 hour of play time when it hit me, how are they checking this? Dawned on me my strength was low and drank a bit in game and it completed.
---
Yeah, dump any none essential holo tapes, notes etc from your stash and player inventory. When you craft the game access's your stash and inventory in the background and it slows down depending on how much stuff you got. If you make a new character just as a test and see how you menus are with nothing in your stash etc. Unfortunately no real fix yet.
---
yeah I understand that.
---
Yep. I'll be online tomorrow - just send me a message with your username.
---
First day on the interwebs?
---
We should have a central auction system,you place your item for sale and you can compare your price against the competition,no traveling around camps,no risk of trap camps and a comission on sales would actually make sence.
---
Well I have won a few times. Most of the time I load into the prison. Good loot. Deserted most times. The rare occasion my internet does shit itself I usually spawn in, and there‚Äôs only two people left so it‚Äôs a 1v1 if I spawned in the middle of the map.
---
Would it work like Junkies? Where you have to deal with new negative effects? I run all mutations so id love Mutants weapons to be better than just the 10% dmg...just wondering how it would work for a player like me.
---
I do the modular building thing in NW. it‚Äôs pretty awesome. I don‚Äôt know why more people don‚Äôt do it.
---
I will start a new team if there isn't one that has a space open with the situation I want. I prefer Events teams, so I'm not looking for the other types very often.
---
As for the other commenter saying that people don't do things with their teams? I see it fairly often - to boot, when teammates kill things, their kills have loot for you to pick up as well.
---
NPCs and turrets and anything interactive would affect the server, and maybe stuff with complicated collision models might have a smidgen more impact. 
---
But in general you're right, the camp budget in most cases is to prevent the clients gpu tanking with a bunch of different objects (or rather the collective rendering load of objects/polycount/number and complexity of materials/textures) and it has to be tuned to lowest common denominator in terms of performance.
---
Exactly I accidentally scripted a TS FFR LVC fixer at 3am. Was I pissed.
---
I think 500
---
Have you tried?
---
Literally just happened to me. Go to see what their camp looks like, and its a survival tent. That just isnt cool.
---
shit sometimes its not even grinding longer its running in teams.
---
Ive leveled up 160 times since wastelanders dropped simply by always having a group of 4, Canned Meat Stew an BerryMents/ScorchBrains running
---
I may be level 360 but level 100s w the right specs still body my ass in PVP
---
I completely agree, they act like if you‚Äôre high level you have unlimited supplies
---
&gt; Bought game
---
&gt; Freeloader
---
????
---
Meme
---
I just hope we go back to the old system. The season rewards suck and the new system is burning people out.
---
See how many shots it takes to fill your critical savvy then change it from 3 to 2 and check again, you may find that the crit meter fills in the same amount of shots. I run bloodied rifleman and I went from 3 points to 1 without changing how quickly the meter filled.
---
Also get rid of better criticals. That point is better used elsewhere. 
---
Your build is solid but this game is all about maximizing efficiency by fine tuning and you only need a few tweaks.
---
Yeah I thought the appeared in my inventory when I was playing Gta but as you and another person said its a package drop from uranium fever
---
For the extra large mag on the normal version, I do have a tip - pretend the left bar on the top is a sight.
---
I used a bloodied primed Gatling plasma and it worked ok, a continuous stream of 20s and 30s
---
Bush Wookie is one thing...AquaLads is where its really at
---
Not it means that if you want to take less damage your going to have to stack so much more Damage Resistance to see a noticeable difference. We're talking about needing and extra +100  Damage Resistance just to take 1% less Damage from Attacks.
---
I dont mean alcohol because we can brew our own so they have no reason to manipulate the vendors. Im talking about bbgum, is there a vendor in whitesprings that 100% always has bbgum?
---
All I can say is there is a disconnect with dialogue after the dust settles on the main quest.  It may simple be that they just never finished it as I get responses that don‚Äôt jive with what I chose.
---
Ouch. That's a beautiful weapon too. Its a shame they couldn't make the combat rifle skins apply to the fixer. They share the same mods, so why couldn't they share the same skins?
---
Totally impractical. The way I zerk is next level using lv 1 Leathers, protected marine suit, and medx/Psycho addiction. I have seen AngryTurtle's broken CSS berserker video and I get that it is pretty op but that is not how any class is supposed to be played, by purposely breaking your armor. With lv 1 leathers you can still use legendary attributes that don't effect DR and be pretty tanky if you are specced out properly.
---
Did you read my post? Im talking about bbgum not alcohol, and I even explained that we can brew it so it doesnt matter.
---
I really like it.  Good work
---
Yeah its like the god damn regular
---
If that‚Äôs the case, then I‚Äôm confused. If it was 500/week before, and it average out to 200/week now, that‚Äôs not 1/5. That would be 2/5.
---
Or infinite exp for logging in
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
So I could still get the New Vegas one?
---
I‚Äôm level 200.  I‚Äôve been leveling up twice an hour since I went full unyielding armor and 15 intelligence.
---
I would also recommend some life-saving armor, each piece has a chance to trip whenever you go down, it might not stop you from dying, but at least it won't stick.
---
Yes, the regular NCR version from the cover.
---
Peeps still try to attack me on adventure. Pretty sure pvp is still alive. It's still super fun
---
Storefront images havent been added in the current version or PTS version. So it's still months out, I mean maybe even longer as the only info we had on it was from a glitch
---
I don't remember any full renders being mined up either
---
It will probably be a Fallout 1st only skin.
---
It's hard to see past the drum when you have the sights on the normal non-skinned gun, I use the gun without the sight so I can see better and get better hipfire accuracy since not having the sights makes the reticle smaller. I'm hoping it's ok if you remove the sight.
---
Have you tried selling your unused ammo for a cap a piece? I'm level 30 as well and I find ammo sells pretty well. Almost everyone who comes to my camp buys some of my ammo. I've made 2k+ caps from selling my unwanted 10mm ammo, fusion cells, and shotgun shells.
---
Very much agreed. I wish there was a larger part of the community that understood and traded blueprints or building ideas. The practical uses are endless and I hope to create some good fort style modules that can be useful in NW and WS alike.
---
Last bubblegum challenge I was low, so hit up the normal spawn at Tyler County. No issue finding some that go around. These spawns are random, so you‚Äôre not always guaranteed. I say you just had bad luck this time, tomorrow will be better. :)
---
Edit: As to vendors always carrying bubblegum, none that I know of which are permanent. They tend to be random as well, which was the case before seasons.
---
Damn! I think jerseyghost had an enclave video talking about how it was datamined I've seen images of it but not sure if they were storefront images like you had mentioned, looks seriously badass
---
He does take damage from Explosive Weapons if that's what you are referring to his Resistance to is not as high as the Scorchbeast Queen at the moment.
---
Nah fo1st prob just gonna get more ranger armor reskins
---
Sweet, thank you
---
Strangler for sure and not just because the acid damage, but because the modifications are much easier to acquire via SBQ. Strangler uses the same mods as ultracite. T65 you have to buy all of the mods with gold.
---
I had this problem too. I think I had some messed up fusion cores. I dropped the fusion cores that I had and got new ones from the fusion core maker and that solved the problem for me
---
So I have a bunch of technical data. If I pull one at a time out of my STASH will I get the event?
---
I know it's not terribly feasible, but how about a UI not designed around a controller for PC? It could be so much more simple than scrolling thru menus like the PS3 homepage.
---
If they get clingy like that just block them. Never have to hear from them again and it's not an issue anymore. That's one of the reasons blocking exists.
---
Yeah this needs to be addressed
---
At what like $10 from the bargain bin expecting mega expansions and free content endlessly. 
---
Awaiting 'been here since beta' comment.
---
Fuckwit.
---
I had to farm lead a couple of times today because whenever I'd add a couple of thousand of .308 rounds for one cap a pop to my machine, someone would snap them up within half an hour or so. 5.56 also sells well
---
Jesus. Okay.
---
Clouds are just someone else‚Äôs server.
---
So they could still get better servers... just saying.
---
Star Trek Online has an account bank that lets you transfer items to your other characters. It‚Äôs more expensive in real money to upgrade than the character banks because they know it‚Äôs more valuable.
---
Not all Xbox/PS4 players have a keyboards to use.
---
There's so much to vent about in the game, too. Things get patched, then next patch those old problems everyone vented about that they thought were patched out, suddenly return. 
---
But, again, these challenges, they've been in the game for a long time, this is just a repackaging of existing content. I thought I'd read that they were going to change them somewhat to make them more like what you'd do if you were just playing the game, but I've yet to see anything different from what the previous challenges were. Same old 'eat pre-war food', 'cook a meal with fungus', and 'take over workshops' etc. that I've seen in them before they ever turned them into this board game - the only difference is you don't get Atoms for completing them, you get pre-selected things you probably wouldn't have spent your atoms on in the first place.
---
I'll look into that
---
But as far as I'm aware we only had the glitched skin over the Prototype X01, then a modder pulling the textures out of the files, and making a 'mod' to put the skin over a power armor set and showing it off in game
---
I might've missed something so I'll look into it
---
2 mods of 1 star, 4 for 2 and 8 for 3...but, would it be random weapon or can u choose range, melee, unarmed or classification style: handmade, fixer, lmg, so forth
---
If we could choose, maybe even more mods and different steel type, or body parts: different scorch  parts from each type for anti scorch, different mutant parts for anti mutant....
---
How bout scrap legendary for legendary parts (scrap lmg to get lmg pieces) and u need 5 parts for an lmg, and so forth
---
Would have another/good reason to grind...and a better use of scrap legendaries...and u would have to balance the scrap and scrip as u would still need scrip to.buy legendary mods and other weapon parts....
---
Just an idea ....pass on to the dev
---
There was an article about a duper and said so far this year before the band he had made. 75 000 from online sales..real cash thats y they do it plain and simple nuts people will pay 50 to 100 for those bloody fusion mini guns or whatever they are. I havent got a regular one yet and I'm lvl 50. Sad
---
I refuse to ever drop first
---
Damn. I don't even know what I need or don't need from those tapes and stuff. Is it safe to dump anything that doesn't have a quest marker? Will the game stop me if I try to drop something I still need?
---
The level a day thing is a cop out I feel. Especially when your over 100. It‚Äôs too much of a grind to get a level during the week every day.
---
It's still trash until they implement server wide text chat.
---
The options of local (very short range) and global (everyone using the mod) are too extreme. I've installed it 3 times now thinking I was missing out, only to be annoyed by it.
---
I know. It sucks. Plus the fixer is probably the most popular gun in the game, you'd think they'd make a skin for it just for the money it would bring in. Instead they skin the dragon and fatman.
---
Yeah such is online gaming anymore.  Oh well still having fun.
---
Cool Story
---
I agree, I hope they don‚Äôt nerf the other builds but buff the useless ones like mutants it‚Äôs could be another full health build like junkies
---
So apparently you can have nothing but 500 flamingos in your CAMP?
---
This will change my life.
---
I use the vanilla skin and it block almost as much of the view. The solution? Use 3rd person POV. Either that or just VATS.
---
If you have the raider collectron, he collects booze. Alternatively, if you go to Al's tattoo parlor there's booze behind the bar in the basement, and at the Wayward bar there is booze up stairs near my boy Smiley.
---
I actually use bubblegum all the time so I always make sure I'm stocked up. Normal bubblegum is the best since it curbs hunger and thirst for 10 minutes, whereas the flavored ones only last like 5 minutes.
---
Edit: BTW if you need gum on the next one, there is usually one is Sweetwater's house next to the Giant Teapot, the gun is on the scale.
---
Fuck, I was so excited for this skin.
---
I'm pretty happy the mod is back, I was starting to feel lonely again! Really makes the game a social place!
---
Im not even out of temp suspension but whatevr happened to u is terrible a bad tease
---
I know, bring 20 PA chassis to block the terminalüòè
---
Indeed but the consoles both have native input dialogues and inputting a number with them would be no slower than the combination style input.
---
One way is fast for controllers and incredibly slow and cumbersome for kb+mouse users
---
The other is equally as fast for controllers and super fast for keyboards.
---
Do you have a aecobd perk card at rank 1?
---
Rank 1 + 1 = rank 2 perk card. Rank 2 + 1 = rank 3 perk card.
---
Bro
---
I agree with the idea, but luring raiders and Rose liking the idea of trading and capitalism? Lul no.
---
What!?
---
Yeah. I don't do every daily or weekly if they seem too tedious. I have been getting more into nuclear winter though since I just got through grinding it for the glowing skeleton outfit. What is the target level?
---
Well considering ESO has it its only a matter of time as Fallout adopts more features from that game
---
Literally never *not* found one on Deathclaw Island just hopping servers several times in a row... o.O that's how I completed this challenge too.
---
I gatherer can haul ass and get 50 ore with a little luck.  2 can win the event but it requires double the luck.
---
Any effort from others, even going down a single section and snagging 10 ore will make the job that much easier.  I get that many want the XP, but I‚Äôm a bit old fashioned and want to win!
---
They have to put the best rewards at the end otherwise people would complain there is not point in completing it.
---
Yep. I was playing with the queen when I saw it. PSA: kill the queen before investigating a small room that only has one way out.
---
And I can't downvote it enough.  Mutant's is a non-choice. There's no reason in the game not to at least have Marsupial other than to deliberately make the game harder to play.
---
The whole system needs to be reworked. Currently there are two weapon effects - bloodied and garbage.
---
So the dragon would load faster if you have fireworks equipped? Nice dragon BTW, I have an IE just like it, I forgot two or three star.
---
I killed 4 legendary scorchbeasts at the fissure site across from Hopescave while waiting for the deathclaws to respawn today.
---
technically it isnt NCR. it has CPD branded on it instead, for Charlston Police Department.
---
you know. cuz the NCR doesnt exist yet, and will be on the other side of the country. yay, bare minimum detailing to preserve continuity!
---
Bloodied, faster swing speed, +1??? Meat hook. Turned in for scrip.
---
Turns out it's one of the most valuable weapons in the game.
---
It mattered when it was new because people farmed it for the rare items, but man does that event suck. It's expensive, and it breaks down your passion for SLAYING. Being barraged by enemies is cool until your 18th event with less than half ore completion, and it loses it's appeal. I've got every reward, and I will likely never do that event again.
---
It was one video and he condensed the narrative of the Appalachian Brotherhood into an entertaining, informative one.
---
Sure, I am on right now. My ID is Eldyrus3. No caps needed.
---
Alot of people bitching and whining about what they got for free. 
---
And how no longer getting as much for free is somehow unfair or shady.
---
It was on discount %50 off on steam when i bought it.
---
This happened to me and a friend on my private server and we didnt kill anything all the glowing ghouls were dead already for no reason
---
....
---
There‚Äôs diminishing returns the higher your damage resistance goes. So getting DR high can‚Äôt be the only thing you do. Blocker as noted is good, as is lone wanderer if you‚Äôre not on teams much. Serendipity is also great as it procs a lot when you need it. 
---
Also consider using stealth more. I rarely take hits  cause I‚Äôm usually not being seen. Not everyone loves this play style but I have one toon that‚Äôs a berserker and has no DR at all. They stay alive by playing carefully and remaining hidden.
---
Interesting, I didn't know that.  Thanks.
---
I feel your pain, I‚Äôve been trying to get the rad barrel for months. Like you need at least two solid people making sure the scavengers don‚Äôt die and one or two players grabbing ore. If I go grab ore the scavengers all die and if I stay and kill all the glowing ghouls nobody is getting ore, it‚Äôs such a simple event that just takes a little teamwork so of course it never works.
---
For real dude I reckon that people are just xp grinding the ghouls... I did it with about 8 or so peeps and only two of us got ore. 
---
I gathered about 80% of the ore for the T4 reward and got next to no xp from the event itself and a couple of ghoul kills (while trying to get the ore). I see why people do it as the event itself doesn't seem to pay anything.
---
Meanwhile the other guys slaughtered tons of ghouls and probably got their daily level challenge AND the event reward. It's tough being the gatherer.
---
I'd have to argue that point
---
The ultracite plans (that apply to Strangler) are much rarer. Especially emergency protcals and calibrated shocks. In the player markets you have to shell out a good amount if items to get one. 
---
Whereas the T65 is guaranteed as long as you just get the gold every day. It's a guaranteed &lt;9 day grind. As long as you get everything. Weekly and daily
---
Some of the ultracite mods are common, but the 'best' ones are apparently under a 1% chance to drop from SBQ

gamestop has ps4 and XB1 versions used for ten bucks.
---
Instigating is relatively okay, but it‚Äôs really dependent on what you‚Äôre using.
---
Love your thinking mate
---
Jokes on them really.  Maybe the real problem for them is there isn't enough shit on the Atomic Shop to begin with.    They bumbled their microtransaction system just like they bumbled the launch of 76.  The quantity of interesting items on the Atomic Ship is so low, you're unlikely to want to buy 90% of it anyway, so at least saving isn't going to be too much harder.
---
Maybe they should have planned better instead of what was probably a knee-jerk reaction to people having many unspent Atoms,and rather than give people more, they just want to make sure people accumulate far less.
---
Cool, just sent you a friend invite. I'll join your session.
---
You never would have. Everyone who bitches about what they used to get free and somehow getting less of it free being some kind of screw over that leaves a "bad tadte in their mouth" was never going to buy atoms. 
---
Free DLC plus some free premium currency.... God forbid. 
---
I invite you to come play rocket League. A game that ruined it's own trade market and has no way to earn free premium currency.... And charges for the every level reward version of the battle pass.....
---
And most importantly they should be character bound just like the wastelander weapons.
---
Thank you for sharing your Survivor Story.
---
They took away something as well.  That's what I'm disappointed about.
---
To start, you should try blocker and fireproof. These two alone can mitigate a ton of damage. Other to try out later is ricochet and serendipity. They sound like goofy perks, but proc way more often than you would expect. Serendipity only works outside of PA. Aside from that, buffing your DR/ER would be the next step. Apparently there are diminishing returns after 300, so shoot for there. If you already have max STR then you should most Def max barbarian, not worth it if you don't have max STR. Ironclad in END can raise your resistances as well.
---
BTW even though you are not focused rifle, you should pick up tank killer 1 and tormentor 1 as this will help you stagger and cripple when you zap stuff.
---
Most of them are ok, but blooded so badly outclasses everything that it isn't funny. About the only thing Bloodied can't do well is PvP for obvious reasons.
---
Right.  I literally want 1 non utility thing in the shop right now.
---
They should make non mutant gear!
---
Well, it certainly does not produce 200, 50 caliber ammo in an hour. That's where my statement came from.
---
I already have one at my camp but why stop there. We need to steal the Enclave technology and make all the deathclaws intelligent so they can live along side us with ghouls and super mutants like Grahm.
---
I feel your pain.
---
People who spend some money on additional things aren't whales. 
---
Whales buy out a whole season. 
---
Whales don't occasionally buy atoms. Or pay for 1st. 
---
However all entitled whiners complain about getting something for free....  Then complain even louder when they get slightly less of it free.....
---
Free DLC plus some free premium currency plus free cosmetics...plus a free battle pass? Cry me a River.... Then go make a resume.
---
After what the Chinese did to the USA in Fallout, I never even contemplated leaving mommy alive. Or anyone under the Whitespring. 
---
Real talk she could have escaped. Instead she's chilling in the guts of the Chinese base. No handcuffs. No cell. She's bent. 
---
Double tap. Bye mommy.
---
Thank you! You just saved me a bunch of time and awkward mic/emote explanations.
---
Shhhhh, I've been making a killing on the stuff all day in my vendors. Most expensive one is 5 caps and people are buying them up faster than I can stock them.
---
These are good points friend!
---
Since I see at least one post a day with this exact same content, I'm going to go ahead and say there's a lot of people who think they're the only ones who give a crap and are the only ones "doing anything" during the event. You are not alone. Congrats?
---
What a world it could be.
---
I have absolutely zero problem with getting alcohol so idk why people keep telling me where to get it. It‚Äôs like literally no one read the last paragraph so whatever, done posting if no one is going to read
---
Thanks! Btw happy cake day!
---
Ok I get ya. I'm only rank 40...still a Noob thnx
---
Is he overweight?
---
Maff is hard.
---
They are, I switched to blood a few weeks ago and once you get a full set of unyielding, and run dodgy, serendipity, and adrenal reaction. It's easy to become tanky. I don't like bloodied, but all the special boosts make it hard to pass up.
---
Strongly agree with you 76 has nothing to do at all with the true fallout series. It is literally like when that idiot decided to make his own version of transformers and sucked 100% at making a better movie.
---
Damn near everything in FO76 is purely situational if you think about it. Bloodied is horrid in pvp unless you have some sort of bloodied automatic. A good amount of the main legendary effects are good on maybe ONE gun, two if it‚Äôs lucky. Then there‚Äôs the one or two secondary and tertiary effects that are desirable, and that‚Äôs it. Then they make these perks and mutations that are next to useless UNLESS you pump 50 levels into an ENTIRELY situational build. Bloodied is THE ONLY legendary effect build without a dependability on situations.
---
I'm on PC and haven't completed Beckett's quest but I found one of those jackets in a player vendor real cheap before even realizing what it was. Let me know your IGN and it's yours.
---
They took away some of something you were getting for free....
---
For real. It's tiring seeing people bitch and shine about free things like they somehow deserve however much they feelnis acceptable when any amount of free premium currency is pretty stellar.
---
Anytime! Stay safe out there.
---
Just make the Chapter use Excavator power armor and tools (wrench, drill, flamer, etc) and call yourself the ‚ÄúBrotherhood of Stihl‚Äù. 
---
Bonus points: Sue the BoS when they show up for copyright violations.
---
Drugs are bad
---
Sorry mate didn't mean to offend, maybe someone else will come here with the same problem as you and look for an answer in the comments section.
---
Get a physical copy
---
TBF, I've found it best to stay on top of that one bunker and wait for her. Otherwise people scatter too far out and you lose her, or people stand on top of floating tents and she never lands. Your milage may very, but that's what I've seen in the dozen or so I've done.
---
So, we've got plastic christmas tree armor skins, a gun skin that blocks half the screen when you ads, and a light that doesn't put off light. These rewards feel like they all came straight from Wish. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for earning cosmetics, but at least test the things before you release them
---
That'd be great, thanks. My IGN is VerasGunn
---
Can confirm. I paid ten bucks not too long ago.
---
i just killed 3 and then i stopped!  
---
ok, perhaps one more....?
---
You could donate them to your local me.
---
If you're on xbox you're always welcome to join my team. I'll take those buffs. I share strange in numbers because it's needed but any other perks being stared I'm always happy.
---
Woah are you telling me I‚Äôm not the only one that runs without mutations?
---
I don't view it as premium currency.  But it really doesn't matter.  I can't do anything about it.  Not whining btw
---
FYI: Gutsies don't care how much DR you have because they fire armor-piercing rounds.
---
It is a thing with hardware. The hard drive to be exact. The people who load faster have SSD. I have an NVMe SSD (one of the fastest drives on the market) and I load in 15 seconds before my friends with SSD, and maybe 30 seconds before those with HDD.
---
But even though it is a thing with hardware, Bethesda has the power and responsibility to fix it. It is completely unfair.
---
Could we just do a megathread of all the things that are broken in this game lol
---
Just imagine
---
I love when I drop a new player some low level legendaries, they pick them up and immediately start shooting random things with it in excitement.
---
Vendors are nice. However a fair player to player trading sytem would be good. One player cant accept the trade untill the other makes his offer then we both agree to complete it.
---
Why not? Raider ideals is just capitalism without gov‚Äôt intervention. Strongest ends up on top and if you don‚Äôt watch your back a nobody can stab you in the back and take everything you earned. Raiders and capitalism doesn‚Äôt care for the politics of what kind of person you are or where you come from, as long as you increase the bottom line for the biggest guy. 
---
Rose just wants more people back in Appalachia so she can watch the chaos continue. She‚Äôd be up for anything that encourages more involvement in West Virginia as long as it‚Äôs not a unified government. Aka a trading post where people buy deadly weapons so they can use them on one another later.
---
Meg doesn‚Äôt care for bloodshed like past raider gangs. That‚Äôs partly why she left the original group. She just wants people to understand she‚Äôs at the top of the pecking order. If you proposed a trading hub where she got free caps just by having raiders who just sit on their butts anyways guard it I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôd bat an eye. Especially since the secret service is trying to horde all the gold in the area. Both settlements would either have to fall in line, fight the secret service, or find a way to establish their own backed currency. Controlling trade would be the best way to make sure they keep control.
---
Run dodgey, born survivor + first aid maxed if u can they work. Also go for sentinel armor if standing still(you can jump straight up just don‚Äôt move left stick) +/or cavalier if sprinting. Go to nuka dragon‚Äôs site for a character builder + play around with it
---
Sorry if that came off aggressive at all. It was just more things for OP too consider
---
As a user of both power armor variants I'd recommend Strangler too. The DR/ER difference seems large, but is minimal in practice. It's just the Strangler has a lot more time that goes into crafting and modifying than T65
---
I don't see why this is so difficult to understand.
---
No, it doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs far better to craft .50 rounds.
---
I miss my dragon. I put it in my vending last year and it instantly sold. If only I knew what I knew now....
---
Not sure how messaging on Xbox works, but... there should be an option to set it up so that only friends can contact you? And then you can remove all the randoms from your friends? Or not add them in the first place (that's something I never understand why people do anyway, adding every random person to their contacts). The game itself definitely offers a "block for session" option too.
---
All in all, you should have all the tools/options to take care of these yourself and not be annoyed by random players you helped once but never really planned on playing together with.
---
Shot guns and laser with beam splitter works the best because each hit counts. 
---
When I first started playing I got ambused at a workshop by two players a few levels higher than me, bit we were all less than 100.
---
Pulled out my level 5 vamp pump I got from leader of the pack and took care of them easy...until they got their high level friend haha.
---
Haha unfortunately no, you‚Äôre alone!
---
I‚Äôve got every mutation except herbivore.
---
How do you not view atoms as a premium currency? 
---
How else could anyone describe it. 
---
In game currency is caps. 
---
Premium currency used to purchase entirely optional, in no way not having them stops you from enjoying the entire core game experience items is Atoms.
---
Atoms are text book premium currency.
---
Looks like it's a third-person only feature
---
Fixer skin please
---
Yep, though you got to accept being a glass cannon. Having played wizards in D&amp;D for years, that's not a big ask. My HP don't matter if my target is dead before it can fire a shot.
---
Blame the Legendary Run. The mechanics of that actually work against you when trying to complete this event.  
---
XP is all that matters, rare plans be dammed.
---
Beth will either need to rework the next run season (maybe get rid of the XP repeatable, or change it to something else like "\# Events successfully completed"), or rework this event so that killing enemies gives little to no XP.
---
You're fine, I very much agree and hadn't fully considered the time investment or RNG required to obtain the ult plans.
---
100% I really love my super jumps so I change teams til I get my super jump haha but today I just opened a roleplay team cuz I just wanna take in the breeze and enjoy nature and go explore and shoot things a long the way.
---
feel free to not like it but yes, u are:) or at least there are not so much players who want anything else but xp from this event.
---
Happy cake day!
---
Yes and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that.
---
Takes up camp budget AND stash space. They need to pick one! Not both!
---
Where the hell is that from I‚Äôve heard it before.
---
Floating camps grind my gears (well - they would if I had any, but I'm fresh out of desk fans and Giddyup Buttercups).
---
Wait you can get all of that from tech data ?
---
Can't speak for pc, but when I experience black screen on ps4 I have to restart my system to get it to go away.
---
Not at all.. just lost people usually like the super powers lol
---
I want to see a giant frickin owl. 
---
The rarest of all 76 creatures, owlets gotta grow into something..... 
---
I'd also like to see an extremely buffed, enormous Grafton monster.... Give it black goo seeking out of it like beasts from princess mononoke.....
---
Also, blood eagles should occasionally have chained up stuff in their camps that break free and go rampaging.
---
I didn‚Äôt know that! I do that event a lot and it was the first time I encountered something like that. It was trippy.
---
Yeah, anything quest related will not drop at all. I had 70 ish inert bombs etc from daily quests.
---
I think we get faction berets tomorrow...
---
Yeah! At least I now have enough steel to make new spikes.
---
Damn guess I wont be getting one since I chose not to help him, since I like the raiders...
---
Should I even bother responding if you're going to ignore the majority of what I post and then misquote me? At least we are on the same page now. You understand that I think playing NW is a waste of time. And I think you just want to be contrary. Your original point of the balance being off 6-9/1 had some validity. I'm surprised you don't like the prospect of having more challenges for NW. I tried to give you solutions, I'm sorry you don't like any of them. I'll stop wasting my time talking to you now. Hope you get a win or two.
---
Possible. It took so long to kill it but the damage it caused was meh.
---
The paper ain‚Äôt here, not since last year.
---
Pull your head out your rear, maybe go have a beer.
---
You might be living in fear, or like headlights catchin a deer........
---
yeah no luck
---
It takes 4 people to collect enough ore, 2 people can do that at a time while the other two hold each side.
---
I was always getting the ore but 7 people still couldn‚Äôt protect the scrappers so now I just stand my ground and shoot anything that moves in the face with my shotgun.
---
Tell me about it. I run 2 RWR on my commando. A junkies FFR and junkies Explosive.
---
Yeah last night saw a guy had tons of anmo so I went to his vendor to get .45 and showed empty with no ammo or anything...
---
Purely cosmetic is the key.
---
i expect absolutly nothing when i enter this event.   
---
the more i was shocked yesterday when suddenly like 6 people worked together and we got that 100 ore collected. lost one scavanger but thats still by far the best outcome ive seen here.  
---
what is really sad, to me its one of the coolest events. challenging, fast pace and nice rewards. also, its always some surprise what enemies spawn.  
---
 i will always remember my first time playing it. lvl 50ish, crappy equip, no real rad protection and first time seeing a bunch of high lvl PA, waving their freakin lasers and big ass guns. after running around like a headless chicken, blocking paths for others and hiding in the rad shower for some minutes, i turned around to see a glowing deathclaw like inches from my face, screaming and then exploding in a gory mess. never felt so alive while nearly shitting myself.
---
Well the NCR armour is just pre war riot armour so it could easily be all over the country
---
While shotguns are very good aswell, they shoot 8 pellets per shot, each giving the vampire effect.. A fast firing weapon like the one i described in this post (vamp 25% minigun) will fire up to 27 bullets a second. While you hold the trigger down it is impossible for your health to drop even for a second. And 500 round magazine will keep that minigun firing awhile. Both weapons are good for lots of different situations, but i personally will take the minigun over shotty any day. You can see and feel the difference if you go against something like imposter sheepsquatch solo.
---
This was something I quickly got over. 
---
I build alot of camps, and early on it was houses. Variations on houses. Multi level houses. Houses with patios....
---
Then I started building more compound like camps. Several buildings usually with an existing structure. 
---
Now I rarely put effort into the design of interiors. It's about the big picture build for me. Using a sewer tunnel, making a mire shanty town, building off an existing structure in an interesting way. 
---
I want people to walk into my camp and find an interesting location, not quality interior design.
---
I'm not 100% sure but I think your terminology for stacking is incorrect. The effect over laps which is why it is effective. Shot 1 will always wear off after 2s, and shot 2 will always wear off after 2s. But when they overlap is when you notice huge hp boosts.
---
It can only be one of two things, that red miner set which is doubtful as that will probably be the first release alon side patch 21 because it's a Wendingo Collosus themed type of set or it will be that PA w/ the helicopter jet pack and secret service under armor along side maybe the black bobblehead stand and paper target.
---
Thats the only stuff left from the last datamine
---
So I am the only one... sad non mutant noises.
---
I‚Äôm leaving right now for my 8 day vacation, so I‚Äôve been grinding hard to progress before taking a break. I still haven‚Äôt finished the main quests, and actually I don‚Äôt like to repeat the same things when I do. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm stalling a little.
---
It was the best day!
---
I woke up one morning with both scout masks ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I submitted a ticket about this. If you take the front sight ring off, it will fix the problem. It shouldn‚Äôt be a problem to begin with though.
---
If any of you guys are around level 15. I got a couple of one star legendary handmades kickin around. Ps4.
---
It's in now, but I'd hold off for as long as possible because it takes more and more score to level up.
---
I bought all of the base weapons and SS armor so I could roll them on the random at the purveyor and obtain them from seasonal events and ally quests.
---
fireproof can be dropped for a dense mod chest piece (or from my experience)
---
This is strange because I find the complete opposite to be true. The standard mag sticks up and blocks a ton of the screen. The large magazine takes that away and hardly blocks anything.
---
Ah. The constant fallback of the entitled crowd. 
---
Make sure you scream P2W next. 
---
The atomic shop is mostly cosmetic. The exception being a few things whose benefit is modest at best, and still in no way stops you from experiencing the entirety of the games content if you don't have them.
---
 Got to give props to good builds.
---
It wasn't the prettiest build but I helped a friend build a house under the bridge by the workshop north of the lighthouse. It started as that at least, by the time we finished he had a lab under the bridge and a miniature town on the top of one side of the bridge. Letting through traffic pass on the other side of the concrete barrier that split the bridge. Including his shop aptly named Bridge Mart, potentially to be changed to Bridgetown Market. It was a fun build, but since it used almost exclusively vanilla objects from the game, almost no atom shop items, it wasn't the most beautiful.
---
I know I hate when you say your not sure and people downvote you so I upvoted you cuz thats just stupid and childish someone did that.
---
The latter, unfortunately.  Would have been better if they had survived and gone scorched so you had to put them down.  Would have given more to do during the quest line.
---
Maybe roll back your graphics driver if it updated recently
---
I have a top of the line beast with an SSD and I'm constantly getting in after other people. 
---
It's absolutely stupid.
---
How do i do that?
---
Wrapping* and no
---
Yeah I think I lost all that stuff, it gives me an option to put things into the vendors, but everything that was there is totally gone. And my collections on my 4 display shelves is gone too. It's pretty frustrating
---
This is true, however it makes your armor heavier. Dense is op though.
---
At least Destiny has easier unlimited grinding and every rank is the same 100k
---
It comes down to how badly do you want the pass items
---
If you don't want them that much then meh dont do it. In Fallout im going for the Sheepsquatch plush, im like 7 ranks away and im out lol
---
Look.  Obviously we aren't going to agree.  I'm going to stop responding because this is just a waste of my time.
---
My bad. Fixed
---
It‚Äôs not the same on the non skinned gun. Here‚Äôs a video showing the difference: https://imgur.com/gallery/Z99EhJv
---
The challenge is pretty easy jus server hop thru hopewell and ur done but the death claw has been nerfed for every Bethesda game since fo3 but yeah it really needs a buff
---
it seems to happen when first loading into a server, without swapping weapons.
---
The acid damage got over nerfed and does almost no damage at this point. Modifications from SBQ (the good ones) are very lucky finds and rare'ish, while T-65 ones can be bought. Imo T-65 is superior at this point. The defensive values are the best in game. But i would suggest people to go with the one that looks best to you.
---
Have a look next time it happens, there should be a tent at the spawn point by the gates at the front of the compound.
---
Happy to help!
---
Bloodied plasma caster in a heavy PA build is essentially just that
---
The skin works fine if you just take the front sight ring off.
---
Thanks!
---
Raider punk is the man. 
---
You can build his radio under the ally tab in the camp build mode. 
---
He gives decent daily quests too. And says some weird stuff.
---
The Wanderer or whatever her name is, is a close second. 
---
Lady Headache and Beckett are for chumps.
---
Add my video to your post: https://imgur.com/gallery/Z99EhJv
---
It shows the difference, with and without front sight ring.
---
Scorchbeasts are larger creatures, by a lot.
---
But yeah a glowing deathclaw feels like a joke when your build is good. Should be more like sheepsquach
---
I can make you the serum. You on Xbox?
---
This is very true, after 1000+ SBQ fights I only just recently received Emergency Protocols, which is a must for Bloodied PA builds.
---
Just throwing it out there since he said his str was 15. So carry weight shouldnt be an issue. And if weight is a problem - deep pocketed or pocketed can be thrown on a piece or two. Ya know? So a little heavier for more survivability. Sounds he doesnt wanna run stealth. So it **should** benefit him in the end. Just my thoughts, though as a lv320 who has ran every build but a nocturnal
---
Yes I am
---
You're right. We won't agree. 
---
Because I'm right. And you're just another in a long line of whiners who think they somehow deserve free shit.
---
It really doesn‚Äôt block nearly as much of the view. Here is a video showing the difference: https://imgur.com/gallery/Z99EhJv
---
Free.  Ha.  Laughs in 60 USD. Also the actual work put into getting it.
---
Get lucky when getting rads 
---
Or learn the plan (bought from Enclave vendor)  and craft the serum. Or do what most do and buy the serum from 200-500 caps from players
---
It's one of the most sold items in player vending
---
Fallout 4 started this trend.  Now I tell you, I don‚Äôt feel good about a deathclaw charging me, but it should be a lot worse of a feeling, rivaling that of a cloaked assaultron dominator.
---
I've gotten lucky. Got 2 from minimal SBQ runs, and got 1 in player vending for 1000 caps
---
T-65 offers best protection, while SH sacrifices some defence for small dps gain. Those are facts.
---
Now which one is better? My personal opinion is that T-65 is. The damage SH adds was over nerfed and is really small addition to everything else we got. But all that said, the difference in defence and dps gain both are negligible and you should just pick the one that you like best. Both have very unique looks.
---
If they would just have pacifist on by default, noobs wouldn't have to learn this lesson the hard way.
---
Raiders...people who played Fo4 should understand why thats a great choice. I personally developed a hate for settlers thanks to our good friend Preston always saying some stupid settlers need my help. Which is why I joined up with the raiders and took it back for revenge. Now in 76 I automatically shoot any settler I see working or on the street. RAIDER NATION!
---
You paid 60 dollars for the base game. They gave you the base game. 
---
That was the agreement at the time of purchase. Not "The base game plus x amount of free atoms indefinitely"
---
Go cut your neighbor's lawn, buy some atoms and quit complaining.
---
Yep. Done in three hops.
---
Make sure you have class freak and starch genes perk first.
---
It's children, children now days are entitled little bastards who don't feel like they should have to work for anything and should be given everything.
---
Teach em to fish then send em on their way.
---
Yeah. 
---
I want Deathclaws to be those things they were in previous Fallout games...
---
Something you spot in the distance. Stop immediately. Crouch and hope it says "hidden"....
---
Please be hidden....
---
A Deathclaw vs a SB on the ground? It'd gore that glorified bat with its horn and rip of a wing and keep it just alive enough to know it's being eaten....
---
Low level explosive weapons are the best presents.
---
Tell them you wanna show them something cool and trick them into initiating PVP at their camp and blow it up
---
Peeps need to accept they're either there for XP or the event! Those doing the event have to accept they will probably gather ore alone.
---
Didn't bother me I was at the end of my play session and had fuck all ammo and was still wearing my stealth suit (farmed a rad zone). My job was obvious!
---
That sucks and I hope they do something about this but then I‚Äôve always found aiming down the sight of a minigun/Gatling gun really weird and unrealistic. Like do they carry the gun up to their face or something? I don‚Äôt get it lmao
---
You can try to report but Beth probably wouldn't do anything, even if you had video proof. 
---
Just server hop and move on. No point in wasting energy on trolls, that's exactly what they want.
---
I'm interested in finding out more about how they baited people though, so I can warn my troops what to look out for.
---
You were passionate about what you were writing it's all good! Upvotes all round :)
---
God that handmade reskin still gets on my nerves
---
Literally just a new model but with handmade attatchments that conflict with it
---
Not to mention the iron sights being broken
---
Right! I agree, and it's good to provide OP with options without making them feel like there is only one way to go. I've used both and they are just as effective as the other, but a waste of perks to use both at the same time though as there is no noticable difference.
---
Fasnacht setting for collectron will collect bubblegum sometimes. Then I just save it.
---
I think the world spawns and NPC vendors just get taken by other players.
---
Still, it's a cap sink that isn't cheap. He shouldn't be starting it
---
A person from the ither side of the fence: I personally join to it farm xp and i hate it when people gather all the ore asap and finish it early. It's the best event for gathering xp, I suspect people only finish it to be a dick.
---
They will be with one Appalachia. Or rather, they‚Äôll be the same amount of challenge, no matter the level. 
---
Won‚Äôt stop optimized builds from killing them quick though.
---
Sometimes we forget to switch it off lol
---
Lol I did this once then killed the sheep before anyone else got to get hits in
---
Okay great thanks for the info. I'll just drop everything it lets me drop then I guess...

Fallout 1 back in the 90's... Me loading the then-relevant missile launcher and hitting 'save' before firing the first shot at one of THREE insanely tough deathclaws.........
---
You didnt leave those fights with any stimpacks.
---
Better hope you get lucky at a player vendor cause you can't get another yourself. I've done this a few times with other apparel items so I know how it feels. What I do now when scrapping is sort by weight and meticulously scrap things one by one making sure its not my underarmor or my favorite outfit or prototype hazmat suit.
---
Your getting paid? I just got a leather armor skin that floats above me when I go into stealth
---
Lying talking behind your back fake friends settler scum
---
Heeeey I never notices that. I think I will change to standard sight.
---
That's just lag. Just wait a while longer for the server to "warm up".
---
This is how I do it. But instead of kids I just brew a lot of coffee after work. Log on. Knock out nearly all (aside from the level up and sometimes kill more than one legendary creature challenges) while it brews....
---
Coffee finishes... I'm done 80% of the daily challenges 18 minutes later , then I decide what to play for an hour or two before the wifey comes home.
---
My new gunslinger toon would enjoy it for sure!
---
Extra two dailies? Do you mean daily quests or challenges? I wasn't aware of this and am interested to learn more.
---
Angry Turtle has a video about stealth i'll try to find it for you
---
Execution combined with instigating is a powerful combo. Bigger health enemies? You‚Äôre delegated to a support squad. When the SBQ spawns I wait till her health is half before firing. More damage, less bullets used.
---
Unless you engage them they cannot hurt you....
---
Definitly. Im a min maxer, so i squeeze every little bit I can out of it. Non-pa with a dense chest gives you 3 points to play with. Max serendipity, blocker, or a QoL perk to lose weight. A lot of builds ive ran outside of PA rely on those 3 extra points! But as you said, there are many different routes. Dont have to spec the best for one weapon/armor. Get the 50% good of two different things
---
The old system gave people more atoms, so Bethesda chucked it for something that makes people grind weary so that they're more willing to pay atoms to speed it up.
---
Meh. 4 was by far the worst, cliched, predictable and least interesting of the BGS Fallout games.
---
Instead of seven daily challenges for SCORE points, we now get nine. This was originally going to just be until 7/20 (IIRC), but they decided to extend it for the rest of the season.
---
Oooo. Well, thank you for explaining friendo.
---
Maybe do a search on what you may need to keep but I'm quite sure if you do drop something you later need you can just pick it up again you will probably notice you have multiple sets of the same keys keep one set of each for say the grafton dam.
---
Yup, happened to me for the first time last week
---
You‚Äôre welcome, pally!
---
I'd rather this series have nothing to do with 76.
---
I love this game, but they've absolutely butchered the lore. 
---
I feel like they are going to do a bit of jumping backwards and forwards in the timeline though.
---
You really don‚Äôt need class freak. Starched genes is a must.
---
CoA won't exist for another ~200 years.
---
It's called fallout 76:stealth and sneak the ultimate guide in a nutshell
---
I wonder if everyone's 'Level Up' daily will be a little bit easier when that happens.
---
God I just want nuke zones to be upped big time. There should be billions of overpowered prick ghouls and critters in there. Instead I get four shovel wielding scorched, a basic SB and three mirelurks in a 500 mile radius.
---
The issue isn't with the game. 
---
It's with your weak ass will power. 
---
"I have to keep doing doing/playing something I'm not enjoying because my FOMO is so intense that I can't miss getting some digital bullshit"
---
Stop blaming BGS for your weak willed consumer whore tendencies.
---
I thought the same about the raider tree, but it is quite amazing. But can understand an aesthetic look. 
---
The chicken coop is so small. I was thinking something 6√ó4 feet(like every chicken coop I have ever seen) and it is 2√ó2, if that, and just look l8ke a box unless you look real close and see 2 chickens through the slats. I thought it would have chickens roaming free around and going in it like the Brahmin feeder. Sadly dissapounted. Now I don't have it yet, just saw AR another camp, so maybe there were other options you can choose from?
---
I only started playing mid-June, so the most recent double XP event was awesome. Have they done them frequently?
---
It was a joke.
---
I haven't done this, because most of my wanted items are in the middle of the board and I'll get there just by knocking out challenges off and on. 
---
You gotta love expendable income though eh? This sub for some reason hates it or lacks it? I dunno. 
---
But God forbid someone is willing to pay for something.
---
OK. I can give you the serum next time I'm on. You can private message me your GT on here and I'll catch up with you later today if that's any help. üëç
---
Wait...Are mods allowed online and work? I mean it doesn't screw with the game. Sorry a bit new to this.
---
If you on ps4 friend me. Would be nice to have extra exp.
---
500 flamingos can a camp hold if a flamingo camp held only flamingos!
---
About 1 every three months or so iirc. Maybe a bit more frequently.
---
The same stuff happened with the screaming eagle skin too...
---
When everyone does the right thing in this event it goes like clockwork. I arrived at one yesterday and donned my Chinese Stealth Suit on arrival out of habit since Im usually always the only one ore collecting. I get a wave and a thumbs up emote sound and when I look another player was kitted out ready tog o ore collecting too. The event completed as its supposed to, no scavengers dead. No bloody rad barrel plan either but thats just how it goes. Most times though its a shitshow. If people play the objectives in that one then hang onto that server for all its worth
---
Thanks
---
That‚Äôs not too bad! Thanks for the quick reply :)
---
I use my junkies, it can one shot the ghouls at radiation rumble, great gun.
---
Np hope it helps
---
The junkies, by far.
---
Both of those weapons have the "magic weapon" bug, so they would both be good guns for now. For the long haul though, I would stick with whatever suit s your build. The junkie is technically a better roll, but if you don't run junkie then it's no use to you.
---
Edit sorry accidentally posted before finishing the comment.
---
Dont feel bad, I played every ending of 3 and NV but I just couldnt do that with 4, Railroad and Minutemen storylines are meh to me
---
They're both magic FYI... But whenever that gets patched the Junkies is the better one for sure.
---
Nice, that can indeed make the dragon somewhat usable üëç
---
If you‚Äôre not playing bloodied don‚Äôt use unyielding. Those stat bonuses won‚Äôt help outside of the five seconds you‚Äôre down at that HP level during a tougher fight
---
i read here some time ago, escape artist might break the stealth (=bugged). try to replace it if you see any difference. i play unyielding stealth and kept getting spotted with 38 AGI, since i dropped escape artist it seems to be better but im not fully sure.
---
I just want the poodle skirt back, just that. Back for once....
---
Sold out, sorry
---
Where can I find a tameable Deathclaw? I want a pet in my camp really bad üòª
---
This. Some genius please help!! 
---
I ditched the CSA when I'd arbitrarily go to full 'Danger' incessantly on trash level mobs. It's got the buggiest stealth. People on here worship it but personally I can't be swayed to believe it's 100% functional as intended and I have very few such scenarios being detected in my normal 5pc stealth setup.
---
I also tend to negligently discharge my weapon as I can't fucking see its drawn in CSA... It's so annoying... 
---
Anyways....monitoring results of OP's post closely....
---
Just lower the amount and make the challenges like the current challenges
---
I don't get triggered or upset lol. I personally think that culture so to speak hurts people with PTSD more than it helps. If something rubs me the wrong way I deal with it. I think it's harmful to expect the world to tiptoe around me, it just makes the bad stuff stronger to hide from it and its irrational to expect other to alter their behaviour to suit me as an individual. Alas I am on PS4!
---
Wtf? I‚Äôve never had that happen ever in 900 hours of this game. Just a bit jealous over here lol
---
This, basically. You can piss and moan and cry to the heavens about why Bethesda released the game without considering that when given a choice to live in harmony and piss someone else off without consequences, there is a certain number in the population that will always choose the latter and the rest have to deal. Its not fair, but thats how it is.
---
If they are cheating, use shadowplay or games for windows overlay and take a clip, edit it in photos or youtube, and then send a link with your ticket. Other than that, try not to let it bother you.
---
Or go buy 1 ammo at a time from their camps for 10 minutes as payback.
---
Starched genes rank 2
---
Yeah well I was In that server for at least 20 minutes and both times even tho I‚Äôve been in it for awhile. As soon as I travel down to wait for nuke to drop I get disconnected. It‚Äôs really getting old now. And when it doesn‚Äôt kick me no one shows up to fight queen. I think I‚Äôm going to just nuking on my private and see what happens
---
Been saying this for months. Totally agree. I think you should be able to select the weapon you want. Want a mini gun craft one, will take ages to get the one you actually want so there is still rng but least it's a bit fairer.
---
Raiders actually had an interesting storyline so I did them. I did the settlers on my alt though and it wasn‚Äôt nearly as good
---
I did it but now its stuck at 36-38 fps
---
Trick: sometimes works: 
---
Make a blueprint of the item and try and place the blueprint. If it is attached to something move it somewhere else and create the blueprint in another location then try.
---
I tried adding a bunch of you tonight but kept getting an error message!
---
Im just gonna uninstall and reinstall the game
---
I thought they fixed it it though? It was a bug with stealth where chameleon was reacting weirdly with the escape artist perk.
---
i completely agree. me and a buddy of mine have been slaying queens and hopping lobbys checking player vendors for a long time looking for those ultracite callibrated shocks plan. weve come to the conclusion that it doesnt actually exist lol
---
Did you join a server from the main menu or join on a friend? If you joined on a friend and they are from another country, there may too much lag.
---
I've got a few friends who I just can't play with because of this, or it makes it really hard to anyway.
---
just drop all your useless/unwanted stuff in the first overseer-stashbox near wayward....  
---
or an drastic method : Drop all out of your stash and invebtory - log off or change server and nerver look back ;)
---
Get a Drill and report back on how long it takes, please.
---
Yes 100%. My buddy and I have been saying this for ages.
---
All legendary perks need rebalanced. Hell, the entire system needs redone.
---
How do you think people get handmade mods as they hardly ever drop......  I cried at how many screws i used to build handmades/scrap and get the silencer 
---
Also use super duper if you are craft farming for mods.  Sometimes you get 2 guns
---
I got that at a discount, I think it was 90-150 atoms.  
---
Now I want the poodle skirt back.
---
Testing would imply that Bethesda developers can make mistakes, and quite obviously Bethesda is so full of themselves that they can't even conceive of the idea of being \**gasp*\* fallible.
---
Same here me and my squad are dying for some new NW content
---
Bloodied is AMAZING in PvP what on earth guys. If done right its actually one of the best in the current meta
---
Pics or it didn‚Äôt happen. J/k...lol. Sounds memorable.
---
I actually have a you tube video of a chainsaw.
---
This is what exactly happened to me. Last night I was vendor shopping and noticed that someone had built their camp all the way on the top North Western part of the map where the River is entering the Forest region. After traveling to their camp I noticed that I was able to hop the fence where the invisible barrier is and was able to freely roam around the uninhabited parts of the top of the map.
---
After discovering this I spent hours upon hours exploring the empty spaces that were surrounding the map in the North Western forest region. Honestly, I am amazed about all the detail and land that Bethesda put into the map only to have it not accessible by players. While exploring I noticed how beautiful these zones were just due to their sheer massive land scale and places to see and explore. I decided to go on my private server to see if this would work and it did! But when I got to far I noticed my character running in place while slowly descending into the ground
---
However, the next day when I tried to attempt this again the invisible wall was up and I could not access those places anymore. I got really sad about this because I wanted to surprise my friends by taking them outside the map and lead them to the spot where I got through only to be met with an invisible wall. :( 
---
Here are some pictures that I took showing the most beautiful spots I have discovered in the game!
---
https://imgur.com/a/TkEdf6O
---
Go to the quest in pipboy, there is always an option to cancel/decline the quest
---
No I joined from main menu like normal. I don‚Äôt play with anybody I play solo so it‚Äôs not that. I join server, joined team and bought a bloodied gat plasma from team mate. Saw nuke countdown. Made some ammo switched perks around. Headed down, got on roof of bunker. Game froze, get disconnected. Jump back to main menu, hit play get put in to same server. Queen has a quarter life left. Can shoot even with gun drawn switch weapons it pulls out that stupid vox syringer and I see all guns are to high level even tho I‚Äôm 270. At first I thought it put me into my alt account that is level 10. Event ends I get nothing but the 2 star armor. So yeah idk, but‚Äôs it‚Äôs disconnected me twice during these fights right at the beginning and it‚Äôs annoying now.
---
It does, at least I'm almost sure. I have it unlocked to craft, but dont remember ever getting the plan specifically. So it defiently was a good amount of time ago
---
Right? I thought Watoga for sure would be great due to more buildings and rooftops allowing more intense sniper battles and such.
---
A couple of other good locations would be Harpers Ferry or Charleston. The map selection is sad and there are quite a few good locations that would be great for NW game play.
---
very kind of you. would be handy, if you mentioned the system you're on :)
---
You know what. Yesterday, I spent hours searching and listening to those holotapes.
---
Hmmm I'm not sure then mate.
---
Best of luck with it!
---
How‚Äôd you get back into the regular map? I think the only reason my game crashed was because I tried to start a public exploration team while I was out there, but I‚Äôm not sure if that was the actual cause or not.
---
If you Fast travel to each fissure sight you're almost guaranteed a legendary or two scorchbeast
---
But he looked at me funny, he had it coming.
---
Entire reason I clicked on this! Nice callout
---
Same thing happened to me one day. Apparently it's a sort of bundle you get as a reward for completing an event in a certain region.
---
Nice, thanks! I wouldn‚Äôt have known these spots. I was just gonna server hop death claw island.
---
I have to agree with you. As it is, I already run a whole heap of mutations because they alone are very useful. Making Mutant's gear scale with them would just make it very powerful with no downsides.
---
Personally, though, I do enjoy Armour-Piercing. I dunno how effective it really is in every situation, but it's nice seeing the damage I deal be closer to the damage stated on my weapon.
---
I'd like a crisp 20 FPS please
---
Thank you for informing me, I completely spaced on that.
---
And salt for tasty squirrel stew! +25% XP with a full squad, Strange in Numbers and Carnivore.
---
Till you blow yourself up every thirty seconds. I‚Äôd say vampires ffr would be the best. Always killin never dyin....
---
If you're taking mutations, especially multiple, class freak is almost essential
---
üôàüôàüôà
---
100% agree. those people are scumbags.
---
Ah a fellow user of scout armor I see... What‚Äôs your set? Mines Unyielding Urban Scout all with Polymer and Deep Pocketed and the atomic skin, even got an Urban Mask to go with it.
---
This
---
using non-descriptive titles like this doesnt make you cool either.
---
I punched one to death with no weapons or armor in one of the challenges. It's lame. WTF is with this and why won't they make death claws scary again
---
I was kind of thinking the other day how cool it could be if somebody could at the least setup a courier like service in this game... but the system is so terrible even that would be a pain.
---
You can just fast travel while you are out there to get back into the regular map.
---
I decided to make a shitty toon for the legendary run. I made him ugly, fat, bald and with a horrendous moustache. He wears a parched suit with a crumpled fedora and covers one of his eyes with the eye eye-patch, looking silly as chicken's hell.
---
[https://imgur.com/gallery/myCwQ10](https://imgur.com/gallery/myCwQ10)
---
For his build, I choose to go with the 3 worst weapon families: archer, gunslinger and one-handed melee. The lack of automatic weapons, and the fact that my best weapon is a TSE sigle action revolver that takes wons to reload, its making me play so different that I enjoy the toon. Everything is really difficult, for now, so great.
---
its random. sometimes he says stuff and sometimes he doesnt. the only time he is guaranteed to talk is when entering the armor. all other times its just when he feels like it.
---
I won a match yesterday without killing too! I didn't feel like having teammates so i put my guillie suit and started hiding, survived until the last circle without engaging combat once. The scorched beast appeared and killed an entire team, 2 people left, a 1v1 and the scorched beast targeted him instead of me and eventually killed him. Feels really good and bad at the same time
---
It‚Äôs bugged on some power armors. I can get it to be black as intended on my Shadow Prime but not on my Ultracite.
---
Oh yeah, duh! I forget that only certain parts of the game are broken, not all of it. üòÇ
---
There one low level deathclaw below the cliff, east of the White Powder Winter Sports. My level 17 character died because the deathclaw respawn immediately.
---
How about the Ash Heap? Less chance of Bush wookies, and less dense hiding spots. Especially if they center it around the excavator
---
Adopt me. My sister isn't cool.
---
Ah okay I see, I'm using Ultracite PA
---
*taps forehead*
---
Can't get burned out by a dumb grind if you're not participating in the dumb grind.
---
Yes and soon.  At level 250+ and not taking advantage of any unintended mechanics leveling is a bit of a grind.
---
It came to me recently that they must've wanted more dialogue for Meat Week and couldn't get the original voice actor so they redid it entirely.  
---
Old voice actor was vastly superior.
---
Ditto... first thing I bought
---
Vampires is great!
---
What I‚Äôve been seeing is that if you are able to join the first server you try joining, then the workshop icons appear. If you can‚Äôt place your camp and have to find a new server, then the worship icons don‚Äôt appear.
---
I always operate off of 5 minutes, but the most important thing is do not log into public server - it kills your server and all items on it no matter how long your on the public server
---
Flip side do this to reset farming locations
---
I‚Äôm starting to get tired of it as well... Seems like every reward I work towards on that run ends up being disappointing. First was the Dark Matter Skin, can‚Äôt apply it to fixers yet. Second was the Scout Ghillie skin, always excited for a new scout skin but this one was kinda gross looking. Got the Blood Eagle Handmade skin today, expected basically the matte black skin but with blood on it and some red parts, ended up being a rusty POS that‚Äôs hard to look at and the suppressor is missing it‚Äôs texture. Not sure if there‚Äôs anything else to look forward to in the run, pretty much for all the stuff I really wanted...
---
But I‚Äôve come so far already, might as well see it through till the end.
---
Yeah I like helping but I‚Äôve encountered a few new players who constantly have been pestering me lately and honestly, not a fan. Usually I‚Äôll only help people out if I think about and/or feel like it so I hate it when people beg for shit &amp; don‚Äôt even think twice about it or give thanks. When I was a low level I had little to no help from people and I feel like these people don‚Äôt understand that you have to work for stuff in this game, just because I‚Äôm high level doesn‚Äôt mean I have to babysit you.
---
Edit: like yesterday some dude entered my party and he was lvl 19 and he was constantly asking ‚Äúhow do you level up‚Äù and I kept trying to tell him about daily quests &amp; events (which I think would be more appropriate than say farming whitespring, considering his level) and I led him to Camden park and told him to do mistaken identity and he did like 1 thing and kept asking like ‚Äúdamn I didn‚Äôt even get any xp for that‚Äù when all they did was talk to a robot üôÑ

Oh my sweet summer child
---
Ohh okay, I was starting to think he was broken or something. Thank you üëç
---
&gt;You can try to report but Beth probably wouldn't do anything, even if you had video proof.
---
Well, they might ban them and then immediately unban them with a "final warning", which is really only final until the next warning.
---
This is part of why I‚Äôve been putting off the ending for years lol. I don‚Äôt really want to side with anyone, sorry.
---
Got mine in one Radiation Rumble event.
---
Fireproof would be a better investment with those three points.
---
Well don‚Äôt we already have all of them? We have:
---
- Standard
---
- Desert Ranger
---
- Elite Riot Gear
---
Wow bro no way how original. It's not like 100s of other identical posts have said this, Ooh but this one has a cool click baity title to get attention!
---
Link?  You should make one with a drill, and then one for an unmodded Commie Whacker from Mr. Fuzzyland.
---
MODUS cybernetic-picklebrained chameleon deathclaw tactician with ultracite claws and nuka-blood!! Absorbs most energy damage as hp and has a roaming crit zone!!
---
Realistically, withdrawal effects are so minor that Junkies is basically equivalent, except you *can* do full health as well, which is convenient for things like Encryptid.
---
All in all, the real power of "Bloodied" isn't the weapon - it's Unyielding and the perks.
---
I see you've met players who have been studying my [complete idiot's guide to radiation rumble](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/h0mg5g/the_complete_idiots_guide_to_radiation_rumble/). Warms the heart to know all these idiots are giving it their all.

np
---
First person bothers me because it makes me feel like I'm 2 feet tall.
---
That sorchbeast damage is so huge. Even with marine armor. You're not gonna start a srochbeast cult, are you? üòÇ
---
No, there is no guide, some have experimented. Yes, you are doing something. Yes, every enemy type acts differently. It's a computer program so there is an algorithm, but the are many variables. AFAIK, stealth is based on both sight and sound. AGI, perks, armor mods, weapon noise level, light source, movement all contribute. Essentially you have to test your own build. If you have a CSS, 15 AGI, 3* sneak, EA, and a combat knife with a stealth blade you should be able to do whitespring without going into danger.
---
Well, gotta up my prices now that I know this
---
Been here since beta
---
Same
---
I really want the Red Shift Power Armor to come back so I can apply the Strangler Vines to it and get FO Vietcong PA
---
Get a load of this smoothskin.
---
That's... Perfect
---
Yup that game is worse than trash
---
Thanks and happy cake day!
---
Exactly! Wanting to see it evolve should be a natural thing, tbh.
---
I've found old pictures of Grahm with that model so hopefully they're not changing him for Meat Week. This version is so much worse.
---
Thanks for your help
---
Yes thered 3 nest. A√±ways wonfered why two pn√±y spawn most of the time

Examples please

I have a nuka cola themed vending machine at my camp that sells Vila and plans and outfits.  Next to it is the nuka cola vending machine with "free" on it full of nukashine.  People are always drinking from it I het excites when I come home and see the door open.

*laughs in Australia*
---
Even at the looking glasses, we're still ~160-240ms away from US, ~70-220ms from Japan (~70ms if the route takes AJC, more if it ends up via Hawaii first, much more if it badly routes            via SEA-ME-WE3) and 300+ms from Europe.
---
I can‚Äôt agree but I understand where you‚Äôre coming from
---
Those people aren't as bad as people who make shitty non-descript titles just so we have to click on it to see if it's important.
---
If you're running stealth, then go psychopath for the crit chance. Ricochet is nice if you plan on getting hit a lot, and salt is only good for when you're literally farming and collecting fungus or nuked flora.
---
To be honest though, grim reapers sprint is probably superior than the other chance perks since a lot of actions depend on ap.

My wonderful Partner and I met on FO76 8/14/2019 and it has been an amazing journey starting of as fast friends and finding our way to this wonderful relationship we have now in February she came state side from NZ to spend a holiday with me in Panama City it was absolutely wonderful I cherish every moment with her I‚Äôm so proud to say my best friend is also my partner. It was our plan for me to move to NZ by now but due to the covid-19 pandemic and the lack of overall response from the US government I‚Äôm currently stuck in the states I hope anyone that is affected by this knows that this shall come to pass do not be discouraged you will be able to come home to your loved one soon. 
---
For everyone in long distance relationships right now Love isn‚Äôt easy sometimes it takes hard work, communication, trust, respect, &amp; honesty.
---
But for the right person it can feel effortless when you work &amp; grow together. Build one another up the human heart is a powerful thing the love we are capable of is extraordinary.
---
Take it from me I never thought I‚Äôd fall in love again let alone with a woman that‚Äôs eight thousand miles away from me but I did and it‚Äôs been the best year of my life getting to know her as a friend and build this relationship together.
---
Yep, Australian Internet is total dogshit... Until the game is hosted in Australia that is.
---
I feel like it'd at least help if the various bonus XP effects also applied to Score challenges. Maybe not the double XP weekends, but stuff like Well Rested or whatever that Mama Dolce's stew is called.
---
Borderlands has a trade system that could work really well in 76. You put your offer up for trade and the other party puts what they‚Äôre trading. Once both items are in the trade window you both need to accept the trade before anything goes through. The item you put up goes to the other player and vice versa. 
---
The other option is fighting to the death over the items up for trade where winner takes both...
---
With the main quest being revamped, what happens if I'm part way through it and the last time I logged in was before wastelanders?
---
Oh don't worry, it will scare the everloving piss out of you when you are trying to sneak, the caution alert pops and then he says directly into your ears WEAPONS HOT or *insert liberty prime quote here*  and then you proceed to shit yourself even though you still haven't been spotted but he says it so loud that Rosie sitting at Top the World heard you. I can't tell you how many times it startled me. Love the armor but I had to stop wearing it because my sanity couldn't take more of it
---
Did everyone forget how fun it was to figure everything out since beta? They dont need your help. They just want hand outs.
---
No.
---
Check my profile. I just posted it there.
---
The man who fills his heart with worldly things in place of the Moth's wisdom and guidance follows a path that has no purpose, wandering without meaning, like an errant Moth who has taken a lantern in place of the moon. 
---
But for he who finds Him and walks the Path with him, protected by his great dusty wings, you shall find in your heart a genosity and selflessness theretofore not discovered. 
---
For we are all but motes of dust beat forth from his great wings and when we perish, to Him we shall return. 
---
Honour to the Moth
---
Trust me I've check many times out of desperation, for some reason there's no option to reject it. Maybe it's because I found the weapon case randomly without having the quest active and then it started after picking it up.
---
UN?
---
Seeing as the event can be done solo, then aslong as 1 or 2 are Atleast attempting to get some ore you should be fine.
---
I just run around in my power armor massively over encumbered firing my bloodied 50cal just to tag stuff and collect the ore.
---
I'm level 460, I'm not desperate enough for levels at this point to be a dick.
---
Thank you for the blessing of this comment brother
---
It will be op, welp. Both armors and weapons have this attribute.
---
So, noctunal should not have penalty during the day.
---
Yeah that could work. I hope they do something similar to that
---
Truth in advertising. I approve.
---
Yeah, the hell ? He looks like on diet.
---
Used to be if you had event quest items in your inventory and you let the event fail or time run out, the item stays in your inventory. No idea if it still works.
---
I used to make a game out of it seeing how much shite I can steal from events... I think so far I have a barrel from toxic Valley daily, come cans from feed the people, some mr messager parts, and some other bits and pieces here and there. Sometimes they just randomly appear in my inventory and I‚Äôve no idea how they got there. The toxic barrel from the daily though sometimes there‚Äôs barrels that you can pick up that aren‚Äôt tagged as the event item and you can drop them.
---
still get diseases while wearing PA though :/
---
Doesnt bloodied max out at 90%dmg and junkies at 50% dmg? Having mutants max out at 25% dmg for 5 mutations is not alot to ask. To compare, two shot is 25% dmg increase, albeit with worse accuracy/recoil.
---
I got all three in my vendors for 1 cap each and no one buys them. Hopefully people see your post so they sell finally.
---
Not sure I'd say *burnt out,* but more.... like, definitely some sort of annoyed. Exasperated. Not even sure. I'm somewhere around ... 55? Or 56? Not even sure exactly. But I'm at a point where I don't see whatever I *can* do a day (or even a week) achieves much, really. During this double SCORE thing - I made some progress, sure, faster than I was before, but that's the issue: even *that* feels too much of a slog instead of instilling any sense of accomplishment. Like yeah I'm this much ahead now, but there's *still* about half of it ahead of me, and I'm not sure I can even be bothered to care.
---
Part of it is the rewards for sure: even ignoring the millionth perk card perk or repair kits and supply crates and lunchboxes and *fireworks*, I don't need a single hand to count how many of them I actually used or applied somewhere. Let's just say they are not the things I'd buy if they were just dumped in the cash shop, and that's without going into details about their quality or bugs or anything. 
---
I'd rather have the daily/weekly atoms back. Or at least give us SCORE for doing the regular daily quests, because between those *and* grinding for treasury notes, doing the SCORE challenges as well is just too tiresome. Not necessarily because the challenges themselves are difficult, but because of how many loading screens doing all this means. And getting 100 SCORE for *ten thousand exp* feels like getting 20 atoms for 7600 hours of playtime - a slap in the face.
---
So now there are religious rivalries occurring in the Wasteland apparently.
---
One thing I do is place down wood shutters, replace it with a normal wood wall using the replace feature, wallpaper it, then replace it with a wood shutter and it stays like that.
---
Ok well. Let's not go too far here. 
---
Rocket League's microtransaction system since being acquired by Epic is trash. 
---
The game itself is arguably the most exciting eSports games we have. It's a game that is fully dictated by a player's skill.
---
Budget cuts @ Bethesda?
---
Yeah that works until I logout and then it reverts back to no wallpaper once I log back in. :/
---
I've only began to feel the burn out now because of the levelling daily.  Everything else I can get done relatively quickly, but it feels like the levelling takes another couple of hours unless I hop onto my alt (which I'm not particularly motivated to do with the goddamned Rose questline) and hope to smash it that way.  
---
And right now, I have the plat. I'm missing one achievement in Wastelanders (raid with the settlers) and I don't have much of a motivation to get it right now. I would love to take a break and play more of Ghost of Tsushima and pick up the Borderlands 3 DLC, but the FOMO is getting to me as a completionist. 
---
I will probably throw in the towel once I get the Jangles backpack.
---
I usually enable pacifist and just follow them around to fu*k with them, getting in a way of any shot they take. Until they get pissed off enough to leave the server.
---
Non mutation bros unite, all 2 of us
---
I also have a ghoul slayer explosive that is great for rad rumble and guided meditation :)
---
I‚Äôve been there myself - except down by Point Pleasant. 
---
I‚Äôve seen video of a shack in the north of the Mire, out of bounds.
---
I mostly don't do it because I get tired of them asking for the weapons I personally use.
---
a on the go fix that i found for the weapon/stim lag is to look away from the enemy it will work every single time(i think the code is a little broken the one that let you select the loot from the container using d-pad with out open the big screen since the enemy is considered a container will get stuck thinking you are trying to loot it.)
---
It's happens to me when there's low level enemies that spawned from someone nearby but then just die as I encounter them and then the rest go my level
---
Same. Even then i feel a little shitty though lol
---
1 and I was super excited about it. Lol
---
Yeah I felt pretty shitty afterwards...I told him if he got disconnected or anything I wasn‚Äôt gonna kick anybody else. LOL
---
A good team, a lucky fire fight at grafton steel, and a well earned nuke got me 18 in one game
---
Also, Mineclaws that burrow and have black titanium claws. Also photo skin flaps, not eyes.
---
Cute. I remember watching a wedding on 76 once. The camp was designed like an outdoor wedding in the forest region.  Bride and groom dressed in the new years party outfits and there were even groomsmen and brides maids.  Once I saw another player wearing the preachers vestments, I went nuts.  Then...the groom crouched and dropped an item... The bag dissappeared, and then the bride did a thumbs up emote.  I wished they were in game chat since that would have probably been cool to listen to.
---
Lvl 95 and no legendary?
---
2 but I only started playing NW when the Legendary run started. Its also my first battle royal style game and it turns out I actually like that shit... ill keep chipping away at it until I kill every player in a single match or die of old age
---
Need some more pictures. Looks cool, but hard to really tell.
---
I've started resorting to recording my game play as the challenges turn over.
---
Not really, but go off I guess.
---
Literally have not seen a single one. Am I supposed to be sorry? This shit still happens, so clearly it needs pointed out *again*.
---
U barely take any rad dmg in pa anyway
---
If it's your drivers, this won't help. If this DOES fix it, then perhaps it wasn't your drivers in teh first place.  Good luck.
---
Itll always happen. You just look like a karma farmer pointing out the obvious. Literally like every 10th post is something like this. You dont gotta look far.
---
Sound like he just means it‚Äôs not primed/has no mods.
---
While I‚Äôd typically agree, I‚Äôve found this issue happening even with three identical PC w/ SSDs setups on the same wired network - each person would load in at different times.
---
Just a reminder maybe its helpful for you and practicable: i had this autocompletion bug happened just 2 Times and both times i loged in the game 12 hours after dailies changed (so in the morning the next day in my timezone). Since then i do them 30 min after daily change on the same evening and in log out 30 min before tje change. Neuer had it happened another time.
---
Thanks, i really hope a reinstall fixes it
---
If you're more upset that you read this than you are at this happening *constantly*, you may be one of the people it concerns. 
---
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
I have a quad explosive shotgun with Enforcer 3 perk. I have ammo for days and can keep those ghouls (and deathclaws too) on their knees basically indefinitely. Additionally I'm not build for rad damage, - it wrecks me more than anything else in the game.
---
You *want* me on defense when playing that event, rather than collecting ore. But yet I still get yelled at and frowny faces...
---
Anyway, it's important to remember that some people are just better at certain roles than others.
---
Oh. I should‚Äôve taken but he didn‚Äôt respond
---
Funny thing... I started the story about a month before wastelanders when I was level 200. So for about the 1200 hours I‚Äôve played the game before that, the countless scorched, scorched beasts, and queens I‚Äôve killed... I‚Äôve killed them all without getting inoculated during the responders quest line. 
---
I did that quest and thought ‚ÄúDamn... you can actually catch this shite?‚Äù My guy literally spent a year in Appalachia and was completely oblivious to getting some kind of immunity to the plague he was fighting. That was some ‚Äúmain character plot armor‚Äù if I‚Äôve ever seen some... That or he was just really lucky.
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôve just been running around shooting funny looking burn victim zombies in the face and killing giant bats for a year. I didn‚Äôt know I could actually CATCH this sickness...‚Äù
---
What the fuck even is a karma farmer?
---
What‚Äôs the magic effect again? I‚Äôve heard that term but never really known what it means
---
MFW I realize that No Man's Sky has way better base building and nowhere near the budget of Fallout 76.
---
Every time I try third person I go back to first because it's hard to see anything. I also don't know if it's just me, but since my character is slightly to the left I can never make it through doorways. I just hit the wall
---
protip: u can create a new character, level up, and then delete it
---
Kicking someone from a public team for being low level is so dumb. I've literally never been in a public team that actually played together, so why whould the levels matter? Everyone doing this for the buffs, or so I thought.
---
Agreed
---
That‚Äôs weird... It doesn‚Äôt for me. :/
---
Although maybe it‚Äôs a server thing? You know how when you wallpaper a wall it‚Äôll remove items off the walls? Some servers I‚Äôve been in I was able to put up wallpaper without it removing my stuff off the walls.
---
I just switched to unyielding for a bloodied build and knew it some how got you more xp but never knew how? How does it work??
---
Also, I went through the top 40 posts and didn't see anyone pointing this out.
---
My private server works just fine for me.
---
‚ÄúHackers‚Äù don‚Äôt see too many on ps4.....üòÇ
---
5 I think? Rare
---
usually its fine.. idk its been acting weird.
---
I'm level 6 on my alt and had the same happen to me with 2 level 25s. I literally started laughing in area chat then proceeded to tell them I'm probably way better equipped than they are. My buddy was in the same world so I switched to my main (level 300) rejoined and asked if I could stay now. When they said yes I told them off and left.
---
god forbid they make something thats worth my money.  well, more of my money...
---
I agree that it should be per mutation, it could be like junkies with 10% per mutation capped at 5 and still be decent but not overpowered.
---
You can zoom out. Hold down the button that you use to switch few and you can zoom in and out.
---
My question why the Gatling Gun? It got nerfed to shit when they removed the Fire Rate Semi Auto bug. Now its super slow and supper unreliable. And I own a bloodied/33% Vats/-25% Vats version which is really good, but now ehh? I keep it for nostalgic reason when I used it.
---
The MG42 should get some love with mods and skins.
---
Some weapons don‚Äôt have plans you can find or buy for the mods and you have to learn them via scrapping the gun over and over, there‚Äôs no other way.
---
So I captured the junk yard today and someone before me built 3 ammunition factories, these were not the armco appliance, these were exactly like the one within the converted ammunition factory. Anyone know about this new feature?
---
You might've just changed my life
---
The main problem is that your idea . . . Has to be coded by someone at Bethesda.
---
I‚Äôd imagine the sound one makes while reloading a gun with Enclave like intent.
---
Hmm.. interesting
---
Very true it was hard going from 500 carry weight to 300
---
Hey man not my fault. I see one of these a day lol
---
Shoot ide love a skin like that enclave never got love after almost w years now smh Bo's got a little more with pa paints
---
Nice lighting! Theatrical! Love it!
---
Self explanatory.
---
Might be an internet issue then, I used to lag on Queen fights when using my 700 ping house internet, the frames were awful. 
---
Now that I‚Äôm using my phones hotspot internet I don‚Äôt lag at all during public Queen fights.
---
(90% of the issues in this game can be traced back to bad connection.)
---
I‚Äôve never kicked anyone. Had several lower levels join. I always invite them to events, but they usually don‚Äôt join.
---
How is it a weird move? Someone has to pay for continued server costs. Continued development costs. Continued marketing costs to maintain a player base. 
---
Where do you think that money comes from if you don‚Äôt drop a dime once you buy the game?
---
The keycard was still valid after those 40 mins, no need for a second.
---
That other dude should've picked another silo if you were there first.
---
You don‚Äôt, though. I‚Äôve missed a solid amount of time (at least a week, maybe two) and I‚Äôm like 1 space behind on the board. I‚Äôve no doubt I‚Äôll complete it in time.
---
I got 4 twice. Still haven‚Äôt cracked 5 for the NW challenge.
---
Yeah unfortunately when it happened the first time to me I thought they changed it so it doesn‚Äôt remove the stuff on the walls in a recent patch. Got on the next day and decided to paint my walls again since it was ‚Äúfixed‚Äù and after a few walls I realized it was removing my stuff again... Might have been a one off glitch or something.
---
Agreed, they should also have perks for max health builds.
---
New songs with special buffs, maybe team buffs for playing the same song together
---
Nah, I'm good. I already have the plan.
---
My bloodied shotgun build on my alt uses 1 concentrated fire perk and nothing else for vats and it does soo much better than my actuall rifle vats build
---
In a weird way those forests remind me of TES 4 Oblivion. Good times man, good times.
---
Aw, that is beautifully and very well said! I wish i was that eloquent in expressing myself üíï all you said is true and thank you for the uplifting words and encouragement üòª yeah, this too shall come to pass and I hope all of us get to bridge the gap and be with our loved ones sooner üòä
---
only thing i want now for the CAMP is the ability to get rid of all the crap in it that is not made by me..like this huge tree that has now grown through my building
---
I‚Äôve switched to a Tesla Rifle just to get hits in on stuff. Doesn‚Äôt kill them but you get your hits.
---
I'd be happy to have you playing defense on a small team that knows how to run the event, but be honest, how many times do people destroy your efforts of crippling them just because it is ingrained in people's head that things must die?  :)
---
Also, was playing this event with just one other random person the other day. I always get my 40 or 50 ore and hold onto it til the end. Guy was just sitting in the middle killing everything and gave a thumbs down with like 20 seconds to go. I had to politely remind him that I actually got ore while he just sat there and leached experience (I.e. he couldn't be bothered to go get ore while I defended, which I am also perfectly capable of doing solo).
---
Aw, I would have loved to see that one! It's amazing how creative people in this community are üíï
---
Actually your right the ash heap would be awesome why not add a 4th map!!?
---
(gives player a shepard's crook w/ Ward Lord attachment, can herd Ward to his bunk)
---
If you run bloodied, which most high levels are. Your stats are going to be in the high teens and twenties. You won‚Äôt even noticed to difference. Plus you can use those perks cards for blocker, dodgy, and serendipity......üòâ
---
Fallout 76 logic.... what logic ü§£
---
Underwater mining variant of excavator with breathing and underwater jet packing. Add a bunch of underwater mines. It should carry more than any other PA, like a freight sub
---
Agreed Mutants should be way better than it is now. Instigating, executioners, and furious are still decent. TS, Explosive &amp; Vampire's effects gimped to marginal use on specific weapons. Bloodied and Junkies are in  the OP effect category. A rebalance is long over due.
---
Yes! Capture the flag, king of the hill, or attack/defend.
---
But that's the sad part. I think we still experience lag Spike's near other people's camps as well, so it's a mute point. If they could, they should just ME3 this game, make all cosmetics free, go back to paid DLC, and make these world's locally hosted on the client side so when this game goes down next year for Fallout 77 we have the option of still playing it with friends after the grind we were exposed to here.
---
Yea, I wanted to do the last launch before the bedtime :D figured I'd rather waste keycard than wait 40 more minutes.
---
Explosive
---
Brand new machine with a dedicated 970 Evo Plus M.2 drive... and I still load in after everyone else, riddle me that?
---
You can purchase a holotape from the enclave bunker which shows you the cool down timers of the silos. I believe it's in the ballpark of 800 caps.
---
I want a xylophone made of bones.
---
Go Fund me babies man. Kids literally think money grows in other peoples pockets which should naturally wind up in theirs if they beg for it.
---
I rarely group but when I do I never care about what level or even what perk they share, I‚Äôm usually there to complete a few objectives and then I‚Äôll peace out from the group. But if I do stay grouped having a low level in the group would be kinda fun, I‚Äôd look at it as having a lil buddy that I can look out for.
---
Because saying you get crippled very very rarely is idiotic?  I've had 4 limbs crippled in 4 damn hits before.
---
If you're relying on being able to move away from a mob so your gauss shotgun doesn't kill you and you get crippled (which happens all the fucking time) right before you move... and then don't... then it's pretty useful.
---
Saw 1 event where a few players were crippling. I killed 2 before i realized what was happening and just went and grabbed ore. Was the most enjoyable and easier runs of that event. Still hoping to see that kinda work again but its just nonstop one shotting.
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4 I‚Äôll give you 15k for it, I‚Äôm at 10k currently but I‚Äôll get that other 5k soon.
---
From my experience running a vats build; yes.
---
If you're talking about how to equip the cosmetics, go to the atomic shop and (depending on the platform you're playing on), press whatever button is on the bottom for "NW Favorite".
---
As for exploring the vault, I haven't found anything much of interest. Most of the holotapes and doors have a overseer level requirement so you'll just have to play NW a bit before you have access.
---
Sorry I‚Äôm on Xbox
---
Sometimes.  It very much appears to not work occasionally (most of the time.)
---
The true power are magic weapons.
---
my advice would be: play it like a regular fallout game. go and discover.   
---
just a tip: follow the overseers holotape quest and get the small backpack at morgantown airport early, helps a lot. regular backpack is a little bit of grind, the quest can be started at every station, lock for the pioneer scout poster.  
---
if you want, i'll be on in like 7h and gladly craft you some weapons.  
---
oh, and dont join the "scorched earth" event! it will end the main (pre wastelanders) questline.
---
Ah unfortunate... You should see about selling it over on the market. That would be someone‚Äôs dream weapon.
---
the damn budget is so depressing. i've had to delete tons of cool stuff just to fit more utility shit. utility items shouldn't cost anything. this includes crafting benches, stash objects, all power items, building blocks like walls and foundations, etc. pure decoration items like display shelves, couches, rugs, wall hanging stuff, etc should be the only thing to count for budget.
---
I don't know what you are doing wrong but I hardly ever get limbs crippled 
---
If your explosive shotgun is killing you than Fireproof is far more useful. Even 2 points into it and you'll barely feel the splash back. 3 and it wont effect you at all. 
---
And it takes one second and one whole button press to heal all 4 of those limbs
---
Thank you my dude will take note drop your gamer tag and I'll add you...I'll be asleep by then...yeah my mate while back said that was the end Quest
---
Does rifleman affect crossbow?!
---
Sweet
---
1% or 90%. It‚Äôs a hit. Or I‚Äôm extremely ******g lucky.üòÇ Let me rephrase that for ya there
---
Edit: but you have to use the manual crit triangle or y depending on console or whatever it is on pv
---
There was a good looking bomber jacket with black jeans in the atomic shop when I first started playing on the last day of Fasnacht... never seen it again since, waiting to get it.
---
PREACH MOTHERFUCKER!!

I believe you also get that holotape just progressing thru the Enclave story. I have it and I know I didn't buy it.
---
I am surprised there isn‚Äôt a fiddle.
---
He had one, it was the Final Word. He was running with a normal Combat Shotgun and Rifle.
---
Ok cool thanks.....I looked but I guess I just missed the NW selection prompt......Also have you unlocked everything in there?......And do you know the lowest level req needed to have full access?
---
You use steam, right ?
---
Also thanks a lot for the ur info kind stranger
---
I could link a video if you‚Äôd like?
---
Would love to get this mod but I tried it and it didn't run
---
I was completing the rail enthusiast possum challenge so was using a bloodied railway gun when 9 got to the substation. 2 shots. Might keep this toy a little longer:)
---
Nope, Bethesda launcher
---
Normally I get my legendary kills in Private World. Harpers Ferry and Whitesprings have 3-4 legendaries. If any of you interested just let me know and I'll add you guys (in PC btw). Whenever I'm in Private World just join me. No question ask as long as you leave me alone, I'll do the same.
---
Makes sense now.
---
finally found something on it, It seems it's a glitch people are doing
---
I also dont mutate it doesn't fit my character lol
---
No news about anything like that. They want you to grind it out to respec. It's a janky system since if you want to respec, you are forfeiting perk cards which in turn will hinder you when legendary perks finally  comes around. The whole "pick a perk or move a point" system is garbage and they should have let any one respec at any time but at the cost of a large amount of caps. I've moved probably 20 points on my main dialing in my build after converting it from a different build, and another 10+ on my other character after I made some early mistakes. The system is unforgiving and annoying, they even give you a reminding of how bad the system is every time you open the perk menu when it asks if uou want to buy a perk or move a perk point. Like no, I just want to cook some soup with souper douper on.
---
Why not bring it on board with Junkies and give it a 50% bonus to damage? 5 mutations for 10% damage bonus per mutation. It does already have negatives like junkies addictions do.
---
Time is money though. So you're already paying them.
---
Should be. It would be a totally natural fit.
---
8, still lost though.
---
Stay in a ‚Äúbuilding‚Äù public group because the intelligence boost helps your XP. For lower levels Canned Meat Stew from the Mama Dolce‚Äôs event is a nice XP boost too. Once you‚Äôre able to make Cranberry Relish it will give you a bigger boost. Stay well rested! Most buffs stay after you die, but not Well Rested, so make sure to find a bed soon after you respawn.
---
They've never said anything about a new respec system. There's legendary perks coming if that's what you're think of. If you want to respec you need to grind out some levels. Also I don't see how a they could ever implement a true respec system in this game.... Your perk load out is only a portion of the battle... If you want to change builds it's your weapons and armor that's the real meat and potatoes of it.
---
gt is Donald Dope, feel free to ask anything if you see me online
---
Agreed. The vault tec style scrap box is gaudy af. I want a raider style scrap box or a mothman cultists style box.
---
I regretted throwing all mine out when I was looking for this dude haha
---
That booty would be a help. Cheers dude
---
Incisor is a must for any melee.
---
Not really.  If I work a 9 to 5 salaried job with garrenteed no overtime, 40 hrs/week for the past 4 decades making enough to be comfortable, my leisure time is worth nothing.  What am I going to do? Pick up a second job at McDonald's to make minimum wage?
---
This is why I got used to using third person when using a Gatling gun.
---
Tell the plebs to get off the tents and fences. Her pathing gets messed up when her target is on a fence or tent.
---
Every major MMO has chat channels and filters.  You don't have to interact with general chat or randoms, but you have the option to chat with your party, your friends, trade chat, whoever you choose to.
---
Putting in chat just provides options.  In a properly built chat system no one can force you to read what they're saying.
---
The end game one are scary
---
Tbh, I'm not too entirely sure what the max level needed is but I think I remember one door requiring at least a level 56 overseer rank or around there(I'm only rank 20).
---
I found this if you're interested in checking out the rewards though
---

---
Do you mind if you explain that perk to me and what it does? I surprisingly haven‚Äôt heard of it or don‚Äôt remember.
---
In time they will vanish as they have zero patience for the 'atmosphere enhancing' bugs and blue screens. ;p
---
Ohhh snap yeah i just hit level 9 tonight myself but thanks for the link
---
So does a player launching a nuke start the event? Like scorched earth?  What starts it?
---
To make this mod work you need to get SFE as well. Nexusmods have instructions at each of the mods how to install it. Or, I can help you tomorrow.
---
I recall them saying they'd do something on the last week like double score again or whatnot, some big boost to score. I can't remember where but I think it was out there. Unless the 2 extra dailies is what they've concluded as so many people had the auto complete score bug.
---
It allows you to swing any melee weapon much faster and they weigh less
---
Make it 3!
---
S2sssessaassd0
---
Exactly - I agree with this completely - i like to have a goal in my games but I dislike when I have to do them on daily basis. Get rid of that criteria and I will be super happy.
---
Cant be burning people out that much unless they are constantly trying to exp farm to finish it too quickly. I'm level 80 now and pretty much playing the same way I used to casually, biggest changes I did was only to throw on inspirational perk and use herbivore for brain fungus and cranberry exp foods which take 1 min to get from macs farm.
---
While that and Faster Fire Rate has saved many a weapon from the trash heap, it doesn't change the fact that among the prefix modifiers, it's bloodied or it's trash. Bloodied explosive is superior to any other form of the modifier.
---
&gt; always have a stock of purified water for 0 caps
---
This made me cringe. Purified water is my 2nd largest 'caps crop'.
---
I have a few purifiers at camp and grab them periodically, when I get around 100 I sell them all for an influx of caps. 
---
I do have a lettered sign above my purifiers saying "Help Yourself" so I'm not bothered if someone grabs them, but I could never give them away in bulk unless I'm on my main.
---
I'm playing on Gamepass and I feel like I'm the opposite; two people came up to give me power armor before I was 50 and I was like "Ok, that's nice, but I don't need this."  Unfortunately on PC I can't tell them that unless I hook up a mic, or try to pantomime something out with emotes, so I just gave a friendly thumbs up as thanks.
---
The game showers you with all the basics you need.  I had one brief stretch where I needed to swap guns because ammo was scarce in the 20s, but that was less than a session of having to mildly manage ammo.  I was selling so much excess stuff to NPCs I was clearing out their daily caps before 50.
---
It's probably a different story on XBox, with a much younger new player pool.
---
The thing I've felt I needed most are up to date build guides by people who know what they're doing, because man is there a lot of bad info out there.
---
I view pre-wastelanders atoms like some reward to BETA testers, who dealed with 100% more bugs and shit. Now game *released* with wastelanders update and i think bethesda planned small atom gains from the start, its 99% pure cosmetics anyway
---
Monster Mash is where it's at üëå I usually score up the repeatable 1-3 times from the event since it spawns high level ghouls. Usually no one else joins the event either.
---
Honestly I don‚Äôt know why they haven‚Äôt been pumping out skins as a ‚Äòbonus‚Äô for First players since month one. It‚Äôs special, but only for those players, feels like it wouldn‚Äôt solve all the problems with the paid subscription but it would be an easy start.
---
14 is my highest. Hit that number with a nuke a while back and recently got it through normal gun kills. I‚Äôve gotten close to their in lost matches too so who knows how high I can go lol
---
There's a good amount of BoS content coming, its suppose to be an 'expansion' 
---
Called Fractured Steel. Current plot might be a sort of a BoS civil war
---
Butthurt people downvoting is what makes Reddit the shit it is compared to, well, everything else. In the Internet age though shit rises to the top. Don't believe me - look at the president.
---
Bethesda ruined the game. Get your facts right.
---
"Lazy and uninspired, 0/10".
---
Or one of those bloody stupid "Single foundation piece connected to stairs leading up to a floating abomination".
---
Watoga would be interesting considering the Cranberry Bog is such an open part of the map aside from Watoga itself, though the thought of Frog Legs being even more powerful than it already is on a map with that much vertically terrifies me a bit.
---
Harper's Ferry would also be really cool, and maybe the Whitespring and the surrounding area could lend itself to some interesting situations.
---
I did 3 queens on one server tonight.
---
First two were nice smooth runs.  People were on tents and fences, she landed, we mopped the floor with her.
---
Third one took almost 20 minutes.  I‚Äôm certain a perk throws off her landing cycle.  It wasn‚Äôt until everyone got tired of shooting her in the air that she finally started to land.  She‚Äôd dust as usual but when swinging back around, which usually results in a landing, she‚Äôd stagger and her cycle would restart.  I‚Äôd bet money it‚Äôs one gun army because the main culprit of shooting her was a Gatling gun guy who would just not stop, and who wasn‚Äôt around in the first 2 fights.
---
Better yet they could just add a lock feature.  Most other MMO and MMO-lites I've played allow you to lock items so they can't be sold or trashed.
---
It's actually not, because I don't know what you mean by karma farming. A post on reddit is not in any way going to affect my next life.
---
This is why my vendors are at the front of my house. 
---
You still need to come up the stacked platform stairs, but the vendors are actually right there when you open the door.
---
Can confirm The Missing Link fixed it for me also
---
Abandoned Waste Dump has 2-3 Deathclaws
---
No, it doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs because of that one perk that can stagger enemies. Get that to proc on her when she‚Äôs trying to land, and it‚Äôll interrupt her landing animation. I‚Äôve tested this....I don‚Äôt even know how many times on a private server where it‚Äôs just me fighting her. She‚Äôll still land if you‚Äôre on a fence or tent.
---
It does :)
---
I hit 21 twice
---
Y'know what man. You've annoyed me so much, I'm gonna join a couple events and one shot the legendaries with my shotty just for you  :)
---
This will be your comeuppance for all your whining and the whining of many others like you.
---
Thank goodness never experienced these kind of low level players. The ones I met are actually pretty decent. Sometimes when I take them along for legendary hunt, some actually offers me their first legendary loot! And also this previous low level tagged along with me most of the time for XP, but she left after 50+ still coming back to visits and gifts me legendaries weapon or fluxes.
---
I wish I could find a girl that like F76 or met her here... üòÇ
---
Congrats to you guys üòÅ
---
Check your challenges menu. You‚Äôre in for a big surprise
---
This is why we should be able to make **polls** in this damn sub.. we could find out definitively once and for all if you are crazy, or if there is actually enough interest in this and other ideas profitable enough for our overseers to make it worth their (minimal) effort.
---
Well this is strange. My steam account loads considerably slower in NW, despite it uses the same files from my SSD.
---
All scouts badge challenges are hidden away in your challenges menu. You can find it from the map page/ main menu while in-game.
---
Which literally makes you the prick causing the posts. Self fulfilling prophecy. And I hope someone else comes along to make another post, just for your being obnoxious.
---
And you still haven't told me how the fuck this is supposed to affect my karma.
---
Unfortunately, that holotape only shows how long until the silo is finished building another missile, not how much time is left until *you* silo timer is over. For instance, you can only launch from a certain silo once every three hours. So if it takes you 1 hour to launch a nuke from all three silos and you server hop to do another one, you‚Äôd still be out of luck until *your* three hours are up.
---
Shotgun
---
Ok well your armor is on the frame the armor does not go to your inventory so pull it out and the armor will be on it
---
I've read comments of lots of couples who actually met through FO76! Who knows, she might be just around the wasteland waiting for you üòÅ
---
The game still has way too many bugs to be considered finished.
---
Untill you have an Un SS set just stay with Unyielding so you have the effects
---
Hey man, hopefully someone will tell ya. Sadly I'm too busy bathing in my new legendaries. Aaah. So much scrip :)
---
Yup. Anybody that has staggering perks on them messes with her. I do Solo Unarmed queens and she lands right away, given that there isn‚Äôt other enemies bothering her
---
If we're both on PS4 I'll trade you My Blood's in it
---
SBQ DR is 300 I believe so significantly higher than most everything else.
---
IIRC, scorchbeasts in general have a high explosive resistance so have explosive rounds make very little to no difference.
---
I believe standing on tents messes with her pathing since it seems she's designed to land on the same "floor" that she can fit on near targets. So an alternate possible option that sometimes works is to set a C.A.M.P. and create a giant platform that spans the entire area.
---
\-no clue about the take off tbh-
---
Like any legendary, she'll regen after taken down passed half health. Only way to prevent that is, again like any legendary, melt her almost instantly.
---
In the world?
---
I love that one.  It's not as good xp as Line in the Sand when it's in that weird mode where the enemies just drop in a big heap right on the platform (what is that about, is it a bug?) but it's still great xp and unlike some events the legendaries aren't spawning off in some remote corner where some jagoff is going to instagib them.
---
For a Bloodied build, especially a melee build Unyielding is the way to go. Even if it's a crappy Wood piece, you need that SPECIAL boost for it to work. Just use whatever Unyielding you have at your disposal and upgrade them to Secret Service as you go. It's an arduous grind, but worth it in the end.
---
Incisor is armor penetration for melee weapons. The other user was referencing the martial artist perk (swing speed and weight).
---
Yeah I know. I just don‚Äôt want to hassle with it. I have 3 characters already.
---
I've got a friend that plays casually, but has been doing so nightly for over a year. 
---
His main is around 107 now. He mainly focuses on camp building and just relaxing to the atmosphere. He bought 1st mainly to avoid the scenario you outlined above. 
---
He'd never contest anything though, he'd simply pop off to a new world. 
---
I play the exact opposite of him. I realized today I play like it's a race, always rushing to do something else. I can enjoy exploring a place and scavenging, never pulling out a weapon but after 30 mins or so I'm ready to go hunting again or ready to do a mission. Always bouncing back and forth between and never stopping, trying to maximize my enjoyment during the time I have. As such I rarely stop to enjoy the lore. I skip through chats and mission text more than I should and never bother listening to holotapes unless I have to. 
---
He plays more like it's a simulator. A trip to the nearby trainyard takes him 'all day' as he methodically searches everything and reads every scrap he can find. He doesn't fast travel and just soaks it all up slowly.
---
Unfortunately yes you need the plan for the jetpack to equip it I tried doing the same for my SS PA and I got the same message
---
sadly im a PC potato but if i ever grab a copy on PS4 i'll go back an contact for party ups :)
---
The answer is to just go in with the essentials, or bring buffs to increase AP and carry weight.
---
As a scuffed melee bloodied build player, carry weight is a problem I'm always dancing around if I don't have a generous amount of free space.
---
Alright, Thank you alot well Luckily I have enough to but it.
---
Futurama
---
Now I want to stock a vendor full of golf clubs and call the store ‚ÄúAbby‚Äôs Revenge‚Äù
---
Keep shooting till its empty. Reload then it should fix it.
---
Weird. You call it that too? 
---
‚ÄúHello hello smoothskin, this is steel brother coming in to buff those stats. This dandy boy is going to make your nuka shine.‚Äù
---
Christ. I heard the ladies man saying that in my head.
---
What?
---
YES!!! and there is no silent judging "YOUR CAMP IS SHIT, GET THIS FLOATING POS OUTTA HERE"
---
ü§î‚ùî
---
Great, the skin I wanted the most is garbage.
---
I will always keep my "Eviscerator" and cherish it. Is there a way to display it at my camp?
---
Oreet will do its not as strong right now because the rolls on my ss right arm were exterminators, +1 agility or endurance and weapon weights -20% so it was the most decent one.
---
Probably yes.
---
I'm good killing and looting, thank you very much.
---
I wouldn't worry too much about it. Just keep using it and empty the clip. I've had a few times where the legendary "quad" mod affected another weapon. I just used the gun and eventually everything returned to normal. If the max magazine size stays that way, then you can always try resetting your game if you're that concerned.
---
Interesting. Never tried to solo so I will take your word for it. I know staggers can interrupt her landing, but a LOT of people say tent and fence campers mess up her pathing causing her not to land as often either. It could be a combination of both of these issues that make it so she doesn't land very much in public servers when there is many people shooting and staggering as well as camping.
---
you're never going to get half decent in a game with that mindset
---
Would kinda suck if have a build involving rads and want to look normal. It should purely be a cosmetic choice imo.
---
Is it legal to use that mod? Afraid of being banned
---
Skip uranium. Plenty of spawn kills
---
I had this problem. I scrapped the ally's object and put someone else's there. The quest restarted for me.
---
Yep...your world challenges
---
I only have 2 small purifiers and a couple dozen free water at a time. Caps haven't been a problem for me so far because I never really buy anything but I'm also not on water so it's not a reasonable way to earn caps for me.
---
It just works
---
Right, I forgot about that! Shame really but I guess it's to prevent people from server hopping to run silos. My general experience is staying in the same server for a session and I'm usually burnt out after 3 queens anyways. Thanks for the correction!
---
No worries
---
We just need 3 people running for ore. Sometimes it's like I'm the only one.
---
If only the rest of my team understood the benefits of the bush wookie lifestyle. Maybe we would actually win sometimes.
---
I'd rather not have to deal with an extra loading screen
---
I want bag pipes!
---
this. its a bug that happens when you fastswitch between weapons, the ammo capacity of one gun somehow gets transfered to the other, once you empty the magazine it turns back to normal
---
Your fusion cores are glitched. Drop them all &amp; pick them up and it should do it. It happens to me like 4 days ago
---
Finding decent people on the game is challenging, it has a lot of kids that play it. I'm always down for folks around my age to team with.
---
sorry, i dont get the meaning of your post. are you banned? ingame? then [submit a ticket](https://help.bethesda.net)
---
New update next Tuesday
---
Congrats; I pulled this off myself for the first time a few days ago, without firing a single shot. Felt great, after having had to run away from people shooting at me, taking almost all of my health, to get the win, knowing they died in hellfire and I lived!
---
or put all of the ammotype the weapon uses into stashbox or drop the ammo then pick it back up, no ammo= empty magazine
---
Oh okay got you, thanks
---
‚ÄúLooks fine to me‚Äù (Joking)
---
Bethesda: You're absolutely right! Did you see the new additions to the Atom shop? Now you can be a wizard!
---
For ammo farming I've found it's better to use the Penitentiary. You get less lead but you get gunpowder and steel/caps from the weapons. When I was using gyms/mines I'd always end up running out of gunpowder.
---
That would only push towards a more Bloodied route for builds.
---
Weekly reminder to equip Strange in Numbers ASAP for massive buffs due to public teams being a thing.
---
Someone had a camp at Deathclaw Island today and the spawn point was bugged. DC was just standing there soaking up bullets.
---
Shit that'd be neat. Not how it is tho
---
U in the uk?
---
We need to get Bethesda to see it so it can happen
---
the special boost from uny is worth it, perkcards like blocker, ricochet and serendipidy are tanking more damage than the higher DR from bolstering
---
Be on your toes at Hopewell Cave, there's a fissure site right across the street from it, and you can easily get swarmed by scorched and a scorchbeast, in addition to the lvl 91 deathclaw.
---
Lmao knowing them I'm not sure they'd be quick to implemented it but ye you have my up vote
---
That's probably it. When it happened, I was fighting a Scorchbeast Queen, and I was fastswitching between a shotgun for crippling and a machine gun for actual damage to tag her.
---
Thanks for the offer. But I am playing on PS4.
---
And I also feel this problem might get solved at higher levels. Yesterday we did some casual questing and reached lvl 20 (or 21?), and I ended up with more shells than I started with, even tho I just meleed really weak foes like molerats. Hopefully with Ammosmith and Super Duper, the issue should be gone.
---
I think that's why T-51b is stuck in my mind. Before Fallout 4, the T-51b is apex of Pre-War armor. I don't actively reject T60 as Bethesda Bad, it just doesn't impress me, it's just T-45d on Buffout.
---
Probably only temperary. 24 hrs maybe.
---
Thank you
---
Probably let them feel like a badass in the process!
---
Try the repeatable quests instead! 
---
Stings and Things and Operation Tidy give me possum badges far more often than campfire tales does. 
---
Also you can always earn them the hard way by completing the individual badge challenges the same way you did the tadpole ones
---
This and the hacker issues on PC should be their top priorities for NW. Then work on balancing and then new content(maps, guns).
---
I'll give the same answer I do every time this gets brought up. No.
---
There is usually several timers for some events. Like Line in the Sand there is a timer to repair the lure. So I usually wait a few minutes to see if people show up and then repair the lure. After that there is a few minutes before you have to activate it. So it gives more time for people to show up. If 1 or 2 other people show up I will start it. If nobody else shows up after the 15 minutes of waiting for both timers then I will just start it and run it by myself.
---
Add the jet packs as a discoverable item and that would be fun.
---
That would be great
---
Aight your opinion my dude
---
I've only done it a couple of times (noone seems to do it), but curious, why is it polite to wait til the end to turn in ore? Times I have done it I've collected but don't wanna piss people off for depositing too early if you should do it later.
---
Edit: is it so the event lasts the full time for max amount of spawns?
---
The CW was only recently cooling off by Fallout 3, right? Even about 20 years before F3, the background lore sounded pretty crazy. People in 76 from out of DC make it sound like a hell on earth.
---
PC, but thank you for the offer!
---
Mutations? Do people not use disease cure to get rid of those? I always do and am sad when I run out.
---
I mean it looks cool but it was meant to be restricted to a prototype factory via fallout 4 lorewise. It makes sense in 76 as to the local BOS guys using T51b and similar as they would salvage and build what was wide spread and familiar to them.
---
Nobody asked
---
This is the 3rd time its happened to me and all three were the smaller fissures that aren't on the map. When I got close one spawned, managed to kill it before it took to the skys and when I collecting the loot another appeared, then other and so on.. lol kinda gutted when they stopped spawning tbh
---
Definitely. The only thing I really wanted was the fireplace door, but as I was rebuilding my camp I realized that the fireplace door isn't worth dicking around in a broken game, just to have a fireplace door in a camp beset by bugs, glitches, and complete ass-backwards functional design. Frustration to earn the damned thing only to be frustrated again when trying to build a camp to use it in. It completely broke the spell; I'd been playing pretty religiously to try to get that door and today I just decided that I couldn't be arsed.
---
The magazine ammo is not in your inventory. Its in the gun lol
---
I see people asking for Watoga all the time but I think it would be horrible. I'm not a fan of the city area of Morgantown either. I'd rather see map with less height advantages. I guess that's just because I'm not a frog legs or explosive user though.
---
So me and a friend once heard that there was a bug causing you to be able to access another players stash as soon as they load up into the game. So we decided to see if this was legit. 
---
I placed my vendor right in front of her with a few ammo pieces ect in. she stood right in front of the vendor. so i exited the game and loaded back into her world. As soon as my vendor appeared, she would try to access it as quick as possible. She was standing right in front of her so as soon as it popped up in front of her, she accessed the vendor. 
---
What we realized was that when she did this, the game would hide all of the items in the vendor. I would look at my stash, and the items would appear that it is in the vendor, but the vendor would be either busy or empty. Basically the same that was happening to you. 
---
What we saw was that when i logged out and loaded back in, my vendor would be empty, BUT all the items appeared in my stash. I also checked my display cases, and it was empty too, but the items was in my stash. I see your situation was a bit different. All your items was gone even after server hopping. 
---
So maybe there was a player who tried to access your vendor while you were still loading in? I have no idea. I just thought i might share this as this is a possible explanation.
---
Odd, then where did this thread come from?
---
I usually drop purified water and basic ammo at the overseers workbench. Partly to be nice and party cause my stash is overflowing. Had over 9k .50 ammo that I gave away for free, before I started using it for my bolt action
---
Inspired build! Looks amazing! I had no idea you could use pillars like that.
---
Not you obviously
---
I find tech data in the silo's every day.  Launch prep room has it 99% of the time in the blue file cabinets.  Also the file cabinets in the control rooms of the power plants have been a somewhat reliable source.
---
Yeah, I was honestly never bothered by that. I figured T60 was most likely just rolling out leading up to the Great War, so what suits are out there, they're likely restricted to local chapters who find a cache or reserved for upper echelons of the BoS.
---
Most of mine come from the two daily quests for cleaning up waste and collecting bug parts
---
Thank you! In a blast zone I will usually bring up the brightness and contrast a little bit but other than these two I don't usually use anything else like filters etc. I will sometimes do a little selective lighting adjustments in Photoshop or other app if needed.
---
If not maybe someone who passes by took it whats inside except power armor
---
I have the exact same m.2 on a Z470 board, haven‚Äôt played NW before because mods but just to see if it is net related (I played from NZ) I shall test this right now :-P
---
I love that this has become the official camp metric system.
---
Good to know, I run the silo at least once a day so I'll look now thanks. That gives something to do at the most boring part.
---
Outfits should be a separate category as armor altogether.
---
It should be up to %50 like junkies.
---
I think they're in the last of the challenges pages. Check them all, you never know when you might be one step away from some Atom Caps.
---
I‚Äôm in EST
---
We‚Äôll see then... üòÅ
---
Eventually they will remove that obvious bug. Try again.
---
I would love that. Honestly, the Scorched in the marketplace are entirely inconsequential to the game so we'd lose nothing to see the ToW turned into a community hub or bazaar.

To me it seems that noone wants to do that event most times but when they do, its just like you said noone goes for the ore so im doing it alone. I have done that event once with 6 other players and still failed. Lately when ever I see that event pops up, I go and don't wait for anyone else. Although I have no chance of completing it, atleast I come out with a minimum of 2 legendaries everytime, a level up and a heep load of loot.
---
Ugh. My youngest brother (he's 15 I'm 28) a gamepass noob. I've had the game since launch but took an extended break, even through the release of Wastelanders. When I saw it was added to GamePass I told my little brother to install it (he had been bugging me about gaming together... I love him but damn man I game to relax lol). I made the choice to start fresh so we'd be playing on equal footing. The fact my old lvl 75 save wouldn't load kinda pushed me to it. 
---
Being the older brother and the one with more experience in the game, I helped him as much as I could. Gave him ammo, guns and armor. Tried to teach him how to loot and craft. That was about two weeks ago. He hasn't played in over a week. Talked to him today before logging off and heading to work. He said he lost interest in the game cause he got sick of not being good at it. He didn't wanna put the time in for better gear. Got tired of always running out of ammo etc. Little shit basically complained he stopped getting free stuff from me and other players we encountered. Didn't like that I "pay to win" via Fallout 1st (couldn't resist the scrap box and survival tent). Now I'm approaching level 70 and he's fallen far behind. Will probably remain a level 35 forever unless I convince him to give it another try. 
---
I'm fine with it though. I get to enjoy exploring Appalachia and teaming up with other players who WANT to play the game. I'm lucky enough to not encounter random kids like that but it hurt to learn that's how my brother games. Thought I taught him better than that long ago when I first let him play Xbox with me 10+ years ago.
---
Or worse, "this item can't be removed or else part of the existing structure is unreachable."
---
Had to build my entire CAMP in one go because once I connected a second foundation that's what I got every time I tried to undo something.
---
Not really new, but I never really played far. So I would say rather noob‚Äôish, yes.
---
I def. don‚Äôt want to make a Jack of all trades, but I thought shotguns and melee could fit together quite well.
---
Surely neither will unlock its full potential, but let‚Äôs see if it‚Äôs still enough to handle the PvE content. If it doesn‚Äôt, I can still shift the build to one of them and drop the other.
---
Power armor works a bit different then 4 this time around. Instead of being able to leave it out laying around like in fallout 4. The frame will house the power armor pieces and only way 10 pounds total. You can manually put the frame away by walking towards it and their should be an option to store in inventory.  After being left out for 60 seconds it automatically gets put in your inventory. 
---
As for tips I highly recommend watching some build videos on youtube or asking around online for help coming up with a build. Its recommend to stick with one weapon type for perk cards. You can still use any gun you want but make sure to be taking perks towards one main type of weapon.  Otherwise you‚Äôll end up with a build that is a little messed up. Each weapon needs certain perks to reach max damage late game. Rifles need tank killer, heavy guns need stabilizer, shotguns needs enforcer to cripple enemies. 
---
If you want to run heavy guns no need to wait until later. Get yourself a gatling gun they can be found in the wild around level 20. 5mm ammo isn‚Äôt to hard to craft or come by. Its slower rate of fire is great for accuracy and still packs a punch. Their is also the .50 cal one spawns north east of clarksburg shooting club over near grafton.its on the bed of a pickup. may need to server change a few times but its not a bad gun and .50 cal ammo is easy enough to make. 
---
Their is also a resource map online
---
https://fo76map.com/
---
Play around with it and use it to find a good place to build your base near a lead vein. You can build a lead extractor on your camp. Just like in workshops. That will help with ammo consumption. Their is a vein just down below wendigo cave in the savage divide. It is a higher level area but i had my camp their for a year and hardly ever got attacked. Only just recently moved because their is a late game item that made my ammo shortage  non existent.
---
Buy the radoppossum hat in the atom shop and then kill 500 possums while wearing it
---
Try not to switch up your build like your planning on. It'll be rough throwing away 10+ levels of rifle/shotgun perks to then spend another 10 levels on heavy perks. Just my opinion tho. N your power armour is on the frame, when you pull the frame out again it'll be there.
---
Read back. I'm not  'buttsore' at all. I agreed with your suggestion. I simply stated that it was highly unlikely to happen because of their priorities. 
---
You were dismissive and confrontational. The fact that your reaction is to block someone who's view differs from yours even slightly speaks volumes.
---
As for removing someone maybe leader wants his friend/s in the team and when there isn't enough slots he removes (kick) someone out of the team? Sometimes people also don't like low level players on the team, i.e. because they have no mutations and therefore don't provide additional bonuses from Stranger with numbers Perk card.
---
As for blue bonding bars - you can't have bonds with yourself, but only with three other members. That's why there are only 3 bars above other members. But all other have "your" bar ;)
---
I've got an X470 board, be nice to see if you fair any better!
---
The first time I encountered this, was in the cranberry bog and I didn‚Äôt realize I had to pick up the toy. I just heard her few lines and thought it was creepy. I for some reason thought of black eyed children ghost stories. So I stared up at her face and saw her pupils seemed black then she looked at me said ‚Äúmy poor Lucy‚Äù and a rad storm appeared out of no where behind her! And then I shit myself and fast traveled home.
---
can, but its signal to not touch terminal. Also occupy the terminal is also pretty good.
---
Let me add one. Since game pass I‚Äôve had my colored lights changed more than in the previous 10 months. They see they can click and change the color...and they can‚Äôt resist. And I know it‚Äôs new players because I‚Äôve been in my camp and watched them do it.
---
Nope didn‚Äôt matter, can tell the games loaded and ready, but the servers just shit like an adventure server with 3 nukes on it -.-
---
Bolstering is kind of useless in my opinion - DR and ER bonuses provided by it have diminishing return above \~300-350 anyway, so for any bloodied build (melee or ranged) Unyielding is always better since it's provide additional bonuses to SPECIALs.
---
I doubt all you said was to fucking stop. You probably threw in misogynistic or homophobic slurs in as well if you got comm banned.
---
Those are diseases! Mutations are things like marsupial and speed demon 
---
Marsupial: +500% jump height -4 intelligence
---
Speed demon: Run 20% faster but get hungry and thirsty 50% faster
---
A lot of people are at max caps, so what then???
---
Very low chance. I have been trying to get the urban variant by doing the savage divide events for a at least 2 months with 0 drops of either variant. at this point it's on my bucket list along with the white fire fighter outfit.
---
I'm not sure Campfire Tales even awards them at all. I've played it dozens of times and my badge count has never gone up.
---
I know because I check the possum machine that's right there after every Campfire Tales, because there's something I want to buy from it, but my badge total never increases.
---
A few days ago i killed 7 people in one game. I was sooo exited about it! Usually i kill 1-2 every game at max, once killed 4. I think i got really lucky with 7 kills that time
---
Maybe look for something they want to buy or buy expensive plans that you usually wouldn‚Äôt be able to get
---
Nope all i said was that not really into sexism of anti gay and this is a game dont bring things like that into place of release
---
The game counts the ammo that's loaded in your gun as still being in your inventory. If you don't believe KekC., bring out any weapon and drop all the ammo in your inventory for that weapon. You'll have an empty mag.
---
Why would you not use mutations I mean marsupial and speed demon at least just for quality of life purposes
---
Not saying you have to finish it early. I‚Äôm all for XP farming too, but people can gather ore, and just wait to turn it in. As long as everyone is on the same page, let it run for as long as possible.
---
Mutants should work like how much and how bad negative effect you have. Without Class Freak much more damage boost like 50-80% with 5+ mutations.
---
i love this bug and hope it does not get patched.
---
Use a gatling and fastswitch/reload your automatic tesla or shotgun till it takes. Put Gatling back in stash..
---
No thanks needed. :)
---
I love this or Poseidon with parts of Charleston?
---
I may kick someone from a team for a few reasons: 
---
1. I have a friend who wants to join and need the spot. 
---
2. The player is sharing a perk card that causes problems‚Äîusually one that removes rads‚Äîand hasn‚Äôt changed it after being asked to. 
---
3. If the team happens to be communicative and doing things together and someone isn‚Äôt participating, I might kick them in the hope that someone who might be more cooperative joins up.
---
Ohhhh!!!! I guess I haven't gotten a mutation yet. I'm level 49, but mainly build camps instead of regular questing
---
I have taken to just leaving it alone, and farm the wendigo's for screws then leave.
---
It's too much on ammo sink. And Gauss minigun ultracite ammo is expensive!!
---
I am from germany. Don't know where you are from and if it works with the timezones. I play almost every evening for 2-3 hours. Write me if you want my psn.
---
is there even a use case for a radium rifle over a fixer or handmade??
---
It's an arms race. You gotta find one of these weapons yourself, in order to participate.
---
And tbh, they're not that hard to come across. I usually just scrip them when I find one because I have no use for them, but perhaps I should start selling them at my vendor now that so many people know about them.
---
I mean im 24 and wouldn't mind gaming with you even though you said 25-45.
---
Yes
---
I found a surgical mask the other day and wouldn't you know...
---
My nose clips through it. ;p
---
Don't want people joining you? Don't join a public team. It's really that simple.
---
As far as I know Captain Cosmo Jetpack is only skin, not mod itself, so you have to know mod first to craft it on your torso.
---
That‚Äôs what I want, specifically on power armor.
---
K no one cares mate
---
This makes sense to be in the game
---
Cool, isn‚Äôt it?! I thought that was cool too!
---
Yep we are slowly getting more content. Their is steel dawn questline coming sometime in few months. A group of members from the west coast chapter of the Brotherhood of steel are moving into Appalachia. No idea if its going to be a one off mission  or a decently long story. We also get season 2 of the score event and daily operation events. As well as a new event involving the wendigo colossus.
---
Then  in the fall we get fractured steel which is an all new story dlc involving the brotherhood of steel which is a continuation of the steel dawn questline.  And the start of expedition events
---
That would be nice to get some skins for Scrapbox - none of my three characters uses any Vault-Tec style theme, so scrapbox looks kind of weird in the rustic wood house.
---
Bethesda has never listened to the Fallout community. Their solution is always to delete the game, re-install the game, re-install the system OS then all else fails to contact the PC or console manufacturer.  As well do not forget they blame COVID for their slow or null response time on tickets. Which was slow or null even before COVID. They do not care about the community. People complain about bugs, they introduce more content and Atom shop items, which just create more bugs then ignore it as if it is all on the end user and not server side.
---
Blocker and Ricochet are great perks. Blocker for 45% less melee damage, ricochet for 18% chance of not taking ranged damage at all. Born survivor and dodgy may help aswell (I don't use dodgy as I don't like it taking my AP). As far as armor, secret service is your best bet if you have the patience to save up the bullion, buy and put on the buttressed mods and if you have even more patience roll vanguard's - would be as good as being in power armor.
---
There was in in the atomic shop like others have said. You can get the makeshift rhoni(spelling?) helm at level 89 in nw however
---
Also stealth editing your comments to make you look better is a classy move.
---
i dont see anything wrong
---
This is the best response and all 3 reasons are spot on.
---
either way just not to surprise you it won‚Äôt matter you‚Äôll end up getting the shitiest weapon roll and trashing it, well from my 40+ attempts anyway (4000 scripts)
---
Sorry I had a stroke reading that what ?
---
K cool
---
I'm more afraid of ants in Appalachia than Deathclaws.
---
Don't forget the carry weight bonus of +20 for Marsupial.
---
the queens DR/ER is 300 plus a flat damage reduction of 70% to ALL damage plus 100% damage resistance to all explosions and radiation.
---
does it really matter if players stand on tents or fences? no. maybe. unclear. some will tell you definitely because queen wont land if she cant plot a path to melee attack but i just cannot confirm it, she lands plenty with everybody on high ground, or not at all with everybody on firm ground.
---
perkcards tank-killer, enforcer and one-gun army, will stagger the queen midair and might delay her landing intervals.
---
queen will avoid thrown grenades by sidestepping or taking off into the air, shooting the head while not in sneak should not make any difference.
---
if queen takes no damage she will regenerate after some time.
---
if queen is in cropdust or hover mode the best strategy seems to be ignoring her
---
Server hopping at cranberry glade with the required taming perks is easiest way
---
Are you on PC? I don't really see people using them at the SBQ on xbox.
---
I wanted to go Archer because it‚Äôs just cool. But the bow really just sucks, especially with VATS. Plus the arrows are pretty expensive to craft, and I hardly made it to collect them back‚Ä¶
---
Can you read? Did i say finished?
---
Best one ive seen said "cheap chems and ammo what could go wrong"
---
The higher the level of ore turned in the tougher the enemies in the lower areas, therefore it can be harder to run in and collect the ore. Floaters and deathclaws etc start spawning and can make it harder to just go about collecting
---
Borderlands 3, Diablo 3, World of Warcraft, there are just so many.
---
Gotcha, thanks for explaining!
---
Released = minimal bugs/no major problems.
---
People are doing the events. As soon as the kill 3 legendary challenge is over Leader of the pack reappears. The legendary run is making it a rat race.
---
Remember you can only hold 1000 legendary scrip.  At some point you‚Äôll have to spend them.
---
its really rare that it awards them, but i have gotten a few badges from campfire tales. Keep in mind I grind all these quests every single day though
---
I have 73 lol
---
Well, maybe if you can *clip* past the *chaulk* walls by those interaction crafting bench glitch that people do to put there base under the ground? Food for thought
---
\- like u/Uninspired617 mentioned it's 300 DR, but she has also 75% explosive damage resistance, so those two combined results in fact explosive weapons are not efficient during the fight with her. On top of that recently (2-3 patches ago) they've made her limbs immune to cripple, so you can't "force" her to land (crippling her wings).
---
\- no, many times I saw her landing almost on top of Survival tents.
---
\- as most enemies her head takes twice damage than the rest and always sneak attacks give at least 2x bonus, so it's not that.
---
\- every legendary enemies health works that way - if it drops below some threshold it regenerates (you have info that enemy is mutated). Just on normal enemies you're able to kill it more quickly and it won't have a chance to regenerate, but big enemies with lots of health, like SBQ or Wendigo Colossus, can regenerate more easily during fight.
---
Yes. I, too, hate pressing a button.
---
You shouldn't play a PvP game if you are unable to handle being attacked by other players. Zero point in cursing at people in a public chat considering children also play the game. They are playing the game how they want to play the game. Perhaps you should play something more your level of maturity such as Solitaire.
---
No, they're an exploit that need to be patched out and never should have existed in the first place.
---
I already have at least one weapon in my stash that meets the requirements that I just happened to hold onto because the other effect were decent even though I've never actually run a heavy weapon build.  And that's where it's going to stay until this ever gets fixed because I'm not an asshole.
---
God but it takes sooooo long to press a single button. I don't know how much longer I can take it. /s
---
I think people are just completing them faster. Especially with the introduction of event teams. Most of them don‚Äôt take that long to complete once you know what your doing. If I notice events are not popping up fast enough i change servers. Sometimes that helps
---
You can find them under Challenges - World. There are a lot of them to complete but all are fairly easy just time consuming.
---
I played since beta, trust me, there is minimal bugs and no major problems, compared to what it was. And most games releasing with day1 or 2 patch, but for bethesda it will be day 1000 patch it seems
---
Place 2 foundations, then place either metal or brick door way and spin and place a second time done
---
Did mine in Rad Rumble
---
Why? I kinda see how it would make sense, but at the same time fear it could be used as an exploit. What do you think?
---
it is actually broken since they added the "silent" helmet variant.

Think you're supposed to be at 55 by today
---
Edit, I believe that was done before we were given 9 dailies though. So you should be close, not sure if you'll get it without extra grinding or atoms
---
Nothing major compared to Bethesda.  Compared to other, more competent studios...
---
Does it only apply on the first floor
---
Place doorways instead of walls; they snap in the same physical place back-to-back. Then switch them to solid walls instead.
---
sometimes a minute or two as well :)
---
All power armor pieces are stored on your chassis. Pull out the chassis and you'll see.
---
Also, if you're gonna move to Heavy Gunner, start doing it NOW. The game doesn't tell you this, but how easily you progress depends on how soon you start your build. The earlier the better.
---
I was in my 30s when I realised I wanted to change, and it was HARD.
---
Start now, and you might experience a little bit of pain, but you'll struggle less than if you start later.
---
I would.
---
I can launch a nuke from all 3 silos and server hop to launch 3 more nukes no problem. The timer is only per server if you remain on that server. I probably launch around 9 nukes a day from different servers with zero issues.
---
I think he has a point. The "challenge" of a game should not be finding enemies, but killing them.
---
Next week we are suppose to get a new end game boss I believe. The colossal problems event is set to launch
---
According to the CM there will be a New respec system in the works, probably releasing by the end of the years with perk loadouts.
---
Holdddd up... Yesterday I played the one violent night event... I am at level 396 and NEVER received a mask ( I bought one a few months ago for a lot of caps ).. But I got an urban scout enclave mask AND a forest scout enclave mask as a reward at the same time yesterday ...so I guess they are still around and I was extremely lucky?

How do you download mods on fallout 76 I play on ps4
---
There‚Äôs not much hand holding in the game for the kids. The games these days like COD or fort nite are straightforward and good gear is always a moment away. There‚Äôs very few MMO style games on Xbox as is, most kids just want to get straight to endgame gear. Having to work for it is too much hassle !!
---
They 100% do not.

Do you want to travel to camps with 30 mounted molerat heads plans and 120 Fasnacht berrets? Me neither.

Double Double? Is In and Out coming to West Virginia?

That‚Äôs fine. Just so you know the limit.

They do not have an increased damage to scorched. That guy is incorrect. That is a hugely common misconception.

This doesn't sound like magic weapons if she's dying from just three people while flying. 
---
This is hacked in weapons on PC.
---
I have some insight with proven data. I run two clients, one for my main and one for my mule. Both are set to same resolution, however, mule is on lowest graphics settings sans draw distance. The mule loads significantly faster. So ignore people saying you need an SSD; it would help, but doesn‚Äôt make much of a difference. Instead, lower your graphics settings for NW.
---
Even on the top floor?
---
Wait you guys can fast travel to workshops?
---
If you fast travel to Haven Church there's a random deathclaw to the right of you. He spawns VERY frequently.

By stacking with Herbivore you mean like Formula P with its accuracy right?

I think I‚Äôve been playing all wrong. I‚Äôm lvl 40 and some things don‚Äôt add up
---
Um.
---
Easiest explanation is to youtube it fo76 magic weapons.
---
But for shotguns there are two ways.Ôøº
---
1. Have a piece of armour with 15% reduced damage when blocking
---
Or
---
2. The shotgun itself has one of a few effects.  A junkies shotgun for example will do incredible damage in VATS regardless of your build.  I think one of the other effects is 33% reduced VATS cost but I can‚Äôt remember despite having one
---
Wrong, the respec system is mentioned in the roadmap for this year. At work I sadly can't link it, but maybe another redditor can help out here.
---
At least teh perk loadouts, most liekly similar to the mod from nexusmods, wiss definately come, I just hope that they expand this and let us freely move points.

You are Communication Banned on Xbox for using a "Trigger" Word via Xbox messaging. 
---
If it's the first time this has happened your ban will only be 24 hours. 
---
If this is a regular occurrence then you may be banned from comms for quite some time as the sentence gets longer each offence. 
---
You can appeal this via the website but as you used a "Trigger" you will not be unbanned.
---
My record is 15
---
1.They would have to include basically every nation‚Äôs flag because ‚Äúhow come XX has a flag and XXX doesn‚Äôt‚Äù
---
2.I‚Äôm all for new content,but the mothman is more suited for short side quests like the order of mysteries rather than an event such as meat week or scorched earth.
---
3.Please no.Even toilet paper smeared with my own shit has more uses than pipe guns in 76.New weapons are always cool,but a pipe shotgun would have to be worse than a pump action,so why would anyone use it?They would need to spice up pipe guns first,before anyone would buy a skin for them.

Roxy or wren daily‚Äôs in crater

You go to the crater at the North on the map.

You go there every day and do the mission that's available to with kill someone or get some kit.

You do this every day for the next god knows how many months, one a day, until you want to cyy at night.

1. President  &gt;!Thomas Eckhart!&lt; disagree with you, this is the Great American soil.

2. Maybe we will get a new cryptid after wastelanders over, since we have the cult already.
---
Magic weapons aren't like that at all you need to use vats for most of them and none of the heavys are very good in vats. I have two magic shotguns and I can't down the Queen in seconds sound like hacked weapons.
---
Because not everyone wants to bounce around like a wierdo...... O_o MMO's have enough 'jumpers'.

You got point there but i didnt attack and it was a private chat not public but they shouldn't disturb others who are trying to play in there own style thanks you gave me a lot to think about

Thanks for the feedback

None of the above

Pureblood is what it's called. Or should be. 
---
Im hoping an Enclave exansion adds Pureblood gear and its particularly devastating against mutated people. I couldn't pump enough shit into the wastelands water imo a-la Fallout 3.

Pipe bolt action and revolver rifles get benefits from both pistol perks and rifle perks. So there's some spice in there from that.

I want the meat week barrel drum!

Sorry to hear that about your cat. The plan you are looking for is called "Modern Paintings", your best bet would be to take Workshops and hope it drops from one.

Or just trade for it.

Yep each to their own üëç
---
So long as the person having second thoughts can only cancel the deal and not pull a switcheroo by swapping in different items at the last second, I like the idea.
---
Yes, once I hit 50; I went to the vendor at Rusty Pickaxe &amp; got some decent gear.  it costs 100 to roll for something with 3 stars/effects so I grabbed a few low star ones so Id have decent armor.
---
But they are still shit.And honestly they look shit so not even a skin can fix that IMO.
---
Console mods are a no go
---
A new map would restore my will to continue playing this mode. Also Bethesda did you intend for us to encounter the same people all the time? Still curious lol
---
Is nuclear winter active? I used to play it with friends everyday. We used to win almost every game. But the cheaters and jankyiness of the game just got to much.
---
Shit is a point of view, Anakin.
---
Can someone explain this as I‚Äôm not sure what it means?
---
Because people don't use shotguns on the SBQ, they use heavy weapons and there's no vats required.  Angry Turtle has an ongoing series each time a new magic effect pops up just running around shooting shit.

But its alway your own risk and nobody knows what Bethesda is going to do.

I believe I addressed the majority of what you posted and I cannot see where I misquoted you. You recommended more challenges for NW, which would break balance, and never addressed the actual request to recommend ways you thought would be better as an incentive to play. Instead you listed recommended rewards, all of which are already part of the run's rewards. Finally you think you are giving me solutions, but I am not the one with the problem here. The sooner you realize you are not entitled to all rewards and you have a choice of wether and how much you engage in the run, the sooner you will feel much better and enjoy the game more. If you had spent half the time you spent responding here, in adventure mode, you would have made up the 250 score from not doing that single NW daily you so dread. I guess it's a matter of principle.
---
Even if some instances while flying are hacked weapons it's  till perfectly possible for people to accomplish the same while she's on the ground with "just" magic weapons.  You can see it all the time, she lands and her health just starts to plummet and then the damage accumulated up so much she just falls over dead while she still had a chunk of health left.
---
I've only seen Encryptid end one of two ways lately. Either everyone runs around dying like morons and we fail, or we nuke her in five seconds and win. I'll take the win.
---
You can't use mods on PS4 unfortunately, you'd have to wait until Bethesda add official chat support or if Sony and Bethesda allow mods on consoles
---
I hit the queen with a couple 45 explosive then she lands I use a anti armor gat plasma

I bush wookie about 60 percent of the time, always with team fill off obviously.  It's like a hide and seek simulator where you die if you get found.  Pretty much the only time I don't make top ten is when I afk for too long.  Making it to the last team spot is fairly common as well.  It's amazing how blind most people are when you are sneaking around, obviously the really good players spot you though.

The problems start though when I don't have any weapons or armor which is most matches.  Usually just run out to get killed at the end.
---
It happened to me for the second time after the most recent reset. I noticed the game took longer to load in after clicking adventure. Abnormally long. Like 3 times as long. Sure enough I had 6 of 9 challenges completed. Weird thing was for the 3 that didn‚Äôt fully complete I still got 500 score for each of those even though x2 score ended 4 hours prior. This whole thing is screwed  up big time
---
Esthetically it might be,obi-wan.But otherwise?P U R E   S H I T.
---
In all seriousness pipe guns need a buff before anything else.I know they are meant to be basically starter weapons,but there is no need to use them when there are 10mm pistols,pump action shot ties and hunting rifles everywhere you go.
---
Farm reps at Slocum Joe‚Äôs random encounters, I did it there for the Settlers, way faster than doing dailies for them (missing Ward/vacuum tube and retirement).
---
I would go for the junk deposit, you will get some lead, obviously not as much as from a lead deposit but it will gather copper aswelll. Plus the junk collector also gives much more valuable materials like fibre optics and ballistic fibre.
---
Think there is much greater things that need patching first, then some over powered weapons but then I'm biased leave me magic shotguns alone lol.
---
I've seen some Queens melt on Xbox too but they looked more like glitched weapons.
---
The game is still designed to only care from a 1 player perspective still. 1 player going to the atom shop and buying atoms. That doesn‚Äôt require two ppl so they won‚Äôt ever fix it.
---
In teams shared cards show up, but have a chain link symbol on them.
---
If you mean cards you hold but not equipped there is no limit  on them
---
The fact that you're upset by this but not that there is no endgame content.... is the real problem. 
---
"Magic" weapons dont melt SBQ. Only the bloody fixer does. 2nd best is bloody gauss minigun but that isnt magic or a glitched weapon.
---
There are really no middle ground weapons short of "magic" weapons. If anything they fill the spot of B grade weapons. Otherwise it's A and C class weapons.
---
Currently the ammo glitch on BPR is possibly what you are seeing. But it's not magic.
---
Eh.  Caps are worth smaller things, good weapons are worth good weapons.
---
Junk. You can easily mine lead at lucky hole. I haven't had to worry about lead or bullets for months. Plus you can still get a little bit of copper and lead from junk, also you can search the scrap that protrudes from the junk extractor node fairly regularly for a few random junk items.
---
But that's on the ground. You stated in the air. Magics good but only three while she's flying. Bit of a stretch.
---
To add to that the daily photo op can give a little bit of rep for which ever faction you want.
---
Yes it's strange. Seems a no-brainer.
---
Ok thank you
---
Guys, did anyone notice that Zorbo, who supposedly shows your current expected rank in order to get all rewards in time, is ahead? Our expected rank as of 28/07 is 56 but Zorbo is already at 61.  
---
I would expect to be ahead of him thanks to double XP weekend, double SCORE weekend and Bethesda having added more daily challenges each day but for some reason, Zorbo is farther.  
---
Did Bethesda change the progression curve to increase SCORE required to achieve later ranks?
---
Right after I farmed 49 fireflies, too.
---
One more thing you could do is the mirelurk side quest at Ohio River north of Camden Park, queen meat gives the most rep.
---
19 kills with a competent team. No nukes. Commando build. Xbox.
---
I absolutely suck at pvp so I avoid it at all costs. Once I had like 4 workshops and that one dude took all of them. That was no big deal because they were just junk extractors, but he started following me around the map, shooting me and attacking my pet cat. (idk if he killed it, I couldn't find it after he was gone).
---
That's just bullying and has nothing to do with raiding.
---
Yup, nothing wrong with an unpopular opinion
---
No good deed goes unpunished. :P
---
You start with a 1 in each stat and then get the points for leveling to 50.
---
Yeah.  Its actually pretty hard to melt sbq with magic, she still has to much armor/health.
---
How does the pa skin look? I'm planning on using it on t 65 with the clandestine minigun paint.
---
Unfortunately no. I think it's just a joke weapon. They used to do a tiny bit more damage with the over repair bug, but that was patched out ages ago. You can annoy other players with it though.
---
PS4 doesn't allow mods, console commands are not mods
---
If you want mods for PS4 you'd have to hope Sony and Bethesda allow them, which probably won't happen, instead you'd have to wait for some sort of official chat function in game, which... I've not seen anything about tbh
---
Yep almost level 398 and i feel the same way. I get the shitty challenges done fast then play nuclear winter. The drop rates suck terribly and the stuff on the board is mediocre at best. These are the the reasons people duped like crazy. I dont really even care if i complete it which i probably wont. Who really has time to repeat 10k xp for 100 score?!
---
You just opened yourself up for a world of toxicity üòÇ. I posted about this twice. All the high levels are too good for you and you can gather ore whilst they xp farm you puny little nothing. "LEt PEoPlE dO wHAt tHeY WAnt"
---
God (Todd) I just want flat ground. Give me decent LAND and I'll take half the budget. There's fuck all places to use that aren't;
---
-Soaked in adds/critters.
---
-Already taken by anyone with a like minded build.
---
But yeah, when you can only have one CAMP and a smallish budget you're so capped any heavy cosmetic investments are kinda redundant.
---
I use them a lot for free teleportation.
---
Do you lose the damage buff if you're not using the drug at the time? Like can I just run around with the addictions and only the negative effects from not using or do I lose the damage boost while not high.
---
Not sure--I grabbed it as iirc the per-atom value was quite good.
---
...I think this is the big thing that annoys me to almighty hell...building budgets not only are so arbitrary but also makes little to no incentive in getting anything from the atom shop. Even in Fallout 4 there was a limit to how much I wanted to do settlement building at a months time. 
---
Bethesda needs better hardware that can compute the values because if the solution is constantly limiting players on an open world, that's just basically asking for default private servers.
---
What level?  I'm 29 and calculated that I can still finish.
---
I was asking because im thinking of doing a drill only playthrough
---
The SBQ and Scorchbeasts do not have an explosive resistance. The SBQ has a generic damage negation perk that encompasses all damage, not just explosive.
---
Not everyone is willing to pay real money for in game items.
---
Yea good luck with that mate, you will be thoroughly disappointed.
---
Yea with all the pre-war food riots I could see them decking cops out.  The visor emanates authority. I remember reading about its being Riot gear as well.
---
Totally
---
 &gt;noticed the game took longer to load in after clicking adventure. Abnormally long. Like 3 times as long. 
---
This happened before it autocompleted for me yesterday too, then it said disconnected before I loaded into the world &amp; chucked me back to the main menu. It was the morning after reset (13 ish hours later). First time it had autocompleted on me
---
I also discovered that Smiley 'autocompleted' for me too he believes I have already bought from him this week, so I cannot by gold bullion from him until next week
---
I'm still grinding bullion too.  Doing both at once is driving me crazy.
---
The Gamma Gun is a pistol. Whether it is an automatic or not, it only benefits from the non-automatic damage perk cards.
---
The PA skin looks amazing it's worth it!! Speaking of the clandestine skin I heard aiming down the sights with it obstructs your view
---
Thank you that is really helpful I was so confused when I put on the auto pistol perk didn‚Äôt work
---
Ha ha.  Bloodied magic minigun go brrrrr.
---
Ditto plus send loadsa heart emojis their way
---
Have you tried the dark matter skin specifically with t 65?
---
Playable Super-Mutants when?
---
Sometimes I wonder too, because I‚Äòm on a server for a long time and no events start. Maybe it depends on how many people are on. I usually change servers then.
---
Solo drilling the SBQ's skull would be a big achivement.
---
The Shadowed mod doesn't work on any type of armor, except leather. It's bugged.
---
&gt;&gt; "Magic" weapons dont melt SBQ. Only the bloody fixer does. 
---
is this some kind of joke? bloodied fixers/handmades are only good due stealth multipliers and these only work solo (or everyone in stealth, which does not happen) . without sneak 2.5x it's just a weak version of heavy weapon to be frank. 
---
my character is specced into bloodied/junky commando and on SBQ any magic heavy gun (I have multiple, junkies minigun or bloodied laser gatling with blocking armor to trigger the effect) melt SBQ in close range with me having 0 perks in heavy guns. if there are 2-3 players on SBQ using magic guns which have good FPS (needed for effect to trigger) and precision the boss can die in few minutes not even landing once.
---
You just have to find what sells. I have found plans(take workshops don't stay and wait for gritters or even run the defense quest at your level retaking is easier and can be done off grieves schedule.) always sell at highly reduced prices as do bobble heads/mags use the interactive maps and locator perks to find.
---
You will also find very obscure things sell a lot, so learn recipes and run dailies like tipsy taste test. 
---
If you are just looking for fast caps sell the weapons to vendors and get purified water makers(build camp on river/lake) and also sell to vendors. There is no reason to walk away from 1400 extra caps a day even at level 30.
---
It is. I use the drill on someone till they hit me back + I melt w my handmade + take their junk = lethal
---
The big game changers were adding more daily challenges. I think what was hurting was needing either nuclear winter or a level up to get the "5 daily challenges completed" which equal 2 x daily challenges and I had to pick either level up or nuclear winter. 
---
The XP bonus makes the 10,000 exp challenge easier to hit multiple times especially during major events. The double-daily bonus is nice if you're time constrained or want to avoid too much grind then you can typically knock out 5 daily challenges and get a level up if you complete a weekly challenge. Harder obviously in the second half of the board and need more of a grind in the last 1/3.
---
Guass rifle skin, namely clandestine to go with the rest.
---
If you get staggered while switching to another weapon, the current magazine ammo of the weapon you were switching to becomes the current magazine of the weapon you were trying to switch from.
---
It's just a bug. You won't be able to reload to this number again until you repeat the bug. Empty the magazine and try to reload and you'll be back at the normal number. You won't be able to manually reload until you're below normal magazine maximum.
---
The heavies are the best.
---
Why's that?
---
Give me an example of fps RPG, where you can interact with thousands of items and objects in the large open world + dungeons. Only teso comes in mind, but alas, it was made by primary studio, so its more polished. Appalachia best world they ever created, in terms of visuals and overall filling. Id say they aiming too high with their goals, compared to their oblivious lack of man power (wtb testers)
---
I agree somewhat but not entirely. The game should not wait for everyone to finish loading, set it to wait maybe 30 seconds for everyone and then go.
---
Are they I've never seen or used one that's magic then.
---
If you got a spare drill I‚Äôd be interested in some drill v drill battles
---
You start with 7 total (1 in each - level 1) and then get 49 points from leveling up (to level 50), for a total of 56.
---
Captainoob on youtube melted the SQB with a B2525 Handmade in under 45 seconds I think, you get 3 people who know what there doing shes gonna get melted fast.
---
I made this post almost a month ago. Charleston and then Watoga!

The grind is real!

But don't let those high levels seem intimidating!
---
Miniguns, gat laser/plasma and lmgs all have high rate of fire, which is a big factor.
---
Oh thanks
---
Shit really? Damn
---
Hopefully some day soon
---
I've killed the queen in under 30 seconds with a bugged minigun on a private server with some friends.  Berserkers limb damage minigun.  Berserkers.....and I was wearing PA.  Actual bullets were doing one damage each, and I never even had to reload.
---
It's no bloodied fixer though let me tell you!!  LMAO.
---
This is a bug that was introduced with Wastelanders. It didn't used to be this way. Make a bug report, Bethesda isn't cruising Reddit to gather bug reports. They made a system for that.
---
Phew! Glad I found this thread, I nearly scripped one! Cheers
---
You think it looks good on the legs?
---
Yup
---
I back this comment
---
Ha I'm a tight bastard at best. I was thinking of waiting until after todays reset to see if theres anything worth while in the atom shop before spending
---
The only joke is you talking as if you know what you are talking about.  I have several magic weapons and none of them "melt" sbq. Only using gauss minigun can I melt her but not even as fast as a bloody fixer can.
---
There are plenty of YT vids showcasing it...
---
Yep, some pistols are coded to be automatic in ways that the perks don't interface with. The Gamma Gun is one of them. It will always be treated as a semi-auto.
---
Not gonna lie....my Berry Mentats are running through my character like Reeses Pieces in real life for me because I keep using it for the int boost during daily challenges. I usually finish everything until the part I have to see the NPC for the reward and pop it in. I've gone through maybe 70+ Berry Mentats and I refuse to have an intervention about my berry mentat abuse. I typically tie it in with the Night Person Perk and go all in. 
---
I also use Daddy-O's but prefer the higher int just because.
---
But I thought you needed to use had to use vats for the magic effect to work. My heavy are useless in vats only get few shots off. Or are those few shots enough.l with magic heavys.
---
They are all useless perks
---
Yes they need these in major hubs, much like Wow. Where you can list a certain amount if items at a reserve price. You see an undercutting war for awhile until the market stabrlizes. 
---
Either all that or just make the items/prices veiwable without travelling, if it can tell me there are 30 weapons just tell me what ones. I would drop everything for a vampire guass rifle, but will never find one cause I just don't have the time to VISIT, until I'm sure I will get something.
---
Yep :( it doesn't boost your Sneak like it's supposed to. It just changes the appearance.
---
Beckley would actually make a great location for NW. As well as Harpers Ferry on the other side of the map.
---
Nah, vats for shotguns but non vats for everything else.
---
It's just that you need to hit the same body part around 5 times before the effect is triggered.
---
Instead of lethal it should actually repair one's camp, especially when a Scorchbeast comes along to crop dust it. When you kill it, pull out the Drill and start fixing every bacl to 100% so you don't see random health bars in your camp.
---
Chainsaws should gather wood when hitting a tree.
---
Things that scare me more than Deathclaws in F76:
---
Radants
---
Cave Crickets
---
Bloodbugs
---
Stigwings
---
Ticks
---
Yao guais
---
Mirelurk Kings
---
Sheepsquatch
---
Missing out SCORE from autocomplete bug (/s)
---
Commander Daguerre's headaches being contagious.
---
I still remember the glorious days of sniping Deathclaws with my anti-materiel rifle from a kilometer away, still afraid one could make it to me. It did not matter how high of a level you were, if you wearing power armor, or any other gear you had. If a Deathclaw ran at you, you ran the other way.
---
I dunno. I‚Äôve tried entire fights where I was in that wide open area just east of V9, and it‚Äôs hit or miss with landing when there‚Äôs enough room for six or more queens. And then I‚Äôve actually had her landing *on* the fence. It looks weird, yeah, but her physics box was able to be on it.
---
&gt; I've never seen or used one that's magic then.
---
Then you shouldn't be commenting here.
---
How do you play without marsupial and speed demon at least?! Its literally game changing!
---
As someone with BPD as well... The buy 1 get 20 is the best damn explanation I've seen regarding all my moods in one day haha
---
Ah right ill try get one lol I've probably had them and scrip them not knowing .
---
If it weren't such a pain in the neck to reload things into vending, it would be funny to just store the vending machine and then do the ? emote.
---
Run off and die or play as a team..  I'm not sure why you even commented unless you are a pushy type.  Remember it's a team game, not just about you.
---
dont give em ideas pls
---
"I have the powaaah!" --He-Man, probably when seeing that camp
---
Watch angryturtles latest video on YouTube. He's explained it all again with updated information.
---
That's some good advice, and it's ironic that you're not applying it to yourself. You don't always dictate where the team will go: it's a team game and you have to listen to the wants and needs of your teammates, it's not all about you
---
I just bought stuff at train station vendors
---
Daily at crater. Rocksy and Wren. For Wren GIVE the repaired radio tube. Option 3.
---
Daily Photo Op from Davenport at Overseeres House in Sutton. Choose to take pic of Foundation. GIVE pics to raider at crater watchtower instead of turning it in.
---
Give Mirelurk Meat ( Queen meat preferable as it is only 1 piece then) to raiders at Ohio River Adventures. Once a day.
---
Do Daily Settlers VITAL EQUIPMENT and if raiders have it, do not kill, but say pay me and you can keep it.
---
Help Raiders whenever random encounter found by killing whomever they fighting.
---
So I should use BOS paint then huh
---
You misunderstood the post.  I don't care if you are level 0 or 99, be a teammate.  Since the game was released on gamepads we have seen a flood of new players which is good, but the (stereotypical) mindset of run and gun applies.  To win you do need to kill players, but you also need to be tactical.
---
I've got magic shotguns just not the heavys the post was about magic weapons so I should be commenting.
---
It's too bad there aren't actual traits like in previous games to work as a counterpart to mutations even though mutations are supposed to be a similar substitute.  Just something that only works when you're not a mutated abomination.
---
I never particularly liked that many mutations seem way too powerful for their own good and don't even really have that many negatives.  It's nothing like traits where you actually had to work around your weakness, the toughest part about mutations is getting the right ones if you can't afford the serum.
---
It needs a solo mode, everyone for themselves, would make matches much quicker. But we get more health and AP to balance out the lack of support. Crit damage should scale.
---
I will thank you .
---
Good point and maybe I worded the comment towards new players unfairly, but it was meant to the pushy (me first) type.  Thanks.
---
Incredibly tedious and not how I want to play games at all. Going back to Skyrim and FO4 now, pretty much done with 76.
---
The grind for cosmetics is equal parts peer pressure, hysteria and psychological manipulation of primal human instincts.
---
There is still a couple of hundred hours of content in there for first time players but it's turned into everything I hate about games in the last 10 years since mobile gaming and its whorish "Log in every day for more useless points!11" mantra.
---
Weapons with a very fast fire rate (&gt;200) and certain legendary effects (like +50% limb damage) can trigger this "magic" damage. Certain guns like mini-guns that meet this criteria can melt the SBQ in seconds. However, to get it to work you need to hit the same body part without missing or hitting another location. Things like your framerate and server lag can affect it as well iirc.
---
It's a lot easier to see this bug with shotguns in VATs since all of the pellets are treated as separate shots and they hit the same location in rapid succession.
---
Very true. The fact that Deathclaws aren't even on anyone's major list of enemies you hope to avoid; Assaultrons suck, so do major gutsy and their pesky bullets along with mirelurk kings. I'm more afraid of a Yao Guai than a death claw really. 
---
I think the hard part of it is Deathclaws are so low level in the game and where you see them as a high level you can easily avoid fighting them upfront. Deathclaws are like Sentry Bots, big and evil looking but kind of a softy versus smaller mobs and you'd prefer fighting them over the smaller mobs. Going to white springs and fucking with a lvl 50 Sentry? No worries! Fucking with a lvl 24 Assaultron, not cool, even their lasers hurt at that level pretty badly.
---
First I thought a legendary module could give you a random legendary effect to a legendary you already have. For example you have a 2* legendary and then you use a legendary module on it you would get a 3* with a random 3rd legendary effect.
---
There is a room with ZAX that you have to be lvl 50 to access
---
To each their own.
---
What platform is this? On PS4 I came across two FAILED scorched earth today lmao
---
18 I think? I launched a nuke end game taking out all the squads but one guy whom i had to look for because he was naked and afraid of me. Lots of Ws on my behalf, only been carried a handful of times.
---
Right I see I thought they all had to be used in vats. Thank for the information.
---
As I was almost positive of. I personally feel that the ultracite lasers could use a buff, because right now, save for their fire rate, they have nothing going for them.
---
I got all except Carnivore and grounded
---
I'm sorry I was too specific?  What the fuck do you want from me here?  Again the fact stands that it's still possible to pull off this shit with just magic weapons when she's on the ground and if she lands fast enough after spawning they can still shred her quickly enough for no one else to earn a tag.
---
Wow... You seem like you dont want a discussion.  I often do, but we are seeing the (come here) spammed in almost every match now.  You seem to not understand the point of the post.  Maybe do some homework before commenting??  You seem to be the pushy type.
---
This was on PC. Sometimes I wish I bought console instead.

It took me i think 1 day. The astronaut one took me 2 days.

Yeah I an unyielding leg with it. Makes shotguns hilariously OP

Just remember we were all noobs once. Many of these noobs never even played a fallout game let alone 76. I just started a new toon(for fast leveling) and forgot how little I had. My MAIN can go in with my vamp shot and kill anything but I find myself trying to play the new toon and struggling for resources. These new guys have probably blown past the food cooking quest and ignored the fact they need this and other skills built up to succeed. This is why many are asking for handouts. Teach a man to fish....
---
WARFRAME
---
that is all :)
---
Feels like the scene for that TV show from the 80's: Tales from the Darkside....
---
No you didnt.  Definitely not in 30 seconds.  More likely is one of your friends killed it and you were just there leeching.
---
Grab that same weapon... and solo SBQ and see how wrong you are
---
Agreed.  You are the best of nuclear winter.
---
Wouldn't that be a bit "Boring"  üòÇüòÇ
---
I have a Junkies PA with gatling gun. I love this gun is so efficient (not op still good).
---
The basic skin and the black knight skin with ads has very similar view (2/3 of the screen covered).
---
So your options right now is 3rd person view or use a mod which remove weapon in ads mode.
---
I must be only one, I do a lot of damage but I don't melt her at all. I just get in close with blocker on and head shot her over and over with my magic quad double barrel.
---
Tremendously üòÇ
---
My first post was just informing you that it sounds like it's not magic weapons as they don't perform as well as you believe and instead sounds like hacked weapons based on the information given. 
---
You're the one who then pulled this out.
---
I'm so sorry about your pet.
---
I'll keep an eye out for the plan and if I find it I'll give it to you. (Am on ps4 too)
---
Are you going to have candles and things too, to make a little shrine ?
---
May as well.
---
Same here.  I enjoy players that actually want to play the game.
---
I have to agree, unlike the many downvotes. I have enough perks to decrease taken damage and i got 30% health. Unless you're using a legacy without a spin up like the laser rifle or tesla you're dead meat.
---
Yeah something like that near my crafting area have the picture and letters above it saying his name and stuff.
---
Frankly, out of the rest of the map, I think this would be one of the better choices. While there would be those annoying channels you‚Äôd fall into, it wouldn‚Äôt be as bad as the mire, where you can hardly see half the time, or the divide, with so many mountainous areas that players would struggle to find and fight each other.
---
The toxic valley (more than just the very edge of it, perhaps focusing on Grafton proper) and the ash heap (focusing on Welch, Lewisburg and Beckley) could also work, though those two could be somewhat boring due to the spare locations.
---
Goes both ways though.  I'd like to help them out, but they are gone to Morgantown before I can even get the right weapon.  Bye bye kiddos.
---
A glitch that's being exploited.
---
Know how to to do it? I found a guy with at least 15 of them in his base. I asked him and apparently has no idea how he got them.
---
"discriminated"... I just...blimey..
---
A lot of console players were saying Fo76 was optimised in PC that is why Xbox and PS has low fps. Well seeing the UI they optimised it for Console thats why no chat and there is a voice.
---
Good to know we can have chat. Now I can give some quick command to others like legendary here or 2 more ores etc.
---
I might start doing that.  Thanks.
---
Ohhh, should I report them?
---
I have dreams of a Deathclaw boss that is terrifying. And it will spawn level +68 Deathclaw minions, with chameleons in the mix wandering the wasteland.
---
WELCOME BACK THE TRUE WASTELAND ALPHA. BE AFRAID.

Maybe Bethesda will surprise us. ....sigh

Gamepass noob, but almost level 200 on PS4... I personally always feel bad when people try to give me things because I feel like I'm unintentionally being shady üòÖüòÖ
---
I do get a lot of low levels following me all over and spamming me with party requests on Playstation lately though
---
I'm responding to your replies: and what discussion can be had with an argument like yours? It does explain a lot about your post if you think that someone having a response that you don't agree with is "being pushy". If you'd like to assign some homework I'd be willing to see what you've got to teach me: from my end I'd ask you to learn that teamwork involves giving, not just taking. Sorry to hear that you're being annoyed by people who think you could be useful in-game
---
lol. so true!!
---
You are so cool. Hope your hormones settle down once your balls drop.
---
Yes.  You are correct.  I wouldn't care if they ran off to die if they'd stop spamming the emotes.  Common sense.
---
Not sure if that's much point. It's a quite simple thing and you don't need to go out of your way to do it or use any hacking tool. And they seem to be all over the place now. Probably best to save the reporting for the serious things like flying hackers. Doesn't seem like Bethesda has much capacity to deal with reports in the first place.
---
Is your argument seriously "An extremely specific bloodied build with a very specific weapon, full buffs and a full set of very specific gear can do it better so magic weapons aren't really a problem"
---
On Public, as others mentioned, Leader of the Pack, Uranium, Radiation Rumble are your most consistent shots. 
---
Outside that and not relying on a nuke, its still gonna be Wes Tek and White Spring Resort that seem to be the most consistent but random encounters are still a rarity.
---
A little background search first would have help them not to make such claims. Every online game has it for a good reason.
---
So how about add it in PTS and then they can check how well it is used.
---
These are meant to take up a large chunk of time. They both took me about a day of play respectively, so probably a couple of play sessions. I would suggest doing Beckett's first, his quest takes you to new locations
---
He only had one?  I‚Äôve seen 30+ in one base
---
That requires an actual build though.
---
Kudos! While it may be frustrating to try and find someone living in a busy during a match of nuclear winter, I can respect the people who manage to pull it off.
---
Good.
---
More SCORE dailies was the compensation. There were less before.
---
I mean... it would be nice if you didn‚Äôt have to pay for the item.
---
Also, yes, it probably should have skins. For free.
---
I wonder if the new questline will be sending us here. The spot is extremely hidden, and I only found it by bumping into a video on it.
---
Acid.
---
Would it be possible in the time limit???
---
buff of what?
---
I dont know, but it would be interesting to try it out.
---
I just rebuild periodically with different stuff. I have no assumptions that I'd be able to build a coherent camp using everything I've purchased from the atomic shop. You come by my camp you'll find yourself in a nice southern plantation house on the river one week and a red rocket/Slocum's Joe truck stop and cafe along the highway the next. You could land in a bunch of log cabins on the lake or some abandoned train cars strewn around a train yard.  
---
While I wholeheartedly agree more budget would be nice I'm enough of a fan of camp building that I just look at it as investments in future builds.
---
Had one single encounter with a Wendigo Colossus in the forest to the south where you do scorched queen. Learned first hand that even if you can get the colossus stuck and it stands there, the amount of bullets needed is insane. A lvl 100ish and a lvl 56 joined me after seeing this freak of creation and one of them had a mic and I could hear him saying "damn that guy (me) is crazy for trying to solo this fucker all I level are 44's to fire at it!". I was redoing my character and luckily had tons of ammo since i ran over to do the queen but the reward for a colossus is so underwhelming...cool fight but damn, will never want to repeat it again. 
---
For note, its extra creepy when you blow up his body post death only to see meat chunks of arms fly all over. It was a bit unsettling...
---
https://youtu.be/bzcqdVELkc0
---
You are right, "magic" heavies can't possibly do what I said.  Pretty sure this guy's friend was hiding in a bush with a fixer too, only logical explanation.
---
iirc, more score dailies were added so people could get in rank 100 without having to complete every single challenge every single day.
---
No my argument is you're a scrub that doesn't know what he's talking about. 
---
Came here to cry like a baby because you somehow couldn't fast travel fast enough after dropping a nuke to get there before she even spawns.
---
If you didnt get hits in... that's on you. Dont blame others for being in the game. Everyone has the same amount of time to fast travel while the nuke in mid air.
---
I suggest getting yourself one of these magic weapons and see for yourself how you dont melt her at all.
---
Now, I don‚Äôt disagree with you that deathclaws should be more scary. The only times I‚Äôve ever died to them are when I was screwing around without my power armor (and not sneaking, like a fool) or one time back in the beta when me and friend ended the first or second session by heading up to deathclaw island at level ten with next to no damage perks (I think we died... 10-15 times total? Especially when it learned how to swim). But... they‚Äôre always going to lose to scorchbeasts since they can be infected by the plague, and thus turned to its side.
---
I have the painting learned. Can put it in your camp if u like.....edit. Your PS4. Damn. U might already have it. Wall decor. First picture is a light house. Scroll right on it and it‚Äôs like the 5-6th painting in.
---
Thank god I didn‚Äôt decide to use that perk when I had my build redone a few months ago
---
As others said below, most people are just soloing. The main time you see people actually popping in as a group is during a queen hunt or the Encyptid Event. Honestly though, its still beats soloing as far as exp goes and I think that's the main benefit of it. 
---
Bethesda \*SHOULD\* change the options setting though where it should be perk bonus type and have a designation like "casual play" or "choose your own adventure" or "group event play" and not just apply shitty attributes based on perk selected. In fairness though, having inspiration and having someone share their inspiration perk card is more than welcome even if their off doing their own thing.
---
Meanwhile the guy that bought the card and took the pylons gets no drop, because someone cheeses it.
---
How would you put it in my camp if I own it?
---
Sure I'll game with ya send me your psn
---
Which is mmo, right? I can compare fallout 4 to fallout 76 then, in terms of polishment
---
but what benifit does junkies addictions give? Mutations the negatives are to offset the benefits of the mutation
---
Because if your in a team your team mates can build in your camp so u keep it I think. Put a fusion generator in my friends camp the other day
---
You know what is truly annoying? Scrolling through this subreddit and reading whinny posts like this. Stop littering.
---
Ok thx
---
Yes there was!!
---
Yes, i noticed that too and it's super annoying. And it is for sure not related to "people finishes them", because a lot of events are tied to fixed time frame. And othen i stay on server for a long time and no events are starting at all, but before last patch event cycle was like non stop event after event
---
I thought that a spinbox for each digit would be the best deal for consoles because, but mind tough that the last time I've laid hands on a game controller i was playing playstation 1. How does this native dialogs work on modern consoles?   
---
Anyway since i'm on PC, well, hell yeah, i would definitely want to just input the bloody price !
---
This guy explains the two-sided wallpaper glitch in this video: [https://youtu.be/GJshb9Qf8S8?t=226](https://youtu.be/GJshb9Qf8S8?t=226)
---
Ok can you add me psn is ImSkully1
---
Uuuu I also have a junkies explosive choo choo
---
This. Sweet Jesus more than anything this
---
Bethesda made Vault 51 (the lobby) a separate cell. Whereas every other battle royale has you load the map while waiting, fallout 76 has you wait in an entirely different cell
---
Yea thats nuts, never seen that one before. I've seen her land on the drop site v9 shelter that every one usually stands out, but it's only happened like twice.
---
Understand me please, im not saying that game in perfect condition, but stop saying that it not improved over a year. Like those YouTube scrubs who was milking hate wagon 1 year ago, doing exactly 10 min videos filling with ads (juicehead for example)
---
I fixed that twice and both time all went well,the girl was super happy and that was it.
---
Also marigold pavillion but those seem kinda slow
---
Idk man, it's not like you can force pvp upon someone, the level 8 player had to keep taking revenge or something.
---
The next map is likely to be Harpers Ferry, someone found maps while datamining a long time ago that even predicted Morgantown.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c07bbk/i\_found\_some\_interesting\_maps\_in\_the\_games\_files/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c07bbk/i_found_some_interesting_maps_in_the_games_files/)
---
I just don't think Watoga has what it takes.  While it's verticality wins out in the height department the number of accessible rooftops and rail tracks in morgantown far outshines it. That's not even forgetting that the rest of the map is just soooooooooooo flat and barren compared to all the hills, mountains and cliffs all covered in trees and bushes offered by the other maps.
---
I killed them after I found out there's no reward for fixing that protectron.
---
Did you try placing your camp? ;)
---
In all honesty, I have 3 fatman launchers because all 3 are 2 x shots with one of them having 25% faster reload rate. During the meat weak with Grahm it was fun one shot killing multiple  yao guais with the right perks. I also got spoiled from the Faschnachts which was basically a nukes for free hand-me event...
---
Personally I carry 2 at all time because they do get ruined faster than other weapons, not as bad as missile launchers but still bad and clear adds really fast during queen hunts.
---
It's heavy gun. There aren't any perks that would increase energy weapons damage.
---
I set up my vendors outside my house, but I have a sign inviting people in for free drinks.
---
There is so much they could do with NW.
---
I do not know if they are so slow on content as they do not have the player base to actually fill up all the possible variants they could, or intend to add to it.
---
Id like to see everything thats been mentioned already but i would like to at a 25 V 25 mode, I think it would be pretty epic trying to hold flatwoods until it is clear the area is lost then falling back to set up an impromptu defense up the road. Or having to try and hold the airport at morgantown etc etc.
---
How about a horde mode where all the players are on one team, and just mobs spawning everywhere, you have to hold you location etc. If you location falls you hopefully can make it to another defended location, last man standing wins.
---
I also think they should take advantage of the equipment and other things in the vault before the fight starts. If you go to the boxing ring, you get a slight melee boost, head to the reactor for electrical charge mutation, get on a exercise bike for increased stamina etc. Obviously you cant get all of the at the same time, but just a logical bump for the location.
---
Finally to cut down on the wait times make it so you can sign up for five rounds etc, when you die you head back to the vault so you have time to explore it properly, tweak your perk cards etc.
---
Boosh wookies asking for more hiding places, better add solid snake paper box üòÅ
---
From where are you playing (timezone)?
---
Late 30s guy from Germany here‚Ä¶
---
Yes with Seasons it‚Äôs very active with both new players and old players. There is also a large population of players that are *just* there for the challenges and would push you off of a bridge if you get in their way.
---
Unfortunately they haven‚Äôt really fixed the jankiness of the mode so be aware that this isn‚Äôt very polished
---
It's one of those items where when you need it, you need it.
---
I don't think so. People are probably just more focused on doing events, since it's often a daily to do some. Hence less idle Events on the map.
---
Wow, someone sure is sensitive aren't they.  Makes you wonder if you're just  that clueless or you REALLY don't want too much attention brought to the issue so you can keep abusing it.
---
How do you stay mutated and still get rid of rads?
---
Not gonna lie, gonna do this toward the finish line just because the legendary run is really an epic grind of sorts. I want to avoid the highest levels to avoid that much more grind...
---
Go from Grimm Reapers Sprint, if you are one shooting your enemies chances of you getting back your AP are high, invest in Gun-Fu to do more damage. And make sure you aim for the head in concentrated fire.
---
bloodied: nerd rage, ricochet. too bad serendipity doesn't work in PA. 
---
junkie's I totally overdid it with all the tank perk cards (born survivor, first aid, field surgeon). Not really any junkie specific perks.
---
both builds also have blocker, adamantium skeleton, fireproof, one man army and bullet shield all maxed out.
---
Long term solution: If you‚Äôre not in a hurry, save them till 1000 and wait for the Purveyor sale.
---
Pc sure has hacked weapons that can easily do that but it's not impossible to do legit even on consoles. A refined melee build can kill her in 2,3 swings or maybe even 1. Even my friend with his min maxed bloodied handmade can kill her in about 200 shots,he usually takes her down to 20% in 1 landing than let people finish her.
---
Yeah it's a heavy weapon. A few things to consider: the gun does not shoot in a straight line, or even shoot consistently. It's gonna randomly miss a lot. So try to use VATs with it, it makes it bearable
---
Old - unstable server + bugged weapon (specific perks)... :/
---
Starched genes
---
5!
---
And?  The fact that people with VERY specific builds, buffs and near perfectly rolled gear can accomplish something doesn't mean it's fine that Joe Bash Damage can run up with what should otherwise be a scrip fodder weapon and accomplish the same or better.
---
Ok I googled it to be sure.
---
There are ZERO YouTube vids of anyone soloing SBQ with a "magic" gun. Because its gonna be a 25 min video.
---
The one video where angry turtle is showing a magic weapon at SBQ isnt him soloing. There are other people there and I'm pretty sure he doesn't show it dying. I'd have to care enough to watch that video again, but I dont....
---
Because I already know....
---
No one is melting SBQ with magic weapons.
---
They do more damage then usually.. sure.. but this whole thing is just in your head.
---
I‚Äôm just saying that this is the only battle royale where you aren‚Äôt incentivized to actually kill anyone. 
---
You get way more do from surviving than killing. The only positive I see out of this is that technically ZAX‚Äôs program will eventually find a great overseer - one that avoids combat and lasts the longest by letting everyone else kill themself and refuses to kill anyone
---
you can just server hop and your CAMP will be there
---
This vid shows how if you need it : https://youtu.be/4Cnl261V624
---
They said it was to compensate for the auto-completion bug. But that's not really a fix tbh. You could still encounter the bug and have your extra challenges completed too lol
---
I agree with connection problem. I think bug happens when server sends daily/weekly score challenges and your client (game) accepts it wrong with autocomplete. That's the possible reason of autocomplete during visiting ATX or loading NW. When visiting ATX server sends ATX info and challenges aswell, but since you can't look at challenges, game makes them autocomplete. Same with NW. You load into NW, server sends NW mode data and challenges, game can't accept chalenges because of different gamemode and makes them autocomplete.
---
So I think the updated way to workaround autocomplete bug for now is: make sure your network connection is good (restart router, change IP if its dynamic), start the game after 15 minutes server resets, do not visit atom shop, start adventure mode, even if someone took your camp place stay in this world untill game recieves challenges list, Praise The Atom (or Mothman or anyone/anything its your choice)!
---
For the love of god no make it an ingame item
---
A couple tips... remove doors in order to be able to remove doorways. Remove upper floors in reverse order you placed them. Build all your floors and then all your walls, both stories, before adding stairs and upper floors, otherwise the walls may not attach. And do roofs last.
---
There is a video on bloodied melee with buffs (food, chem, bobblehead) doing crazy dmg they can take it down with 2-3 swings.
---
There are magic heavy (ffr) guns which can trigger huge damage.
---
Only common sense that if you can do so much damage so fast just let others tag it before you take it down. Like wait for mutation.
---
Imagine you doing the silo run (not using the laser grid trick) for like 25mins and then some else taking down SBQ in 2 seconds deny xp event rewards from everyone. Not cool.
---
100% agree.
---
Im always delighted when the circle isnt going over the dense area of morgantown.
---
Dirty water from rivers is much faster if you spam the collect button as you are collecting water.
---
It feels weird and too goofy for me even for an Fallout game.
---
Find a stream and spam the collect button.  Can't really get it quickly from a pump, which is annoying, but that's how it do.
---
I have an instigating explosive black powder rifle that does over 2k damage per shot... I'd say it's still op even without legendary modifiers base damage is 1k with crit headshot
---
That was my first random encounter. I couldn't help her at first, but found a fusion core in a nearby building. I was so happy I could help her out until it exploded ü•∫
---
I think 5 in a solo win,and maybe 7 or 8 in the only nuke i ever launched.
---
You play a match with a group of people. That means that you are all going to finish your match at about the same time and requeue at about the same time. It's not that they intend to put us back together, just a side effect of being on the same time group. I tend to be matched with the same group unless I have a bad start, go out early and immediately requeue (at which point I end up with a different repeat group). It's not so much intentional as coincidental. Because of the match size, you'd need more than 100 people in your same server geography queuing within a 3 minute window just to get a chance at a mostly different group (and even then, you would still expect about half of the players to be repeat from the last match).
---
I never get a legendary kill on the SBQ event. Some of the trash in the radiation zone but never the queen herself.
---
Whatever. There was less before and now we'll get almost all the way without even completing the dailies. There really isn't much to complain about now unless you want to complain about the whole system.
---
I don't even bother changing my files to do NW and I still cought up to the green ship.
---
34, 1 nuke took out 20 haha
---
It could be the prime receiver for the Gatling gun, not Gatling laser
---
Fallout 3 was my first experience and i  avoided any area with them until i discovered the beauty that was the dart gun üòÅ but more than one at a time noooo way, i still would run or climb the nearest thing i could, pretty sure my character has a permanent hunched back from sneaking through the whole game üòÇ
---
Oh, I know all that, been building CAMPs since the BETA and learned a lot of that the hard way. I'm saying it's legit a bug that prevents me from removing anything in my camp that isn't a decoration. Tested it out multiple times, and no matter what I did - two foundations, a foundation with a stair and a floor up top, a foundation with a wall and a roof, whatever - the moment I connected that second piece, the whole thing was considered unreachable.
---
Stop defending that crap lol, im using j/33 Gatling lazer when bored, and its literally melting queens health, flying or landed, doesn't matter. Need to fix that
---
The Canadian flag of Fallout is already in the game, it is the USSA flag. The sooner they can accept that, the sooner they can go about being proper Americans.  
---
Mothmen need a bigger role, I want them to take over the Palace of the Winding Path. That place just needs something more interesting done with it.  
---
I sadly doubt they will do more pipe weapons, they are adding to the end game content, there is sadly less reason to add to the lower levels in a game you keep expanding.
---
The fucking ants are impossible to hit. You shoot them without cars and their hit box is too small. You shoot them in vats and vats doesn‚Äôt work because it‚Äôs saying you have 95% but somehow you‚Äôre always getting that 5% miss.
---
Add that to the list
---
I just need a jelly emote ;)
---
I‚Äôm Xbox and just realised. Check u may already have it. First pic is a light house in wall decor. Click right and there‚Äôs like 35 pictures in the tab
---
I stand in the doorway and block it. If they move to go around me I step across. They've taken the hint so far
---
Point 3. A lot of weapon needs skin. And hopefully not just temporarily available ones.
---
Soooo... People here are giving you tips and hints how to complete those 3 kills easily and all you do in e v e r y reply is complaining about other people stealing your kills etc etc etc
---
Everyone here is able to do it with ease. Takes a few minutes more sometimes but all in all I‚Äôd say you get your head out of your ass and play the game instead of whining here.
---
25 here on most the time but If I'm YouTube I'm most likely asleep üòÇ.send me your psn
---
Or just use a gamma gun you know
---
Thank you CTgamer. I‚Äôm an idiot - it was the plans for the Gatling plasma! Thank you!
---
AD VICTORIAM EVEN THO THE BROTHERHOOD IS SCUM
---
I‚Äôm pretty much only playing for the end run space themed items for my airship camp. They locked most of the actual space related rewards behind the final part which is weird because it‚Äôs supposed to be space themed
---
Yeah since the last patch this issue has happened. You can tell if you are in a broken server if the icon on the map is not a workshop icon but a light blue regular icon. Just server hop if you are gonna USE it.
---
You guys are all counting but there‚Äôs actually 6 of you
---
If you open eyes, you can watch queen health bar decaying like crazy, when he uses magic weapon. And im using one myself sometimes, just test it yourself.
---
I checked thx though
---
I'm creeping up on Rank 99, and I've won 3 matches without ever firing a shot, playing solo. I don't enjoy PVP so I exclusively hide in bushes, prefering to play as a pacifist.
---
Agree - acid is harder to come by / farm and is needed for gunpowder.
---
You can't have instigating and execution on the same weapon. And switching weapons in battle is usually not a good tactic.
---
It's like you didn't even watch that video before you declared victory lmao.
---
Watch the damage as he's shooting. Her health barely moves. Then a huge chunk goes.
---
It's his friend behind him that is doing the big damage lol.
---
Dummies on this game lol
---
I do not know how bad it is to fix.
---
But deer beth just introduce event wide xp and legendary loot so if someone decide to show up with glitched/hacked weapon they cannot grief.
---
Okay that makes sense, cheers
---
Hey man, if you took all the time it takes for that one simple button press every day for a month you'd have like an extra ten or fifteen seconds to play.
---
Okay cool thanks I'll try that. Might move my camp to make it easier
---
Not even marsupial??
---
You can get back on the same public server. Drop whatever your trying to move in a container away from high traffic areas to minimise it being discovered while you log out to swap characters. When you select your alt the scroll to Social rather than Play and tab to Recent to see the list of players you last played with. Select a player and go to Profile and (unless they've selected show as offline) then Join game. If I'm moving a high value item I like to take a note of 5 or 6 gamertags from the map before I log out. If your loot isn't there when you log back in it's been discovered or, if you're lucky, the player you joined swapped server (join another player from the original server to check. I note down gt's in case the recent list updates to the new server)
---
Cool thanks I didnt know it would work if I spam it, I assumed it would still only do what it can handle with the animations :)
---
I'd seriously consider to cancel 1st if another of those drops.
---
Okay cheers, as I do not have a mic I would not know if someone is communicating with me, all I see at times is the mic symbol when a player is talking and as I am a bloodied build I would not have perk cards to remove rads so when I have been kicked off a team it must be because of the first reason, thanks for clarifying that for me.
---
Now imagine if that was a Dragon? Haha
---
Agreed, but I'd still like the option to build a double or triple story over the whole surface of my build area, and to fill those floors with relevant stuff.
---
I have a few ideas already, but they'd require more budget. For example some of those ideas would require many more walls
---
So you have the plan but its not showing as "known"? If thats what you mean then it means you havent yet learned it. You can sell it if you want to but youd be pretty silly. Learn it. Once learned, fixers then enter the table for The Purveyor and you have a chance at getting legendary ones. if you ever get the plan again, then sell it
---
You can solo the SBQ with non legendary weapons and armor and using just the right cards. Capatainoob did a video on that one too lol. I solo the SBQ all the time on my private server with nothing other than a primed bloodied handmade. God tier rolls are only needed in PVP, shit I can solo the SBQ with an unarmed weapon and I'm a commando focused build.
---
Very creative build!
---
yes
---
If you're on PC you can turn it off in the ini.  
---
[General]  
---
bDisableSplash=1
---
From what I remember the animation looks like you only collect one.  If you hit the button ten times in a row real quick and check your inventory, you will have ten though.
---
I have the wastlanders water well purchased with bullion. you can drink from it then start to spam the collect button
---
Nop, I learned it dude, I am receiving fixers from.the purveyor also, I know ot for a long time but It is not showing as known, exactly as the signs and letters also
---
I‚Äôd save them until I maxed out then just stock up in legendary modules periodically
---
If you raid Morgantown highschool you can pull over 100 plastic every time plastic pumpkins and plates
---
Full SS UNY with buttressed and some perk will gives you 400+ dr which is more than enough.
---
UNY will gives you STR bonus a lot this benefits hugely for unarmed.
---
I am a bloody commando/sniper but my 1star bloodied power fist has more damage without any talent on it.
---
can't believe this shit
---
CUTE and wholesome!
---
But I wouldn‚Äôt want to have to rely solely on voice
---
I have an instigating explosive dragon it‚Äôs crazy dmg but breaks in like 4 shots haha
---
Sometimes the one near Solomon‚Äôs pond is a legendary. It is random though.
---
said from the beginning ban wave = fake news 
---
the only players bethesda will ban are the ones who bully other players calling them a homo
---
FO4/76 deathclaws are looking pretty good but their combat routines makes them easy targets. They stay still too often instead of going straight for the kill. 
---
In FO3 and NV, the deathclaws were insanely quick at jumping at you and slicing you and your armor up.
---
If they added an effect to give Unyielding a run for its money that would definitely change the leveling landscape.
---
Yeah
---
Mods don‚Äôt get anyone banned. Hacking scripts get people banned, and even that Bethesda doesn‚Äôt seem to do
---
Source: I‚Äôve used a plethora of mods since early launch including this one
---
So you think I'm inaccurate by stating that Magic Weapons perform less then what OP mentioned? That 3 people firing wildly while the queen while flying takes her down in seconds. Magic is good it isn't that good haha it's hacked weapons with modified numbers that kill her in seconds my friend. 
---
I agree Magic weapons need to be fixed but OP seemed to be mistaken between a Magic Weapon and a Hacked Weapon. They do play on PC so Hacked Weapons exist.
---
all your camp objects still render for other players. this is being addressed with the forthcoming instanced camps
---
Still shocked I even saw one
---
I think the TC is just trolling.
---
Like how many people have to tell him, he's wrong before he gets a clue.
---
This is awesome info, thanks for sharing!
---
Never owned a fixer, the game still works. You don't *need* to follow the herd.
---
Plans are used up when you learn them.
---
Why do people still play fallout 76, its terrible
---
Took me over 5 minutes and asking a friend to figure out 'Pianos' were stored in Chairs menu...
---
To bed
---
It‚Äôs actually better, as the chat has functionality for all players who have the mod, not just on your server, so you can find people looking to do trades or quests easier
---
Lead Deposit or Junk Deposit? Why don't take both? There is the place for the CAMP with double resource deposits you're looking for. The place is to the east from Black Bear Lodge.
---
I use the grey free states one, it‚Äôs the closest in colour, kinda blends in
---
Just to make sure...U have Animal friend 3 and wasteland whisperer 1 equipped?
---
I use communist propaganda flyers for cap transfers. They weigh 0, can actually be sold, and there's something deliciously ironic about using them for capitalism.
---
Gamma guns and radium rifles are best for bloodied builds without much radiation resistance. I for one, have contingency plans
---
i remember when i used to ask bethesda to fix things ahahah
---
I rolled I 50lb one but thought you need over 200fire rate and sold it just for 3k caps in my vendor and the guy who bought it was making endless heart emotions..so I was server hoping until I bought J33 one just for 1.5k caps but I can‚Äôt make it work like magic, maybe it‚Äôs low frame rate (PS4)?? I also have AA 50lb but it doesn‚Äôt work either..I even wear a blocker chest peace to supplement and still no magic. I see people melting SBQ with gatling lasers in 1-2 minutes but my magic weapons do no magic. Maybe I need to respec the build for heavy weapons?
---
Came across 2 level 91 glowing deathclaws together at one of the Whitesprings entrances last night and thought all my luck had come at once cos I only needed 2 more for the challenge... I got absolutely massacred 3 times and when I got back there the 4th time they'd disappeared - high level ones definitely aren't as easy. But I agree about the Level 21 ones - Deathclaw Island ones you may as well be able to kill with the Pro Snap they're that easy
---
Yeah you're right I just like the gun, and I'm pissed because now everyone will be one shot the Queen with explosive legacies that spawn dragons or whatever game breaking thing they have
---
Todd once said, during a preview of FO76 at the E3 reveal, that the game would have 16x the detail of their previous game. Lots of memes followed.
---
He probably meant texture details. But there are enough bugs to distract us from anything else.
---
I used a zealots 50 crit black powder at Scorched Earth. I build up crit with my lever then shoot SBQ in the face with the musket for around 1300 damage.
---
I personally wish there were more freedoms with PVP. That would make it very immersive for me. Hope they bring survival back bc I love the thrill you get knowing that there‚Äôs a risk, very realistic. It‚Äôs not that hard to take precautions against getting fucked anyway in FO76. The game pretty much spoon-feeds safety nets for the RPG community that don‚Äôt really PVP ever.
---
Unfortunately seems you were right. Really thought this ban wave has definite since it was huge on all platforms
---
Or Sun kissed it slowly gets rid of rads during the day and doesn't remove mutations
---
they *were*\* in the game (plural)
---
or
---
it *was* in the game (singular)
---
Train station would be nice. Crafter corner at the white spring should be a no brainer.
---
You're welcome Bethesda
---
It "offends you to your core"? 
---
Deathclaws being nowhere near the Wasteland Apex Predator they once were certainly underwhelms me, but I wouldn't say I'm "offended" by it.

Porn hub mobile?
---
If I wanted a grammar lesson I would ask. So I bid you to Take it to somebody who gives a damn
---
I'd like to have at least a bench that can scrap weapons and armor even if it didn't have any crafting functionality. Just to be able to scrap the 700 lbs of gear I pick up in various events and general scrap runs. Sure it would be nice to craft too but honestly I'd be satisfied with just scrapping.
---
This. Need to be leader to change team type, when 100% of other leaders I've seen do not. I literally have never been in a team where they're changing it dynamically, so gotta do it myself!
---
Regardless, you now know the correct way to structure your sentence.
---
Whether you give a damn or not.
---
"Like crazy" is not an accurate form of measurement. 
---
And it's not melting her. Definitely not in comparison to a gauss minigun.
---
I know I have several magic guns. I test it every day. I use them instead of the gauss to save ammo and to give others a chance to damage her.
---
You should open your eyes. He's not solo in that video and he doesn't kill it solo for sure.
---
Do us one better take your magic gun and solo SBQ. Let's see that 30 second kill.
---
Wont hold my breath waiting for that video.
---
Go to a workbench. If you can craft one then you know the plan.
---
yes, it is a chore. I'm going to the end but then I'll probably take a break
---
Also some of the same group of items aren't next to one another. Like the Steel walls
---
Also steel walls don't have a keypad door option like other walls
---
I've stopped doing it. I want the rad barrel so badly for my camp in Toxic Valley, but lately any time I try this event I'm the only one collecting ore, the last couple times 300+ players were camping the spawns so no one else could even get a tag. I know people were sick of new players begging but honestly the high level xp grinders are the ones making me play less.
---
Exactly what I mean
---
You can speed up collecting water at a pump by first taking a drink then spamming the collect button. This only works once per animation then you have to do it again if you want more water. You do risk disease using this method though. 
---
It's far easier to collect from a stream but that's not always an option especially if you live in the toxic Valley.
---
There used to be a trick where if you drank first and then quickly spammed the collect button you'd get loaded down with dirty water.
---
I came back to the game last week and that was the first thing I noticed that had been fixed. It's a shame they took time fixing something that actually improved QoL but Beth gonna Beth. ;p
---
Edit: Only now does it dawn on me that I could have abused this by stocking up and selling the water in bulk. I just enjoyed it as it made cooking less time consuming.
---
It‚Äôs one of my favorite events, because it‚Äôs so crazy.  I usually do stealth suit ore collecting, and take out mobs along the way.  When I notice there are multiple peeps collecting ore, I switch to defense. If I see one or more NPC health bars going down, I haul ass over there to see what‚Äôs going on and straighten that shit out. Flamer/Friendly Fire, etc.  
---
I don‚Äôt really care about the rewards, etc it‚Äôs the roller coaster experience I like.
---
I must admit I get irritated when there‚Äôs enough peeps yet the NPCs still die.  But hey, everyone‚Äôs gotta learn how it works, amirite?
---
Peace
---
You getting the animals as random encounters ? They must spawn alone too
---
Campfire tales has less than 10% chance of giving a badge. 
---
Challenges and the two dailies are your go to badge givers.
---
I know that I learned the plan, long time ago but I wanted to sell it, now I know it is destroyed after you learn it, ballz
---
Give me time and I will find a way to bush wookie. Bush wookie is love, bush wookie is life.
---
I saw one I was like holy crap then I died quickly due to loads of ferals rushing me and him just stomping me true story lol
---
Some, many, players don't care about others, XP farming. They may be in a team or a group of random players at an event, but they are actually playing solo and rush to complete everything as fast as possible so as to get to the next event.
---
Their two spawn points are Solomon's Pond &amp; by the Bog Town Workshop. Sometimes there can be several in Bog Town. They can be normal, crowned or legendary but they are frequently farmed for XP in public severs so don't be surprised if you don't see them that often.
---
Your adventure mode level has 0 to do with NW. Its a battle royale so everyone is on even footing.
---
Nuclear Winter have different leveling systems, but your SPECIAL is tied to your primary character's in Adventure. Once you're familiar with Fallout 76's combat system, then you can give NW a try. But it's entirely pvp skill based than perk based.
---
I was getting a little burnt out of my main (and only) character so I decided to start a new one with a completely different build. 
---
I wanted to make a melee/explosive (GL, ML and fat man) guy so I created the character, did a few quests and got it to lvl 10. Looked around for an explosive build and that's when I realised how bugged/bad explosive weapons are. And they have been in this state for a whole year ... anyway, I gave up on this character. I'll play on it again as soon as Bethesda fix those weapons in a few years or so.
---
Did you read the plan after buying it?
---
Sounds reasonable except Unyielding armor pretty much negates most stat penalties. We need balance changes that disrupt the bloodied+unyielding meta. Its too good at damage, stealth and QoL (max Charisma = more caps). I was kinda sad to find out Unyielding beat my Chameleon+Weightless armor in terms of stealth.
---
I‚Äôm not sure, but I always pop Armorer lvl 3 before doing any armor, perhaps check that?
---

Deathclaws in the lore are meant to be the most terrifying thing in the Wasteland. They where created pre war by the US to be sent into a location and rip everything to shreds. They are literally made to be unstoppable killers but even the giant plague ridden bats aren't scary in this game so I can't say I am surprised that they dropped ball AGAIN with Deathclaws
---
You read the plan right?  Maybe log out and log back in. Had no issues.
---
+1
---
I actually ran when I saw it lol he hit me once and I lost a chunk. Then came two glowing fog crawlers and he killed them both and came back for me
---
Or Solid Snake sneaky stealth skill based.
---
I bought a fixer to see why everyone is suddenly riding its dick. It's not worth the caps people are charging. Probably if you're a stealth and crit hit build. But overall, it's not the OP God weapon people are behaving like it is.
---
I'm on PS4 and can make this for you. Sending you a PM via PS in a few minutes.
---
Ok
---
Thank you for this it‚Äôs really helpful
---
Hmm I will try to look for them from now on but yeah the XP was good so it makes sense why this is my first time finding it.
---
Ants are the real threat in the high grass, you never see them, but they are at same time munchin on your ankles.
---
Also Rad Rats seem to be much tougher to kill than most other animals, not sure if that is just me or what.
---
fo4
---
Guess we'll see during the next dupe wave and see how many of these "final warning" players get hard banned
---
Thanks a lot üòç
---
I estimate it would take 8 players with magic weapons to kill her in 30 seconds when she hits the ground. (Based in doong it with 4 people already) 
---
Your complaint is that she's dying in the air.
---
That is 100% NOT from a magic weapon.. as others have said here(but you clearly suffer from selective reading disorder, common place on reddit)
---
You're wrong. Stop crying about nothing. No one person, or 3 is ruining the game for you with "magic" guns. 
---
People with builds better then OURS do own it but that's the reward they get for putting in the time to get the build right.
---
Maybe you should play socialist 76 instead. Where everyone is equil and boring AF.
---
You mean you bought a regular fixer or you got a legendary like a B2525 version? Because there's a huge difference
---
Not everyone was unbanned OP. Some people got a hard boot from the game, I assume the most prolific dupers. I personally wouldn't join in on the next dupe wave, but I never join in on them anyway lol
---
hells darkest places are reserved for you.  
---
also, congrats  
---
    
---
and burn!!

When I needed it, I would FT over to Overseer‚Äôs camp and hit the river there.  Spam collect, then waddle back to her camp and boil it.  Dump excess into stash.  üòâ
---
I have it.  My first gold purchases were the chem backpack mod, the ammo maker, then the full T-65 set and a few mods.  I just bought my first SS chest piece a couple of days ago, and I am going to grind for the full set.  My first chest piece was a 1\*, so I tried again and my second chest piece was a 3\* Zealots with -15% from Scorched, +1 Intelligence, and Reduces damage while blocking by 15%.
---
Oh I‚Äôm putting my money on nothing happening just like this one
---
Yes. All base game weapons can drop without knowing the plans.  Weapons added by dlc require you to know the plans though before they will drop.
---
Doesn't take long at all if you have most of the map unlocked and dont mind paying fast travel fees. Took a few hours for each. It's usually just fetch quest do becketts first his reward is better.
---
You only need plans for the fixer, sheep staff/club, shepards crook, bear arm, and the bullion weapons. All the games base weapons are available with no plan
---
Not everyone was unbanned from this last ban wave, so just don't get greedy and I guess we'll see
---
Yep of course!
---
I bought Armourer 3 and equipped it, and I still can't see it in my Armour crafting bench.
---
Most accounts that got a hard ban were the accounts used for the dups kind of like burner accounts. So if your main gets unbanned and you still have your duped kind of sucks
---
I've done all that, and still can't see it in the menu.
---
Yea I ran to but his first hit crippled me I was trying to use a stimpak and then got over run I'll be honest I shat myself he appeared out of mid air lmao
---
There's still people complaining they got hit in the trade subreddit, so not everyone had a burner account I guess lol
---
Not taking part now or in the future in duping or glitching to be honest. Breaks the game for me
---
You began a sentence with the word 'and'. Since you failed miserably at that, you owe me something to make up for it.
---
Does that make sense to you?
---
Weird. U 100% brought the actual under armour plan and not two mods for it. Check in the gold vendor it will say plan known if u did
---
I... cannot count how many modules I‚Äôve pissed away on exterminators and mutant slayers... hundreds at least. Although I do have three uny and two bolstering now, they are hardly god rolls...
---
Good work
---
Yeah if you bought a fixer with caps it‚Äôs probably not that good
---
I wasn't going to reply to this then i thought fuck it. OP here.
---
I play this game a lot. More consistently than any game I've ever played.
---
For someone that has things going off in their life, the legendary board proves difficult to keep up with. Full time job, wife, little kids, grown up kids, house and dog means that when i go on FO76, if i want to progress on the legendary board, the time HAS to be productive.
---
A single event takes between 5-10 mins. Logging into NW, doing the task and getting shot takes 15 mins. Killing 3 legendaries - unknown - did my best for 30 mins and found / killed one. Server hopping takes 2-3 mins between loads. Leveling up on a fresh new char about 10 mins.
---
My wife has the patience of an angel. Ill be down at 9pm to watch the film together my dear......or at least ill try.
---
Its 8.55 and I've only found a solitary legendary, server hopping produced Leader of the Pack swarming with people. Fuck it, its going off and i'm forfeiting those SCORE for today.
---
So why try keep up with the board? Why not just get what i get?
---
Because i know if i get each nights play right, I can do it.
---
Personally I dont care about anything that changes my characters appearance so 70% of the legendary board is useless to me. However I would like that fireplace door, any CAMP objects and extra atoms for the atom store so I can enjoy a little build time at weekends.
---
This is just my situation which i know doesn't suit the game anymore. Obviously others will have more time to plow into both play and challenges which is great for them and I see some have completed the board already.
---
Weird.  ü§î
---
I see that "toilet paper debt" thing for 30k caps regularly ... always make me chuckle.
---
For a Run
---
We need the broken new vegas deathclaws or at least my opinion. They to me were harder than. The other games then fo4 came out with some fun one the 76 just nerfed them to a radroach
---
You think they can manage to make a new UI with more than two options on it? Optimistic today aren‚Äôt we
---
Naahhhhh that's too much.
---
Two Shot has a 25% damage increase but has accuracy and recoil penalties, especially when hip/ Vats fired. Also has a negative affect on weapon degradation apparently.
---
If you were going going to run Mutations anyway because they're so damn good...there isn't really any downside to Mutants.
---
The game needs a lot of rebalancing (bloodied and berzerker come to mind) and removal of some useless effects.
---
Though as another user posted, a non-mutstion based damage buff would be a nice addition. You potentially give up a lot when not using mutations..so you should also have a equal gain in return. Possibly make it a third star that boosts damage by 25%. Either way, it would be cool as every positive should have a negative and every negative should have an associated positive.
---
Just a regular one. I wasn't aware of any legendary variants.
---
Duping has been around since the very first days of this game's life. It is what it is. There's hardly any economy in this game
---
I believe he's talking about the Mutant's legendary for armor, which is apparently supposed to have a buff of %5 per mutation you have(and also apparently doesn't work, per the OP).
---
ü§£ Wow, haven‚Äôt seen this one yet. Gotta keep an eye out for it
---
Buy 2\* legendary at the purveyor. May get something you like at your level and influence your build /weapon choice later. There will always be more scrip to get. Don't deny yourself some fun on the way to max level.
---
I run no mutations. There are two!!
---
When people talk it up, they're talking about legendary variants. It does the highest base damage on any auto rifle along with getting those built in bonuses and extra legendary effects. A bloodied or Junkie's can get pretty high and a B2525 is considered the best weapon in the game
---
Try minigun or Gatling lazer, . 50 cal kinda slow and PS have some fps problems as i remember
---
My Camp is near Solomon‚Äôs Pond and I visit Swan every day and blow his mind with my story‚Äôs from the wasteland
---
lol someone sounds butthurt
---
Serious question: Why bothering about level-ups at this level anyway? You should have all the perks you need by now, and I don't see anything else you could get that makes you stronger.
---
Wait until you see the Scorchbeasts
---
Ah. Where does a legendary. Fixer come from? I've never heard of such a thing. Or is that a duper thing?
---
This is 100% what it was, thank you.
---
Spend time with your family?
---
I just watched his video, happened to have a vampires bash damage minigun. Lets just say that mean old Mirelurk Queen cant hurt me anymore lol.
---
I believe the Modern Paintings plan is sold by one of the many vendors at the mall at the Whitespring.
---
The legendary ones are fun to fight. But yea they pack a good hit. Was fighting one a few days ago and my game glitches on me and give unlimited vats but then insta kills me and reloads me with an empty legendary and alot of amml gone. But the xp is nice lol
---
Except those douchenodes who put their anti-rad machines in doorways making visiting shops impossible without losing ya mutations.
---
Have fun with those prats
---
Great Idea. A wardrobe we could build and actually store in would be terrific. And then to blow our minds make outfits stored there weigh absolutley ZERO
---
Animation makes sense considering your model just raises the gun a little up next to your hip, and nowhere near your eyes
---
/s
---
Right... but it‚Äôs amazon web services... they a pretty top notch.
---
You have to know the plan and then they can *only* come from the Purveyor, so it's an extremely rare/sought after weapon. In addition to usually having awful rolls this makes it pretty difficult to find. However during the dupe wave it was one of the most duped items in the game. I was given a JE25 and a B2525, they're both pretty good
---
this was instantaneous drop from 80% health to 0%. I think I saw what you were talking about. The kill i saw earlier is different, it is something i legit have never seen.
---
I doesn't have fallout 1st or friends who willing to help me with that üò•. If you have eyes problems and cant see huge health spikes i cannot help you with that, have a nice day
---
That was my first thought too üò¥
---
^^ That's the answer right there. Scrip is plenty easy enough to get. Too much concern about meta and min/max and filling daily limits from folks and not enough just doing things because it's a game and it's fun.
---
If you are on pc and are just wanting the mod and not the plan, I have one in a vending machine for 250 caps.
---
That was my second thought after bed üòú
---
I mostly avoid interacting too much at the minute because of this, but I did have a super wholesome experience with a gamepass noob! He joined my public team and just wanted to do events, so messaged me to ask if we could go to events as they popped up. Had to avoid a couple as it was a low level server so no one was going to project paradise or rad rumble (no, I cannot solo them don't judge me) but we did a lot of events together over a few hours and I showed him some good farming spots, and introduced him to the purveyor.
---
Though I did laugh when he attempted to punch three charred feral ghouls to death and was promptly ripped apart.
---
No I am on PS4 and am looking for the plan so I never have to chase down a mod again.
---
If you didn't know yet, there's an insanely good location full of lead ores in the game. It's called the [Lucky hole mine](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Lucky_Hole_mine) and if you're using an excavator PA to collect these, you'll easily end up with 400+ ores. 
---
As others said, acid is a better choice. If you need copper, there's a workshop in the mire with 3 deposits. There's also a workshop with 3 acid deposits north west of the map.
---
Player vendor hub with multi server vendors, that would allow you to buy and sell items from all players in your gaming platform (sure could be made to work cross platform, but while making unrealistic wishes why not wish we had unicorns that we could ride in game).
---
These kinds of vendor hubs / trade houses have been suggested up to infinity and beyond, without a single response from Bugthesda. Top of the world or Whitesprings would both work really great at these.
---
Uninstalled only a few weeks ago to free up HDD space üòì

Encountered a similarly greedy piece of garbage today. I had done several things before logging out prior to this encounter. The first was Line in the Sand, where my cohorts and I made out with copious amounts of XP. After the event I gathered all the stuff from the bodies, ashes, meat piles, and goo puddles, then trudged through Fort Defiance gathering some much needed Ballistic Fiber, before taking it all to the 3rd floor and scrapping it down. I had around 1100 steel from applying the Scrapper perk to all the Scorched weapons from the event, 40 or so Ballistic Fiber, and a lot of other materials. So the final thing I did was waddle over to the nearby power substation and kill the deathclaw  to complete the 3 deathclaw kills Daily SCORE challenge. Then I logged out. 
---
So, later I log back and I spawn in at the power substation. The deathclaw comes at me and I cripple him with my explosive shotgun. It's at this moment my controller batteries die. I'm trying to grab some out of the TV remote so I can put this deathclaw down for good, and what do I see but some person in power armor standing near me. Well, this person makes no move to help with the deathclaw, and just watches as it recovers from its crippling and 2 shots me while I'm still working on getting batteries in my controller.  Then he riddles my body with minigun fire before I finally get my batteries in and respawn. Right as I respawn I see my brand new objective, "retrieve your dropped loot" pop up "Completed". Then the cowardly dick leaves the server because he didn't want to stick around overloaded with my metric fuckton of loot and have me confront his ass as he waddles away with it.
---
I would have shot this person a scathing message but I didn't catch his handle. I did notice that he was level 400 and something, well over twice my level. You really need to snatch junk off of someone's corpse at that level, man? If he'd just randomly messaged asking for materials, I would have given him some for free. I like sharing with those in need. But this really hurt because I'd combed through piles of flesh for 15 minutes and gathered up ammo bags for another 15. The game had started lagging a lot inside the fort so it was a struggle just to walk around picking up junk.
---
In lockdown, can run around the house I guess ü§™
---
Not really.  Just wondering why he was so hostile.
---
No one else is home atm üòû
---
Got the painting thx to Calliope_Sky. I never been apart of a greater community in my life!
---
 VATS glitches and you miss 8 shots
---
If all else fails, then yes ü§´
---
Indeed.
---
Mutants are the future, Charles.
---
Cheers for your help lol
---
I found it at the Welch Trainstation Vendor Bot. It‚Äôs properly named Plan: Dense Marine Armor Torso
---
Picks? What makes it the wrong side?
---
How about Charleston? It would be cool too
---
Excellent idea. I logged on yesterday to find my 4 month old deathclaw missing. No amount of server hopping brought her back. I'd love to be able to just reassign her to my camp. That and the robot think. An assaultron guarding a camp would be awesome.
---
Some players are already doing that, though ... I guess they have 30k caps but still want people to visit their camp.
---
I found that not too long ago also! Really cool. Makes me wonder what other places like that there are.
---
Wanna talk about a kick in the boys? I joined a team and someone launched a nuke. I had "I am become death" complete on me....
---
How many people actively read forums of games they hate?  Love and hate the game.  Sunk 100s of hours into it.  Hate the bugs and how little end game content there is.  Time gating also sucks , but the rest is pure joy.
---
LMAOOOO well I‚Äôll keep that in mind although I love hearing his voice cause of how badass it sounds. Just grinded all today just to get enough atoms to get him. Hahahah. üòÇ
---
Yea! There's a few tall buildings and a few buildings with holes. There is also new gad there with the dry lake bed that could be interesting to build a defensive structure on.
---
Well, other than which cards you will be able to equip since it's tied to your special.  A brand new character won't be able to equip more than the most basic cards.  Otherwise true, adventure mode level has no bearing on NW gameplay.
---
Yes, once you build his radio at your camp he will show up. He is 1 of 5 allies you can get
---
Myself.
---
They do, but it's rare now. Imagine if players had any incentive to do so ...
---
You cant see the guy behind him,  clearly. That's the huge spikes. 
---
If it was all from him and his gun the rate would be even the whole time yes? Its not like 1/10 bullets do massive damage. It's all the same across the board with the one gun. You dont get damage spikes from magic heavies.
---
And the health bar isnt going down as fast as it will with a gauss. Prime gauss will be even faster.... and the bloody fixers do it even faster.
---
This entire arguement is misguided by one cry baby that didnt get his lousy 1* weapon from one SBQ fight. 
---
Oehz noez gotta cry and spread misinformation on reddit asap and troll anyone that disagrees even though many people say how wrong the whole thing is.
---
Todd's Plan
---
BOS hood looks good, and so does medical goggles.
---
computer says no
---
I think you are getting downvoted because they already did add the pay to advance mechanic
---
The actual weapon plans: Crook, Staff, Club and to a much lesser extent, Shard
---
True ...
---
I'm making a heavy gunner build but now I'm realizing that one gun army messes with her, whats a good replacement for that perk? Oh I still don't have the perk but was going to get it.
---
The 2 vendor bots at Watoga. Prepare to server hop a lot though.
---
There used to be legendary drills afaik and a bloodied one with used to be pretty lethal.
---
The problem is they literally have not expanded on it at ALL since putting in the second map, almost a year ago. Other maps were leaked in the data and they‚Äôve basically not touched it since launch.
---
I used to not like the game so much, and I kind of hated it at release, but it gets better as time goes on
---
Its fun, but its also a frustrating mess at times.
---
When I first got the game at launch, it was glitchy and frankly boring I got to a point where I just got stuck (around the Rose questline).  Since the major update I am loving FO76 much more. Having the NPCs is much more reminiscent of the other Fallout games that I love. Once the legendary run was released and public teams was introduced, it sealed the deal for my love for this game. I never had anyone to play with, but public teams let my introverted self reach out in a really natural, organic way and helped me enter the community of (mostly) kind and helpful players.  I even made a couple of friends that I look for every time I log on!  
---
It was frustrating to start but now that I'm mid 90s it's MUCH more enjoyable. Im not constantly running from enemies. I can explore the map in relative comfort. 
---
I hope this helps!
---
I have one shotted people in power armor in pvp for 1k damage with a pipe bolt action lol.
---
it's not fixed it still works
---
Do you know if you don‚Äôt resubscribe to fallout first that you lose them?
---
Oh I found it in the Welch Station Vendor Bot
---
If you have an armor piece with 15% less damage taken while blocking. Any weapon, which can be magical, will be magical independent of the weapon's effect (excluding firerate dependencies)
---
Only shotguns require vats, heavy weapons don't.
---
Burning Babred plans are probably the rarest ones.  Burning is kinda rare but not as rare as burning barbed.
---
Not getting like 20 caps isn't that bad so I don't see the issue myself XD
---
More try-hards....
---
[there is a mystery going on](https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/g9onb1/new_mystery_in_appalachia_can_we_solve_it_together/)
---
I was playing yesterday and the same thing happened (I wasn't using a Gauss though). It happened with 3 or 4 Sbq and SB.
---
Yeah some one corrected me in didn't know but now I do thank you for letting me know anyway.
---
I‚Äôve heard someone else say it was at that vendor but never found it personally. I used to trade them as was quite lucky at finding them. Until the gifts got duped and dense plans were everywhere.
---
Not magic weapons, rather glitched or hacked items. Yes Bloodied builds can make short work of the Scorch Beast Queen, but I've now seen multiple times the boss killed in seconds. Simply the player turns up and immediately dispatches the queen. No exaggeration. Was one of the first people to write about this annoying exploit, but it's got decidedly worse in frequency and time the queen is killed.
---
LMFAO
---
Why I think it‚Äôs a good idea
---
I've seen 4 kinds so far, with pink, green, red, and orange eyes
---
This. Exactly this
---
I'm also mutation free until I figure out which ones I want
---
So then I might have been right then since now I noticed it only happens very little where he will talk actually
---
They should, like, spawn everyone onto the map in a glass tube. Then once everyone spawns in, have a countdown before opening the tubes and letting us go. Everyone out at the same time, Hunger Games style.
---
According to their 2020 roadmap, there at the end, will be "CAMP Shelters - Build Instanced Interiors" so that sounds like a way they will make the budget bigger by making them instanced.
---
Wait...you mean I could have found it in a player vendor? Hmmp
---
Military cap
---
I ususally just blow his mind out with bullets from my gun
---
There are new backpack skins coming you might like
---
I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre trying to say all this intelligent logic stuff. My point is purely emotion. I just want to put my walls on in the right direction so that my wallpaper goes on inside the house, not outside. Don‚Äôt they know it will ruin the wallpaper if you put it on outside?
---
Besides, it already takes a solid 30 seconds to render people‚Äôs houses, regardless of how big or small they are. Oh, or when I travel to someone‚Äôs camp they spawn me inside the side of a mountain, or once half way through the floor. I spawned with the floor through my chest once.  I could turn circles, but couldn‚Äôt move around or jump. The camp owner came over and watched me spinning around for a minute. Then I‚Äôm pretty sure he was T-bagging me by squatting on my head over and over. It was all so traumatizing.
---
I have 15 of them...the Encryptid grind is real.
---
Yeah if I can hit all 3 then it usually downs them but I don't use rifleman and if you miss then I mean they most likely have an automatic weapon and kill me before I reload
---
Powerfist or DCG... I loved my meathook, great weapon
---
Deathclaw gauntlet with iron fist and incisor I would imagine.
---
Unarmed still greatly outperforms 2H (and 1H obviously) but you may see better performance from a heavy or shotgun build. Running bloody unarmed right now, and it‚Äôs... well, exceptionally high risk, comparatively. 
---
That said, standard bloody build applies alongside unarmed perks. Your meathook build is probably just fine, but swap the gladiator cards for things like blocker, incisor, what have you for a touch more durability.
---
When I have a break from this game. I always seem to miss the skins for the tents. Im gutted. When I next have a break from this game, bet you they put a new skin up haha, just my luck.
---
Yup. One sentence and boom, a vivid example. I will give you an upvote!
---
I have a TSE black powder pistol that one shots most players and enemies
---
Well my gun is called ‚ÄûWasteland Story‚Äôs‚Äú ;)
---
You‚Äôd of got it cheaper but I‚Äôm actually looking for this plan for a new toon and found everyone but that.
---
Just to confirm they have patched out the gladiator perks working with the meat hook then? Seems the dcg seems the next best unarmed weapon then
---
ARGH! :D Thank you =) i dont follow such news, so i missed out the reference ;)
---
Let me guess you have no proof of this? In before "bro trust me lol"
---
lol. Yeah I got lucky. Never had to leave my private server. Gonna do a SS roll and purveyor roll just in case I am that lucky today
---
If anything he should be thankful for magic weapons. It's how most of my friends can have a chance to do enough damage sometimes.
---
But do we scream... nerf the fixer or HM.. no... we just see it as something to work towards.
---
The real inexcusable and insulting fact is this game has no end game content. SBQ does not make an end game. She's fluff at best. Can pop her every 10 mins. For all the trash gear you want.
---
And with all the other glitches and hacks and dupes going on. 
---
Magic guns arent even in the top 10 of major problems in this game.
---
At worst they are actually providing help to mid range players which isnt a bad thing to help keep a dead game alive.
---
I‚Äôm a stealth commando, non-bloody, but I drop into PA and swap to a Gatling for the event.  Use the juke box instead of instruments.  
---
Wastes time for full spawns and keeps my butt alive.  The only issue is someone one-shotting the legendaries.
---
Thats a very good idea indeed. Especially considering, with the companion items there is already a system like that included in the game. It could work like you explained it, and you just have to place (let's say) some raw meat club for the unlocked deathclaw, or a tree for the sloth. With that they would also have this item as a fix point in your camp (instead of the module) they are attached to. Probably would also fix the disappearing problems. I mean, my Beckett runs around a lot. But in the end he always finds his way back to his bar. If not by feet, then by teleport.
---
Yes, it has been patched out. Meathook only gets Iron Fist applied now. I‚Äôm running a powerfist because that‚Äôs just what I‚Äôve got, but yes a bloody DCG is likely the best bet.
---
The Starched Genes perk in Luck is mandatory for mutations - you won't lose them when using Radaway, decontamination showers, etc.
---
Funny, I‚Äôve found the raider style/mothman stuff the exact opposite.
---
I‚Äôd appreciate a rustic style scrapbox that would go anywhere.
---
Too fucking long
---
It's nothing wrong with my system. It's a bug I found out after much research, to do with the UWP deployment.
---
Apparently it works if you install it to C:\\, or delete a file every single system boot. Not prepared to do that.
---
The game is broken on Microsoft Store, would you want to buy a game you can't run? Unless of course you can spare 100GB ish on your system drive.
---
Also who cares if you or Microsoft think it is a 'review' or a 'moan'? Steam is superior because it does not censor its users. How can I review the game further than reporting an error if I can't get past the loading screen?
---
Think I‚Äôll do that just PA and go to high health. Stupid bloody event
---
I feel ya. And now that they basically did away with getting atoms in the game, as the measly amount the legendary run gives you is sad, you either buy them or do 1st. 
---
I also wish they would reduce the cost of bundles if you have part of it already.
---
What will I ever do? Some guy on reddit insulted me! And it was about puberty! Oh god, my life is over!
---
Yes, but it has been permanently screwed for a very long time now. At this point nothing they do short of a server wipe is going to fix that, and a server wipe would cause too many other problems. There is quite literally no way they can fix this anymore, they dug too deep a grave
---
This is good to know!
---
Thank you! BOS Hood only through the technical whatever quest?
---
Tbh I run around with a Bloodied swing speed Boxing glove and one hit most things ( beside queen or imposter sheepsquatch) . As long you got the right perk loadout for a bloodied melee/ unarmed melee build, the unarmed weapon doesn't matter at all.
---
You don't think that potential buyers should know the game doesn't work? 
---

---
Shhh the more easy challenges like this the easier we get through this sh*tty legendary run...
---
First roll on LL and RA were Unyielding for me... wasn‚Äôt anywhere near built for bloody, but I bloody am now. Had a full set in ~30 rolls total. 
---
Yes, I am aware I‚Äôm out of luck for the next 20 lifetimes. I‚Äôm okay with this.
---
Heh, I enjoy this event so much more when nobody else shows up. I cripple enough ghouls that they trickle into the barn at a rate that my terrible ass can handle while still protecting the jukebox.
---
Haha good one
---
There are a ton of decent places, just not all right next to a station, scrap pile or spawn. I must've moved CAMP about 30 times since launch.
---
There are instruments? I only saw a jukebox.
---
Wat?
---
I think I had that encounter but had the option to fix the Protectron myself, and when I did it was fine and they were happy.
---
I can make you one are you on PC?
---
I think that‚Äôs the problem with 98% who show up. There‚Äôs a room full!!!
---
I have been playing for 2 months and its really fun. However, they need to add some creative content, side quests, funny stories. For example, seasons is a clever way to make people to play the game everyday but we also need something different to grind everyday.
---
On the other hand, some bugs can be verry annoying and cause injustise by the players who exploit it. I want to believe some people in Bethesda are trying their best to solve these issues.
---
You will just see the creativity of the developers just by spotting some garden gnomes and toys all around Appalachia. I love this spirit. (Encryptid: roof of the shack, Galeria 2 tourist gnomes wearing sunglasses, Ohio River Adventures golf player jungles near river)
---
Duped b2525's... Gave a few away. Got banned. 2 weeks. Got unbanned. No warning or whatsoever. All items are still there. Feel like they should have taken away the duped items but okay *shrug*
---
I notice that when you go to examine the robot you can choose to fix it or sabotage it! I‚Äôve done both and it was really funny seeing how the scavenger was thanking me while the robot was attacking her lol (she never asked me for a fusion core though)
---
I didn't even know shard was a thing until I bought it from someones vending machine a few weeks ago.  I have gotten multiples of every other plan at this point, still have never gotten the shard plan
---
Wow. I‚Äôve just server hopped welch now and no luck for meüò≠
---
WHAT economy? all npc vendors magically refresh their caps over night. we find caps in mobs and containers. we get them out of thin air for completing tasks. a economy, as far i understand it, would be if the caps in the game would be finite resource, which we need to keep in motion to get any value from it. and then, its just a GAME currency, who really gives a whet F... about monopoly money?
---
Sad day. You could server hop to my private if you‚Äôre on PS4. I had luck. Maybe you will
---
How does it affect you? If you don‚Äôt partake you have nothing to worry about and if you do, then you roll the dice as to what will happen. 
---
I could care less what people do, as I have never cheated nor have I bought duped items. Part of it is because I could care less about what these people are duping as it is not my playing style and he main reason is I carry my values into the game with me and find that duping is just wrong. 
---
The only way it affects the economy is if you were looking to sell one or wanted one and are concerned if it‚Äôs authenticity. Other wise just do what you enjoy doing the game and have fun.
---
Trading systems are so bare bones and stupid thats is impossible to have a decent economy. Plans and ammunition have become so numerous its not a challenge.
---
They need to create events to encourage people to destroy these items and fix the economy. Also allowing larger server populations.
---
Judging from this description, I guess the bug that makes the events randomly end early isn't happening with everyone?
---
I guess you could read up on this one. Shows where plans are found and for event plans it normally shows the drop rate.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/g3dqwa/plan_and_mod_database_wastelanders_update_is_now/
---
Yeah, I'd take your low level with that buff over some level 100+ player who can't be bothered to share even a one-point card.   And honestly, that buff isn't all the important either.   I just want someone who will stay in the group so the stupid bond doesn't have to be reformed repeatedly.   That's where the big profit is at.
---
Same here - I'm our team 'crippler' - leave everything crawling while the others clean up üôÇ Quad explosive combat shotgun is the best thing to happen to me in this game!!
---
I think i got 4 once after finding an auto grenade launcher and wiped the team that left it behind
---
thank you
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs not bloody friendly, but you can solo it all day using a nothing special build as long as you can keep the JB working and mitigate the occasional ghoul slap.
---
You do not.
---
Aww thanks I have private and just checked there too. Lol thanks I might take you up on the offer if I don‚Äôt find it. This toon is obviously just unlucky. My other used to find them every time I looked.
---
Oh it happens to me as well. It's either ten minutes or 30. Most of the time ten.
---
Bloody hell. Do *any* of the rewards in the legendary run work like they should? I‚Äôm honestly expecting to find out the Sheepsquatch plush is highly flammable and will burn your camp down if placed too near a heat source.
---
It seems like fun but there are too many bugs and glitches
---
Or maybe people just disagreed with the idea. I know I do
---
There was a match I was in the other night -  I'd already sacrificed myself to the fire as I'd done what I was there to do, so my camera ended up locked onto a level 32 hiding underwater. It became obvious that the final few circles would be centred entirely on Grafton Lake.
---
There was another team of at least 3 people there and from what little I could make out they were going to have no choice but to get into the water and it seemed clear they couldn't find the final target when that time came and ended up coming a cropper to a scorchbeast by the sounds of things. Lake boy got himself the win and barely moved the whole time.
---
I only play NW for the daily SCORE challenge as I think the XP rewards are miserable for the time involved and so I feel my focusing on adventure mode is a better use of my time. I'm no expert at Battle Royale or PvP in general but I think it could do with a general XP boost across the board. 
---
It seems much more profitable to hide (we've all done it I suspect and I get exactly why people are doing it so I no way begrudge them that) rather than be aggressive. It's a funny old mode when the objective is to fight and win yet actively avoiding combat by any means generally ends up being the most efficient, albeit time consuming, way to gain XP.
---
It's not supposed to have that, it's a flat 10% damage buff which is working correctly. OP is suggesting bumping the damage to 5% per mutation with a max 25% damage buff
---
lol. Yeah go figure. I always wondered if the luck stat really has to do with finding things like rare plans.
---
During meat week they can be legendary (the cranberry bog primal cuts)
---
The game is a mess
---
MST is 8 Hours behind Germany.
---
12:00 Uhr mittags(12:45pm) (Germany) = 04:00 morgens (Mountain Standard Time)
---
I can give you a price/rarirty list for the asylum outfits if you need one
---
recently made a high health commando class. bloodied does smoke it, but adrenaline not working is extremely detrimental to that build. in bloodied adrenaline doesnt even matter.
---
What is ‚Äúmeat week‚Äù and when is it
---
You might be the first person I know to run mutations without maxed starches genes
---
I truly believe some toons are lucky. I have what I call a lucky low that gets fixers from the purveyor all the time. My high gets trash every time.
---
Yea thats true.
---
I hate when your whole team decided to spawn at one spot and one of the guys changes and is to stubborn to go where the team is. They always end up dead within 5 mins and it is just a waste of a teammate
---
Nah I rather them fix basic issues with NW before we get another map
---
Gotcha. The way OP worded it makes it sound like it's supposed to be +%5 per mutation.
---
Spoilers
---
Except Paladin Danse, now thats a synth i can get behind :3
---
I got some of the best weapons by roaming the ash heap, cranbury and mire
---
What are you on? I can help you build up what you lost if it‚Äôs on Xbox, I‚Äôve got a loaded scrapbox but I don‚Äôt build anything. Just repair armor, weapons, and make ammo
---
Whens the enclave going to make them hyper inteligent? I want goris back
---
Id just like some kind of different tattoos/makeups/hairstyles in the shop tbh its been awhile
---
Lmao. Damn. Maybe your lucky low should be trying to get the dense plan?
---
jesus fuck ive been doing it for 4 fucking hours and i‚Äôm halfway through
---
Leader of the pack is my favorite event for the 3 legendary enemies :)
---
Disagree, mutations offer incredibly powerful bonuses already. The mutants effect is giving you a bonus for something 99% of players are already using. It's not like junkies or bloodied.
---
 That being said I also wouldn't give a damn if they did buff it, game is easy enough to play without lego items so it really wouldn't matter.
---
As an aside Nate Purkeypile tweeted on Sunday that the cat featured in those paintings, Galen, passed away on Sunday.

---
needs nerfed. 
---
all bloodied needs nerfed
---
I‚Äôm banned üò≠üò≠Yes I foolishly duped but only a few things and I never had before so not sure why I still am. Hence why I‚Äôm not looking for plans I already knew. My new toon is not lucky at all.
---
To be honest Im more upset that I never got the double Score for atleast 90% of the missions I did during the weekend.
---
Gamepass noob spotted !!
---
I'd go with junk. You can farm a heap of lead in an hour or so by raiding gyms &amp; Lucky Hole. Never had a problem with acid stock either as so many baddies drop it on a consistent basis.
---
I think it starts somewhere next month; I'm having trouble finding the exact date but I thought it was the 18th.
---
A few times an hour (I think 4) the event 'primal cuts' starts in different locations around the map. There you'll have to kill the waves of enemies in a certain time. Some can be legendary. Upon succesfull completion, you get primal meat (quantity depending on difficulty level of the region the event is in).  
---
Every hour, on the hour, a BBQ event starts near the vault. Everybody can drop their primal meat and get scrip for it and do chores to complete the BBQ event (drumming, cooking, cleaning, gathering more meat, gathering veggies, ...). There are three ranks to complete the event in, the higher the rank, the better the rewards. Rewards are meat week specific things like a chef hats, chef outfits, tenderizer, meat week flag, ... If you complete it all the way to rank three, you'll get a legendary armor piece also.
---
Oh... that makes sense. Well the new toon needs to get more lucky! Maybe drink some whisky or something. lol
---
Oh I‚Äôve had that in the past but not recently no
---
Get off the fences/tents and stop staggering her mid air. If you have the queens attention and you're on a fence or tent she will either crop dust over and over or do one of those annoying quicky landings.
---
This has been proven already but people still do it.
---
I don't run mutations tbh.  I do fine without.
---
But marsupial is quite tempting and speed demon.
---
I think you can get some from the guided meditation event as a reward
---
I‚Äôd like them to actually do something with Watoga. I mean once the main quest is done there ain‚Äôt much else there.
---
Just to the current character you are or where playing.
---
If you are at the max cap limit you will lose the caps if you collect them. (Max cap limit is 30k caps)
---
once time only. You can leave them there until you need them. Like a bank
---
Ok thanks
---
Well if bethesda fixes the fight like they say they are, one gun army will be fine because we can break the queens wings again. For now it's best to avoid it.
---
Have you tried public teams? I made friends with someone through them a couple of weeks back &amp; we've been teaming up since.
---
Hehe she‚Äôs a little lucky. First sbq I did she got the ultracite hud plan that I originally traded my soul for. So hoping that‚Äôs a sign.
---
2 shot should be changed to the mighty effect from fallout 4(because it's not really 2 shot anymore) all creature specific weapons should be buffed to 50% ,stalker should be completely reworked/scrapped(maybe more sneak attack damage in vats) , suppressor also needs a Major buff or rework effects like instigating shouldn't drop on high rate of weapons like miniguns (already the case for quad,stop being lazy Bethesda) and that's just the primary effects lol
---
That would be awesome. Even if it was like a display bar where they could be hung up and seen in your camp. 
---
The clothes...not armor...cannot be modified so there is no extra characteristics that Bethesda would have to worry about. Similar to the junk and their reasoning for allowing it to be displayed, etc.
---
nice reference. have un upvote. I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôm on xbox. good luck, though :)
---
Wow that's sad
---
Someone already got me the painting thx though
---
She doesn‚Äôt ask it‚Äôs just an option to offer one.
---
Thanks :)
---
a few months back when I purchased the game I found deathclaw island.... the deathclaw was glitched, I shot it in the face with my lvl 10 sniper, 50 times, ran out of ammo changed to a pistol, killed it. 
---
i don't play the game anymore, i'm going to stop following this community after this comment
---
Bloodied seems the laziest build. It‚Äôs all about making sure you don‚Äôt have any risk or challenge in the game based on gear and not any skill.
---
For sure.
---
I've tried it but I'm a bit microphone shy and mostly the teams are just made for the bonuses and not really to play together
---
+1 for medical goggles - with the right outfit it's just like Princess Leia's bounty hunter disguise.
---
Since you know the plan you can sell your extras. They sell for 8 to 10k caps.
---
I've had some good drops as well around those areas
---
Are you serious right now? It affects me when you can kill a legendary enemy with one shot before anyone else could tag it? It‚Äôs been happening in every event for a while now. Yesterday had a guy kill the SBQ in a couple of shots while the rest of us were loading and trying to tag it and you end up with 10 people standing around confused and angry. And yeah now the prices of weapons are all over the place because of the dupping but you‚Äôre right, it doesn‚Äôt affect me.
---
Where did you see me talking about caps? I‚Äôm talking about the economy between players, trading and buying, selling gear and weapons. Seriously just read the post before you try to be a wiseass
---
Well it's high risk high reward. Especially melee builds as you got to get in their face and kill them before they get 1 hit on you.
---
The fact that shotguns without the bugged effects are the equivalent of hitting someone with a wet sock is inexcusable too. In game they are short range weapons, and I fucking expect a single blast to turn my target into fine red mist. The same thing a gentle pat on the back with a power fist or super sledge would have done..
---
Over exaggerating the effects and perks of legacies to prove a point. But seriously you can kil the SBQ with a couple of shots with these weapons
---
Oh ok! Well I didn‚Äôt have that option anyway... and I was carrying a lot of fusion cores lol
---
Marsupial and speed demon are loads of fun, although playing without them will make you a sad panda once you get used to it.
---
Nah, I'm good. I'm such a pack rat that I end up selling most of my junk anyway. I'm not hurting for any materials. It was more about the time wasted than anything else. I sincerely appreciate the offer, though!
---
I don't think I've ever seen that one pop up......Do you happen to know what part of the map it spawns in?........I've been jumping from base to base for the last 2 weeks trying to get rid of this dumb ass charisma stealer
---
It‚Äôs actually not. It‚Äôs about removing the challenge by raising your damage up so high you kill everything instantly. They all are the same. Marsupial and jet packs to avoid being hit.
---
This is a strange complaint
---
‚úãüòê
---
Well that's your opinion and I respect it but I don't agree with you.
---
I just ran Whitespring last night and came away with 17 HRFs. Focus on the golf club, the condos and the maintenance building, and loop around.
---
Right, and I figured it'd be nice for him to have a game he actually has to grind a bit. I completely missed the mark on that. He's not about that grind life.
---
High rad fluids drop MASSIVELY more commonly for me on PC from super mutants. When I was first nuking the assault areas for the wendigo colossus I managed to save up a stock of 70 from the two areas near the monorail/huntersville, as well as the SM that spawned at those encounters. 
---
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs anecdotal, but whenever I‚Äôm in a nuke zone and kill SM‚Äôs I‚Äôm guaranteed to get at least a few from them. They drop a lot more commonly than ghouls, which tend to drop glowing mass a lot more (makes sense)
---
I one shorted a level 90 glowing Deathclaw fighting one ant then pumped the rest of the clip in the ant, it doesn't die but kills me in one attack (I was still in caution) these ants are just out of control
---
What other reason is there for the bloodied builds? To be able to one shot kill just about everything in the game you can.
---
There ya go. Has to mean something. At least you didn‚Äôt get a explosive vent and nocturnal harpoon gun
---
Oh and nocturnal should be a flat 50% damage boost(has weird fluctuating damage currently)between 6pm and 6am and maybe remove the downside entirely
---
Making me want to find a vendor selling the juices now
---
it‚Äôs 14 or something quests
---
It's based on my experience , I'm modding Bethesda games for quite long time. Also abit of unreal based games too.
---
Sadly they removed fast travel carpets. It would fix a lot of issues.
---
Yeah houses appear in chunks to lower the resources usage. You can't just spawn whole house in 1 second. It would cause performance issues or lags.
---
well i guess i have something to do tonight
---
Id love to see a blast back stagger effect on impact hits
---
Ok that is usually what I do and I might get 1 if I am lucky. Get a few of both masses but fluids elude me.
---
Lol a nocturnal harpoon is a level up from a lead pipe. Yeah I will wait till I‚Äôve been to the purveyor a few times to see if she‚Äôs lucky.ü•≥
---
ok
---
Well if you play on xbox let me know, I'll give you a marsupial for free. The serums are easy/cheap to make, the recipes are just super expensive.
---
Bummer, the wasteland is full of pricks lol. I laugh 'cause that's what you'd expect but I'm bummed out that I wasn't there to get your back
---
You‚Äôre just having a run of bad luck. Sloths can still be tamed but not the one that fights the Yao. 
---
I use a map I found on YT to find the pet spawn location closest to my camp. It greatly increases to odds of the new pet reaching home. Good luck.
---
 I noticed.
---
I've been trying to get Diffuser plan more than anything for that tadpole shit.
---
No thats just not true 
---
With those ‚Äúmagic lmg‚Äù you can, but legacy have no effect to the queen, she‚Äôs explosion proof, all the queens I‚Äôve done post dupe took a decent amount of time 
---
Players having guns like that aren‚Äôt going to affect you in any way, with bloodied builds, fixer or not it‚Äôs a one shot to most of enemies
---
Ok thanks. Yeah cause ghouls are stingy when I do WS. Get masses but almost no fluids. Thanks. I will try that
---
Cheers
---
Personally not keen. I think it's an ammo sink for generally crappy rewards. 
---
Would be happier to farm Rad Rumble, Surface to Air, AWOL Armaments and Line in the sand all day though :)
---
But will watch thread to see if there is an uptake
---
This is not the solution cuz then you would get 5 10 guys just floating there tent and going afk at the queen all day long like fasnaut
---
Yeah that ones tough because so few people doing the event now. Everyone focused on grinding season points.
---
I saw this one too and was like "oh sure take this fusion core I dont want you to be sad pls fix robot" and robot was like "NO" and she was screaming "noo what have you done". Then BOOM. I felt awful for a solid 15 minutes afterwards.
---
I haven‚Äôt tested it but I think Giant is right.. no one took it I kept a close eye on it and I was the only one in the region
---
You may have used one and not known it. If you've used an Instigating, Junkie's, or Stalker's minigun (with the accelerated barrel mod) in the last \~6+ months, you've used a 'magic' weapon.
---
Ok thank you!
---
Nah bro, you gotta preserve them perfect Vault genes.
---
Usually the same is true for me. Last night seemed quite different, for some reason.
---
7
---
Really I've scriped loads of stalker mini guns. God damn it.
---
They could also add in special maps as events. Non Canon locations based on previous games in the franchise.
---
I can verify the mini gun can cause this mass damage scenario. I been playing since day 1 and I didn‚Äôt want to do bloodied and went PA/HW. I was on a never ending quest to find the best weapon and skill mix and stumbled on a 3* minigun (executioner, weightless and limb damage). For a while I noticed that there were times when I would mow through some enemies like they were grass. I always thought it was executioner and the damage perks I had that did this. So I set out to find that god roll of explosive/executioner and whatever and when I finally got it, it failed to live up and so by process of elimination it had to be limb damage. By sheer happenstance I had a Gatling laser with just limb damage and was able to repeat the melting effect. I do know that once, late at night and before there were private servers, I called the queen and melted her in such a manner that I took some serious static over it. So if you‚Äôve ever encountered me and I did this to you, I‚Äôm sorry. I still roll with this gun however these days I don‚Äôt engage the bosses until people can get a hit in or the mutation occurs. But I know other players that are not as considerate. So again, if I‚Äôve done this to you, sorry.
---
In one of Angry Turtle's videos show, IIRC, he does solo the SBQ and ends up finishing it off stupidly fast with a Stalker's faster firerate LMG. The only time I've successfully killed the SBQ solo was with that weapon.
---
You can run a bunch, if you get class freak 3 there‚Äôs really no downside. Marsupial, speed demon, herd mentality(if you play in groups a lot), and scaly skin are a must have for me but I also have talons and the other melee mutation for my unarmed build.
---
I'm yet to see this happen, and I can deal 43,000 melee damage
---
Ok thank you! I‚Äôll look for a lead deposit! How do I build an extractor?
---
So all the mutated players are mudbloods lol üòÇ
---
Yeah i mean its not even that big a deal i just got annoyed by the fact that there were two other powerplants free
---
At the moment, Instigating gatling plasma since it's magic.
---
Yeah I am using a Nocturnal Harpoon on a mule. Got it fletchetted
---
Okay thank you very much! I‚Äôve heard I should go for a Gatling gun? Any heavy weapons builds you recommend?
---
so much hate for bloodied. i am hurt.
---
For clarification i don't 1 shot kill everything. Sometimes it takes 2 or 3 shots
---
Looking at you Bloodied Gauss Shotgun.....stay in the corner till you have written your 10000 lines ' I will actually work in VATS when it shows 95%"'
---
That‚Äôs the truth there !
---
Does anyone know how long we have left to complete it?.......I'm only half way through myself
---
You've been playing Fallout 76 for over a year, I find it hard to believe this comment.
---
Okay thank you! Any tips of what perks I should invest in and which I shouldn‚Äôt?
---
Yeah xp is good from those as well but SBQ give fluxes as reward for finishing fight and don‚Äôt get those from others. Also only been on 2 successful Radiation rumble and they are fun but lately servers just feel too empty of higher levels to do these events. At least for now
---
What do you mean?
---
Bro don‚Äôt tell me it‚Äôs not true when I just witnessed it yesterday. Got the nuke warning. The event started, my team was already there, i was finishing, a daily. When I got there the queen was dead, my team hadn‚Äôt tagged it yet and ALL of the players I saw standing there were either using the confused or the thumbs down emote
---
Yeah I mean canonically it makes perfect sense, as SM‚Äôs are rad bois, and ghouls are glowing bois. 
---
No idea if it‚Äôs actually designed they drop more of one thing, but at least in my experience they drop a lot more of each respectively, even though they all have the chance to do so. 
---
Also for what it‚Äôs worth, scorched drop a hell of a lot more hardened mass on average too, but I don‚Äôt tend to farm that until I have the rest to craft immediately as it weighs too much to save üòÅ
---
It's that big temple in the upper middle portion, the event is one of those free fast travel ones so that nice. You just defend these points from ghouls for a while.
---
Why is it important to be on tents and fences?
---
That is good. Haven launched my own nukes yet but once I get a good feel for the silo I will and can‚Äôt probably do better at farming these things. Thanks
---
LOL
---
Or a ‚Äòget the fuck down to open ground‚Äô emote.
---
Hey random legendary question......Being lower level I have like 2 legendary weapons.....When it comes to the amount of stars they have my baton has 2 stars but it looks like it can have more somehow because it has empty stars showing next to those.......Can you get it higher than those 2 stars or am I just interpreting that wrong?
---
I literally told you how it happened M A G I C guns, not legacies
---
Very cool! How the heck did you get the 2 x 1 stairs inside the monorail though?
---
Two heads are better than two (on one body)!
---
Twice I have crashed (Xbox 1 X) after either I or someone else launched a Nuke and started the scorched earth event up... 1st time it happened I was on a public team so i was atleast able to try to rejoin the server (it was full) after about 5 minutes I was able to join only to be greeted by a black screen with the loading symbol in the bottom right frozen I gave up playing after that... had a full team and 4 lunch boxes going (what a waste) 2nd time it happened I was able to join right away with no issues after...
---
Makes sense on the scorch that was as eventually they turn to petrified corpses. Good observation i will have to try the SM. Is Huntsville the best place to get them? Cause I only have run into about 12 or so there when I have ran through
---
Is it hard for a level 30 to complete?
---
You'd be surprised at how laid back my playstyle is. I primarily just wander, scavenge random junk and just enjoy the scenery. I do very little meta grinding or legendary hunting. As far as gameplay grinding goes, I'm the epitome of a casual experience and I'm okay with that. I am far behind other players with my time in 76 and I'm not bothered by it. I treat 76 more like Fallout Minecraft.
---
Just to clarify, legacies are guns that were too powerful and so Bethesda removed their drops but if you had them you still keep them right?
---
Just have em equipped ? Did not notice any difference on rifles
---
Yeah I need to look into them more because I have no idea what any of them do besides the shitty ones I've caught and gotten rid of but the ones I've gotten had no good side to them
---
Yeah i thought of it the same way. But now i think they probably do it for the coming legendary perk system, where you get the higher perk cards for lvl points you get by scrapping cards you don't need. They just want to have as many points ready as possible when it goes online.
---
I always buy them as Instanced buildings will be here by winter and one day we may even get persistent workshops on the private servers. I hate that I missed out on the Nuka Cola door and other items I see in other people's camps. 
---
And I'm not going to spend the extra atoms on outfits, in case they bring out more plushies and possibly some of the bears or even Jangles.
---
So I go queen hit it for 50 rounds doing a lot of dmg someone shows up melts it in 0.5 sec no loot for me.
---
I go queen kill it got xp loot from queen no quest reward
---
These two bugs while not common they are not rare.
---
In my 3 month experience I see a lot of afk players, low lvls like 10 and a lot of high levels standing in top of their tent not making the SBQ better at all.
---
While I do not like the idea reward everyone it is still better than no reward for ones doing objectives (pylons in ISS).
---
So we need to handle this like they could fix these but they did not and it is still out there.
---
And now I am very keen on your proposal how to handle this. Because you did not mention a solution.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure that depends largely on the secondary effects of the magic weapons, also instigating isn‚Äôt that great for high fire rate weapons because you only get double damage for one shot. I‚Äôd go with that bloodied or junkies Gatling laser while I looked for better weapons
---
Once you have a set of Troubleshooter‚Äôs gear, it‚Äôs pretty much a cakewalk. Or stealth your way through.
---
Add in the shortcuts (both intentional and/or not), and you can spend more time waiting for launch prep to complete than getting to the launch room.
---
There‚Äôs a spot nearby you can drop a nuke that hits two assault encounter spots. It‚Äôs easily findable with a search on colossus spawn stuff, but it covers the monorail location, and you can get another encounter spot in as well as huntersville with good placement. 
---
That way you get the huntersville stuff as well as the frequent SM spawns at the encounter locations. 
---
It‚Äôs not a quick job, and when I do it I usually stay for a good hour or more farming each location as it respawns, but it‚Äôs definitely worth it considering high rad fluids are usually the limiting factor in crafting for most people, and it soon adds up.
---
Yes, legacies are things that aren‚Äôt obtainable atm 
---
Magic guns are something else, they‚Äôre bugged guns that do a high amount of damage for  reasons unknown, one of the best queen slayer is a Junkie ffr lmg, it consumes her health
---
I was in one with 3 others that were under level 10 after we went to West Tek, Huntersville, and the capital they all were leveling up fast. ( I let them tag the mobs then would finish them off) used a lot of stimpacks to revive them but it was fun helping out new players. I'd prefer to play on a team with lower levels even if we don't actually work together. This was the first time in a public team we all stuck together
---
That's a really good suggestion. Would make Mutant Armor on par with Vanguard and Mutant Weapons on par with junkies, if 10% per mutation up to 5, considering that like addictions, even with class freak, mutations have downsides.
---
That would allow more viable equipement pieces (for the sanity of aconomy and possibly diminish the need to dupe) and more viable builds (especially a real full health build), which is one of the reason why people need to dupe in the first place (although it won't avoid people to dupe)
---
But anyway, no need to speak about buffing anything as long as Unyielding is not nerfed/removed.
---
No, Instigating is a magic effect. I had an IE minigun that shredded enemies.
---
Lewisburg as well.
---
Thanks for that!
---
Marsupial and speed demon are a must have, marsupial makes you jump super high and increases carry weight for -1 intelligence, speed demon is faster walking, running, and reload speed but you get hungry and thirsty faster
---
All I want is an extra secret Macho Man Deathclaw that you get sweet loot from......But he's the only one you can find in a particular spot or mission and he's the ultimate Chad Deathclaw.........Also screw those damn ants and rats.......And extra screw that pansy ass SB
---
Or simply nerf Unyielding, which is way too overpowered, from a leveling and gameplay perspective.
---
You monster!!!!!
---
Alright my bad, I meant over powered weapons or magic as you say, that have been duped recently and make it damn hard for the rest of us to tag the legendary enemy in events etc.
---
What prices are you talking about? Nobody sells god rolls for caps, people still trade god rolls for god rolls only.
---
And the fast killing of strong legendaries happens because of the ‚Äûmagic effects‚Äú weapon glitch, not because of duped legacies which are much weaker than a ‚Äûmagic effect‚Äú weapon.
---
I joined a full public team yesterday and strange in numbers didn't activate for me, I think I've found your people
---
If your a PA user, bloodied builds are your friend. So go with the BGL
---
You have denied Grandma her special favours üëÄ
---
Even though its fire rate is under 200?
---
I refuse to have anyone tell me this game isn't metal:
---
https://youtu.be/0zarZ4VfxbM
---
I don‚Äôt think they were duped too much 
---
Legacy and fixers got duped to high hell thats for sure. But in you‚Äôre case you probably just came across a guy that happened to carry one
---
the forest is only Lvl 1 - 10 so a Level 21 Death claw to a Lvl 10 is pretty scary. I suppose when One Wasteland drops we'll all remember the old days when Deathclaw Island had Lvl 21 death claws we could punch to death.
---
I hate that it you are good at trading why would you need to grind 100s of hours for single weapon. That you cant even transfer to another character.
---
Adrenaline doesnt work?
---
So you‚Äôre saying that if the market gets flooded with duped legacies or magical weapons that won‚Äôt affect the prices or trades? And I didn‚Äôt know about magical weapons but someone down in the post just cleared that up for me
---
Soooo do your perks help fight the I'll effects at all cause I have enough trouble trying to figure out how to best manage my storage in the first place so I barely have room for extra food and drink items
---
I sometimes hop bc i see an other team has a member with a lot of stuff to sell. Or when someone has a better camp position in another team. Or bc of the team objective.
---
But yeah I might forget the marker, sorry about that.
---
Yep.  Just played around a bit more, it appears that when switching weapons you have to unequip and equip the mines again to get the faster reload.
---
I'll never forget the time I went to the Penitentiary half asleep doing a standard ammo run only to discover no muties present but instead a horde of over 30 Behemoths! So many packed in the courtyard they couldn't move!
---
I'm at work or I'd link the screenshot. Was my first time seeing them in game and I just thought the horde was an event or something.
---
So that's why i reloaded my handmade crazy fast, probably even faster than you would reload the assault rifle.
---
If you throw on the high speed barrel it is faster. Angry Turtle also showed that a weapon can be magic if it has a fire rate above 100, though 200+ is optimal.
---
That doesn't explain my Instigating flamer though.
---
I think if they're still working like this after next update they're official content. Enjoy. I am curious why people still get worked up by sbq. It's annoying to not get to loot, but come on. The drops are crap. We all know it. Until they redo the loot table you're not exactly missing out on much. I'm more interested in the treasury notes from the event at this point.
---
New questline?
---
About an hour n half of you have a bloodied build and about 3k caps for quick travelling and skip the boring empty dialogue
---
i‚Äôm happy i‚Äôm about to finish it after about 5 hours
---
Danke
---
Abso-fuckin-lutely
---
I‚Äôm not saying instigating can‚Äôt be a magic weapon I‚Äôm saying the second effect after the instigating part is what‚Äôs going to produce the magic effect. 33% vats 40% bash and a few others are kind of bugged secondary effects that make the enemies health jump way lower than it should
---
The market doesnt need to get flooded with magic effect weapons, they are shit rolls, everybody always had them. Nobody duped those because everybody expects bethesda to fix this bug.
---
And yes, there are more legacies offered than before the dupe incident, but nobody gives them away for anything less than before. Legacy for legacy. So nothing has changed.
---
Only the real money traders are affected from this, because they have a healthy competition on the rmt websites now.
---
Daguerre's questling takes about 2h 30m if you do the same as I suggested for Beckett. I done Daguerre's when I was level 35+ so took longer before I knew about bloodied builds
---
Rather it is or isn't, it should be more of a toy than anything.  Wouldn't recommend centering your build around a bugged weapon that is supposed to be getting patched with the next update.  Once patched,  instigating is a pretty "meh" roll for a heavy weapon.
---
Yeah watched vids and only thing I am concerned about is keeping the nil launching robots alive lol
---
Modders are going the developer's job for them
---
Nope. I was definitely the Instigating effect. My 1* Instigating flamer was the same way. Full health legendary SB, fire for one second and it's dead.
---
Imagine a deathclaw boss 3 times the size of a regular one, that actually took strategy to defeat...that gave every build an equal opportunity to defeat it.
---
Somewhere in the Watoga area where you had to drop into the trenches for cover or risk dying immediately.
---
Came across someone in Watoga that was tinkering with robots. Conversation went in a direction I wasn't expecting. 
---
By "tinkering" I mean...well....let's just say she likes robots a bit too much.
---
Yeah that is what limits me for sure. Ok thanks. As for waiting for them to replenish, you just leave for 10 minutes and then come back and they are there again?
---
Taking an already claimed power plant means you don't have to go through the boring and time consuming fixing quest. 
---
Did you lock the Fusion core generator. If not then it's free game. If you did then the intruder will gain a wanted status. I usually leave it unlocked as I use few cores and whether I get 3 or just the 1 makes little difference. I mostly do it for xp, something different than the endless cycle of events, and to kill time. 
---
He killed you in a pvp zone, nothing specifically wrong in that even if it stings. And he took the workshop...thats what seperates a pvp death from griefing. If he had killed you, not taken the workshop, then stealthed in the shadows awaiting your return to retrieve junk only to kill you again that's different.
---
I need friends for events and just showing me the ropes s little......I'm level 30 today and still trying to figure out everything like gold bullion and power armor pieces etc......Some things you just can't find when you try giving it a googs
---
Picked up a two shot Gatling plasma once.  The spread on the shots was horrendous, even for a two shot weapon. Plasma goes everywhere except for where you are aiming.  Would not recommend that one.
---
My Stalker's faster firerate minigun kills level 80 legendry scorchbeasts, as well as legendary sheepsquatch in about 40 rounds to the head (~1 second).
---
I'm still in the process of discovering workshops on my alt and yesterday I came upon the one near a power plant just north of the Top of the World and it looked unclaimed on the map.
---
There were a few resource extractors running but I just (wrongly) assumed they'd been abandoned by whoever held it last. I grabbed 40 wood, 12 fusion cores and 20 Uranium when the 'defend' notice came up. 
---
Only then did I notice a, rather pissed off level 128 zone in to defend his resources. For some reason my map still showed the workshop as unclaimed but trying to claim it did give me the 'already owned' message.
---
After the defend ended I dropped what I'd 'stole' near him but he vanished before my bag materialized.
---
SB isn‚Äôt really a tanky target, I can kill it in one second with my 1* bloodied .50 call. ‚ÄúMagic‚Äù weapons are what melt the SBQ in minutes.
---
I think it's designed to make people spend time playing to get/tame another pet...
---
Sounds fun
---
Todd... Todd never changes
---
I am not for bringing down the SBQ in 45 seconds, I being my TSE gatling gun to most fights but if I launch the nuke I am bringing my Bloodied Gauss Minigun.  You can't whine and cry if you didn't launch the nuke.  But then it is fun to watch a bunch of noobs running around shooting all their ammo in the air so I can melt it down with 5 minutes left on the clock.
---
Wow sounds crazy would love to see that
---
I suggest level 50 so you can have a good S.P.E.C.I.A.L set up but at the same time it really doesn't matter you can start whenever you feel like it
---
They can do anything though, like make it a low gravity event, or equip everyone with backpacks. It's not like they're aiming to make NW an esport anyways, so why not go full on and make it as fun as possible
---
I'm totally cool with all that , and am well aware . I'm just saying I take it easy on noobs. And I know they should know, but so many don't read that stuff when it pops up on screen.
---
Alright fine. The way I know that Instigating is magic is that when I'm firing, I see a sudden exponential increase in damage. All of a sudden, what ever I'm shooting at is dead. I refuse to use magic weapons on the queen since it's just cheating the system.
---
It's sad they don't counter attack but I can see issues game balance is terrible with op legacy weapons and builds meta like bloodied.
---
Tbh NW PvP is most balanced.
---
PvP in adventure mode = how much time you can spend = stronger
---
I‚Äôve had this event fail so many times lately. Like you said either every one is shooting and I‚Äôm the only one playing to summon or they one shot every legendary and no one gets a chance. Last event on Xbox we finally summoned it and I swear there was 4 to 5 guys with explosive lasers there so yeah def didn‚Äôt get to tag it at all
---
I'm level 82 as of today, so I don't know everything by far but I'm happy to teach all I know :)
---
Do a circuit around all locations, usually they respawn by time you get back if you don‚Äôt rush. There‚Äôs a few locations for flux inbetween so can grab a bit of that too I guess on the way. 
---
It‚Äôs not ideal and there‚Äôs a bit of dead time inbetween and it costs a lot of radaway/radshield, but I personally find it more enjoyable than WS, especially cuz you tend to get it to yourself rather than having to compete, and it is more reliable for fluids in my opinion anyway. 
---
Personally I‚Äôd drop all 3 nukes myself, one on the queen first, get the reward flux, then one on the assault encounter and one on whitespring or Morgantown depending what you wanna farm in regards to flux. 
---
With the camera glitch through the first door into the last area, you can run silos in like 6-7 minutes. Then you have a lot of places to go on downtime from spawns and a lot of diversity. I reckon you could stack a good pile of everything in a couple hours.
---
It's pretty clear it should be 10% per mutation, capping at 5x same as Junkie's does withe addictions.  But someone forgot to throw in the multiplier.
---
And do you know what some people call that mule? A food build
---
I think this is a great idea, but fortunately I'm use to it now
---
Since i have no idea where you are in the world i'll just say in 12 hours and 13 minutes from this comment. Same goes for other reputation dailies.
---
Turned up to kill a deathclaw and it was fighting an ant...
---
As others indicated, that was happening long before the duping that recently took place. Furthermore, other responders are correct in stating that those that have these duped weapons don‚Äôt trade them for caps lol. 
---
You can still get decent drop from events and the proveyor. It just takes time. So, no, in the end it doesn‚Äôt affect you and your cap prices since people don‚Äôt sell legendaries for caps lol.
---
Im British
---
There are a total of 22 plans you can get from free range. Mods like the heavy staff or poisoned are pretty rare, but the most desired mods are burning barbed or electrified. But honestly they all look awesome. Poisoned has worms crawling all over it.
---
I'd make it 8% per mutation up to 40% so that it's on par with junkies
---
Yeah. Mutations aren't nearly as difficult to manage as bloodied or junkies. Especially with the public groups to make strange in numbers amplified.
---
Frogs legs is easy to get now with overseer tickets!
---
That would be 1:00 AM for you then. If i didn't funk up the timezones.
---
Ah ok thanks ! I‚Äôll hit the coffee
---
Agreed, I want to collect them all, and having a separate container for outfits would be great.
---
Such an ignorant response. How do you know OP plays on PC? Magic weapons are a thing on all consoles, and hacked weapons are extremely rare to non existent on PC. I have over 1000 hours logged on just 1 character and have never seen a hacked weapon. In fact I've only heard reports of them here on reddit. Same with the buddies I play with
---
Idk why people think PC players just run around with hacked stuff, and the rest of us just act like it's not happening lol. 
---
Console plebs really think they have it better lol
---
The adds. I believe you still deal with ranges attacks, but you dont get swarmed at least.
---
Yes. i have also found SM and strangely enough, robots, yield HRF in blast zones more readily. Do have that instance when the ghouls are generous though, but that is far and between.
---
What does the description say?
---
I like flat without enemies. Don't care too much for water etc.
---
I've got my secret spot now that's about 50% flat and enough for me- that never sees any enemy spawns. Thank God. No random HP bars for my structures!
---
Cool idea. Nice to see more community style things going on in F76.
---
Hellz yeah......Are you Xbox by any chance?
---
The raider dailies **usually** alternate though.
---
We said we weren't mutated- we never said we could count ;)
---
I don‚Äôt think the economy is broke really. I can‚Äôt afford a lot of stuff and never see things cheap. Maybe it‚Äôs different because I‚Äôm on PS4, but yeh. I‚Äôm level 170ish and never had a legendary fixer yet. I just don‚Äôt see anything worth my time in CAMPs. I‚Äôm still after an instigating weightless lever action, and haven‚Äôt seen one yet.
---
Nice. Though I rolled an UNY/POW/SEN left arm on my very first try. :D
---
...though it's taken several months to finally scrip out all the subsequent trash I got.  
---
One thing I will say, perks aside, SS is freakin' good armor.
---
I've got a bloodied DCG and a bloodied PF, love them both, will never change builds.
---
Got them both via legendary drops.
---
I‚Äôve never really paid attention to robots but I can definitely see it being a thing. The SM thing is definitely real for me though. Even after taking more notice it stays consistent. 
---
Like you say you can definitely get a good/lucky run from ghouls, had it myself, but I‚Äôve also had 2-3 full runs of WS where I‚Äôve not gotten a single one. I‚Äôve never got zero from a super mutant farm, even though they tend to be a lot less numerous in spawns overall.
---
I leave my marker for weeks. Typically it is for locations I may want to move my camp to in the future or something I want to explore further. I‚Äôm not going to remove it just because I‚Äôm on a team.
---
Pc sadly
---
Still, I can always give advice should you need it.
---
It might be a long shot but perhaps there's cross-play using the Xbox function on windows
---
I'm hanging out for an awesome atom line-up. Last time I got pumped and dropped a bunch of atoms was the Responders stuff ages ago.
---
Enough cabins and diners etc... Give us something cool... Heck even an 'Army' pack ahead of BoS would be cool- imagine all the APC's, tanks, barricades and a crashed vertibird!!!!!
---
Oh, they know how it works, they just don‚Äôt care. Just shoot everything in sight, NPCs and ore be damned.
---
Just to add a bit more data:
---
I'm running the game on a SSD and have encountered players already kitted out before me in NW.
---
In adventure mode I do feel my load screens can be quite lengthy.  I think my CPU is the 'weakest' link in my system.
---
Well.. Workshop are PvP areas. It even says so in the pop up when you start claiming one. If you want to play around with them, then be prepared to fight. As there are people who look for PvP. Also, there are better ways of getting fusion cores.
---
If you‚Äôre on PC, the Perk Loadout Manager mod has this feature built in.
---
Marine Dense and Trapper Dense don't exist on PS4;)
---
That game sounds pretty cool, I think I'll give it a try next weekend. Thanks!
---
They need to fix the hood before adding new stuff for it. Id like to match without having all my hair removed.
---
This is the first I am hearing of shard
---
I feel like that guy was like ‚ÄúI got 500 rounds and ima fucking use them‚Äù the entire time not realizing that you guys want her to land.
---
I have The other one active but ive still been able to di retirement plan
---
Don't leave the server while you are in your camp. The pet can disappear when you load into the server at your camp. Find a location nearby your camp, but outside of draw distance, to log out at. When you log back in, just walk to your camp. This and Pacifist mode are the key to keeping your pet for a long time.
---
Who cares, means less kills for them.
---
Gotta love fast travel to desktop!
---
If you want to stay full health pick up a couple addictions and use the junkies, if you are willing to run low on hp use bloodied. If you want to keep you character clean from addictions, pop formula p like crazy and use the 2 shot
---
Hey bro I don't know you but since starting this game on gamepads I've randomly met guys like you on my journey and I just want to say thank you for helping out......Even if it wasn't me personally I thank any higher level that helps me or other people......Iva had kind folks like yourself drop basic stuff to help a noob out and Everytime I emote a thumbs up as a thank you......I also try and get pictures in photomode with the awesome people I meet.......It seems this guy is trying to farm you but there are those of us who do take pride in legit grinding for cool stuff and not just getting it handed......I've only gotten one gun from a higher level and even though it's not a crazy op gun I've used it throughout my journey and it's helped tons......So now I also pay it forward and try to drop stuff for people......You guys are the real heros
---
I feel guilty when I join a team just to take a photo or put a bullet through Mad Dog Malone's skull for the 100th time (world's easiest event.... Ever....).
---
I reassure myself that I'm not giving that team false hope--Bethesda makes me do it for SCORE. I drop group and run away ashamed of my actions in using up a public group real quick.
---
It's not me. They made me do it.
---
... This is when I'm not buying 3x single bullets (which, unless it's 5.56 I leave in a bag down the road) to achieve the *other* SCORE challenge.
---
Atleast I don't mess peoples maps up!!! :)
---
Wait so how low of a level do you have to be for it to be a trap?.....I've been rewarded them a few times but never gotten to use them.......Do you get good stuff from them?
---
so long as you are in pacifist it shouldn't happen and during events its not supposed to 
---
now that doesn't mean a hand grenade thrown during a event won't go off a few secs after ending and trigger it or even a bullet
---
I simply run pacifist unless I'm going to pvp on purpose as it makes my day a lot less difficulty - like a lvl 10 one time got hit by the explosive effect and thought I was trying to kill him (was helping take down the ghouls that had him surrounded) and he started shooting at me - so I walked over and waved at him and used my mic to explain it was a accident and now hes on my friends list
---
I'm not sure of the time difference between the US Mountain time and your timezone, but if you're online in about 3.5 hours, you can look for Lamorak\_2000. I'm not a hardcore player, but I do what I can.
---
From the OP to all the other users comments the amount of ignorance in this thread is impressive.
---
 For console players, hacked weapons are so rare, i have a better chance of winning the lottery than coming across a player using one. 
---
For everyone else, 3 magic weapon users can easily melt the SBQs health bar even while she is in the air. All it takes is her to stay still for a sec so they can get the shots needed to activate the magic effect and then hear health bar will drop so fast she probably doesn't get to mutate. It happens all the time, console or PC.
---
Weird tip but you can avoid falling into the ground if you swim in the river that goes north through the forest
---
" with a build that obviously favours melee or knitting judging by the damage they put out "
---
LOL. .I immediately thought about some of the PA players i encounter in rad rumble. 
---
Do you also have back pain sometimes from all the carrying you have to do during events?

Log into server, search those places, if there is some other head piece DO NOT LOOT IT or you will be locked out of that spawn spot until you pick up 180 random items in the world.
---
EDIT: Just looted two of them couple days ago from Ranger District Office.
---
I forgot that you aren't allowed to have an unpopular opinion on reddit.
---
Your post said nothing, and this explained nothing. 
---
You trade 5.56 as caps or actual caps. God rolls for god rolls. 
---
Trading in this game is shit, and ifpeople want to skip the rng process, because fuck the rng in this game, then more power to them.
---
It's fucking crazy, it really feels sometimes that they don't have any clue whatsoever and just put random numbers. The train wagon takes quite a bit as well, same for that cage from the miner event. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad that the red rocket takes little...but I'm sick and tired in general of having to delete a bunch of stuff to put "x cool new item".
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Got ever plan and then some....
---
How do I know? Because I chose not to be ignorant and did some research and OPs past posts have stated they play on PC...
---
However the point being that you seemed to have glossed over is that OP thinks that 3 people with Magic Legendaries could melt a FLYING Queen before she lands for the first time. 
---
My point is that Magic Weapons are powerful but across hundreds of Queens using them and in parties with people using them and all specced out to maximise damage on them. Melting the Queen BEFORE she can land for the first time between 3 people is downright unrealistic. 
---
OP being on PC may have encountered a Hacked Weapon that CAN melt her in seconds. Or even at a stretch some people may have a new Godmode stacking glitch but that's a long shot. Either way it makes more sense then 3 perfect aiming Magic legendary players that can keep all three guns trained on the Queen while she flys about being staggered. (I could see this happening with PC aimbots but that again isn't the Magic Legendarys causing the issue solo)
---
As for the console plebs comment. I don't think console has it better we are rampant with problems too but explosive mini nuke 5mm. Gamma Miniguns and some of the others just don't exist on console. We also don't have to contend with flying aimbotting players in NW either. We have our problems but they certainly aren't as rampant as in PC. 
---
Bottom Line is that OP believes that only 3 people using Magics can melt the Queen before she lands and from a lot of experience, three just doesn't cut it. They will when she lands but in the air...nah
---
Seriously, what difference does it make?  I for one will leave my marker where it is, feel free to boot me if said marker irks you.
---
Yeah there should really just be more non mutated buffs. As it is right now it almost doesn‚Äôt make sense not to be mutated other than if you don‚Äôt like the idea of it as a RP gamer. 
---
The first 100 levels I ran without mutations. Now I can‚Äôt live without them sadly.
---
Hmmmmmm I'm gonna say no
---
Sounds like what EQOA did when they added Lycanthropy. They added a bunch of different lycan options and another subclass that let you ‚Äúhunt‚Äù them. If you chose a lycanthropy, the hunters could ‚Äúout‚Äù you, turning your character into the were version of whatever you chose. For example, my paladin was a lionwere. Gave tank buffs so it made sense. If I was in a more populated town near a hunter who wanted to be a butt, they could force me to change into the basic form and the guards would attack me so I had to run out of town and change back. 
---
Only problem I see with it in FO76 is that there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a huge anti-mutation sentiment in any of the storyline AND there‚Äôs no current way to tell if someone has a mutation outright unless they do something wonky. Besides, the Enclave sells the serums and the recipes so they, in theory, wouldn‚Äôt be the faction to be grumpy about that stuff. I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs more along the lines of the Brotherhood. 
---
On a side note related to the point from the last paragraph, it‚Äôd be so much cooler if there were physical changes with each mutation instead of just stat and physics changes... they definitely missed an opportunity there.
---
I remember doing one at about 9 am yesterday and then I was able to do it again at about 10pm. So I think it‚Äôs 12 hours instead of the standard 20 hours like vendor reset. Just my experience yesterday. Not a solid fact
---
This was vital equipment quest as well
---
I just can‚Äôt fathom how a level 120+ with an exploding lazer or plasma takes 10 shots to kill a ghoul. All fireworks and no damage. Are all their perks carry weight and fast travel and crafting???
---
They're likely referring to the Brotherhood of Steel based content that is on the roadmap for the future.
---
Oh but they do! üòÉ
---
"Change of plans, Tenno" \*Nuke everything\*
---
Hey now we aren't all greedy ungrateful Fortnite kids ya know.....lol......Some of us actually work for stuff........I think I annoy more higher levels by trying to do events with a baton or golf club smacking shit upside the head to complete it......lol......Any drop I've gotten from a high level was like an unexpected emote and once I did get items I thanked.......Some people are just greedy......
---
I‚Äôm just gonna hop out of this thread like the marsupial I am
---
Reputation dailies have fixed reset time, which happens every 24h at the same exact time. Next reset will be in 11h 55mins.
---
It's basically a throwing knife made with sheepsquatch quills.  Damage is not much different than a regular throwing knife, just more complicated to make.  Not that impressive but yeah, never knew it was a thing either.
---
Hopefully that would be awesome but yeah I'll take you up on that advice......Speaking of which what's the best way to explore the map going from lower level to high?
---
Naw it's easy and there's usually people doing it it on PC  anyway:-)
---
I'm not that hardcore either, I'm mostly into hoarding junk haha.
---
I'll probably be free in 3,5 hours the time difference should be about 8 hours with America.
---
Use True Hiker or the Food mod backpack from Foundation, I'm of the opinion anyone should run at least one or two weigth reduction perks, or you could get the Herbivore mutation, a melon farm in your CAMP and never worry about food/water again
---
I remember. My first TSE weapon was a level 35 TSE dragon. Back then that was my go-to for tough enemies. But then I found a nocturnal explosive gatling plasma and that changed pretty quickly lol
---
as a mutant, I like this idea, especially as one of my favourite weapons I've got has the mutant's effect
---
Agreed. But they better buff shotguns after they fix them. It will be the first time I will consider quitting if they don't, as the bug is the only thing that makes them viable. Bethesda in the past has nerfed things very lazily and I can see them taking the same approach.
---
at least the handmade has a fixed location inside big bend tunnel. i'm almost done unlocking the mods just from getting it from that spot. Lever Action and Gauss Rifle don't even have that, though.
---
Preach it!
---
I'd kill to be able to make marine combat helms so I could have one for each character, have only ever found one for sale.
---
My friends and I melt her in the air plenty, if she sits in the air and floats there for a minute or so its extremely easy to proc the magic effect and melt her, with just 3 people. Hell most of the time its just my buddy and I on a private server. Sure the fight might last a few minutes before she gets into a position, but after that it does only take about 30 seconds. But air or ground doesn't matter, unless she's super crazy high where range drop off takes effect.
---
Spawn in, light the flame, turn to your immediate right and go down towards the ‚Äúbridge‚Äù speaker. Kill 2-4 ghouls, go hidden. Maybe fight 2-4 more. Wait it out and hope no one else spawns in. Mobs stay away and you just sit there for 7 minutes. Event completes.
---
Wait a minute you can make donuts in this game?......I need to get my hands on that recipe
---
Well, if you want to take a look at my own loadout, I'll link it here.
---
Note that it is far from optimal, and I know some players will look at this and literally vomit, but it still works - with a Gatling Gun and a 50cal MG I can take on everything save a SBQ on my own and not have to worry about dying, and I can unlock any terminals/locks without swapping perks.
---
[My unoptimal loadout. ](https://i.imgur.com/Pp9sQPA.jpg)
---
I much prefer just exploring and finding new things than being an optimal one-hit killing machine, and this suits me just fine.
---
Same mother loving thing happened to me twice now. I‚Äôm also on Xbox one x. First one I was on team go down to start event. Get disconnected it says I try load back in team it does but that black loading screen and when I get back on event over. Then last night another launch this lobby had a bunch of 800+ players. But get down to it and disconnected again. This time I get back in pretty quick but queen had a quarter life left my gun is out but what‚Äôs that I can‚Äôt even freaking shoot then switch weapons it brings up that syringer and I notice it says I‚Äôm level one and can use any of my high level weapons. So I never got to tag her or anything. I‚Äôm so done with the server drops on me when a nuke is launched
---
Private servers mean I can literally set up all the power yards core generators along with anything else. I've had like 9 workshops of all kinds running for about a day one time. 
---
Peeps say 1st is a tad pay to win. When workshops get tipped and hawked by asshats it's hard to disagree 1st users don't get a distinct advantage in this regard.
---
I took one in public and bailed immediately just to tick the box. It wasnt even claimed but I just didn't wanna get smashed in 'PvP'.
---
And my axe!
---
Ok really my handmade but you get the point.
---
Fu's
---
You can add me if you want. My reddit name is my IGN. My sister and I always welcome new friends. Plus we usually have a public team either events or building. üôÇ
---
As far as I know the enemies scale with your own level, the best way to explore is to.. well just explore. Teleport to events you see pop up and complete the events that start randomly as you enter a location. Try to complete quests as they start or they'll really pile up haha. In my experience, so long as you don't enter the bottom right corner of the map you should be a-okay :)
---
My bloodied fixer out performs my gauss minigun on the Queen, reaching 467 damage per bullet, more with crits and head shots! I get enough damage for the loot after one magazine!
---
So the game wouldn't be broken if you installed it properly?
---
Thanks for clarifying my point.
---
u/Valseek can't stress how important it is for these bugs to be fixed, but please make sure the shotguns remain viable. It's bad enough having to deal with vats and gauss specific bugs with the gauss shotgun...
---
https://youtu.be/9mRX-MEPzhs
---
and please turn off sunkissed, radsponge and other rad reducing perks, concentrated fire(not everybody uses it), any weight reducing perks, night eyes, basicly anything that may collide with teammates builts.
---
everybody likes if you share Inspirational, Stranger in numbers, Night person or any damage perks like bloody mess
---
Flamingo units. The camp budget measurement system.
---
Your doing the lords work with this post
---
Run all of them. Seriously, with the way teams work their are no downsides to having everything. They're all op tbh.
---
It was like level 50 or 60 random. I stayed behind it
---
Clear the launch room of turrets and bots before starting launch prep. Then after you start launch prep, constantly patrol the perimeter, with a little extra focus on the lower left side (from the chief‚Äôs perspective). Keep an eye/ear on the progress bar/audio notifications. And as soon as the bar gets to about 95% full, head to the keycard spot and be ready to activate it immediately (just in case there‚Äôs a stealth unit in the AO trying to steal your nuke). Check for remaining security bots, and then go enter your code. 
---
*Then light that candle, General!!*
---
"If she sits in the air and floats there for a minute."
---
Haha this explains everything. It must be great if she decides to pause in the air for you to proc your magic legendaries. It's not like she's supposed to keep moving about. Haha this made me laugh. Your trying to justify her freezing midair with no mention of a cryo as normal behaviour. Enough to make a point that you can do what just got stated cannot be done. 
---
You are right though if she pauses in the air for a minute for you then yes ground or air doesn't matter üòÇ haha
---
Thanks, I'll definitely do that :)
---
You don't have to fix power plants for the fusion core processor to work. You can just build a fusion generator yourself and use it to power the processor. Last time i did this you had to build a connector between the processor and fusion generator for it to work. Don't know if this is necessary anymore.
---
HEAR HEAR!!
---
i like to role play my characters.  like i have a tavern owner.  he sells food and drinks to make money to adventure.
---
yes the game is repetitive as hell, but that is just statistics.  you grind mercilessly, you are gonna repeat a lot.
---
i was once a min / max'er, but that just makes me burn out quicker.
---
to each their own.
---
Some of them are only bad though
---
I would be fine with anything other than battle royale. I'd put my vote on the horde mode.
---
Edit: Fuckin Fornite kid going around downvoting. So lame (:
---
You do realize op doesnt mention her flying about right? Just says before she lands, and no I don't use cryo.  Who tf wastes their time with cryo? 
---
You obviously don't know how to play this game. The SBQ pauses in the air plenty juzt flapping her wings floating there. Its like you've never even foguth her before. 
---
Im starting to think you're a troll
---
Reallocate your points from Luck to another attribute, what do you currently have?
---
Wtf.....lol.......Why flamingo units?
---
I've been selling some weird ammo that I know I won't use like arrows and fusion cells. Somehow I even managed to get some cannonballs in my inventory. No idea where those came from. 
---
The rest of the bullets I have been hoarding because I wasn't completely decided on what type of weapon/build I was going to stick with. But, I think I've gotten that decided now, so I'll try selling bullets next.
---
To be fair that is a standard of Bethesda games, that's why 76 has seemed so lazy!
---
I do the same, my CAMP is just a little up-hill from his place. I'm actually starting to feel bad for him. He just wants to take a bath and I keep interrupting him.
---
workshops are a bit buggy at the moment i took over several recently that were displayed to me as unoccupied and suddenly an enraged player appears who defends his workshop and im suddenly in pvp ...
---
Ah..I‚Äôll have to try that some time.
---
New feature: Heart attacks
---
FYI it doesn't matter what door you use.
---
What's the problem exactly with (unshared) Concentrated Fire and Weight Reduction Perks? ü§î
---
That can't be.......I went to dolly sods trying to take a workbench to complete a challenge and as soon as I got there I got raped by a glowing level 75 Yao guai then respawned and got molested by some weird glowing lizard thing at like 50 something and I'm only level 30
---
While you can see an indicator on players near you if they have chat installed you obviously can't give quick commands to people that don't have the mod
---
Yeah I got all the water purifiers I can stuff in a small pond that's right next to a railroad vendor. I load up on water and run over there every time I'm passing through. It brings in a nice little bit, but it sure is satisfying when you get that little notification that somebody has bought something from you.
---
So, which guns are exactly considered magic now? I thought they fixed some with the seasonal patch. At least my jffr lmg stopped working that way.
---
Well you could nuke their tents... they have to respond and they possibly loose flux if they afk through a SBQ into the next
---
I can do this. Are you on now?
---
XP = Score
---
This happens to me even on PS4 and not sure why - aren't we all on the same console there?  
---
Edit: remembered Pro is a thing, could probably be why
---
Noiiice thanks
---
BioComm chest and Chem Fiend perk
---
Can someone explain the benefit of not opening the packs? I understand how the cards will be able to be scrapped in order to earn the currency needed for the legendary perks (at least how it worked on the first PTS, no idea if it‚Äôs been changed). 
---
What‚Äôs the difference if the cards are in a pack vs in your collection?
---
Alternatively, make a new character. One round (max. 2) of bushwookieing is enough to get from rank 0 to rank 1.
---
Also I'm trying to do the pioneer scouts stuff and it sucks worse than any other mission.....All just to get the bigger backpack.......It's bullshit
---
So when I first bought I had enough for chest and arms. With in two rolls I got 3 star unyielding for all of them. None have god rolls like weapon weight reduction but I took it. But those mother loving legs took so many god forsaken rolls to get them and still no weapon weight reduction but once I got them all I said screw it and I‚Äôm not rolling another one ever again. Lol guass mini best I got was anti armor and the two shot I‚Äôm done with that one too. First roll on shotgun I got 2 star bloodied only rolled one more time for a ghoul didn‚Äôt roll anymore. Plasma caster I have rolled just one and it‚Äôs assassin for a berserkers from purveyor. Gauss pistol I rolled junkies first try and didn‚Äôt roll anymore. I just use all my scrip now on 3 star ranges rolls from purveyor. Last week I got 3 bloodied weapons in a row including my bloodied fixer. I thought my luck with her has changed..... nope nothing but gammas and pipe pistols since.....
---
That‚Äôs exactly the problem though. If you don‚Äôt have the luck to get a good RNG weapon you trade or don‚Äôt realize it‚Äôs a good weapon till it‚Äôs gone because there‚Äôs no way to check in-game, then you‚Äôre out of luck. Game should reward us at at least somewhat based on the amount of time, caps being worth enough to purchase anything - assuming you have enough of them - at least ensures there is a way to obtain valuable items that isn‚Äôt just dependent on chance.
---
Some people like PvP. I myself enjoy it and will definitely go out of my way to engage in PvP with a player that is in their workshop zone. It‚Äôs one of the few things I can do to pass the time on this game and keep me from getting bored. If you don‚Äôt like PvP then don‚Äôt take workshops. Or take them simply for the challenges and only go into the workshop zone for short amounts of time. If you hang around then you‚Äôre a sitting duck.
---
I still can't even figure out how to make gardens in my base.......Wanna do a sick indoor garden so I can free up body space
---
It is one of my favorite games because there's nothing I've found that really compares to it. Just a constant war on huge worlds.
---
Where can you view the content roadmap?
---
This sounds like a whole lot of YOUR problem. No I'm not removing my marker. No I'm not going to get charisma to share a perk. No, I'm not selling things at the moment. 
---
I'm going to be polite, try to work as a team and share legendaries if possible. That's it.
---
Also, this sounds like it wouldn't be a problem if you didn't have a marker up on the map
---
While it doesn‚Äôt need to be instanced, you don‚Äôt have to use it. Seems like a pretty minor inconvenience if it means we can control our stash limit finally.
---
That is strange, however the enemies are scaled to the first player that enters the area. So maybe a higher level player has passed by before you arrived.
---
If there is an enemy scaling system i'd try top left to bottom right.
---
Starting from the top left and head to the bottom right.
---
If you want to powerlevel I'd suggest the radiation rumble event and just shoot 1 bullet in every enemy and let the rest of your team kill everything.

---
The Deathclaw Preservation Society approves this message.
---
Cheers, I was leaning towards that one because I‚Äôve had it forever so I‚Äôm sort of attached to it!
---
What kind of buff?
---
Oh okay youre right. We all have to assume that your freezing in the air bug happens to everyone all the time. That she doesn't fly about like normal for most people. 
---
I'm good friend you seem to be grasping at straws now. I honestly do not care about any of this. I actually just came into the thread to make an attempt at explaining that OP came across a Hacked Weapon and without the planets aligning for the queen to freeze midair for a minute straight. 3 Magic legendaries while she flying around just won't cut it due to how the Magic effect procs. 
---
I agree with OP that magics need addressing but they are not as powerful in the situation laid out as OP made them sound. Either that or before people come to Reddit to complain or cry about something they should be kind enough as to provide complete information on the situation that occurred to avoid confusion. 
---
Vague complaints and rants open the doors to confusion.
---
Tweet this to Bethesda and Fallout...I did...maybe it will generate some buzz
---
Thought the same! It‚Äôs such a cool room and is supposed to be the best view in the game - currently isn‚Äôt. Would be great to see it become more than just another mob spawn.
---
I don't understand? You can't remember which one is yours?
---
knitting builds? nice!
---
i only spam enforcer explo shotgun and let the radio play, xp is for everyone!
---
to those camping on the roof and one shotting the ghuls as they spawn: why even join this event? easier xp and treasury notes elsewhere...
---
No Todd, i would not buy it. But thx for asking.
---
I sure hope he finds my crappy camp and features it......lol
---
If on PS4 you are welcome to come to mine before I tear it down to move to my next build lol
---
I was defending one of the junk yards against scorched and I encountered a lvl one legendary scorched. I cant remember when I last saw a legendary scorched?
---
nah
---
Ash Heap is the least populated. The Forest? I never bother. They're all noob shops with NOTHING worth buying.
---
Whats the difference between hacked and magic weapons? I was under the impression that magic weapons were any weapon that does things it's not suppose to do?
---
What I'm even more annoyed about is having to be online for 6 hours to scour waste dump and deathclaw island to find 3 deathclaws that others didnt kill yet for the daily. There was constantly 2 people at both places while i was doing my session
---
Not sure because I'm not home but I still needed to level up 12 more times to get my build "done". I was going to move 3 agility stats to luck for one gun army meaning I would have enough for adrenaline, which I still need to get and two other perks for agility that would take 3 points each.
---
you can also use death tamboo or other musical weapons, hitting with them counts as playing music
---
Oh it's badass, but it's so jarring when it's dead quiet and suddenly his voice kicks in
---
There is the short storyline about the Free States hunting down and killing non-feral ghouls...
---
I fear crickets the most. 10/10 nightmare fuel
---
Unless it's for aesthetics purpose I say you usually dont need more than 6 of any given crop, in the case of an herbivore player maybe a 10-12 melon farm should be ok, as long as you always remember to equip green thumb whenever you harvest your crops it should more than enough to don't have any food issues while you play.
---
Time for me to get gamepass so I can get some help from you.
---
Nah I just stick mine out back
---
I‚Äôm talking about the consequences of this un ban wave on the economy ( the market where people sell, trade and buy from other players). That the arrival of players who had their accounts ban and now unbanned will have a negative effect on said economy. And I‚Äôve seen legacies ( or god tier weapons) being sold for caps, allot 120 k and huge numbers like this but it‚Äôs been happening even since I started playing 76 with the arrival of wastelanders.
---
I keep my old ones but rarely ever use them. I put them on display but the exploding dragon breaks fast. Still awesome looking guns tho.
---
Well, technically the original point of fallout was surviving in a rough landscape where there is little hope and even fewer resources, where everything everywhere is out to get you, and you alone must face off against the odds to save people. This game kind of defies it by design when you can't go ten feet without finding an ammo box or medical kit, and we end up just nuking ourselves out of boredom with our magical explosive guns
---
Speaking of events when is the wendigo boss event happening? Does anyone know a date? Sbq isn‚Äôt fun for me anymore üò≠
---
Long story but some people were messing around trying to figure out the budget and realized they could place exactly 500 flamingoes in a camp. So they then would remove flamingoes while adding every other camp item they owned to see how many flamingoes they would need to remove to place each item. Many being 1 flamingo, or .2% of the total budget. 
---
So each of the letters in OPs pic is 1 flamingo. Which is asinine cuz you can place the "components" or "ingredients" labels that use the same letters and they both only count as 1 FU. But if I were to spell them out manually they would cost 10 or 11 FUs
---
Have never seen that before.
---
Nah, but I'd a decontamination shower skin. Something with some dope LEDs in the arch.
---
They can only mutate once but her health can reset if she gets too far away or loses aggro for too long
---
I have not got into mutations yet either
---
Damn i wonder what the instanced interiors are......And am I reading that wrong or does it look like part of those updates is a Respec for your perks?
---
No, I hide my generators from public view because, y'know, they're generators.
---
Lol wtf are you even on about lad?
---
The queen isn't freezing in the air, she's literally hovering, floating, treading water, etc. She is flapping her wings while staying above ground but not actively flying all over the place. She does it literally all the time during her fight. Its part of her mechanics. Have you ever actually fought the queen?
---
And the op just said she died before she landed, no that she was flying over the nuke zone. Or fkying by dropping the poison cloud. The SBQ will pause for a second above everyone and hover while blasting her sonic boom attack, regular SBs do it as well. Its a very common part of their combat mechanics.
---
Which sound awesome. I've often fantasized about a game like that in the Dune universe or something similar to the Gone with the Blast wave webcomic. Can't wait to test it out and see if it's to my liking.
---
The weapon plans are the rarest. I don't think you get the actual mods to drop until you know how to make the related weapon, either. I recently found the shepherd's crook plan after doing the event probably a hundred times, and suddenly I'm getting a bunch of shepherd's crook mod plans I never learned before
---
There are so many throwing weapons in this game that I never use. It might be fun to play a day with nothing but throwing implements.
---
Sometimes. When I had my camp near twin lake by Solomon‚Äôs the Behemoth would sometimes spawn as a legendary. Which was convenient.
---
Fixing is why the majority of people go to the plants early game to get the plans, the core generator is a bonus if its free because of the pvp zone which is sometimes highly sought after (and sometimes not, I've claimed and randoms have turned up just for defence missions for the xp - no thieving even if unlocked, no pvp...not everyone is a griefer)
---
Damn that sucks cause those letters are super helpful to customization
---
If you are in stealth or in hiding long enough or too far away, she can forget someone is there, drop combat and reset. You need to try and keep her in combat. Same thing also happens with every other mob in game.
---
Basically a Magic Legendary is a weapon with certain effects (bash damage, vats hit chance etc check out YouTube just search Magic Weapons fo76) widely applied to Heavy Guns but some Shotguns share some benifits. 
---
When a weapon let say a Gat Laser has one of the Magic effects when fired continually at a single limb the damage is greatly maginified. A faster fire rate helps trigger the effect quicker and a minimum fire rate is needed to trigger it. 
---
A Hacked/Cheated weapon is a weapon that has been input into the game via some third party tool. Instead of being a bug it's downright cheated. Modified numbers, different outputs (Miniguns that fire Gamma rounds etc etc)
---
These hacked weapons are the real cause of several second queens and is a recognised problem. Magic Weapons are strong but due to the accuracy needed to trigger the effect certain situations make no sense when people complain about them.
---
And if they don‚Äôt do it again that‚Äôs fine. I enjoy thinking about what could be just as much as what will actually happen. 
---
If they ever do release an update like this, it seems like within the next year would be good timing lore-wise though. We are now supported by the gold standard economically so there‚Äôs actually a resource that‚Äôs backing the value of caps and Maxson‚Äôs BoS will finally make an appearance, which could mean we finally see a chapter that wants to cooperate with the wasteland. If that‚Äôs so they‚Äôd have the tech and power to create a trading hub at Atlas perhaps so they can afford to keep themselves financially supported as well as ensure that all the factions are dependent on the Brotherhood to keep caps flowing.
---
1) who cares 
---
2) they‚Äôll probably get nuked at some point anyway since not everyone nukes in the exact same spot
---
I can take out a behemoth with 4 shots from sneak. They're very underrated. I also don't think people realize they're considered rifles not heavy weapons for perks. I didn't realize that till I got one.
---
Got any more for trade?
---
You might be onto something. I‚Äôm always down for more lights.
---
What rad reduction perks besides sunkissed and radsponge? How do perks collide?
---
Thanks, went with the other!
---
I would cheerfully spectate this historic contest.
---
The Drilla in Manilla!

True I think that‚Äôs part of it. I won‚Äôt argue what it is or what it isn‚Äôt. I guess I should‚Äôve put in the OP that is was my view on the point of fallout. Kind of dumb to label the franchise in any way
---
I just wanna make it so that I can free up backpack space in my lil kids backpack I'm wearing.......Like every 2 sheds I loot I'm having to dump stuff in order to not be a slug
---
Oh yeah...
---
Someone claimed yesterday concentrated fire reduced weapon range. I can‚Äôt confirm or deny but I had never heard that before. 
---
I have no idea what could possibly be wrong with weight reduction perks lol
---
I mean I still had multiple vanilla playthroughs with 3/4 without almost any issues
---
My point exactly about being clear and concise. 
---
Freezing versus hovering. Both have extremely different meanings. Especially in Fallout 76 which is riddled with bugs haha.
---
I'll edit I brought up freezing but sitting in the air. Not hovering my mistake.
---
What's your gamertag?  I'm usually on after 5.
---
I just go hunting. I'll head to a less used area of the map, and just go kill ai, just like adventure mode. You can see others from farther than sniper range, and most won't follow you if you are out of range. They tend to have pretty good stuff, are good xp, and it mostly keeps you alive till top ten before you have to engage.
---
Did you place that skin from score rewards on your C.A.M.P. module?  If so this is a known bug.
---
Figured,  just something to check üòÅ  a thought tho,  are you making sure to be online before you open fo76?  As I said just a thought
---
Ohhh yeah you may be right because once I got there and tried to take the workbench there were already turrets everywhere so a higher level must have taken it originally then dipped and I showed up and got an unwanted sex change by those glowing bastards
---
It's very frustrating in the beginning because there's really no tutorial and you're just dumped in with everyone else. My psn is in these comments. If you start playing feel free to hit me up too. I'm usually playing something in the early evening. I'm on eastern time
---
Since I wan't going to grind over 100 instances of the repeatable, doublescore was much, much better. Even as an every day player.
---
Everything you are describing is in the original story. Go down to the ash heap and learn a bit about the American Dream and automation.
---
But you are correct race isn‚Äôt really addressed...
---
That sounds interesting, I need to do that quest line. I thought that with the events of the game being so close after the bombs fell, some of the racial tensions of pre-war like between white people and black people would carry over to the story more.
---
Any sort of game economy has been wrecked from the earliest days of this game. The biggest and most efficient dupe method was very early on and went unchecked for quite a long time. The only reason you're bow seeing a surge in the weapons and armor again is because the latest dupe method finally allowed ease of access to dupe those items. If the legendary fixer variants existed at launch, it would have been TSE fixers instead of the current meta ones. 
---
Getting upset over this is the equivalent of getting upset that other people in the world have more cereal than you do. Its pointless and dramatic.
---
Triple? Psshh
---
Quadruple exp weekend!!
---
Ah I see thank you.
---
I didn‚Äôt get the sense that race relations in 2077 were as big a deal....
---
Exactly.
---
Yeah, if I wanted to press buttons I'd spend my time playing video games...wait
---
Try the looking for group thing on xbox, found some really nice people there.
---
Check anything that looks medically. They tend to have an addictol or two.
---
Not really OP. I can hit over 2k damage per shot on most things with a bloodied auto fixer
---
A bloodied shotgun a day keeps the sexual delinquents away, is my motto
---
I haven‚Äôt used any of my ‚Äúmagic‚Äù weapons since pre wastelanders. But when I busted it out right before wastelanders, I could have downed the Queen in about 10 seconds (I didn‚Äôt, because the event had just started and there was only 1 other person there who wasn‚Äôt doing much; i gave him a chance to get some damage in for kill credit). All it took was a 5 second burst to get her to half health and legendary regeneration kicking in.
---
So I‚Äôm not sure what your expectation of magic weapons is, but they can absolutely murder her. 3 people? If their guns perform like mine did I‚Äôve no doubt you could take her down damn quick even in the air.
---
I put mine in a Windows with my two vending machines. In my baby character camp, I just stacked a couple of small ones behind a door in my crafting shack.
---
I speak Spanish, Catalan, English and German. Im sorry for not being flawless and making grammatical mistakes sometimes.
---
Everyone saying bloodied needs a nerf stay salty it's a glass cannon build. I can deal damage but can get killed easily especially my melee since there is a long distance to travel to the enemy and can easily get swarmed
---
Ya, I used to solo the queen in my privite server too. Last two times I did she did the same thing to me. Rage quit, went to sleep.
---
Wait that works?......Or is this a troll I walked right into?
---
I had my first partial auto complete yesterday. I disconnected on my first login last night.
---
Also, for those who don't know, you don't need anyone else on your public team to get the benefit.
---
More along the lines of the Brotherhood...and who is coming along in the next big expansion?
---
They lowered the server population a while ago to increase server stability
---
So you've not tested it since pre Wastelanders? Okay
---
My PA heavy junkies build shreds the queen in the air with just my minigun unprimed.  Its possible.
---
Nothing like if she was on the ground but I take chunks off in the air.
---
1. Standard mutation at 50%, actually pretty pointless as there seems to be no added effects unlike in FO4s mutations. Why not just give legendaries more health to begin with if not using the feature?
---
2. Flies off too far for too long. Rare but if you are running around a lot it can happen.
---
3. Loses her aggression. Generally because you're Stealthed too long and thus present no target. If the fight is a distance away from the spawn sight the she may well fly away or up high out of reach eventually reseting. 
---
4. You die. Often enemy health will reset, especially on the first death, if you are the sole combatant.
---
5. Bugs. It rare compared to many other issues but very occasionally I will duck behind cover for a rest and pop up to a full health/part healed enemy again. It as though the game clock goes awry and assume you have left the combat zone.
---
With the exception of 1. and maybe 4. they do happen rarely and so many not even be noticed by some players.
---
Currently flagged for the 4th, but we'll see.
---
Okay great I‚Äôll check it out. I‚Äôm still somewhat new and looking for things to do in the game. I‚Äôm more familiar with wastelander content. It‚Äôs kinda hard cause the game really points you in a lot of different directions
---
12ty, non mutants untie
---
Rotten luck with data itself doesn't help either, but I'm sure I'll have it when 2023 hits xD. At this point I should just look for someone to paint it for me instead I think, saves time.
---
I‚Äôm a non mutant too, brother. Genetic master race
---
Lmao what you can start a sentence with and. It‚Äôs not the end of the world. Read a book; authors do it all the time.
---
Cooldown?   (&lt; _ &lt;) (&gt; _ &gt;) 2 seconds. 
---
ü§´
---
noice
---
Thanks didn‚Äôt know that
---
Ohhhh didn't know that thank you!
---
Only if mutant slayers gets applied to anyone with a mutation!
---
I would like to day thankyou...  until this moment I never thought of the scorchbeasts as farting on me when they dive.... and now I can't stop....
---
Yes. I think those can be a case. I saw regen myself 1-2 times and there was similar situation as described
---
Well unfortunately I'm a squishy ass level 30 with a regular ass shitty and a golf club to my name...... Definitely not working on a level 75 rapebeast.....lol
---
It wont gain any more legendary effects or go up in stars. As far as I'm aware right now you can only get 3 star gear, but weapons like the fixer come with faster movement speed while sneaking effect
---
Haha, how dare you not know everything there is to know about the game? BTW you're not the only one, my from launch character is only level 140.
---
You can only have so many of a card.  If it is a 3/3 perk for example you can have 6 cards: 1/3, 2/3, 3/3. If you get a seventh card it currently disappears into infinity.  Once the legendary perk system is in play if you get a seventh card it will give you points towards buffing your legendary cards. It may not work exactly like this but it's all we have to go on u till it's ready to launch.  So most high level players are saving their card packs currently until that system comes out so they dont waste them.  Hope that helps.
---
I had a L80 1 star reset after every shot for about 15 shots last night.
---
shoot, regen to full.
---
shoot regen to full
---
shootregentofuckingfull
---
Same thing was happening to a L80 two star sheepsquatch. But it *only* regenned about half a dozen times.
---
I am so sick of this garbage. Im getting less and less interested in logging in precisely because of the mounting number of bugs. But this one easily tops the list. And by a long margin.
---
Yeah I still havnt gone to buy legendaries yet even though I have enough scrip......Don't know enough about how it works to chance getting something shitty especially at level 30......I'll be pissed if I waste it
---
No it does not
---
Double xp with teams was insane.  Hopefully they do it again before im done with my score run.
---
Should i take off tank killer?
---
That may be true but also it could be that fallout doesn‚Äôt want to directly tackle the issue. So, they just reframe it as the non-feral and human issue like the tenpenny tower quest in fo3.
---
I see, but as long as it's not shared it would trouble just me (it really didn't for 160 levels, but I am not even sure I ever played without...). ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Dude I do......I check every medbox or cabinet or desk or suitcase or dead body I find.....Havnt found one yet......Hell my whole game session yesterday was spent trying to level my score and fast traveling to base after base in each server to see if anyone was selling any......Once I find a steady supply I'm gonna start selling that shit......
---
I can't wait until I find that recipe cause I wanna label some funny shit on my camp
---
Can I cross this name off my list or what? Can I cross this name off my list or what? Can I cross this name off my list or what?
---
Because people tend not to like politics in their escapist video games:
---
Yeah I'm definitely checking out that red dead update and grounded is ready to go......I'm still gonna try to knock out my score stuff but mostly grounded I'm ngl
---
I mean this is the precursor game so it makes sense that resources would be a lot more abundant. Plus it's in an area that wasn't directly nuked so the over all conditions are better.
---
Haha I've done some research and cross-play is definitely out of the question otherwise I could have given you something that packs a bit more punch than a golf club ;) if you aren't already I'd suggest doing the excavator power armour questline to get a sweet sweet level 25 set of power armour. The quest isn't all that hard and can be found at the garrahan mining headquarters (Google for exact location) this will make your golf club hit more like a golf cart :)
---
As for fusion cores.. well just look up some spawn locations or ask someone who's drowning in them like me for a few.
---
Also what's skater XL is that on gamepads?
---
Well Trump's brother is a member of the board of directors at Zenimax, so that could be a issue when dealing with real political topics.
---
Pre-war Appalachia was really more about the workers being shafted by the corporations...rich against poor, the government vs the people.
---
I don‚Äôt run them, only decent one is marsupial and that‚Äôs just funny jump height.
---
FYI fusion gen plans are cheap and easily available at numerous early-mid game stations. Lewisberg for instance, in ash heap.
---
Thank you! I hope really hope so!
---
The floating tents have been in the game since they launched not an unknown issue they weren't taking damage because how high up they were and they were using formula p to get better accuracy which is a feature at this point considering how long it's been able to stack
---
Server hop Eastern Regional Pen. It has a chance of spawning two addictols. It seems to spawn every other time I arrive there.
---
Well how am i supposed to make fusion cores then?
---
While I think Bethesda could have handled the ban wave a bit differently. Keep in mind that the original ‚Äúban‚Äù wasn‚Äôt even that. It was a suspension to investigate players who had an influx of of duped items. Many of those people had accidentally picked up those items or were sold multiple duped equipment and could have honestly not realized what they were buying.
---
That being said, you are right that the market has been permanently altered, but it seems not a lot of people responding seem to understand why. God rolls are still traded for god rolls, but dupers aren‚Äôt just stopping at valuable weapons. Flux and rare plans were duped till their value dropped to nothing. Multiple people were offering 1k flux for a single fixer or bloody weapon. Mothman plans used to be sellable for thousands of caps and now they‚Äôre worth about 50 after major string of dupes. A lot of players who got them legitimately ended up down a few thousand caps because ‚Äúduping doesn‚Äôt affect anybody.‚Äù 
---
For some reason, a lot of people on reddit fee that exploiting the game should be a right, even though we all signed the same agreement saying we can be banned for violating this rule. Duping isn‚Äôt as severe as bullying, but it does ruin the game for a lot of ppl. It‚Äôs just the players on reddit who are watching the feed often who are less affected by duping. Players that just want to play the game without 3rd party chats don‚Äôt have a chance.
---
Bethesda probably isn‚Äôt serious with all those players that they have one last chance, but plenty of ppl have been banned, many are still under investigation, and it‚Äôs fair to say there‚Äôs a lot more that haven‚Äôt spoken up on getting banned as they‚Äôre probably pissed or trying to buy a new account that they‚Äôll have to restart their gear grind.
---
Agreed.  They need to sit down and decide what the expected performance of a non-situational legendary effect is, make that the baseline, and then retool every legendary effect's magnitude (or in some cases, the entire effect) based on how situational it is or how much tradeoff there is, keeping in mind synergies with other effects and perks.
---
They could stand an even deeper dive than that, looking at how all of their math interacts, particularly the damage calculation formula, and the interactions of additive and multiplicative adjustments.
---
I don't see that happening though; balance has never been a focus for Bethesda.  It takes a certain development mindset they don't seem to have or seek out.
---
Yeah i am
---
Junkies is also a magic effect.
---
I would if it were quiet like the vault tech small generator
---
So at like level 4 I'd stumbled across a set of power armored but due to the level req I had to strip it down to just the frame but that things been one of my most helpful tools in Appalachia......I'm still trying to figure out if I can draft lower level stuff to complete it so it's not just naked......But you are telling me there one I can find with armor on it AND it's level 20?.......I'm tempted to log on now just to get it
---
Yeah you can use that build too. Plenty of resources out there for you to use to melt SBQs and plenty of ways to get your hands on the weapons you need.
---
Damn apparently I have to move my camp in order for the glitch to go away. (Changed the skin back to Settlers)
---
Thats what ive been experiencing for the last 5 mins now i gotta wait till 1 am to do it again
---
Ah i get it ;) Rep am i right ?
---
Powerfist at lower levels of attack dmg as it has built in armor pen. At higher levels of attack power (like 1.5-2k+) the armor pen becomes more or less meaningless and Fist/Deathclaw Gauntles, and Mole miner Glove are all more or less equal. Bear skull is a bit worse than those three regardless of dmg, but it looks cool.
---
The rest are all well behind.
---
The thing is though, Bloodied unarmed is super strong. Especially if you stack food buffs. So pretty much any weapon can work. In one of his vids talking about the build, AT was nearly oneshotting L68 mutants with the protest sign and it has an absurdly bad base dmg.
---
Also because of finding it so early I just use the power plant to farm the fusion cores so I have plenty of those.....Hell I even have them in my vending machine.....lol
---
I know not of what you speak. ü§ê
---
Good day sir
---
There is, and it served me well to level 70. It gives you the crafting recipe for all the pieces and ou can craft them very easily. The only thing is that you'll need 50 black titanium scraps but those can be farmed easily in the belching Betty mine by mining all the outcrops
---
I went for junk because of screws, ballistic fibre, ultracite and other harder to find resources. It‚Äôs a good passive farm imo.
---
Edit: also set your collectron to scrap.
---
Oh my god YES- people shouldn't look *good* when they've got Egg Head, Marsupial etc. They should actually look mutated like how in ESO when you become a Stage 4 Vamp you need a mask as it's so goddam ugly.
---
I feel, lore wise, between the Enclave (FO3) and BoS there should *some* anti-mutie sentiment.
---
Good day fellow Human
---
A new skateboarding game a bit like the skate series but more simulator than arcade, nah its not on gamepass unfortunately, its not full price though its ¬£30 in the UK for me
---
I mean honestly who cares. I don‚Äôt even have a god tier weapon but still have a great time fighting the SBQ. Just get to the event before it starts and you can get a hit on it unless you‚Äôre waiting till the end of the event to get one shot on her (in that case you‚Äôre a scumbag). Otherwise no one cares and in fact I love when people come with those magic weapons and melt the SBQ, means I waste less time, ammo and stimpaks.
---
Don't hit your Egg Head on the way out.....
---
Ohhh so it doesn't come with armor but default?.....
---
Its a shame as its the only thing i want out of the season pass and it looks like it makes it harder to use the dam gun.
---
But he mentioned level up, not XP.
---
That would be cool
---
Do you mean the marine armor helmet or the combat armor helmet? The first is a plan from the treasure hunter event.
---
And yet it never works out that bloodied builds get killed easily. Please don‚Äôt try and BS with this glass cannon stuff.
---
I had read if you put up a vending machine it fixes it temporarily.  Dont even need to out anything in it from what I understand. I cannot 100% confirm this as I got the skin after the bug was known but it is a simple fix if it does work.
---
Angry Turtle released a new video yesterday discussing magic weapons. You should watch it. Some primary effects can make weapons magical.
---
Ohhh got ya.....I never played skate but I was a big fan of Tony Hawks before they went to shit but I am looking forward to the remastered one coming out......that's gonna be sick
---
Leveling Up = XP = Score
---
I feel like the solution is work on fixing that stability, Appalchia needs to feel more alive and they need to focus on the social component of this game
---
Oh I believe it id probably startled too lol üòÇ
---
You say long since worn away, but not all of those people died 25 years ago. Some of them were quite recent in the Fallout 76 timeline even. 
---
This isn't to say that they really thought it out either, but all those people didn't die all at once in Appalachia.
---
Technically the quest only gives you the crafting recipe.
---
But it's not expensive (other than the black titanium but that's farmable) so it's like 1 hours work for a nice set of full power armour that also gives you +100 carry weight alongside the strength bonus.
---
I actually feel double XP had more active servers than double SCORE. I said this early on but nobody really agreed.
---
Double XP weekend it rained nukes. This weekend on PS4 I saw three. I didn't launch any as nobody woulda showed imo.
---
Forget double score Beth- XP gives us more!!!
---
They just added a bunch of humans with Wastelanders.  It should work against Blood Eagles and other humans and not just PCs.
---
Got it......Will do.....Thank you kind stranger......May the Mothman continue to bless you
---
Eh. It's alright though. I deserved my downvotes, I was an uninformed doof and I made myself look like one. It happens to us all from time to time.
---
I got a two star two shot fixer as a reward from my raider punk daily. That was nifty.
---
100% agree with you. The fact that they have not dropped the hammer on these things is ridiculous.
---
There is a flute coming soon
---
A week ago I saw a level 1762, I will never forget him because he nuked me and my 4 friends community of bases with 1 nuke
---
Plenty of us care. It breaks the game.
---
What's your gamertag?
---
Applehead230
---
I'd pay good Atoms for a silent fusion generator....
---
I mean I wish we had more budget too and they keep adding stuff and loads of it has too high of a budget cost to build it, making me have to rebuild and rethink my camps all the time. It‚Äôs very annoying and very inconvenient.
---
Yes, I have both level 3 equipped. Edit I am also using a non scoped ranged weapon to aim at them with, when attempting to tame them.
---
There was a dude taking aggro for 5 minutes, ignoring my "Come here" emotes, on a tent, so I decided to message him and told him the queen wouldn't land.
---
He told me "That's just a myth," jumped off his tent, and the queen instantly landed.
---
Interesting the more reports there are the more likely this seems. It is also interesting that many of us had our first autocomplete coincide with this
---
Meditations brings up emotions and memories you may have suppressed in the past,and that can lead to a deluge of negative feelings that can be hard to handle.Mindfulness-oriented meditation led to changes in personality traits reflecting the maturity of the self at the intrapersonal and interpersonal levels and also led to decreases in trait anxiety.
---

Go through above link it will benefit.
---
Yes, I found a map online showing all the random encounter spawn spots.
---
It really bothers me that they haven't implemented some of the 1 1/4, 1/2, 1/4 settlement objects from Far Harbor. I'm talkin' specifically the window wall/glass roofs. come on.
---
Are you x box?......I'd love to take some of those off your hands
---
I'm not sure why some people have different survival tents? Is this depending on when you sign up, or do you get a different one if you subscribe to one year vs one month? Or do you get new variations after renewing? Anyone know? Also - yeah, skins for the scrapbox would be cool.
---
Corrosion and poison. OMG poison is such an pwner!!
---
Mirelurk Kings be strutting around my carcass too much!!
---
and charred ghouls that hit me when i am 2 stories up :(
---
I got to go to the other side last week, and it was so beautiful! They really are holding out on us for the Forest region on the other side! 
---
It seems like they removed the shacks in the Mire now tho... I couldn't find any structures on the outside anywhere.
---
I run a silent base. No allies. No music. No power generators or turrets. It's hidden.... Other than wind chimes I don't hear shit. 
---
I use 20x compact generators in a 1x1 with half steel walls and a roof that I feed cabling subtly through with the better conduits set. It's got a flag pole on top and with uplighting looks like a flag monument. I also hide the ugly ass CAMP module in it, and all 20 generators and CAMP mod fit inside with room to spare. 
---
No need for a loud ass fusion generator which is way too big to fit indoors comfortably, and the core of the base is tucked into a single foundation to be moved easily.
---
the thing is, with double score you only get the boost to whatever tasks they set that day, so really you had the same people doing the same things. but with double xp, you get double xp on EVERYTHING. people could benifit from it by CRAFTING LEATHER ARMOR.
---
I agree with this, it did feel like more people were playing on double xp weekend than double score.  I think it had to do with double xp being available all weekend while score could be done in an hour or two and then people switched to another game as there was no more bonus to be had till the next day. Just an observation though ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Absolutely, that was the biggest mistake they did with FO4, just out of the vault and you take on a Deathclaw.  Get outta here!   In NV or FO3, I did everything to sneak round and not take on head on if I could.
---
I have my pip boy in yellow, that should be readable in most environments, I personally dont like the green.
---
It never included mini nuke planter, since it was introduced muuuuch earlier than that bundle.
---
Sorry for the random question, but since you both have one how do you get the Enclave and Settlers titles next to your names? Still pretty new to Reddit in terms of having an account.

no long as you have one of the effects it will bug

Race has been addressed, at least Pre-War. Chinese people were in detention centers and viewed with deep suspicion due to the war going on with China.
---
I've run into that damn protectron a few times. Always able to fix it, but there's a typo in the repair confirmation dialogue box that pops up after you're done. Something to the effect of replacing the "curcutboard"
---
I hate do this event with somebody else. Many times people go outside and one shoot every enemy like on kill race - who will one shoot more enemy... and ofcourse final ventigo is also melted by one person... always... who will see him first BOOOOM and guy disappear... to be clear I'm blood comando with fixer b2525 so I can easy clean that instance but I dont want to kill fun of other players so I use my favorite .44 when I'm in group.
---
I'm sorry people are down voting you, you're just asking questions, same people who beat their kids for being kids probably.

Do you play on PC? Then you should have mods as well.
---
Preach fellow traveler......I'm a low level noob and I always share the xp and try to help with move that are completely out of my league but I usually just end up on a team by myself for the reason you listed......It's like dude it's not my fault your mega weapon kills shit in one clip or less......I'm swinging my golf club as hard as I can.......Geez
---
The one in Abandoned Bog Town is always standing near the Workshop. Use the nearby Pylon TP, turn west and you will immediately see him. Mind the L70-80 glowing Fog Walkers/Gulpers that spawn at the base of the pylon. They are frisky and will frequently get dragged into a fight with the behemoth and his L68 Mutant guards. Its a much more action packed fight than the lone behemoth at solomons pond.
---
The shack you spawn near is a perfect place to fight from though. The behemoth cant climb stairs. Just dash to th shack, take the stairs a flight or two up and aggro everything. Let them all start fighting each other while you tag everything and start picking off stuff. Once you are safely ensconced on the shack and its stairs, by far the most dangerous thing will be the behemoths super mutant guards. They have missile launchers and miniguns.
---
The behemoth itself has a long respawn though. So its not particularly farmable unless you have 1st.
---
yes, so i can farm kills with my 40mm yeeter build.
---
just saw the video and thought the same.  
---
its ridiculous. and hilarious. i love hate it :D
---
I have the wrapped hood. Goes good with the tattered field jacket.
---
The buffs and free teleports definitely help.....I usually try to stay out of a higher levels way because I know my damage isn't doing shit but I try God dammit
---
While its certainly mostly about aiming/getting the jump on the other player, having things like 40% more damage + 15% more damage is quite helpful.
---
Its not going to guarantee a win, but in a straight trade it will definitely give an edge.
---
that doesn‚Äôt compare the non skinned version just the same version with the two sight options
---
Xbox here......My body is ready for teaming
---
I agree, that's why I make my characters ugly as possible. Off topic but I really hope BGS makes the Brotherhood at least comment about all the mutated people running around their establishment
---
This is where I went. Once to deathclaw island, once here; 3 killed.
---
I don‚Äôt think tents or fences do it. I‚Äôve watched her land and go right up to someone on a tent and beat away at them. I think it‚Äôs the one gun army staggering that throws her off her landing sequence.
---
Have you actually tried to pvp one my friends and I pvo each other and back when I was using an aass  powerfist I could kill him just because your build isn't set up good doesn't mean I'm false
---
Can‚Äôt do anything about it though haha
---
Inconsistent results with Magic Minigun: one time it melted after 400 bullets, another time it took 3k rounds. Heads and legs don't seem to trigger the magic, only about the neck region of one of the side-facing heads.
---
Fallout 76 may be have improvements compared to FO4 but it still seems pretty dated regarding its user interface. I presume limitations of the foundational game engine.
---
Thank you. Finally someone understands my post! I‚Äôm discussing the effect of this un ban wave on the economy and like you said it‚Äôs not only about legacies or legendaries but suddenly the flux you had on the side isn‚Äôt worth much compared to it‚Äôs original value. It‚Äôs the effect on the economy from guns to gear to ammo.

The non skinned version takes up the same amount of screen space and the skinned version without the front ring sight. You‚Äôre right that I don‚Äôt show that though. I‚Äôll throw images together and post them here in a few.
---
Kill a radscorpion, make an omelette from it's egg. It'll cure a random addiction and if you only have one, that's the one it'll cure.
---
Every unlockable stash skin should come with a matching scrapbox skin at the same time.
---
God does the bond work and what do you get from it?......Also do any of the xp gains from perks or armor or just anything that boosts XP work for challenges?......Like does the xp help with ranking the season rewards stuff?
---
If you are on PC you don't need mods, you can just edit your \*.ini files. Very simple process of copy/paste ready commandline from some guide (there are several around).
---
I think you are right about the run of bad luck. It just seems all the creatures are either never alone or they are glowing, rabid, or diseased variants, and those are non tamable. I have been thinking it would be unlikely to run into a regular variant at my level but I suppose it's still possible? I really want a Snallygaster, Megasloth, or Deathclaw. I am not really interested in the animals unless it's a guard dog maybe.
---
He did that on a private server. You can‚Äôt do that in a public server like he did in the private server. Sneak while in a team doesn‚Äôt work the same way it does in a private world or without being on a team. If you play as part of a team whether it be an event or not, as long as you‚Äôre teammates are detected then you‚Äôre automatically detected even if your still in ‚ÄòHidden‚Äù or ‚ÄúCaution‚Äù. Hence why captainnoob was able to pull that build off. He wasn‚Äôt in a team, therefore he was able to get all of the 3.50 or 3.75 sneak attack bonuses
---
That‚Äôs a smart idea. I‚Äôm going to have to remember that.  I like building small but decorated camps. I can‚Äôt have my module in my building though because I like to keep my pets alive.
---
Shhhh
---
Thanks!  I really like the atom store in general.  Always check the daily offers.  If it loaded straight away I would even mind.  But it's like those mobile sites where the button suddenly loads and interrupts.
---
Wtf no way.......Now I need to track down the spawns for those
---
There is the bug with LMGs which can do almost the same. If you have a BFFR LMG and land the first shot as a crit, then every subsequent shot deals the same damage. Same with Instigating. In this way you can REALLY get the damage up and she‚Äôll drop like a brick
---
It‚Äôs not just the SBQ it‚Äôs within the game itself and events and PvP.  I mean, I have an AAE Gatling Plasma and Quad FFR Tesla and a few other legacy energy type weapons but rarely use them because they are so overpowered and glitched. 
---
Bethesda has done such a shitty job balancing weapons that some are either totally overpowered or some are basically useless (most melee, shotguns, non auto rifles, etc).  And don‚Äôt get me started on grenade launchers or missile launchers or fat man weapons.   Hell, half the weapons in this game are useless.
---
Lol! You just made a statement you can‚Äôt back up as proof your right!
---
Yea that‚Äôs a terrible ‚Äúfix‚Äù. All but one of my dailies was autocompleted the other day.
---
The experience of running around the map yelling at everyone that they can invite me and a friend so I can unlock him will never be forgotten
---
I love all the lights in some peoples camps but have to avoid as it drives my poor gtx750ti into slide show mode üòí
---
This isn't the issue.  When you load the game it doesn't load this splash screen straight away. It will interrupt whatever you are doing.
---
I have a two shot I carry around and use it instead of the handmade and lever action I have in areas with lower lever stuff since it uses different ammo. And I like it.
---
That's what they get for judging a book by its cover
---
Two things can be true at once
---
Ah, thanks for the heads up. I'll keep that in mind as to not get discouraged in the beginning.
---
And I'll add you. I usually play in the morning/early afternoon during the weekends. I'm on Central European Time so might be bit tricky to be online at the same time, but we'll see.
---
Unfortunately not. I'm on Xbox. Though surely QoL such as colour blindness options shouldn't be left down to modders?
---
Junkies for sure if that's your build. Secondary you can go with Explosive or 10% Damage While Aiming, being a sniper rifle and all.
---
Playing on PC I recently started using a nexus mod and all generators, turrets and water purifiers are now completely silent, such a relief.
---
I felt there was already so much going on they didn't really have time to waste effort on race relations unless there was the direct threat of nuclear annihilation from them, like the chinese
---
You'd think with it taking so many assets from Fallout 4 that they'd have brought over this customisation, hell I half expected to come back and see it available for Atoms.
---
I run into it all the time and don't bother, as nothing comes of fixing the damn thing.
---
There is a pvp damage cap bloodied unarmed vs unarmed makes no difference rate of fire makes a difference a heavy gun build that's non bloodied with the same rate of fire as a bloodied one has almost as good a chance
---
Unfortunately I'm a console player. No space for wizardry.
---
Because there's really nothing more important than infesting every single aspect of culture and leisure with contentious and divisive real world conflict and politics. It's vital that in our private world of leisure we never watch a film, play or TV series, read a book, listen to an album or play a game unless it is a vehicle for "addressing race" or other public issues.
---
As I look around and literally see a country in flames the only thing I think is why isn't this reflected more in my private culturally pursuits.
---
Shotguns have never been the same since the TSE nerf over a year ago.
---
I had a sweet AAE combat shotgun that was devastating and fun along with an explosive double barrel shotgun and once that nerf took hold I dumped my build and have been running an auto rifle build ever since.
---
well be prepared to be fucking tired until 2028 when they figure out how to fix it lmao.
---
 till you hit level 35 the leader of the pack event northwest of the map at the ferriswheel is your friend for getting lower level armor and weapons, look for "hoarde events" in west and middle part of the map as well for the same reason.
---
only go to the east part of the map if you team up with a higher lvl (80+) buddy
---
invest in sneak and concentrated fire (1lvl is enough) perks, especially on low lvl the ability to do sneak plus vats headshot is very useful
---
do not sell anything apart from screws, acid, crystals and ammo until you hit lvl 50 and get to know which weapons/armor are sought after (spoiler unyielding armor, bloody and junkies weapons)
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox but I normally have 40-50 lights built. Some people might call it excessive.
---
I hope one day to come across your camp, it sounds really cool üëç
---
Quintuple with the lunchboxes even though the max xp from an enemy you can get is 4000.
---
Edit: quintuple not octuple
---
I think Bethesda did nice work there with issue of automation. They did a good job with world building but I don‚Äôt think those issues really ‚Äúshow‚Äù itself in the new content at all. But, I like Commander Daguerre‚Äôs comment on how she can‚Äôt believe how the U.S could have so many nukes but yet, be so unprepared for what happens when you use them.
---
I just got out of match that I won without even trying or really paying attention to the remaining players. But it was really quick. The circle had only shrunk once and the time was just half way to the second wave, when I see the Overseek rankup popup.
---
I'm down just a warning though I'm a level 30 and never launched a bike although I did find a code for a solo yesterday I think so we could use that
---
And I say that because it comes down to how build is set up and I know 99% of bloodied builds are set up min max for pvp and pve so again just because you are bad doesn't mean I'm false
---
Albino radscorpions from fallout 3 were way worse than deathclaws.
---
Shut up üôÇüëçüèª
---
It‚Äôs that typical 50‚Äôs attitude, which carried over.
---
Now if that was a challenge to kill three mole crickets or yao guai or sheepsquatches it might be a challenge.  The only challenge to killing death claws is server hopping to get enough of them.
---
Too late. You banned.
---
BAAAAAAAAANED.
---
Why don‚Äôt they just do both simultaneously? It seems so much more efficient.
---
what ammo does it use?
---
Had the same problem first week of wastelanders and my fiance had it last month when she finally completed the raiders.  Just keep at it.  When they finally make it through that scene without bugging out you will need to stay with them, dont run ahead, or they may try to path to you directly and get stuck on topography such as railings or crates.
---
*spoiler* Johnny dieing is not a bug.  You have to select your responses very carefully or he dies.   It is possible for him to live through the whole vault raid but only if you select the right responses there and further into the vault.
---
Do you really don't see the difference?
---
He clearly said at lvl 250+, LEVELING becomes a grind.
---
Getting a certain ammount of XP on the other hand it doesn't matter if you are lvl 100 or 500.
---
So the argument doesn't make sense that way.
---
I really wanted to see a sytem implemented that allows you to select camp module A, B, and C.
---
Basically you just select which one you want loaded in before joing a server.
---
The camp module can be placed anywhere allowing you to build 3 seperate camps, but, only loading 1 in per server.
---
This would allow multiple builds without making the players have to pack up or scrap their current camp.
---
The less score you have, the more inclined you are to buy some ranks.
---
1500 points for a max card.
---
1 point per ‚Äúnormal‚Äù card,  5 for a ‚Äúgold‚Äù card.
---
Shits insane.
---
You don‚Äôt need waste land whisperer. There‚Äôs a lot of outdated information about this. Basically all you have to do is find the animal at the spawn site with animal friend 3 equipped, walk up to it and press tame. It has to be alone. Don‚Äôt try to escort it back to your camp. It will attract attention to it. Just wait for it to show up. It can take hours to show up. Make sure your camp is in a safe location away from water or high level enemies. Refrain from pvp. Keep your camp device away from any foundation of walls unless you want it to be crushed by your building. Grahm will also kill them
---
some people are just lousy like that.
---
However, i n my experience,  it is almost never the really high  level players who could blow enemies over with a breath who do this. Almost always an up and comer flexing.
---
You keep telling yourself that Captain_Crutch. The truth is you can‚Äôt handle game‚Äôs unless you find a way to remove any risk or challenge. Otherwise the game is unfair.
---
Here‚Äôs the thing. I didn‚Äôt even bring up PvP. You did. You went straight to defending your view on bloodied based in PvP.
---
So you really gave away your hand there.
---
Yep, staggering her fucks her landing and everything else. If she flys away from you, turns around and is looking in your direction while stationary in the air, rather high up. She's going to land- as long as her current target is in open area and she doesn't get staggered. If she gets staggered too many times she'll move around and restart the cycle.
---
You mean I wasted those boring fireworks one after the other for nothing........oh.....did not know this oops :D
---
Its onyl 20 minutes because leeches and bystanders dont know what they are doing.
---
Let ONE person land her. THEN attack. Dont just creep around taking potshots while stealthed or hiding on a tent like a clown.
---
the fixer is NOT the best weapon in the game. not even the best rifle in the game.  handmade is the best rifle. fixer is way overpriced, yes its a great weapon, but definitely not the best
---
You only say that because he thick and you tryna get up on that
---
In 4 I'd always go for a purplish hue as that was the least stress on my eyes. My red and green receptors ain't so good which means certain greens and yellows are hard to read and I can't see red if it is over a certain colour.
---
Unfortunately being on console I can't see anything in my options and don't have the luck it tweaking files or mods to replicate that feature.
---
I feel ya, my camp is at max even though it's only a3 story with bare essentials
---
Oh yea anything is possible on PC, there‚Äôs still some level of normalcy on consoles. I saw an ebay seller sells nothing but hacked franken weapons for PC such as 50 cal nukes and explosive laser handmades and title them ‚Äòqueen killer‚Äô.
---
I thought they were useless as well, until today. Fortunately I had only used one of them so far.
---
Well.. maybe a 100% completion without spending atoms is for people who are able spend more time for their progress.
---
However - I can do my dailies only on 4-5 days per week, I have a 40hr/week job, have a loving family, a girlfriend, do sports, make music and on top of that FO76 is far from my main game. I am part of a competitive Overwatch team that trains 2 times a week, I‚Äôm playing hearthstone on a daily basis and I manage to watch Netflix.
---
Oh and I‚Äôm still ahead of the curve on the board, since the problems you are complaining about are not as bad as you describe em.
---
Need a tip for the legendary daily? I run whitesprings (0-4 legendaries), west tek outside area (0-2 legendaries), Hop a few scorchbeast places (Quite often a legendary) and if I‚Äôm not done already I look for events. Sure sometimes people don‚Äôt let you Tag the enemies before they die, but that is absolutely not the rule. Pay attention, learn the spawns and be a bit faster. It‚Äôs totally up to you if you‚Äôre able to Tag or not in 90% of the cases
---
Yeah screw evolution. What has it ever done for us? Oh wait...
---
I really don‚Äôt think they needed to be added to the game at all. The game itself is incredibly easy, I don‚Äôt need to pretty much play with cheat codes. I think mutations should have vastly more drawbacks for their use, you‚Äôd think being mutated by large amounts of radiation would just give you cancer and not super powers. I‚Äôd never complain or campaign for their removal from the game but I‚Äôll never use them. Currently sitting at lvl 183 and mutation free
---
i have noticed a lull in events popping. And then later on same server they be all over the place again. Maybe it's an attendance /  timer thing?
---
you can also run a bunch of events and jump servers. Often you will find cycle restarting on new server.
---
You're welcome.  
---
I'm looking forward to it too, it's a pretty fun fight.
---
People on fences and tents do nothing to stop her from landing.
---
Glad to hear it.
---
Buy 2* stuff.
---
My son got a two shot explosive double barrel (lucky kid) from the purveyor two weeks ago.
---
You get more chances rolling 2* stuff.
---
I enjoy the grind.. its kinda what I signed up for in a looter shooter...
---
For sure! It‚Äôs easy to understand where ppl may not see the problem because Bethesda‚Äôs cap sink is constantly too small to keep the amount of caps from rising - more caps in the market, less each one is worth. So caps were practically worthless from the start.
---
But junk items are the new base currency, and only FO1st can afford to trade at the scale being asked. The issue with duping is it creates a huge divide between currency and god tier weapons and outfits and there‚Äôs no bridge in between them. So you either find a god tier item for trade or your lvl 200+ account that you‚Äôve spent 400 hours on is absolutely worthless just because of RNG and duping.
---
Wait does that fireplace in the atom shop have a secret door?.....I may need to use my atoms on that
---
Nope, no mutations at all. I‚Äôll never make fun of people using mutations but it‚Äôs like playing the game with cheat codes on, the game is easy enough.
---
But it's 6K from an event! So never enough!
---
Two more and we can make a team.
---

---
:3
---
Its a stupid easy challenge if you actually play and just remember where you commonly see deathclaws. There are numerous static spawns for them.
---
It's not just you, rats can be tougher than ghouls. I don't know if it's high damage resistance because they wanted us to think they have thick skin or I dunno, but they aren't as easy to kill as you'd think.
---
I mean, there were a lot more quests/activities added with the release of Wastelanders, so...
---
Oh snap that makes three.
---
If you play a game of NW and then play Adventure mode the outer world barriers are gone.  
---
It seems related to changes in scaling between game modes, like how a nuke zone looks twice as large on the map when you play Adventure after NW.
---
I love the building aspect of the game and my main atomic shop purchases have been for the camp items. But the budget is killing me. I don't want to delete anything in my camp, and I finally like the location, but I can't add anything extra :(
---
:D glad I'm not alone
---
Enjoying Appalachia...since it‚Äôs where I grew up it‚Äôs really cool seeing it in a fallout setting...not from West Virginia but along the mountain range...
---
It's depressing how they do things, really, and I truly dread the day that the bug will go away, at least when it comes to shotguns..
---
I enjoy just bummin around lookin at cool shit, then I go back to my base and move stuff around. Its a nice chill game, just enjoy the ambience
---
How else will I be able to infiltrate the enclave to take em down.
---
The fact that it's so easy to break her A.I. (don't stand here, don't stand there, don't equip this, don't shoot that, etc. etc.) is fucking absurd.
---
I have One Gun Army so I know not to shoot her in midair, but I'm not reshuffling my build just because Bethesda can't be fucked to address the SBQ's...ahem..."bugged" limb damage.  I just get my phone out until I hear her land.  
---
But it's still stupid.
---
Ehhh. It's fine. It doesn't hurt me none. I asked questions, I got answers. That's what matters most.
---
doing funny stuff with frens
---
True. America was seemingly prospering for a while with technology but, still at it‚Äôs core, there were many problems with the country.
---
If you‚Äôre on mobile, go to the main page of the subreddit, look at the top right and tap on the three dots. There is an option in there for User Flair.  This also works on other subreddits as well.
---
I haven't finished any main story lines yet. I've been taking everything very slow so I can enjoy it and not get jaded. I spent a lot of time building my camp and gathering plans/decorations. Being a cautious player worked out well in this game. It took months to get to level 50, then weeks to get to 105.
---
Its worse with this patch again for sure. Launch of Wastelanders was actually good. Usually every other patch or two they bring back old bugs by getting lazy an reusing old broken code.
---
I have had a Bloodied Puncturing Boxing Glove on my inventory for a week, haven't used it yet tho. It's really that good?
---
No it's the rank 99 legendary run reward
---
Agreed.  Compared to the other workbenches the Weapons workbenches are total eyesores.
---
Well, know, that's just cool.  Thank you.
---
Don't get me started. Not only can people kill them but a lvl300 cant tame anything over what lvl30?
---
I know.  I followed the instructions, maybe missed something.
---
I personally don‚Äôt see the point, I know I‚Äôm just handicapping myself but the game is already easy enough.
---
Important thing to note; he waits until she lands first.
---
I too have obliterated the queen with a magic heavy, but it does seem to be a lot more difficult to do while she's airborn.  
---
I'm not sure if that's because I have bad aim (lol), or if her DR is so crazy high while she's flying that she can resist most/all of the magic damage.
---
Is this for your documentary?
---
Excellent
---
I would love a laughing emote.
---
hyperbole clearly. unless actually mentally challenged. which given the op, might be the case.
---
I went with a tiny CAMP idea- it's literally that flag pole 'core' and a seedy shed. Also, if you place a small water purifier down and a foundation next to it, you can use a dirt tile (from Foundation bullion) and it'll snap to the first foundation laid and it'll make it so the purifier sits in the middle of the dirt and you can put carrots or tato around it. The whole base is three tiles :)
---
Thanks for the nice comment appreciate it!
---
Magic shotguns are frankly just about right imo.  It shouldn't take 3 shots to down a max level super mutant with maxed shotgun perks and a bloodied double barrel.
---
.45 which to be fair is the same as the Lever Action, using the Radium is also for variety too. My biggest problem is carrying so many weapons, part of which are legendaries that take forever to exchange because of the scrip limit/maximizing the full amount.
---
silence dirty blood
---
actually its been very nice recently, legacies and fixers and been made accessible enough that every time i want to trade they arent the only fuckin thing people want. been doing more trading than usual because of the dupe. honestly id say the dupe did more to help than harm. salty greedy traders are pissed though, but i dont really give a fuck.
---
this is dupe number 20 something and people only care about this one because it got alot of attention, nothing really changed on pc at least. most people who got banned were greedy console grubs lol.
---
one example: you are a bloodied build
---
your rads are like a limit for staying in the under 20% health region
---
if your rads heal and you pop a stimpack in the heat of battle you loose the low health benefits.
---
there is at least one more perk that heals all your rad when u revive, forgot the name, wasnt intended to be a complete list :)
---
You can get through Buried treasure without jhonny.
---
Hey, thanks for taking the time and helping-out.
---
I, thank God, finally managed to finish the quest after the third time.
---
The part about Johnny, i had a hunch it had something to do with the way one chooses the responses. 
---
   
---
Thank you once more, have a nice day, or night sir.
---
Yeah VATS with the bow is generally bad, lately it‚Äôs been significantly better though. I think part of the bow being underpowered makes it more fun. I still enjoy the combat, I‚Äôm not Leroy Jenkins/VATS running through feral ghouls. 
---
I was also lucky enough to roll a 2 star anti armor bow and have the plasma arrows from foundation which have added a lot of damage. 
---
It seems that very few people use the arrows so most people are selling them for 1 cap or free, but the crafting of them is a little costly. 
---
The bow breaks much slower than rifles, and I can scrap or sell pretty much all weapons I find and am not longer slaving around for lead to craft ballistic ammo. This is my second character and I‚Äôve really enjoyed using the bow and a melee weapon. Dive right in if you‚Äôre looking for a cool challenge!
---
506 hours myself. It has been the one thing that has saved my sanity, and my family from having me home for such an extended period during lockdown, and curfew. We were on Lockdown from 27 March to end MAY. Now limited movement and night time curfew still has us home mostly.
---
I like that there is so much you can do, or not do, besides just pew pew.......and i like the grind.
---
Wait a damn minute......You can take the creatures and make them pets?
---
A certain mod locked all the auto-complete threads in the Bethesda Help Forum last night stating it was due to people not being logged off at reset time. 
---
-
---
Ignoring people like me who have experienced it for the first time. NOT AT RESET &amp; after the world failed to load while loading lots of people have had this in the past few days.
---
Smiley also auto-completed I can't buy gold for another week because he thinks I've already been this week
---
You could try it with the flag setup away from your main base thats the beauty of it. It's just a flag pole on a pedastol that happens to power the camp and act as the spawn point (or assist in the placement of your likely spawn).
---
Sorry I haven't ever kept pets so I'm not sure how they're affected in CAMPS etc.
---
41 here this was posted before here:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Nji1wR3q5hoHOKwKQWnK5p1qhtub7O64XPGZxeimpI/edit#gid=0
---
Got it, i managed to do it at my third try, Johhny survived this time arround.
---
 Thanks for helping-out sir.
---
Have a nice one.
---
Well given foundation keeps calling me a drug addict for having mild buffs from food and chems I reckon they will!!
---
i have an IE90 dragon lol. it breaks in like 5 shots. its a dumb weapon, but sometimes you just need to meme on a radroach.
---
(no offense but)I wouldn't be comfortable doing a nuke with just you since I'm also pretty new at it but if anyone else joins then we can ‚ò∫Ô∏è.
---
Also your name is cool
---
Imagine being so thick skulled that you aren't willing to admit you are wrong despite giving all the facts. How about instead of advocating to destroy a build how about advocate to  buff useless effects like mutants to be good. Since launch I ran a non bloodied unarmed build with a 2* anti armor swing speed power fist still pushing very good damage not 1 shot but 2-3 just because one build is very good doesn't make all other very bad
---
concentrated fire: not everybody uses it and with it the vats controls are different, due to ability to switch between bodyparts, this is very confusing if you are not used to it.
---
weight reduction: you are running thru the wasteland, the teammember that shared the perk leaves the team and suddenly you might be overencumbered
---
they dont give a fuck, it makes it more likely that a few people will just pay to skip.
---
Same as Fixer also, sadly
---
You‚Äôre not alone! I run no mutations because on my previous character I found myself being terrified of rad showers and radaway for fear of losing my precious little mutation.
---
Or that, so long as they put in a bit of work for it.
---
No, my hoarder mentality is made worse by the limited time factor of The Atomic Shop. If I want something and see it I have to get it because I don't know if or when it's coming back. It's the main thing that has had me progress so far on The Legendary Run. I buy everything and fill my camp up to capacity, but I keep buying more.
---
Ohhhh got it......Even more reason for me to finish it......I'm only halfway there and I'm hoping I have enough time to finish
---
I thought you only benefited from one Chem at a time?  How does this work, is there a trick to it?
---
Thanks in advance for the info!
---
I am running a junkies 50% limb Damage 250 DR while reloading and it‚Äôs my main go too.  Been enjoying my mutants Handmade as well.  Way better than my 2* The Fixer.
---
You won‚Äôt see them often but I have have gotten a few from the Purveyor so I keep playing the RNG game hoping for a Junkies Lever Action with faster reload.
---
Is plague walker worth getting? I have all except for that one and herbivore, it just didn‚Äôt sound as beneficial as the rest.
---
Bloodied unarmed is that good. The boxing glove is a lower tier unarmed weapon but with a proper build even it can be viable, especially if you track down a faster swing speed version. You can even still make a meathook viable, but a DCG, Power fist, Gauntlet, Bear Arm, Mole Miner Gauntlet and even a Death Tambo will be better.
---
I‚Äôm now using the Grounded Mutation,  it doesn‚Äôt have any negatives with the Gauss Shotgun. 
---
Thank you guys for your time and advice.
---
I'm just here for Inon Zur's score and the perpetual Fall colors.
---
LMFAO ü§£
---
Oh, good! I was worried about that taking up my budget! Thanks!
---
Yep. We have like 4 or 5 skins for the Fatman but none for the must popular weapon in game lol.
---
I targeted [acidic items](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Acid_(Fallout_76\)) long ago and now have an ungodly amount at this point. Mostly coolant and Abraxo Cleaner.
---
Just note. In order for overdrive and psychotats to stack, overdrive needs to be taken first.
---
thank you i was not aware of that
---
That carry weight is perfect for my needs......So could I use the frame I'm already in or do they give you one?
---
Totally--also let's face it a LOT of people are finished whether this be legitimately or otherwise. Double SCORE in the early days would have helped, whereas I see people now in-game with cosmetics from pretty much the end of the board so Beth left it a little late imo.
---
Also, if the XP repeatable was made into double daily it might have helped in server attendance numbers, as like you said it's easy to do the dailys in like &lt;30mins.
---
Watoga would be awesome with the huge city. You could maybe make the south east a really high risk/reward area to spawn with scorchbeasts spawning early but lots of PA frames and orange crates around.
---
My other vote would be for Harper's Ferry and the surrounding area. I quite like the idea of the Mire because of how dark the area is which will make the sneaky ambush style of play better.
---
In all honesty, there really needs to be a new map added sooner rather than later and ideally more than one. Two maps isn't enough and Morgantown is voted about 90% of the time in my matches. I'm no expert but it doesn't seem like it would be particularly difficult to make a new map - you just copy and paste the map from adventure mode, change the loot tables and add spawn points for crates, PA and enemies. Would definitely help to revive the mode.

here what reloading a dragon is like lmao
---
Mate I‚Äôm over level 315 and I can level up in like 20-30 minutes. It‚Äôs not that difficult, and the XP that comes from it is worth it
---
Also if I have recipes for any other armor can I craft them to my level so that they are usable?
---
Seeing a Deathclaw used to bring me fear. I fought a pack of 3 for 30 minutes in fallout 4 and I was scared the entire time. I killed 3 today in less than 5 seconds. I didn‚Äôt even think about it until I read this... I hope they bring some big badass Deathclaw into the game that will prove its strength by instantly destroying power armor pieces with one hit.
---
They just need to rework her and incorporate the Free States Towers. You activate the Towers, she lands for X amount of time/damage. Mobs (ideally big scary ones, not bloatflies and roaches) spawn and attack the towers.  Kill the mobs, repair the Towers and she lands again, rinse and repeat until she's dead. 
---
No more talk of fences, tents, perks or crippling. An actual timed planned event not based on luck.
---
In the olden days I phoned my mate and sat in the hallway at home. Now I can phone several mates at the same time and have something we can all do
---
That plan may be rare, but too bad it is constantly bugged...
---
Double score sucked. Double XP was awesome
---
What the fuck
---
I'm writing a Fallout 76 novel - I use the game to build out locations, characters and details in my work.
---
This. I've gotten multiple duplicates of every single other plan, but I'm still hunting the burning barbed plan for the staff.
---
1.2k hours in. I just enjoy the world. I log in and fuck around, kill some shit, move my camp about, maybe do an event. Its just a chill game where I don't have to think or get super invested since my time has become super limited lately
---
If I feel like something might be rare, I usually just look up ____ price check fo76 and then that comes up with different posts that people have sold it for before and I get a good idea of what it‚Äôs worth. Anything else, I don‚Äôt care enough so I price it 1/3-1/4 of it‚Äôs written value
---
I like healing without stimpaks after combat..so much fun that and being melee build I use twisted muscles for that extra punch in the face
---
Why are you booing me? I‚Äôm right
---
Thanks but it's cool I get it.......Also thanks for the compliment
---
I get mental health issues reading these posts every other day
---
I prefer the settlers, but I sided with the raiders for the vault raid because I wanted to get the ammo producer faster
---
I think it's because box skins are able to be monetized. They've been releasing stash skins for atoms but if they tried that with FO1st gear, people would lose it. They way I interpret it is that Beth does not see any incentive for them to give us nice skins for our scrapbox which is lame as hell.
---
That is hilarious
---
Geez man I didn‚Äôt mean it like it should be Bethesda‚Äôs obligation to physically shove race to the forefront of their games. It‚Äôs just my personal preference that I like to be confronted with issues like this to think about when playing a story. It doesn‚Äôt have to be blatant and Bethesda usually does a good job of being discreet about things. 
---
I enjoy having an escape from it too, so I‚Äôd like to save that for anytime I‚Äôm not playing the story.
---
And now the typical insults. Imagine being so insecure. You can‚Äôt play the game unless you remove all challenge and can‚Äôt handle the truth 
---
Awww. Cause honest people wouldn‚Äôt get all angry worked up like you are. 
---
Poor poor you
---
It's almost like they're out of touch with their player base üòÇ
---
I really hope they fix this issue, so annoying. (Xb1x)
---
Frames are universal and can fit every set
---
Authentic!
---
Ghillie scrap box
---
Thank you. Saved me a thousand+ atoms
---
Damn this is a great suggestion.  Will turn into an atom shop paint set probably
---
How are they viable now? Compared to previously
---
Thank you. Saved my atoms there.
---
..... Seems I'm not the only one XD definitely prefer anti armour on all my weapons.
---
Agreed, why are people downvoting you for just saying something
---
Cliff from DOOM PATROL
---
I enjoy amassing tons of legendary weapons/armor and trying out different builds.  I like trying to make bad things work.  I also have friends I play with online, which makes a huge difference. 
---
I also encourage people to do light roleplaying - no talking in character or anything like that, but get some friends, make a team, intentionally nerf yourselves a bit and decide on roles. Select your cards and don't swap.  
---
It's kinda like playing Minecraft or other survival games - after a while you make your own fun.
---
I'm down to only needing 14 plans in the game and still need 3 from free range.  My luck has been terrible with free range.   [https://docs.google.com/document/d/18cw0UZl\_3XelTH3yMdhrvXzpdq5xATEcfFSoVMJuYPQ/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18cw0UZl_3XelTH3yMdhrvXzpdq5xATEcfFSoVMJuYPQ/edit)
---
I believe power armour has a minimum requirement, 25 for t45 and excavator 30 for t51b and the rest I'm unsure of. The excavator quest gives you the recipe that lets you craft them for lvl 25 to level 45 as long as you meet the required level.
---
You seem to have misspelled regular players
---
I'm  hoping this is being addressed by the "instances CAMP interiors" thing mentioned in the winter section of the roadmap.
---
If in theory part of the CAMP budget cap has to do with collective load in the "world" (either on server or client) by creating the ability to instance even part of our builds, they'd be able to push it a lot farther, since that'd ultimately be less (at a time)
---
Thanks man! I hope so. I'd love an ebony pipe rifle for stealth. The petrified trees around the toxic river bed would make sone nice weapons I think
---
...but y, tho? I know there's not really an answer right now, and asking won't get me anywhere.... but... it's just.... Y, tho?
---
Yes, the green ship is the counter telling how long is left on the event clock.
---
Late starters also need to keep in mind that the score needed per rank increases more and more later on the board. Later ranks are a lot more expensive. Someone posted yesterday that the actual halfway point on the board in terms of total raw SCORE points was L67, not L50.
---
&gt; I like trying to make bad things work
---
have you made a Archer/Thrown weapons build yet?
---
Other recipes for regular armour and weapons also give the option to craft the item for different levels once said level is acquired
---
Same. The best use of the first person angle was 'Enter the Void', if games would be able to capture that sensation then I think it would feel a lot more immersive. Otherwise, it all just feels like I'm riding in a slow motion roller coaster. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxb9RCYANxY
---
Honestly, I was expecting to get random skins from the Atom Shop every month if they weren't going to all be somewhat unique.
---
And to be able to wear masks/glasses with it
---
No you are right, I know the E in TSE is nerfed against the SBQ but its still useful for damage.  Popping a bunch of buffs is the key as you can see in many Youtube videos, I learned a lot from viewing them, I didn't even know about the usefulness of a mutation serum until I reached level 220.
---
Yeah both sets I've found were level 45.....So I had to strip it......I was just wondering if it worked like other stuff you craft where you can craft to your level
---
This used to happen alllllll the time when the game first came out
---
shit that's a good point cheers for that, I forgot how close we are getting now! towards another update.  those goodies would be outstandingly cool. my most recent big purchases were both raider bundles, Greenthumb and flyboy bundle. Ha I really need a Fridge well I've stocked up on a little over 1800 atoms in hopes of what today may bring
---
Look like a post apocalyptic ragamuffin! 
---
Nuka Caps or Knee Caps sir, what‚Äôs it to be?
---
I would try to find an instigating for the one shot kill on most mobs in the game. 
---
Then for tankier stuff a junkies ffr.
---
Just alpha strike with the instigating and quick swap if you are fighting bigger stuff.
---
It does, you can craft a level 25 set now and a level 35 set once you reach level 35
---
thx :) I'd kind of given up on her at the moment. I have so many SS Left Legs to get rid of my stash is full
---
You started with the insults but ok. Also there is challenge to bloodied build like constantly losing roads upon dying and going down and having so little health that even a little rads can kill or a simple 1 hit from any enemy  but you aren't willing to learn so I am no longer willing to try to explain
---
I also don‚Äôt run mutations your not alone
---
Still doubtful they‚Äôll limit you doing the quests if you‚Äôre mutated though.
---
Everything you mentioned - flux, plans, etc can be found in the game by playing the damn game. Need flux? Nuke the map. Need plans? Do an event. Will you get them right away? Probably not, but what point would there be if a game gave you everything you wanted on the first try? 
---
As for things costing less, like said mentioned mothman plans...that‚Äôs life. Maybe you should have gotten rid of them sooner instead of holding on to them. And if you got them legitimately you didn‚Äôt loose anything. Be proud that you got them the right way and not because of a dupe. Besides...you can‚Äôt say that you lost anything because you didn‚Äôt know the future, you just played the game the best you could at that given moment, which is all we can really do!
---
You don't like massive propane/oxy cylinders stacked on eachother??? :)
---
My dream is a 'craftsman' bench, which amalgamates weapon/armor/tinker. That'd be epic. 
---
Plus, having some DIY experience I don't see why you'd need separate benches as after the gun bench an ammo press isn't that huge in order for one bench to also make ammo... Or weapon and tinker together??
---
That'd be a good atom store item Todd. Please note. 
---
P.s Todd your ammo converter is a cumbersome fucking eyesore. Surely my lame terminal didn't need an equally ugly doppelganger. Ammo converter is way too big to fit into precision tiny-CAMPs. 
---
As a tiny CAMP man I choose one bench for scrapping (chem atm, sometimes do tinker) and just use overland or other players ones. This can help with space as you generally don't need to access weapon/armor/PA that often unless you're taking an absolute beating regularly.
---
I run Bloodied but either user my [shotgun](http://imgur.com/a/UH5Xw17), [assault rifle](http://imgur.com/a/Cx7VgUk), or [spear](http://imgur.com/a/c4OF8bz).
---
Haven't really tried 1 handed it unarmed yet.
---
I already have the instigating. But I can't take down scorchbeasts or Mirelurk Queens
---
No problem. Happy to help.
---
It was an individual item, quite popular, so hopefully it will come back again 1 day for you to snap it up at a cheap price.
---
NOICE
---
Its probably going to be the same as ESO, where you caan get small player homes cheap in game, but the larger/cool ones will cost actual money
---
Exactly
---
I gave up making my dude. Edited a few things and just wanted to play. I suppose I could go back and mess with it but I‚Äôm too lazy and I wear the Chinese stealth helmet anyway so I don‚Äôt usually see ‚Äúmy‚Äù face.
---
Edit: caps lock because fat fingers.
---
Fingers crossed we get some gems!! :)
---
Yeah, but I just mean it would be thematically appropriate to have legendary armor perks for non-mutated folks come with them. It probably won‚Äôt affect anything in the storyline, though it might be clever if the dialogue changes depending on mutations.
---
Platform?
---
Maybe don't bully people in a video game......What an idea
---
I re read your post and saw that. Thats why I recommend the junkies for your secondary. You will get a 50 pct damage boost on every shot with it which helps with big mobs.
---
The camp device is their spawn point, so if it‚Äôs close to foundation, they will get stuck in your camp or get crushed by it. I‚Äôve messaged people to move their devices and they had no idea that was why their pets were dying.  
---
I will keep your idea In mind when I feel like rewriting my whole camp.
---
kinda dumb that they defaulted to blast you in the face with open this/open that, when after 200 levels you werent going to have to actually use them at all
---
The key is you have to have foundation or floor on either side of the wall you want to build. So when you're building your camp, make the base one foundation bigger on each side. The same applies for upper floors. You then can remove the extra floors and foundation pieces once you have it built, but I'd recommend waiting to remove them until you have your entire structure in place in case you have to move something, otherwise you have to rebuild sections of your camp to get the flooring back.
---
Yeah the marine armour helmet, sadly I was away during that event and never had a chance to try and get it. With the amount I work and move around - even during covid as I'm in essential work I don't often get to do these short events.
---
I went to a Line in the Sand event recently where a level 1054 showed up. He hopped up on a pole and from the barriers proceeded to one shot about 80% of all the mobs. All the way out to the road. The other players had to scramble out to the road just for the chance to tag one before he obliterated them.
---
I just put my weapon away and waited for the event to end. What a waste of time.
---
It depends. You can mix and match. I don‚Äôt run junkies, but I know mutations have bigger negatives than junkies addictions in some cases. For each addiction, it is 10% damage up to 50% for the junkies weapons. It still doesn‚Äôt bring it even close to bloodied builds though.
---
a % buff to what?
---
I'm only 50 but I build CAMPS more than actually play. Plus, had a newborn three weeks ago so I feel you on the family time constraints.
---
Solid effort by you though that's awesome to be so far along. I only want the chicken coop, and I'm willing to forfeit everything else so I'll def make it given I'm just behind the other spaceship on the board.
---
Nothing in the game is scary when you have people running around one shotting everything with bloodied builds lol
---
That's amazing. Good work!
---
Oh no, I completely agree with that. When 2/3 of your player base is doing one build, something should probably change. I wasn‚Äôt mutated for like my first 125 levels then got gifted some serums. It‚Äôd be rough going back but I could do it if there was a reason. There isn‚Äôt one right now.
---
Friends...Wish I had 1 of those
---
Shhhh...  quiet!
---
I could not remember to exact total of the secret service armor, somewhere around 9000 I believe. I'm not bothering with any of the factions quests or score stuff anymore. Since I decided that, it's been a better experience.
---
I asked for this a while ago, but bound it to the gold system.  Basically I requested that a legendary plan of every weapon/armor in game should be put up for sale split between Crater and Foundation.
---
Did you get your core back?
---
Just give us pets already
---
Yea, that‚Äôs no way to have to play a game.
---
Are you on PC?
---
I‚Äôve found like 6 of us in this thread now, non mutant gang rise up.
---
not quite, its going to make some people very in-game wealthy, but that has the side effect of making it much easier to acquire end game gear.
---
also consider that the rmt sellers will lose alot of money in the short term because they can't sell their endgame gear for 50-200$ a piece anymore.
---
Yes the Fasnacht donut recipe. But here is the kicker. Did you know they have pepperoni rolls too? I didn't know this until recently. Or how about S'mores.
---
Put in more than 4x what you have and I still enjoy hopping on for an hour a day to do my dailies/weeklies/etc
---
Oh holy shit yeah your flag would be a danger to your pets for sure then. They might get stuck in it. Still useful for a tidy power setup though! :)
---
Oh man Fallout 3 was fine at version 1,but each official patch made the game worse, missing textures and models!
---
And Fallout 4, the quests glitches out so often I got railroaded into only being able to support the Minuteman!
---
Ur not actually! Hating on other people for their build and weapons they use doesnt make you cool. It's a game. It's supposed to be fun üôÇüëçüèª
---
Yes sir!
---
What platform are you on?  PS4 here.
---
Double XP &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Double SCORE
---
The Fork of Horripilation :-)))
---
No I didn't know any of those existed except s'mores because I need it for this stupid ass scout mission for the backpack.....Where do you get these recipes?
---
It takes you 20 minutes? I do it in 20-30 seconds on average but yeah it‚Äôs super annoying the tents and fences do affect it but not as much a staggering here mid air as it resets her attack cycle
---
That Laser Rifle (Wazer Wifle) looks amazing
---
edit: are you missing a finger? Kinda adds to the cosplay
---
I am referring to noobs not knowing that they can actually activate a setting to disable being attacked all together. I got my azz kicked a few times starting out before I learned about pacifist, and I have been running it ever since, as most people do. It should be on by default.   
---
The lesson they learn the hard way is that Bethesda still thinks their game is a pvp game, and no one else, including new players, think it is, nor should be. I think most noobs see everyone running around completly safe in pacifist and do not know why they keep getting killed by the few jackazzes in the game.
---
Ok cool I have to go find that spot cause I need that carry space
---
I had this happen many times , long before wastelanders came out.
---
If all of us non mutants played on the same platform we might be able to fill up half a server.
---
This is how it should always be. That third person reload perspective lol.
---
Not yet, want to get the other plans for thrown weapons, which IIRC is part of meat week.  My current projects are an assassin using nocturnal gear (bit of a roleplay here, run my bar during the day and then go out and hunt legendaries at night) and a drunk monk unarmed with beserkers fist weapon and heavy alcohol use.  I've also been hunting down the "perfect" slayer gear (e.g. Ghoul Slayer with + Rad resist + sentinels).
---
I've been finding 2-4 per run of Riding Shotgun as of this patch.
---
Amazing !
---
Guess we need to mutate more fingers
---
Shit, why can‚Äôt we just have ONE bench that give a UI for all crafting?
---
It's in the south-east corner of the ash heap, I'd still suggest googling the location though 'garrahan mining headquarters'
---
My bad.....I misunderstood your meaning I guess
---
Honestly, any of the STR builds work fine when they are bloodied or junkies. I jump around between all three melee, heavy weapons and shotguns. I've actually found I enjoy one-handed most. It's not super useful on stuff like the queen where I switch to unarmed or heavy, but for general purpose, I can one-shot pretty much everything with my Sheepsquatch Club and I never have to worry about AP, like you do with 2H or Unarmed. Plus it makes it easier to use a Shiskebab to heal if you can actually do damage with it as well.
---
Yes, the layers of RNG you have to go through to get something you want is discouraging.  Having no way to target farm items you want, and vendor caps limiting your progress on top of that is insanity.  
---
I've played games where gearing up is slow but targeted (MMOs generally).  I've played games where gearing up is less targeted but faster paced to compensate (ARPGs, Borderlands, loot-explosions everywhere).  I can't remember the last time I played a game where gearing up was both slow *and* directionless.
---
Definitely will....Are there pretty hard enemies there?
---
yes, a small skin would be great, b/c then i wouldnt need a 2x1 room w/ walls and a roof to store it in
---
Good luck and of you need help I'm happy to oblige, if you want you could  DM me (otherwise this comment section would become a kilometre or mile ;) long)
---
Yeah that's what made me ask
---
Far Harbor or Nuka World would be perfect!
---
Maybe a little large to start with but it all shrinks over time...
---
thx :) Just got to find one now.
---
Anything will stack on top of xcell too, as long as xcell is taken first. Can do xcell + overdrive + whatever
---
Double xp would be great if I still had gameplay I wanted to do for more than 1-2 hours per day. Right now I am just doing my chores each day and then logging off so double score weekend was highly preferred as it means 3 more days of vacation at the end of the run for me.
---
Ok thanks again fellow traveler
---
I did stumble on a Deathclaw taking on a non-legendary Scorchbeast in the Cranberry Bog last week, so I crouched and watched and waited to see who won before picking off the other. 
---
The scorchbeast won, but the Deathclaw got it down to about 50% health.
---
I was vague. I am not very good at getting my point across ;)
---
I have a friend that I play with , he regularly loads 30 seconds before I do. He does not have a ssd. He has the original PS4 that he bought 6 years ago. As do I . Mine has had a harder life.
---
I don't remember that, but that actually sounds more balanced than the current situation. Those things take forever to reload.
---
It‚Äòs never the one gun, one perk card, one armor piece,.... that makes the difference, it all sums up.
---
If you don‚Äòt play stealth you don‚Äòt need a fixer; invest in a handmade.
---
Edit: don‚Äòt get me wrong i am not talking about things like a bloody build using a bloody gun vs non bloody gun thats in fact a huge difference.
---
Makes me wonder when they'll add "increase your C.A.M.P.'s Build Budget by x%" purchases to the Atom shop.
---
Nahh it's all good......I just hate bullies so much
---
I agree with you, but mainly talking about what would happen if all the end game loot are available early on, along side scarp ammo fluxs etc. Personally I‚Äôve arrived at a point where I‚Äôm done with all quests, pre and post wastelanders. And mainly grind for legendary weapons or gear, scrap etc. And so the influx of all those duped items will have some sort of effect on the economy
---
Clean your room
---
Internet down means that it is a good time to put on a movie (if you have dvds) and just do some house chores!
---
yes i found it as well recently after 100s of levels of various chars and i concur
---
pipe is life
---
The most retro-futuristic part of the map - it should definitely be in there.
---
Na, as a higher level its hit and run. See someone, drop useful items (especially if inventory is tight) wave and go. I am Ninja Santa.
---
Is that where you get bleached wood from?......I need some for a water filter
---
It's robots, it shouldn't be hard to sneak past most of them however there is an assaultron which you should try to avoid at all costs, the others should be killable without too much trouble.
---
S'mores recipe is a drop from campfire tales at camp Adams. Pepperoni rolls is from riding shotgun at big bend tunnel east. Fasnacht donuts is from the Fasnacht parade (you may have to wait until next year for the event again. Or just buy from a player vendor who has it.)
---
You can‚Äôt blame people for shooting her in the air, though. Unless they browse this sub, how would they know that doing something logical can fuck up the fight?
---
No way.
---
Now... an Imposter Deathclaw... ... .. . . .  . ..  ...
---
Have you tried spamming the interact button to see if after some taps you get a dialogue?
---
Adreal Reaction is nice to have.
---
That's always the catch isn't it!! Lol. 
---
Good luck!!
---
Me too. Especially in FO76. 90% of people are very friendly. Bullies are rare in the game from my experience, though they do exist.
---
How many hours have many of us each put into this game? Put that same amount of hours into another game. Prob not for myriad reasons.
---
Tired of the grind....take a break. Want the stuff without playing for it. BUY IT.
---
oh you feel like you are wasting your time....It's a VIDEO GAME. They all about entertaining us while wasting time!! Not entertained. Move on. 
---
So what are we actually complaining abut?
---
u/Valseek u/Ladydevann u/CM_PipBoy u/LoneVaultWanderer
---
It‚Äôs great!
---
Yep, I just got a death claw after the dog I had died. I don‚Äôt know how a level 3 dog lasted  months, but he did.
---
Yep, spammed a ton. No dialogue windows.
---
Flipping good! Only thing that looks jarring to me is the drinks bottle.
---
It looks to modern &amp; plastic. Like you have a coca cola bottle. Id lose that but the rifle is epic.
---
Other than that it is brill!
---
I'd get an old glass coke bottle from the 60s or 50s &amp; fill it with water &amp; light blue/aqua food colouring. To look like Quantum Nuka Cola. Add the appropriate label etc. That way people's brains won't immediately think coca cola
---
pets do go missing but people can kill them with explosive bait even if your in pacifists mode. Why I started using the vault Tec camp so no one can kill itüòÇ and as a person who loves taming great idea!
---
Ohhh ok I thought the Fasnacht thing was just a regular mission but I may have the s'mores one cause I've done that mission a ton although I hate it
---
thanks I'm going to need it
---
I couldn't keep track of how often I gained score from the Repeatable Weekly during 2XP. It was awesome.
---
However, 2XSCORE made a bigger dent in my progress overall.
---
I paid for the rounds so im gonna use it!
---
Im not sure if your aware that they changed the timer for OvL.
---
You used to have the full 30 mins to summom the nightwalker.
---
Now the event can still go 30 mins, but you need to summon the nightwalker in the first 10 minutes or the event will fail. 
---
You can still run out the clock after the nightwalker has spawned, but Ive had mixed results with the ghouls respawning sometimes but not others. As soon as the nightwalker is killed the event completes.
---
This game is pretty good for not starting PvP compared to other games. Turning on Pacifist mode or not accidentally hitting other players and avoiding Workshops means you'll probably never have to deal with it. Yeah this is a surprisingly nice community.
---
Looks solid. Well done.  
---
A tip a buddy gave me years ago when some of his friends did similar: take a dishrack, spray paint shades of red, brown, and orange, then bend, warp, and break as needed.  
---
Winds up looking a fair bit like wire mesh and fencing, without actually having to track those down.
---
now that they have a database of officially warned cheaters.. Im expecting the next round of bans to be brutally ruthless for those who have this warning on their account..
---
Yeah, that's the place. Toxic valley is full of it
---
I'm glad I havnt run into any in my time for the last 2 weeks I just started playing......I now just loot anything that's not nailed down and try to help lower levels out
---
Ohhh ok so I need to find that place and farm that wood
---
The worst thing is that fallout is adopting dailies and systems from other games
---
COMMIES!

Might be a long shot.. but have you looted the overseers cache? Just trying to think with you now lol..

Not for me. I get splash screen THEN menu.
---
Not making veiled insults to strangers might help.
---
I'm the target of this comment and I don't like it üòÇ
---
Yeah I get that and I'm not saying we should get mad at them. But there are people on this sub that still fence sit and staggering her mid-air. That's what my comment was about.
---
Sadly no, xbox.
---
The dish rack is a pretty good idea, i will try it when I have the time. Thank you.
---
Everyone can see you‚Äôre on chems.....go sleep it off.
---
Damn I'm also the target of this comment too......Guess I've got some rebuilding to do
---
Middle Mountain Cabins near the Whitespring is probably the easiest.
---
Are you on two main questlines at once? Try to advance the other a tad.
---
If you mean the one downstairs, then yes. I'm thinking that I should maybe complete the missing link quest l, which should unlock new dialogue with her. But that is the only solution I can think of.
---
I don't use mutations. I use too much Radaway to have one for any longer than 20 minutes.
---
Ah ok..it was making my mind boggle. In a way it would have matched the cosplay. 
---
Youre gonna find that wasteland POS who took your finger
---
Agree 100%. It‚Äôs that goddamn perk.
---
You're quite welcome. Keep up the good work.
---
Yeah that's what I'm thinking. Maybe completing The Missing Link will help
---
Don't forget about the place where Rose sends you to make friends with one...always a guaranteed spawn, though lately there's also usually a mob fighting the local eagles
---
Nobody ruins the game, there is no competition or meta in this game. This is an adventure and exploration game, I give 2 fucks about anyone but me and my friend. Dupe your items, make yourself loose fun in the game and stop playing, that's what you are going to get with that mindset.
---
Or if they gave other ways to get score than just dailies and weeklies.
---
How about a repeatable do 15 events for 100?
---
Pipe is life
---
I have that Nuka Cola vending machine. Its there for players to take a couple, just remember to share!
---
A level 23 came in to my CAMP, took one, then went back and spammed the vending machine removing all but 2. I called them out, said ‚Äúhey, they‚Äôre for everyone‚Äù and the response I got was emoted question marks.
---
Seriously, you got something for free, don‚Äôt you think others would like to too? Or was it, because it was free/unlocked the thought was to grab it and go before it was noticed by the owner?
---
Seriously, is our game getting more selfish? It used to be everyone was great and friendly. To be fair its still largely like that, but griefing, trolls and hacking just seems to be getting worse.
---
Yeah this is a big problem. I also hate how the crate spawns are not truly randomized. There are select places where orange crates are almost guaranteed to spawn. There's other places where if you land, you won't find any crates at all, of any color.  This results in everyone basically gravitating toward the same damn places.
---
I think that would be it, the missing link would lead you to rose
---
most assuredly it works.  i do it every day; i have an entire gallery of characters that didnt survive one whole day in appalachia lol
---
Pet Rabbit +1 Luck
---
Yeah, I'll try that
---
It's the best way I've been able to describe it ;) haha glad you like it
---
I've been playing since beta. It has taken me forever to get the S'mores recipe. I finally got it probably right before seasons started. So I know what you mean about that event. Now I'm at a comfortable level where I can enjoy most events because I have my character sorted out better.
---
Lol muggle.
---
Double Score only added score to challenges, most of which did not require you to play with others.
---
Double XP is best utilized with events and nukes, which fosters group play.
---
I had a fun bug yesterday where my dragon had 20 shots in it. Went to a queen fight and unloaded on here. That was fun.
---
yeah silent fusion generator would be awesome! I purposely have my turrets setup halfway down the road away from my base so I dont have to hear them lol
---
I just went ahead and rebuilt my camp luckily my camps not too difficult didn't take long.
---
yeah, they somehow took one of the most feared fallout enemies and made them kittens. when I hear the tell tale roar, I'm actually relieved because they are so easy to kill.
---
Oh that‚Äôs a cool idea! Never thought about that!
---
I was just about to say that. Had my camp up there for a while. OP just has to be very precise where he places his camp module since the camp border barely reaches both deposits.
---
Shit I'm only level 30 so there may be a good chance I don't even have it now.....lol
---
what platform
---
Watoga is an awesome place. Going there for a wedding this weekend!
---
Why on earth would you want some of them since some contradict each other, plus plague walker sucks
---
Pets should be un-killable.
---
Allies can't be killed, so no reason pets should be.
---
Honestly it depends on your schedule.  I liked this double score weekend since I was already booked up this weekend with other events, it was nice to log in and bang out the dailies.  That being said, the double XP felt more gratifying since I rolled the 10K repeatable multiples times per event.
---
I'm just happy to be officially ahead of Dr. Zorbo now by just doing my daily/weekly and not stacking INT buffs.
---
Pretty good! Would add more dirt effect to the clothes perhaps. But that‚Äôs just cause I like the dirty look since it seems more realistic to me and since I go missing and hiking a lot and do a dirty job haha
---
Lol.....So it just counts for your normal character even though you used a noob character?
---
Marsupial isn't really a "cheat code". You can't jump away from enemies all that well, they're still able to melee you in most cases.
---
Being able to path around terrain though, that is hard enough on it's own with this old, dated engine. Being able to jump a little higher goes a long way.
---
I know it has been said several times but that cosplay looks amazing. I really like how that laser rifle turned out - especially how you were able to make it look old and rusted.
---
no
---
Can confirm. If there's a tent, I'm on it, along with 3 other people. She lands consistently.
---
TIL Bethesda doesn't know deaf people exist.
---
Thank you kind stranger......You've helped me out immensely
---
Check your recipes at the cook station. If you have it you should be able to craft it.
---
First time I did it I was lvl 20 and I was chilling Ina fence getting shots,she was landing too lol
---
I'd say it's more of a balance &amp; combat AI issue. I'm lvl 155, full health, full set of buttressed SS armor, and lvl 91 deathclaws can still take me out in two swipes. The trick is to sneak up on them and drop them before they can get near you. That part is too easy, especially with VATS + a shotgun (1-2 VATS headshots will drop a deathclaw regardless of level). 
---
If they got a bit more damage resit and were a bit smarter at evasive maneuvers so that they're more likely to be able to get close to you, they'd be a whole lot more difficult.
---
That said, before I was level 70 or so, deathclaws would wreck me every single time. They definitely inspired fear in me, but I outgrew that fear once I got some decent weapons and armor. 
---
Now the only things that scare me are mirelurk kings.
---
Ohh while I have your attention and you seem pretty knowledgeable......Do you have any thoughts on a good spot for lower level assultron spawns?
---
Oh man, ran into that once while playing with my husband and he was able to fix it. It didn‚Äôt explode for us but it would have been wild if it did!
---
I have no friends.What veiled insult?
---
With class freak the negatives get a lot less, strange in numbers increases the positives.
---
Plus i don‚Äôt need to use starched genes since i don‚Äôt worry about accidentally gaining more mutations since i have them all
---
No real worry of losing mutations because i can go to a River to regain what i lost.
---
Foundation has plans for dirt crop plots in Samuel if you are Friendly or Neighborly I believe.
---
I'll have to check once I'm on...... Hopefully I have it.....If not I'll have to farm......Is it a quest reward or does it spawn at that spot?
---
Forgive me since I'm not very versed on junkies, but I thought Xcell was not really taken for Junkies since the negatives were too hard. (-2 to all specials)
---
Well we are already assuming cats and dogs are coming to the game due to the fact that when Wastelanders came out there were emotes in the atom shop very briefly that were pet related such as tricks etc
---
How is 2k damage is less OP if it's a different weapon? Well except for a mini nuke.
---
I guess your right, although I still think plague walker sucks
---
What I asked is what ate those perks?
---
Does the front sight ring show up when using the skin? 
---
EDIT: oh so the skin completely replaces the front sight ring. Great. The one thing I wanted from this stupid season.
---
If you have bad prices in your shop I kill your pets btw have killed a fuckton of Brahmen
---
Double exp is for levels in addition to score, which will catch some of the people who don't care about score.
---
I want a red rocket and Slocums Joe one.
---
I‚Äôve been enjoying the Chinese stealth suit, just don‚Äôt get hit, repairs are a beast
---
*Reloads in Patriotism*
---
I did not know this.. . I believe I still see sneak crits appear on the upper L corner, and a bump in the dmg number, while on a team in public and in caution.
---
If you mean the Armco ammunition appliance which you get from the raiders for Gold than you are obviously allowed to place it down but you can‚Äôt place it at your friends camp
---
Step 1: place your C.A.M.P.
---
Step 2: place the sleeping bag.
---
Step 3: take a nap
---
Step 4: success
---
I‚Äôm a berserker. Tent/fence sitting prevents me from getting one hit. Also, she lands pretty frequently when I am doing the event.
---
Whoops, kinda forgot that. I'm on XB1. (I'm a third shifter still awake for some reason)
---
Everybody kills my crawlers, like I'm serving them xp on a plate. I usually won't even go to that event on public anymore.
---
Well it‚Äôs primarily PvE, but it should be PvP - it *is* a *survival* game after all. Part of *surviving* is having to adapt to any threat you come across or die. Including other players. On the other hand, PvP shouldn‚Äôt be forced upon someone. And it isn‚Äôt. To initiate PvP, I have to shoot you, then you have to shoot back. When one of us dies, you have to deliberately seek revenge. I would say that‚Äôs about as far from forcing PvP onto you as possible.
---
i know about the stealth suit but sometimes i need the UNY bonuses for stuff like carryweight or crits
---
I agree. I've only been logging in for the dailies, I don't play enough hours to hit the weekly XP repeatable. Even with the double XP weekend, I was constantly 8 or 9 spaces behind Zorbo. After double SCORE I'm now only one space behind him.
---
I had been planning to use the atoms I've been earning to make it to the end, but now I think I'll actually be able to get there on my own, so I can actually use all these atoms to shop!
---
The raider reputation one? Thats safe to use. But you only can place that you own camp.
---
The cheated one from the workshop? Thats is an exploit...
---
Event reward from campfire tales.
---
Which do you need and what platform are you on? I'm on PS4 and have a handful of spares. I'm not sure which I have at the moment but could check later today. I'm largely in the same boat as you, but I still need a bunch of those expensive Whitespring plans and then the usual really rare ones.
---
Bloody mess = +15% damage straight up
---
Yes, it has bad withdrawals. But if the goal was to have no negatives and stack active drugs, then this is an option.
---
I personally don't use it on my junkie
---
Can you buy it before fully joining?..... Because I want those plans but I don't want to fully join them
---
Damage numbers are higher in VATS, I mean sure the handling is better on a handmade but it's all about the Damage
---
Pipe is Life.
---
Well yes but I‚Äôm wanting to discuss options and going even deeper than just having a fuzzy or scaly friend around the camp. I‚Äôm wanting to see what in depth ideas people have around pets and companion animals/pets for adventuring and the buffs and options that can come with them. Get creative ya know? :)
---
I leveled up both my character and my score just crafting ammo at one point during the double xp weekend
---
Your best bet is a full uny set. I run a full 2* heavy combat uny ap set and it's great.
---
The best you can get is probably a uny, ap, htd wood set. But all you really need is a 1* uny though ap is nice to have as well
---
Spawns in the parking lot outside the Cranberry Glade.
---
Pipe is Life
---
I have not found that chems sell well.  If you are low level, they are too expensive.  But when you are high level, you end up with so many you sell them to vendors regularly.
---
Ammo sells as long as it's 1 cap each.  Rare outfits sell as long as you don't get greedy.  Same with rare plans.
---
The location of your camp matters a lot too.  Like any store, you want to be near traffic.  Somewhat near a train station is usually your best bet, or not too far from a popular event location.
---
Currently level 12... at 10, I collected a frame and some Raider parts and didn't understand why I couldn't use them- figured out the lvl 15 requirement later- so I ditched them.  Didn't occur to me to keep the frame by itself!
---
im not sure of the metrics but i‚Äôm fairly certain they can rock. i‚Äôve got a bffr pipe revolver rifle that i‚Äôm fairly certain (dont wanna feed you misinformation tho) was hitting almost as hard as my lever action... also, a bffr auto pipe can be super fun and hit pretty well also. not as high numbers as something like a fixer of course, but still fun. also, the auto pipe rifle has such a cool firing sound...
---
Just wear broken zealots armor and you'll have 75%dmg reduction, along with blocker you should be fine on the ground.
---
Your post can be interpreted as ‚Äòanyone still playing this game has mental health issues‚Äô. 
---
Your premise begins from a position of negative assumptive bias. 
---
If your approach had been *‚ÄòI‚Äôve gotten burned out on this game; what are the rest of you doing that maintains your interest?‚Äô*, that would be different. 
---
Perhaps it‚Äôs not what you meant. But the way you present yourself to others is a significant factor in how easily you make friends.
---
Oh that's easy as to why not. 
---
They don't give a fuck.
---
If you know the game mechanics, sure. New players do not. They see some lvl 200 in power armor attacking them, get a message saying they are under attack, and they fight back, naturally, enabling pvp. There is not a messages explaining that you can turn off pvp. You have to learn that yourself.
---
It‚Äôs happened several times in my group
---
The act of seeking revenge upon death is pretty deliberate. Noob or otherwise.
---
The worst thing to a game like fallout 76 are mmorpg systems like dailies and over balancing
---
AND I have yet to find the wind instrument plans.... sigh
---
Yeah it is. I thought thats why its not online yet? Cause they wanted to "rework" it.
---
Thank you! I made the rust effect with brown and orange acrylic paint and applied it with a sponge.
---
How is she going to amass her arsenal of weapons then? Still wondering what she's going to do with the 16 tonnes of guns she has?
---
I would 100% buy the Vault-tec reactor skins for the fusion generator.  Wouldn't make it smaller, but would be nice change.
---
While we're at it, can we also get a sorry emote and a laughing emote. Both are essential. Sorry is pretty self explanatory, but the laughing one will be great because there are so many funny things in fo76 and funny people playing
---
Or you don't seek revenge, get respawned, get attacked again, see that you are under attack again, fight back again, get killed again and repeat. There is nothing to let a new player know that if they do not fight back that they cannot be hurt. They can only learn this through experimenting or someone explaining it to them.
---
If you‚Äôre teammates aren‚Äôt in your proximity, then yeah you‚Äôll still see sneak crits while in a team, but other than that, it won‚Äôt work while in a team. For example, if your teammate is somewhere at the top of the map and you‚Äôre somewhere down the bottom, then yeah sneak will work as intended and you‚Äôll be seeing sneak crits.
---
Wait a minute I need to look this info up
---
Hahaha
---
Ok cool thanks
---
Alright thank you. I guess I'm gonna take the risk
---
It also occasionally makes you emote at like twice the speed. It's pretty funny
---
No you dont
---
That's amazing!
---
Got it......Ok I'll check it out......Thanks for the knowledge friend
---
How close is too close? Need good social distancing?
---
Canada and Mexico were annexed in the Fallout universe....
---
THAT MUST MAKE YOU A COMMUNIST! AAH!
---
Yea bad habits are hard to break.
---
Nice to know
---
Thank you!
---
Yeah, I don‚Äôt really care about an optimal build as long as I can enjoy the late game and not be on the struggle bus against every enemy I fight
---
My pleasure, buddy
---
Awesome
---
thats how RNG rolls yo
---
Berserker mean no armor.
---
Yup no problem!
---
You can break the armor so it gives no dr but still get the legendary  bonuses
---
I was happy to get double score since I‚Äôm a gamepass noob, it helped make up a bit of lost time on the game board. Probably can‚Äôt get all the rewards but there‚Äôs still some cool stuff in there for newbies!
---
Try adjusting your monitor's color settings.
---
So you're saying I shouldn't go for the gauss shotgun? Was really looking forward to making a build with it.
---
I am impressed
---
It just works‚Ñ¢
---
Works just fine for most people. It hard to say it doesn‚Äôt work because I have x pc when someone with the same could have no issues
---
Interesting tactic. And super weird.
---
If you want to join my discord, there will be XB1 folks that can make you as many marine helmets as you like
---
Well you also got flux, improved repair kits, some plans right?
---
Eventually you‚Äôd see for yourself even if you‚Äôre not experimenting. I was attacked on my first character at level 23, and me being me, one shotting most things level 50+ at that point, thought I was hard enough to shoot back. So I did. Hell was rained on me from an explosive Gatling plasma. When I respawned and he came at me again, I thought ‚ÄúOh shit I‚Äôm gonna die again‚Äù but nope, when he rained his legacy hell on me again, I noticed I didn‚Äôt even take damage.
---
use first aid perk lvl 3 and holster your weapon (for instant stimpack use) - holding 3 conduits wont be a problem now
---
I know this, put way too many hours into the game. Yes on having two weapons. Got downvoted for some stupid shit, because people can‚Äôt critically think. Smh
---
Anyways, I have the weapons to where I can click the left game pad and it‚Äôll switch between the two. Literally not even 2 secs to switch. 
---
I will say I don‚Äôt
---
Use it for PVP, for I use Explosive Laser or Anti Handmade Rifle. Execution is pretty good
---
Against bloodied as they health is so far down, but since there‚Äôs a cap it doesn‚Äôt really matter.
---
That makes you a bad person... and btw I don't have a vendor at my camp. I don't sell anything to other players and I don't buy anything from them. The cat just dissapered because of bug or something else. It wasn't killed.
---
Yeah try using it with a chinese stealth suit. Good times with zerker weapons doing that. Plus you still get the rad res even if the armor is broken
---
Bro, I love my furious walking cane and stalkers pool cue! -.-
---
This bundle is still awesome and by far my favorite purchase I've made ü•∞ü•∞ I'm so glad they brought it back as I didn't play the game when it first came out.
---
The whole point of the limit is so u can‚Äôt get more items that would cost scrip so adding this would defeat the point of the limit. It would be just easier to raise the limit
---
Aw the 4th? The boys and i were hoping it was today. Oh well, what‚Äôs another week? Hype!
---
Unfortunately I am on xbox
---
Dont worry, I have a sloth vanish for 3 whole weeks before it came sauntering back during a scorchbeast fight, only to instantly die.
---
Play on pc, rly, no chat there
---
I actually dont have xcell withdrawal cause it's so scarce so instead I have daddo addiction sense its minor debuffs. I was more or less saying that it's a option
---
scrip
---
It's not just the queen. Did Project Paradise with a group of people last night, and I got a 1* Mutants rolling pin from the LVL 100 alpha sheepsquatch. The last 3 times I completed that event, I got walking sticks! Walking sticks! Every. Freaking. Time.
---
I run a set of wood unyielding with one chameleon.  The protection is decent but the repair costs are cheap.  I love it.  Plus my whole armor set weighs less than 3 lbs.
---
Full unyielding with a Chinese stealth suit when you gotta go in nuke zone.
---
Edit: shadowed is supposedly only good on leather. (According to Angry Turtle unless this info is now out of date?) As for light/sturdy/heavy well I‚Äôd say whichever you can get or like the look of or prefer.
---
I had all auto completed except i was left with 2/3 on complete an event and 1/3 kill a Deathclaw. I know I killed the game while logging in because I realized I was logging in an alt and didn't want to wait to load in, log out etc.
---
I have had the opinion that a server wipe is necessary for the future of this game. I think there could be some clever ways on how to do it and  here is my suggestion. would really like to have a discussion about this and point out any flaws.  
---
\- They will need to make a better trading system before doing this, and look over the currencies  and try to make them airtight. Also remove all caps on caps,scrip and gold buillion. There would need to be some things to counter inflation but i think it is ok and normal for a player with 1000 hours of playtime to be a "Millionaire" if he has put time and effort towards that goal. Some good suggestions on this is to have a bank where you can put the money in for safe keeping and then only draw out x amount a day. It will collect interests. Also if people want to farm legendaries all the time and roll the dice at the purveyor they should be able to. or if they want to farm a certain resource and make caps from that they should be able to.   
---
\- The server wipe should be optional. People should have the choice of doing it. You can choose to do so and live in the new improved system. Or you can stay in the old system with all your stuff. Eventually everyone will move if the new system is really better.   
---
\-People should be able to choose one weapon and one armor set of their choice over to the "new way of things" along with up to 1000 ammo of their choosing.   
---
\-There should be an option to reset all quests (maybe im not seeing the problem with that)
---
If you don't already have Starched Genes, Class Freak and Bloody mess maxed, that would be the first place to go. I usually run one point in Psychopath and Grim Reapers Sprint because I use my explosive Gatling gun with vats to pick off the adds and it helps refresh my ap which is really important in power armor. For the third perk, I usually use pharma farma for those sweet chems, but better criticals would also probably be good. But if you only use rapid fire heavy weapons, you're probably better off moving those perk points to INT and adding some more power armor skills.
---
The lady in the travelling hub? Yeah...
---
No you're not alone man, pure human here
---
Awesome, really cool!
---
Ants are always fun but the real killers are a pack of Cave Crickets or Glowing Kings. Ouch, help!
---
I'm not sure but I've found if I do those things in that order it works. But it has to be in that order for example if I take psychotats before the Berry menta I lose the psycho when i consume the berry.
---
i think shadowed leather armor gives you the most benefit, shrouded wood makes you sneak faster but the additional sneak effect is not as strong as other armor with shadowed
---
We don‚Äôt need more bush pussies.
---
I saved one I got 1-1/2  years ago, it's hanging on the wall in my C.A.M.P.   Its a nice two shot but getting mauled trying to reload it is no fun.
---
So many people had this although you are the first one I've seen who aborted the load in :D
---
If they won't listen to us that this is a thing now it will never be fixed
---
Wow nice job.
---
Yep Alcohol, Overdrive, X-Cell, berry mentats &amp; Psycho/tats/buff. That's the order that works for me.
---
I was pretty disappointed when I discovered that. I had almost all of my perks animated and wanted to swap out one of my non animated ones for an animated one, but nope it only goes to 2/3 won't let me have another 3/3
---
Xp is king üëë
---
correct.  all C.H.O.R.E.S. points are universal to ur acct.  when you collect the prize (eg lunchboxes) make sure you do it on your main tho as that is unique to the character that collects it
---
Ye its annoying, hopefully they unban me again in the nxt unban wave, im sure youll get your account back.
---
I think you completely missed the point of what I said...
---
Flux, plans, junk are all the current in-game currency since caps are worthless. However, because of duping they are no longer worth anything. Let me know how long it takes you to get 1k flux, and how much of your inventory needs to be dropped in order to hold that much. I‚Äôm not asking them to destroy the RNG, but your response of ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the way it is‚Äù is just a cop out.
---
If someone has the potentially to make money and then that potential is taken away, they did lose something. Potential wealth is just as important as current wealth. Just ask any investor. Being proud when the other guy walks away with the rewards for minimal effort doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense.
---
Also, I‚Äôm just confused by your last sentence. For whatever reason you‚Äôre treating duping like it isn‚Äôt a problem then tell me that I need to ‚Äúplay the damn game‚Äù because ‚Äúwhat point would there be if a game gave you everything you wanted on the first try?‚Äù 
---
Bud that‚Äôs literally what dupers are doing. I‚Äôve thrown thousands of scrips into a void hoping for an unyielding ss or bloodied gauntlet and will continue to do that. Your argument is inconsistent and despite you for whatever reason using it to tell me I‚Äôm wrong only reinforces that duping should be stopped.
---
All the respect and sorry if the words sounds harsh as I‚Äôm really not trying to be, but please reread what you had sent! The logic you‚Äôre using is just taking the standard logic used against duping and adding some extra words to make it seem like it‚Äôs the honest player‚Äôs fault.
---
But isn't that a good metaphor for the world before the war? That it's the same after? Death, violence, boredom?
---
That‚Äôs so cool, at first I thought it was straight from the games
---
The costume looks really good, the laser rifle looks great and really completes the package.
---
Yep. According to the community calendar it's the 4th, but it's been pushed back before.
---
Not to step on your expectations or anything, just pointing it out to temper'em.
---
A week's a good time to get prepped, if nothing else.
---
I'd like to introduce you to my religion
---
Imagine new boss event. With deathclaw matriarch and you with friends trying to snatch deathclaw egg.
---
And waking up whole nest on the way.
---
Sneak by or go full guns. Choice choices
---
Are you connected to the internet?
---
100%. I launched a nuke and was alone for the first 5 minutes.  By the end of it, 3 people showed and we failed miserably.  Barely a dent in the queen's health bar after the mutation.  Sad.
---
Sit on it and the experience totally changes. Doesn‚Äôt last as long but is way more intense. 
---
Pipe is butt.
---
How many FUs does that build use compared to the full sized Fusion Generator though? I like quiet of course, just concerned about the ole family CAMP budget.
---
Are you on Windows 10 with multiple GPUs/switchable graphics? If so, right click on the desktop, select Screen Settings, find Graphics settings at the bottom, then browse for Fallout76.exe and set it to high performance.
---
Power armour and spamming stimpacks also works
---
Honestly it doesn't really effect anything if you do or don't join. Just max out rep for both factions and you'll be all set.
---
And no, it's not a base plan you learn. After thinking on it a bit I believe it's Neighborly that you get the plan available to you.
---
You should be so proud of yourself!
---
Budget is something the player manages. If you buy everything in the atom store don‚Äôt expect to show it all at once. As someone who has almost everything in the store I still buy new atom store loot because I change my camp very frequently.
---
The flux and the repair kits are the reward. The rest isn‚Äôt the point. Though I do agree the drops from a supposed end game boss could and probably should be better, at least a guaranteed 3 star drop. 
---
I just do it for something to do mostly. And I rarely use more than one or 2 cores for ultracite Gatling laser. Well worth the flux alone.
---
No, just don‚Äôt shoot her until she lands.
---
Hahaha, same but with cooking food!  :D
---
Lol .....C.H.O.R.E.S
---
I use a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet with the extra claw. Can‚Äôt remember the other 2 legendary effects. But with my right perks. Without any food or drug buffs. I‚Äôm doing around 1,600 damage. 
---
Whenever I fight the queen and I switch to sneak and take a few buffs, each punch to her face does around 2,000-2,500.
---
If they put in officially I would hope it would be like a local thing only.
---
"server" or "region (meaning area of the map)" would just be flooded with nonsense.
---
Yes, this. Walking up to them is so much better than using the gun. If you're on PS4 I can help at some point too.
---
Try chameleon set. You need one harder to detect, 3-4 ap pieces, one shrouded wood and one shadowed mod (doesn't need to be leather). The rest can be played with, ultralite on all. The chest should be dense and you can swap in a ss jetpack as needed.
---
With that set you can run low agility (run 7 here) and still be invisible.
---
That would be nice.  Even with double xp I‚Äôm still 2 spots behind the zorbinator
---
The Responders questline and other areas shows how brutal the Brotherhood of Steel was to regular people, shaking them down for resources that those people needed themselves. There seems to be a lot about good wishes versus power in this game.
---
I‚Äôm like in bad unyeilding gear with Ss jet pack and bloodied shotgun keeping Aggro by hopping in the air (other players break the jet pack and you can like stay at her level) while the other guys are in PA sit on their tents üòÖ I enjoy it though
---
Oh god yes, I was telling my boyfriend yesterday that the tents need a bench! I'd be willing to forgo a scrap box for a bench instead
---
That‚Äôd be nice. I‚Äôd throw money for some of the nice ESO instanced areas
---
the reason i would like to see some changes is just by default the scrip system is heavily geared to the casual player base. I personally would like to see more content for the hardcore player base than do ur scrip runs daily and then that's it.
---
My head cannon is that there are so many now and a lot of them are weak, but overtime they will come out on top. Them having to battle and destroy all these other monsters (that arent there in the "future" fallout games) could be what helps make them the top notch monster in a few years.
---
right?  its not the user's responsibility to not use the product at a certain time of day in order to fix a progammer's error.  fixit, dice!
---
Same here, at level 365 I don't even pay attention to leveling up anymore.  I do take advantage of the double xp and score mostly because I am a sucker for the grind.
---
Where is your location. Im never happy lol
---
great work!
---
Is it actually proven for sure? Just wondering since I don‚Äôt do it but I am never really sure if it actually stops the Queen from landing. Also does the same thing happen when standing in the bunker? People tell me it does but I‚Äôm skeptical
---
Scrip*
---
Yep.

[this is basically what I run and I fuck shit up on the reg..](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=6b445ce&amp;d=sa0sg2pd2pk2e82c72i11ic2a72lr2pp0pl2lt2a02e00a31lv1l71ao0an0ar1p00sv0sb0lk2lb0&amp;w=p80p90c52ij2i42iq2pa0lm0ed3i30ia0i50if2ik0&amp;m=5c8&amp;am=-13-1f-1321-1d&amp;wp=w5w5w5w5&amp;wm=1a2936-1124-17-1d)
---
Im not soloing SBQs and encryptids or anything like that.. but I 1 shot mobs as well as any bloodied or junkies..
---
its not like.. MOAR Damage!!!.. kills mobs faster once youre already 1 shotting everything...
---
I must admit tho.. **ZoMg!!** sometimes I have to use 2 bullets to kill a spongey mob.. TWO.. imagine that...
---
As a PC user I too have experienced the fast travel to the [Bathesda.net](https://Bathesda.net) Launcher feature. I try to tell myself it must be my filthy casual memory. At least the digital kind where the game resides of course. I think the game has memory leaks and/or hits graphics anomalies that cause it to re-spawn occasionally. Broken pointers and the like are tough to ignore.
---
Pipe is life.
---
I mnove my camp almost every 3 days. I get bored really fast and i love building.
---
Scrip it, scrip it real good...
---
Jesus max I get with my neathook with around 1k. What buffs do you to use?! That's insane!
---
well considering you are level 30 any that you bought would be level 30. It would be best to wait until at least level 50 so you are getting max level for your weapons. It is still RNG so you will probably go through thousands of scrip before you get one that you like. I have had better luck buying weapons from people's vendors than from the purveyor. Most people aren't going to be selling awful weapons in their vending machines and usually have 2 or 3 weapons. Most of the weapons aren't for my build, but when they do I can buy it instead of buying a weapon and both hoping it is good and hoping it is the weapon that I want.
---
PS4 I noticed insanely fast reloads on my .50 caliber. I had just use some fireworks I recall and checked my buffs to see if I had something I wasn‚Äôt aware of, but it was nothing, so best guess is it‚Äôs the fireworks
---
Yea I just tell them to go to my C.A.M.P. to see what I have.
---
It boggles my mind that something so basic is an issue in 2020. Especially in a game that‚Äôs rich in lore.
---
Try a full troubleshooters set, med-x or -25% vs robots magazine.
---
I'm just working towards the Chinese stealth suit honestly. But you also kind of helped make my point, that's a stack of hoops to find all the proper pieces to be good vs low health just slaps on 3 to 5 unyielding pieces and they're golden. That said I have a piece or two something like this in my vending machine I'll see what it's like, thanks.
---
I've noticed that when it breaks (usually when I'm aiming for the head)  if i disengage VATS and target a limb or torso it starts working again.
---
Bad
---
That would be great - thanks, I'll do that.
---
Where is the "pay to skip" option I keep hearing about or is it not "active" yet but is planned?
---
I run an instigating explosive lever with a useless third, picked it up cheap, for literally caps, and i can normally one shot almost anything i point it at, and that's with only 9 perception. A proper build would break it. Truthfully been looking for an ie hunting for awhile now.
---
E: poop, I read your edit. Junkies Limb/Junkies FFR would both have better dps for a lever.
---
Yikes...
---
I did this before, but there was an intelligence check that I failed to fix the bot when the new core started to overload.
---
Someone hasnt ever fought a cazador, I see.
---
All these people that only played the first few hours of Fallout 4 that think Deathclaws are scary.  They never were unless you were a noob with no gear.  The only reason people have any fear of them is they throw you at one basically right out the gate in FO4.  Of course it is going to look scary then....
---
Sadly that message pops up even when you don't hit a legendary enemy. As long as it's in a certain distance from you that message will pop up. Would not believe the number of legendaries I've missed because some blood eagle or cultist killed them.
---
Being able to jump onto the roof of a car is one thing, jumping onto the roof of a building is another.
---
Sounds like some great tips
---
Thank you very much! It actually is a coca Cola bottle. That was a last minute idea because I thought it would be funny.
---
I‚Äôll be honest, I‚Äôve seen people say it matters and other say it doesn‚Äôt. 
---
Personally, I‚Äôm still *on the fence* on this subject.
---
That's the truth luv. Shouldn't say that cuz I cant tell if you're a man or a woman
---
Amazing cosplay! 
---
I hope you laser does not break as fast as in game. 
---
Let me guess you are from Germany?
---
No worries!
---
They're not shown on there, but I do have other perks for when I'm at camp, either building or crafting. Ones that reduce material costs, increases repair quality, allows building better structures, and of course Ammosmith and Super Duper for almost unlimited ammo.
---
I also use a Gatling Gun for long range and standard encounters, and a weapon called Final Word, obtained from rescuing Beckett in the Wastelanders content. A level 50 weapon, 50cal machine gun, literally eats enemies up close.
---
So if you just wanna enjoy your time in FO76, then my build might be close.
---
Did you have aggro though?
---
Yes i am from Germany. Thank you!
---
Ok cool I was just worried because I heard that once you join one the other isn't an option so I figured the unlocks also would be closed off
---
Same.
---
This is amazing
---
Dont be a jackass, dude
---
You do make a good point, though. In past games, it seemed like there was a tad more uncertainty, maybe, about which group to support? Like each group had it's pros and cons, but none was perfect and an argument could be made in favor of almost all. Now, though, they've diluted the raiders a bit, but there's no question, really, that Foundation's settlers are the "good" choice and the raiders are the baddies, and the moral gray areas (which gave the other games such flavor, IMHO) are absent. There's no big debate on who you personally think is morally correct. It is pretty black and white, for the most part. (Unless I'm completely missing some bit of lore atm.)
---
Yeah I mean my damage is still good so long as I'm in stealth between my rifle cards, sneak attack and one or two instigating weapons. I have a friend who mirrored my build but went low health and it's just insanely more powerful and just better, AP for days, hit chances always through the roof. That said it seems like he has a lot more issues of the whole 95% still misses than I do, I'll have one maybe two every say 20 shots vs his line 7 to 9 in that same number like the game has an issue cause the shot shouldn't be 95% immediately but it is with the massive stack to his perception.
---
I've been doing this thing in my camps where I put my fusion generator behind my vending machines and I've got a conduit structure an "upside-down U" with connectors through the wall and the four-way connector with the shop lights on it. It makes excellent light in my little shop and I can wire the rest of my camp from that building. The conduits fit perfectly across two-foundations against the back wall of my little four-foundation shop. I can put the four vendors inside (or 3 with a PA station, bed, water fountain, cooking pot, and plants) fit in there along with it. And, the fusion generator, fits nicely right in the middle of the conduit structure. 
---
I did this in one of my main characters stationary camps last night to free up space in the house. Before this, I had the fusion generator on a top floor behind the wall so it's out of sight, no door to it, with conduits going outside.  Moving that thing freed up 2 floor squares worth of space in my room - lots of space.
---
Yeah, definitely I'd be up for a much smaller footprint for the fusion generator.
---
Life Is Pipe
---
How about the fences, and have you ever seen her land on top of the bunker?
---
Another one in our ranks
---
I‚Äôm colorblind and have been playing since beta with no complications.
---
How am I. Am I not allowed to have a different opinion?
---
hasnt come up for me in about a week, still cooling down i guess haha
---
I don‚Äôt play violent night or uranium fever on public servers anymore.  The folks dying to show how badass they are take all the fun out of it.  You‚Äôre better off running the capital building.  You‚Äôll get just as many legs and I never see anyone else there.
---
That rifle is absolutely great! A lot of the cosplay engergy/gauss weapons seem a lot clunkier irl, so it‚Äôs cool to see someone with a laser that you could theoretically see being used! 
---
Your picture cuts your head off till it‚Äôs expanded so all I saw was the gas mask and thought someone was srly committed to a hunched over mole miner haha.
---
I suppose it has broke
---
If she never focuses on the people fence sitting/etc, it wont matter, if she does, it gets fucked up. But no one knows how the queen chooses aggro so best bet is to be on open ground.
---
I didnt use them for the first 200 levels. Now I use about 6 and I refuse to use marsupial as this is not a Mario game.
---
I love bringing them along so they can tag enemies or level. Nothing wrong with that. Just the expectation that I have infinite resources to share bothers me.
---
You're allowed to have a different opinion, but be constructive about it. Just saying "bad" with nothing else just makes other people feel "bad."
---
Double XP meant that if you had the score glitch you still were able to get tons of SCORE by grinding. Double SCORE means people still get fucked.
---
T65 PA +Vampiric  faster fire rate flamer. I can be a triple conduict, amd my Hp does not even move down a bit.
---
Sometimes you have to jump start an event like radiation rumble or path to enlightenment.  Beam yourself into the mine or lighthouse and walk around.  It came up after a few minutes.
---
There is a nice almost completely flat piece of land down the road south from summersville. Just follow the road and after you passed two crashed cars there is a big flat piece of land on the left side of the road with an ok view. Enjoy!!!
---
Love it! Would definitely roam the wasteland with you!
---
Die Pfandflasche hat dich verraten. :)
---
Their is a down side, you have use 3 points of luck and 2 more to keep them.
---
Don't diss my instigating barbed walking cane
---
Lolol. Like I said, it matters if you're fence sitting and have the Queen's attention, if not, it wont matter. But how to gain or hold queen aggro is a mystery so best bet is to get to open ground.
---
why
---
I think they are, post 77,  but not really race relations so much as mutation or species, perhaps? Humans are possibly united against a different common "other" in the form of mutants, ghouls, and synths. As long as there is another group to focus on the differences, they can be ostracized and humanity unites against them instead of each other, maybe? And it could be pre-war, everything was breaking down so quickly and people were too desperately clinging to survival in the form of work and resources and such that there was no time for extra hate. There's plenty of folks to hate overseas trying to steal what little we have left for that, possibly?
---
Looks amazing.    Great job!!!!  My wife and I are going as our fo76 characters for Halloween,  so we need to find that same rifle for her and I need a deathclaw gauntlet
---
Why do you need a three story with only essentials? isn¬¥t it quite empty?   
---
Not saying you cant build how you want. But i never understood why people build huge houses with nothing in them. maybe take one story down and fill up the two stories with stuff?
---
I don‚Äòt. I just come here for the laughs.
---
I currently spend all my scrip on Legendary Modules, which is what OP was talking about. I use them for Secret Service Armor. I currently have 3 great pieces and 2 decent pieces. So once I get to 500 scrip I will buy 10 Legendary Modules and craft 5 left arms and 5 right legs and see if I get some better rolls. It is still RNG as I may get 1 star or 3 stars and sometimes the 3 stars are ones I want, but often they are not. However I don't have to deal with RNG with what armor piece I am getting. If I craft a Secret Service Right Arm I am getting a Secret Service Right Arm.
---
Ah, bummer. If you keep an eye out you can sometimes find them in player vendors too. I got a couple of mine that way and will often sell excess duplicates since they move really quickly.
---
Nope. I made that mistake when initially doing the vault quest for the bullion.
---
Grind out rep for both without any fear. Be aware you can take quests for photos from Davenport (Overseer's house) that you can turn in to either foundation or crater for increased rep.
---
Also, Ohio River Adventures has a daily you can run for some raider rep. Not sure if there's an additional Foundation rep besides taking photos of crater and handing them to Ward.
---
lol, that would be the day
---
It was fixed recently, nowe shadowed works also on other armor types as well.
---
Looks like your pinky is just hiding as the fifth knuckle is noticeable
---
anything would be nice really
---
Can't argue that point.
---
Yeah the drops are worthless.
---
I banged out the astronaut in an hour.

---
This is my current setup right now, a full set of Vanguard's armor and the marine wetsuit with the protective lining mod.
---
No kidding, its like they share a message to mooch off of older players as soon as they leave the Vault.
---
Don't be a douche.....This cosplay is awesome......Why disrespect someone's art......The world needs some positive especially in this current state
---
&gt; I choose one bench for scrapping (chem atm, sometimes do tinker) and just use overland or other players ones. This can help with space as you generally don't need to access weapon/armor/PA that often unless you're taking an absolute beating regularly.
---
A couple months ago I realized that I've got sooo many repair kits piled up from SBQ fights that I hadn't repaired anything manually in months, so I ditched everything other than a chem bench as well. On the off chance I need to mod something or craft some atom shop clothing I just pop inside the hotel.
---
There was always some conflict between non-ferals and humans...we saw that in just about every Fallout game (lots of it in Fallout 3). And, of course, between humans and super mutants too...
---
I just put mine behind my vending machines and walk off the room with windows. I put my crafting stuff on 3  foundations on the back of my house with a fence. Two floor spaces is a whole room. It seems like a waste of space just to have a generator.
---
You should make it on easy by sept but my suggestion would be to abuse xp food and rested bonus.  If you have lunchboxes or can do path to enlightenment do so.  That way even if you're building your getting bonus xp constantly.
---
I would love to see how many xp bonuses I've gotten but I'm pretty sure I have gotten more score from xp challenges than from the others combined which of course goes back to your initial comment lol. Double xp over double score.
---
Bingo. I see a tent or C.A.M.P. down there, I make sure it's in the blast zone (sorry not sorry).
---
I dont think it's awesome. Go cry elsewhere simp. This isnt art. It's a grown adult playing dress up. Its sad
---
There are some great files for the gauntlet and the rifle on thingiverse in case you have access to a 3d printer. If not it might be cheaper to buy a printer than buying the weapons. Those rifles are ridiculously expensive.
---
I'm running a bloodied too. I have noticed that. Have you had your health just randomly knocked down for no apparent reason?
---
Yeah I've visited her house but I kinda got mixed up on the missions since the game points you in all kinds of directions and apparently she expects me to now find a counter for the virus somewhere I have no idea about so I need to look up the location to finish it
---
To add to the Quantum Nuka Cola idea:
---
Add a small led light to the bottom of the glass bottle facing the glass itself. That way it will light up the liquid and make it look like it is glowing.
---
Sorry, I didn't see the second bit. Due to all the perks for a bloodied build you can really get some nice damage out of them. Even a JE pipe revolver smacks. Plus pipe revolvers and boltaction rifles work with both rifleman and gunslinger perks simultaneously. Previously pipe weapons were good but mostly filler, now you can really hit hard
---
This is fantastic.  excellent work!  my only suggestion to complete this look would be to smudge some dirt on your face and arms/hands.
---
You have a very gritty look in the rest of the ensemble so I would suggest taking that to griming yourself up and really get into it!
---
I think it's anything that gives xp.   It helps with the repeatable level-up weekly challenge.
---
it's not as simple as that. agility is just one portion of the sneak mechanic. yes, it's an important one. but you can't rely on it alone. high health builds also need the proper pieces.
---
having said that, the CSS is a great alternative that excels in areas regular armor don't, unyielding or otherwise.
---
That makes sense.  But the gooper incident was weird.  I was alone in the lagoon and there was nothing else around (that I could see) when it happened.  Heck, maybe it was a legendary bloodbug that a gooper killed and I didn't even see it?
---
Goals! Very well done!
---
Well vats is broken in pvp for one, and is semi broken in pve... but it would be nice for some more high health perks or armor buffs, because vanguards is just bad.  Not only do you lose dr every time you get hit, but dr and er have diminishing returns past  300-400 dr.  You're better off running assassin for pvp and a mixed set of hunter/troubleshoot/ scorch/ mutant slayer ect for pve
---
Shouldve been here on day one of fallout 1st im about to cancel my subcription if they dont add anything else...
---
Vehicles generally have wheels, wheels are circles, circles require polygons to make circular... Bethesda doesn't do high enough polygons.
---
Yea finish the quest and you will get one too.
---
I can totally see the mole miner. Might be a project for the future.
---
Just making the joke. Personally, I hold my fire and stay in the open. If a player can‚Äôt handle that, they‚Äôre not ready for a Queen fight.
---
You can buy lead and steel with caps.  When you run a heavy gunner build, your glad people will take caps for your bullets.  That's really true for anyone.
---
That‚Äôs what I thought about wastelanders too. The story seems more like a tool to introduce the gold bullion system than something that has some kind of intrinsic value to me and would replay for the joy of it. I guess the OP is to see if anybody else is worried that this will be the precedent for DLC in this game.
---
üëçüèæüëçüèæ
---
I'm console, I'm not messing with my TV settings for one game when every other game looks OK or has settings I can adjust.
---
Thanks!!
---
Sounds about right. I'm pretty sure you can still boost pipe revolvers woth both gunslinger and rifleman perk cards so youd be able to hit harder than a lever in theory
---
What a piece of shit you are......You and people like you are the reason this world deserves to burn....Trust me I'm no simp......But you are an internet bully with no life but to tear down others.......Eat a bag of dicks
---
I should check player vendors more but I just got so sick of all the mounted head and Mr. handy buzzblade plans in them.  Drove me crazy
---
Oh my god! This looks so cool!
---
Vanguard's armor is trash at the high level, and secret service stats isn't worth it compared to solar healing.  
---
Damage reduction from armor is a function of the value of armor vs the value of damage taken, it takes more armor to reduce a huge hit than a small one, so gaining more armor is most effective against very high damage attacks, and once you go over a certain threshold the amount of reduction you get for your value falls off a cliff hard.
---
To perspective things, for a 100 damage hit you get these damage values against certain armor thresholds
---
50 armor - 64 damage
---
100 - 50
---
200 - 39
---
300 - 33
---
400 - 30
---
500 - 28
---
1000 - 22
---
As you gain armor, you get less and less difference compared to before, going from 0 to 100 armor is about as significant as going from 100 to 700
---
It's when you start going over a 3:1 ratio that the effect really starts killing your benefit from pushing armor values higher, so with \~97% of all enemies dealing 100 damage or less (A level 80 scorchbeast deals 95 with it's strongest attack) going much over 300 isn't all that useful compared to the other things you could be doing instead. Furthermore, all attacks that deal more than 100 damage are melee attacks from rare and powerful monsters, with only two non melee hits going over this threshold. Meaning the blocker perk by itself cutting melee damage by 45% before your armor is calculated makes the most powerful attack in the game only deal 137.5 damage (glowing super mutant behemoth 250 damage heavy melee) So going much over 400 is not necessary with one perk.
---
Vanguard and bolstering are great at low levels where they can push your armor up to the 300 threshold far sooner than you can do any other way, but when you are high level, and have good base armor that already gets to that point the effects are so much less valuable you are better off running almost anything else.
---
A set that is better than full vanguard armor in almost every single situation is 1 of each: ghoul slayer, mutant slayer, hunter, exterminator, troubleshooter. As not only do you get a straight 15% reduction to almost every enemy, but you also get that 15% against enemies that ignore or otherwise don't care about armor (col G, M-king, Assaultrons, ect), AND to top it off the 15% reduces damage before your armor is taken into effect, meaning you effectively get an 18% boost to your armor, meaning for every 200 armor it is like also having an extra vanguard effect at the same time, but no matter what your health is.
---
265/175 damage reduction from poly solar armor isn't significantly worse than secret service 317/297 in most situations if you are supplementing it with any sort or bonuses. The combination of under armor, scaly skin, and any sort of perks renders the differences minor against the vast assortment of enemies. While on the other hand secret service armor has no set bonus, while solar armor's set bonus of team wide health regeneration is absolutely amazing, and allows you to tank so much more damage than secret service armor while burning through less healing, and the fact it buffs team mates makes it unrivalled for doing events or hard fought battles.
---
In my personal opinion, unless they give the secret service armor power armor style hidden damage resistance enchantments, or buff it's base stats sky high (like 1000+ dr/er, 100000+ rr), I don't really see a point to it other than the whole jetpack, which I only carry around in inventory to use when marsupial isn't enough to climb things.
---
Good to know, thanks, I‚Äôm a bit out of touch with where things are at.
---
I've just been given a 3D printer and the first thing I'm planning to make is a Pip-Boy 2000. So excited. That rifle is stunning üòç
---
In FO2(I think) there was a car.
---
But I don't think consoles can handle cars, bikes, horses etc.
---
Do you have speed demon? If so, have you tried sprinting? The game can hardly cope with that, let alone the speed a vehicle would travel.
---
Yes.  No, that's true.  I understand it's hard to make a game like this.
---
I‚Äôm with you as well, and not even on the specifics (because, as we‚Äôve seen, ‚Äúvaluable‚Äù is always going to be circumstantial) for me it‚Äôs the overarching principle. Bethesda laid out an agreement when each one of us bought the game and created our accounts. Terms and services aren‚Äôt just a list of things you agree you won‚Äôt do, they also set the expectations of what you can expect to be protected from during the evolution of the game because the company isn‚Äôt just stopping you, it sets a reasonable expectation for the behavior of all players. 
---
I wasn‚Äôt affected in anyway by the duping or banning (I‚Äôm new to the game and keep to myself for the most part) but I love the point u/Thraex_Exile made in that we all read the rules and agreed to follow them. Whether dupers/exploiters want to admit it, cheating to create in 5 minutes something it‚Äôs taken everyone else 5 hours to make/gather legitimately IS negatively affecting everyone, directly and via trickle down. 
---
Bethesda‚Äôs refusal to punish people who break the rules essentially allow the punishment to spill over onto those who follow them instead, and that is disheartening to see. It makes me, and probably many others, question if this is something actually worthy of my time and money. How many more of these issues will there be before someday I end up suffering the consequences of someone else‚Äôs actions?
---
This sums it up.Do your dailies and thats about it.Fallout games are supposed to be packed with content that makes the player want to waste his life on it.
---
Got it ......Thanks
---
This would be great, but there would need to be a way to mark items as "do not scrap".  It's almost guaranteed that some people will accidentally scrap their god roll weapon because of lag or something.  At least with the scrip machine, you can buy the item back if you don't exit right away.
---
It is a bit ridiculous how much room that thing occupies, and how much noise it generates from behind the wall!
---
Might be able to make it if you spent all your atoms on the board! But obv got to decide for yourself if a faux fireplace and a shiny black bubble man armor is worth missing out on atomic shop items.
---
Oh yeah. When that bug happens, it‚Äôs amazing. Especially with an explosive dragon.
---
I had even expected the Atom store to at least sell colour changing Pipboys if not in settings but that doesn't appear to even be so.
---
The Deathclaw in the Museum of Witchcraft in Fallout 4 was the Bane of my Existence when I first came across it back in the day. Now they're just an enemy that takes 2 extra shots and gives a little extra XP.
---
6.  Just yesterday.  No idea what happened but I logged in just to drop my camp and leave.  
---
After doing it, I noticed a head in the distance.   Waked over and it was some afk.  So I said why not and killed him, then another player spawned where that one was and I killed that player to, and then another player spawned and another and another.  
---
Lol. No idea wtf that was about but easiest 6 kills ever.
---
No, its definitely better, I just wish things were a bit different.
---
Well first floor is vendors and crafting stations, second floor is my room and a few display cases of rare junk items I found, as well as some bedroom decor, and top floor is going to be a rooftop garden once I buy the indoor planter floor tile plans
---
Agreed. Honestly there should be at least one map per region. Harper's ferry would be my top pick.
---
Just explosive alone is great, frankly. 700 damage in a single shot... even if it doesn‚Äôt feel like it.
---
wait a second! did you post the build of the gun on youtube recently? I think I might have watched that.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but ffr doesn't work on semi autos right?   In that case explosive is probably your best bet
---
Eye sight is different for everyone, not just distances can see but how you process colours. You're just happen to be lucky with how yours is. I usually can get away with it in most games but Fallout colours are unforgiving for my eyes.
---
I gave a random stranger alcohol until he keeled over dead and then looted his corpse. I didn't know it would happen, it was just funny hearing the slurring getting worse each time. I felt kinda guilty afterwards, though.
---
Because her damage resistance is super high.
---
I remember game plus in borderlands. But not being able to pick and choose any items from one player and distribut any of them to any of my other characters on any save file regardless of their level.
---
If you have high enough intelligence you can repair it yourself and both are all good.
---
It kinda is when you realize it‚Äôs without using bloodied.
---
I honestly wouldn't have a clue sorry
---
Think it really depends on if you like the unnecessary grinds quests/events. I personally like the repeatable events and could make a weekend out of doing them while I watch an office rerun - except escorting that officer protectron. piece of scrap.
---
Yeah and I've been keeping a few pieces that look good in those realms just to try and get something. And I mean as broken as VATS is in PVP like I said the guy ducked them all due to serendipity I know this cause he bragged over mic how good luck my serendipity just told all your damage to F*** off as he gunned me down with a minigun. I can't have this discussion with the group I play with cause they all run Unyielding and just "don't see the unbalance in it" or "but you're so tanky, we get hit once and die" but they don't cause serendipity, and yeah I'm ok defensively speaking till I take one hit that is.
---
that would be great
---
I'm pretty sure shadowed stacks. shrouded is broken and doesn't do anything. escape artist I believe negates the cons of armor weight, unless you're just going for more AP of course.
---
Sorry that must have been someone else..
---
Not to mention any more than 3 workshops on a public server and you start running higher risks of a disconnect. I can take 12 on private and spend all day on it.
---
It is the only thing detracting. Seriously 50s glass coke bottle.
---
You did a wizard job on this!
---
The economy for anything that could be displayed has been fucked since the display case glitch went public months ago, and the economy for weapons and armor was fucked the day the most recent video hit YT.
---
There were shitloads of those weapons in the hands of people who didn't get banned, so unbanning a few people with extra guns isn't going to change much.
---
&gt;Edit: people downvoting this, just go glitch or dup instead of being butt hurt that we‚Äôre complaining about your actions.
---
I've never duped, but I downvoted because you're being a whiny little bitch and creating yet another thread about something that has been discussed dozens of times already. 
---
&gt;suddenly the flux you had on the side isn‚Äôt worth much compared to it‚Äôs original value
---
Someone I know duped over 25k of each flux using the display glitch and was never banned, and I know he's far from the only one. Flux hasn't been worth shit for months either...
---
I have SO much stuff available that I don't use now. I keep hoping this will change a bit with instanced camps, if it still is happening, but who knows?
---
thanks :)
---
That's some great cosplay work!
---
An armor workbench without that bucket of hot coals would be nice.
---
totally agree
---
I want to tame a mega sloth but the fact that the taming is so eh. It has kept me from doing so. I visit a lot of camps as well an in my year of playing have seen one person have a tame at there camp.
---
I have a ton of mods but not quite sure how they work......Like do you have to have them in your inventory when crafting and do you lose said mod once you use it or is it reusable?
---
I could give my level one characters a shit Tonof stuff that most level ones don‚Äôt have. I can use that to grief the shit out of other low level characters.
---
He probably doesn‚Äôt wear a mask either.
---
Ahhhhhh. Thank you for the response. :)
---
I know. That low hum is so loud.
---
The damage isn't consistent because you have to hit the same spot. Miss even one round and the damage returns to normal.
---
Good points. Amusingly, I once landed the killing blow to the SBQ while on a public server and jumping up to hit her with an unarmed weapon while she was in the air; she was hovering very low.
---
I actually rolled a junkies fixer last night but don‚Äôt really have plans to adhere to a junkie build
---
 Absolutely legit.   
---
Disheveled hair really makes the look complete.  
---
11/10. Would approve of you having a cameo in new Fallout Amazon Studios series.
---
I recommend Nuka Cola Quantum or Nuka Cola Cherry if you don't have quantum. Stimpaks wear off much quicker, so you will be spamming tons of them to stay even. What I usually do is use one stimpak then use a quantum. That will keep me topped up for about 30 seconds. Then I will use another stimpak and another quantum. Often I will only go through 3 or 4 of each of them in the entire event even with 3 pylons. If there aren't enough people then those numbers will of course be much higher.
---
These used to be great for shooting down a cargo bot!
---
With Meat Week returning soon they won‚Äôt be too valuable for awhile
---
This could be the solution to weapons like the chainsaw or tenderizer not having legendary variants.
---
I sell them 1000 caps few months after Meat Week, they go fast
---
I haven't heard ragamuffin in ages.    
---
***Bomboclaat!!***  
---
Your post made my day. Stay irie, respect ras.
---
Agility is the biggest factor when it comes to stealth, so Unyielding is the most important feature.  And one piece of  "harder to detect while sneaking" is nice to have too.
---
Lighter weight armor, shadowed, muffled mods, and etc. are supposed to help, but I think the added benefit is minimal if your agility is already 30+.
---
I like repeatable content to some extent. But the gameplay cycle I am in doesn't feel too fulfilling right now. At least half the public events I don't bother going to right now. I still run the Davenport, Ward and raider dailies to get quick gold and those are pretty bland. I really wish they added gold to the old dailies as I would much rather grind queen of the hunt or a few others instead. Other than that I mostly just do my score chores which are typically not compelling gameplay. 
---
Last year when I wanted to play non-stop I would have loved a double XP to grind score. Now I am an old fogey who liked a nice quiet double score weekend.
---
&gt; I want goris back
---
I want to be a child of Goris in a future Fallout when we can finally be something other than normal humans.
---
Amazing work. Cheers and thanks for sharing.
---
What‚Äôs your build?  I have a bloodied handmade and hit between 150-250ish with headshots. If it‚Äôs night can go higher with mister sandman. That‚Äôs without any buffs
---
How high a level are you looking at? I'm almost 80.
---
serendipity is like flipping a coin. it's the definition of unreliable. I think it's way more likely that vats being bugged saved him.
---
you shouldn't be using vanguard armor anyway. unless you're wearing wood armor, you're probably above the dr and er threshold anyway.
---
for pvp you should be using assassin, obviously. for everything else, either PA or a mixed set of creature-specific armor. zealot, troubleshooter, exterminator, mutant and ghoul slayer's. preferably with AP and sentinel.
---
pair it with dodgy and hope sentinel triggers.
---
I see it as a warning there is a legendary around, sometimes I find it fast enough.
---
I haven't played borderlands 3 in while but I remember there being a special bank that is shared across my characters. I was able to transfer a few items to my alt very easily when I started a new game. I don't know. Maybe I am misremembering?
---
Honestly Mirelurk King's are the tankiest bastards I've come across. Those bastards can shread you if you're not fast enough. Two can be a nightmare if you've never dealt with them in groups.
---
No they are not, never were. Do i have to answer to every 3 posts you made about this or is this enough?
---
Here's the spreadsheet. I don't know if it's been updated recently, but it has all of the base game items and a bunch of the early atom shop stuff. It's also handy because it lists the name of the plan and shows a picture of the item, which is helpful for the things like "rug set 2" which aren't very descriptive.
---

---
And they won't make extra money adding things for 1st subscribers üò≤
---
Do you know if that's considered armor?  If so getting tank killer might help.
---
I appreciate the info my friend.   Thank you very much
---
In NV they straight up ignored your damage threshold. Fuck whatever armor you had on, it didn't matter. You were naked to them.
---
It was glorious. I probably did 75 levels that weekend and maybe 50 spots on the board.
---
Dang i didn‚Äôt know they were posted it just said wait before posting so I did
---
I think the flooded town with the dryed lake would be much better, but I would also like Watoga, that would be my second choise
---
I carry a set of Unyielding, Trouleshooters and my t-65.  I can change armor and weapon and be ready for event.  It's not that hard to get rid of or gain rads.
---
There should be one, at the last week...
---
Maybe valuable to a new player who wants the outfit but I don‚Äôt think they have any value at all, even just casually doing the last meat week event got me half a dozen outfits, you would then see them afterwards in vending machines for anywhere from 500 caps to a few k.
---
Would kill the immersion for me. I like seeing mistakes happen and me learning from mistakes. Buying and selling is where you are in the endgame. Nothing should be balanced around end game. That's where the most stupid design decisions come from and make a unique game feel like any other.
---
Hell, having no chat on pc version is the best I've ever seen, having actually talk to people is something many might not like (especially efficiency players), but it makes this game unique for me
---
in post-war Apalachia, pipe smokes YOU!
---
I am perpetually at max budget. I've got to delete something every time I want to build something new.
---
I‚Äôve moved camps so many times before, like almost once a week. Been here for at least 4 months now I think. The spot is in a body of water, quite a popular place it seems, very close to Pleasant Valley Station. Rarely any enemies spawn there, I‚Äôve got a pack of Brahmin and a water source whenever I need it, all within walking distance of the station.
---
Nah ide rather buy than grind
---
Very cool!
---
Oh yeah I forgot that ally dailies can give you any Purveyor roll, I knew they could give you buillon weapons, but so can the purveyor
---
Because with double XP you have double progression/incentive so you keep playing for XP and SCORE, unlike double SCORE where you just do dailies for SCORE and log out because the repeatable wasn't awarding double SCORE (in positive case, more people would have played during the double SCORE weekend).
---
You being busy makes it hard, but I'm at lvl 29 and calculated I could finish.
---
My defense numbers are 410 ballistic, 289 Energy due having the high capacity backpack mod on pulling down my energy resistance. That's full Vanguard's at my highest possible health.
---
Whats ur IG?
---
I am so upset that the Thunder Pipe isn't a fart gun
---
Yeah, I spam stimpak supers Bc they work faster as a conduit esp when holding all 3
---
I wish that it would provide a special buff and that it would stack with Junkie's builds...
---
Yeah they're so lazy even with the shop they need new people on charge of some of these things
---
she has a 70% reduction from all sources prior to armor getting involved (tank killer has no effect on this)
---
then she has 300 ballistic armor  (can be reduced by tank killer)
---
Again - it isn't being on fences or tents. It is the goshdarnit stagger perk crud shooting her in the air.  She has no problem landing, and charge attacking those on fences and tents. It is the perk!
---
Who is arguing? I made a statement you dolt about my colorblindness. I never said he wasn‚Äôt justified in requesting accessibility feature. Go white knight someone else
---
Who cares about the market honestly? It's not like in Fallout 76 we have to make our living off of it. Most players only trade occasionally when they need something special or see something nice. Having certain things available in-game at lower prices doesn't really affect your gameplay experience at all.
---
I also doubt that the sale of the typical high value legendary weapon is the main source of income for players who sell a lot. It will be the cheaper stuff you sell regularly like plans, ammo etc., and so far I haven't experienced running out if stock for those things, which means if you have a couple thousand ammo up for sale a duper with a couple hundred thousand will not be tougher competition than any other player who does the same like you. The only things where I could see a small inflation is chems, serums and Flux. But something tells me you will still be doing just fine, especially because this game is a survival game which is about fighting, and not an economy simulation which tries to find out who's the most successful businessman. 
---
In other games player to player economy might be more important, but honestly, in Fallout it's completely irrelevant.
---
Lol. I feel you there.
---
...and I've spent over 1200 hours on it....FAR more than any other Fallout game to date....
---
75% damage resistance.  
---
Try using scorched weapons
---
Smoothskin overrated, glory to Set - Kill the normies.
---
Did you come across any enemy?
---
Better on a cane than a minigun
---
I don‚Äôt think my point‚Äôs being made properly. A single bullet is a worthless item. The game doesn‚Äôt even think some of them are worth 1 cap. Saying that caps in their current state is a successful currency when the only thing you can buy with it is the cheapest item in game isn‚Äôt a win when the currency that vendors drop 1,400-2,800 of daily and every event and quest gives you can only buy one thing or small amounts of junk. And if you aren‚Äôt a melee build, that much ammo could be used up in a single SBQ event. 
---
And if you are a melee build, you have no need for ammo. You‚Äôre the guy selling it for a single cap. If caps was working well players wouldn‚Äôt have to buy unnecessary items like serum recipes just to make sure they don‚Äôt hit their 30k cap. 
---
As far as buying lead and steel. Steel is a pretty useless item for trading and lead has become less valuable lately because people are farming them in bulk. Most people trading for junk are looking for numbers upwards of a few thousand oil in trade for starter bloody weapons. And flux is being traded at the thousand. Unless you have FO1st, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to trade enough steel for it to be worth someone‚Äôs time.
---
Scorchbeasts aren't scary either.
---
Just a tired old man.
---
All joking aside, the game just doesnt handle extremely fast movement well, the roads and other routes one would use were designed to be travelled on foot. There are huge cracks and all the broken vehicles littered everywhere. 
---
I would like to see it attempted, but I would imagine that would need a new game engine to handle the increased velocity and a new map that had much larger open areas to explore on a vehicle. Also, it's a bit of a pandora's box. If you include vehicles in your game, you're expected to have them forever in every subsequent version and expanded upon for every new game. If you take it away, that leaves a bad mental state for everyone. We as humans hate negative consequences 10x more than positive. Adding more features is great in concept, but I doubt Bethesda's ability to perform the upkeep so to speak to keep these features running and avoid bloat.
---
r/pipeislife
---
It is for sure. accessibility is something Bethesda hasn‚Äôt addressed.
---
I'll try that
---
If you all stop shooting it and let her land then the mele builds can finish her real quick and cost you nothing
---
I raise it to: Add Watoga Underground as a NW Map (with some tweaks, of course).
---
I have a bloodied 1 star fixer I'm doing stealthy commando bloodied
---
Do you not have speed demon? If not, have you tried sprinting? The game can hardly cope with that, let alone the speed a vehicle would travel.
---
This was the fastest burnout I ever had.
---
20 hours of actual gameplay then it becomes a shitty repetitive bland hour long daily routine 
---
I want it to be a limitless packed with tons of content game that I can play 10 hours a day.Like any REAL FALLOUT GAME
---
I guess I expected too much
---
Time to move on
---
Bye
---
The huge downside for a bloodied build is poison.  I ran into a poison enemy yesterday (at full health) that almost killed me, a bloodied build would have been dead.
---
SBQ was supposed to be the end game boss. I don't believe they implemented it well. She's super easy and the rewards don't mean anything. I don't wear PA, so I just toss all of the ultracite plans.
---
Granted I am only rank 33 but I have only been going at this for 2 weeks now and as far as seasonal mechanics go it's really not the worst I've seen. Maybe my opinion will change later on but so far I haven't had to spend more than half an hour of dedicated effort a day to get every non-nw daily and weekly.
---
The seasonal mechanic isn't for everyone no but I feel like the negativity is getting blown out of proportion.
---
I can't log in rn, but take a look at the options you have at the bottom of the Legendary Run map, it's there among those (not the most obvious thing and I'm not even sure how it works exactly, but I have seen it).
---
I've always said ther doesn't need to be two limits.
---
If you limit how much I can turn in per day, don't limit how much I can hold overall.
---
If you want to limit how much I can hold at one time, don't limit how many I can turn in per day.
---
Only thing that keeps me playing now is putting on my Blood Eagle outfit and role playing as a chem crazed blood eagle. Picking PvP fights with everyone I come across and running up bounties as high as I can by picking locks on people‚Äôs camps right in front of their faces. Makes for good fun. The whole ‚Äúfriendly wasteland‚Äù crap is annoying. I also like killing any NPC‚Äôs or Brahmin people have around their camp. One player had a settler NPC at her camp digging a hole with a shovel and I executed the NPC right in front of the camp owner. They immediately left the server.
---
Love it!  Well done!!!
---
Touch√©
---
Sorry for the confusion, but by play the game I was referring to just doing that...play the game, I was not referring to taking part in the duping. 
---
I guess I am just old school as I do not buy weapons/armor/flux etc. I will buy the occasional core or purified water when it is a daily requirement but everything I have I have earned myself. If there is something I want I will work for it, whether that means trudging to the purveyor or doing specific events. For me there is nothing in this game I cannot get over time, but I guess I can see the frustration if you want to buy your stuff instead. 
---
Yes, duper‚Äôs want instant gratification and that is what they get by duping. I would argue that they also take advantage of those that need to be one of the pack as I have run into players like that while playing. 
---
PS: I didn‚Äôt take offense to your words, as my main point is simply - the game is what you make of it and it affects you only to the extent you allow it. Oh, and I‚Äôm a girl sir lol
---
I agree i don‚Äôt care for text chat. I think a trade system though would be a natural progression for the wasteland. If the secret service is girding good to back the economy, what are they backing? Everyone already accepted caps as currency before they returned so there needs to be some region-wide accepted value for items for the wastelanders quest line to mean anything imo. 
---
Perhaps it‚Äôs not a feature accessed right out of the vault, but every other fallout had caravan groups focused on trading and standardizing item values throughout the game. Players still fill that void as the traders most the time, so a trading guild would be a natural evolution for us.
---
It's 70%. And the dude has bloodied weapon (and presumably a bloodied build). It will do several times the damage of an scorched (or if you want to use the real name of the prefix Zealot's) weapon...
---
I live in Charleston. Lemme just say that‚Äôs an accurate depiction of some locals
---
They were very popular PVP weapons because there was no damage cap in the early days. A single shot from a dragon would kill most players.
---
I have the same build and I've had an Instigating FFR and Junkies FFR Lever action.  I ended up primarily using the Junkies one.  I found it more versatile in that it would still one shot most enemies or 2 shot the tankier high level ones.  If the Instigating Lever action doesn't one shot, each follow up shot feels very weak, especially end game.  I'd rather have 50% more dmg on every shot.  Plus, when playing with other people or in events, you don't always get the first hit on enemies anyway.
---
don't use vanguard. just don't. also what armor are you using? like the other guy said, solar is probably the best. but a heavy combat torso, 2 heavy metal and 2 heavy leather limbs will give you the best dr and er, bar SS of course.
---
like we've told you, use a mixed creature-specific set. I'd use zealot's over hunter's, personally.
---
mutations give you a 50dr and 150er bonus as well. plus dodgy, which will greatly reduce incoming damage at the cost of ap. there's also ricochet, it negates all damage like serendipity but doesn't require you to be at low health.
---
Just a heads up here. I'm a modder myself (Rigell on Nexus) and I made lots of cosmetic and sound mods for this game since launch. Been using a literal ton of mods of all kinds since release. After tens of thousands of downloads on my mod pages I have yet to hear even one complaint about bans. To be honest, I'd quit the game long ago if it wasn't for some QoL mods like Perk Loadout Manager, Text Chat mod and many others.
---
This type of post is actually a change of pace. All I see anymore are people requesting more garbage camp cosmetics. Because that‚Äôs exactly what this game needs. More useless cosmetics for all the camp builders out there.
---
I just bought 1.3k steel.  I had excavator on and just crafted it and a bunch of steel I got into bullets.  Idk.  You're kinda right, caps are kinda useless, but compared to a b2525 fixer, what do you want me to sell it for?  How could anything but a similar weapon be comparable in value.
---
weapon mods are completely separate from the Legendary system. Mods are used when you are customizing the weapon at the weapon bench or armor bench. At the weapon bench you can do things like crafting a better receiver for your rifle or crafting a scope. However if you have a mod for the weapon when you go to modify the weapon it will use the mod from your inventory instead of your junk resources. It is consumed in the process, so you can only use a mod once. However you can only craft a mod that you know the recipe for, but can still attach a mod from your inventory even if you don't know the recipe. 
---
when you scrap weapons or armor you have a chance to learn the recipe for the mod. So at first the mods you find in the world are great as you can attach them without having to learn the recipe. However over time as you learn all the different mods for your weapons and armor they become less useful. Most mods don't take a lot of resources, so I would rather only craft mods as I need them than waste inventory space on mods found in the world. I usually scrap or sell them.
---
ok , it has slightly more damage, but you will miss half of the time, bcuz the fixer have terrible acuracy and even worst recoil. ok use it in vats but.....thats lazy and skilless autoaiming all the time. In pvp you can rely on vats, when they crouch or use stealth boy you cant vats them. i preffer handmade
---
Yikes.  This makes me think a heavy gunner would be better off.
---
I have the same problems on Xbox. It will work for like 1 day and then won't work for months.
---
Idk if it's just a visual bug because in Nuclear Winter I ask my team to emote if they can hear me and sometimes they respond even when the voice symbols don't pop up for me.
---
Also works for going grocery shopping now!
---
Herd mentality is a no brainer with the team format. Can be alone and on a team and +2 to all specials. +3 with a mutant teammate/strange in numbers. Works in private servers for those still wanting the buff without anyone else around.
---
Do you always get repair kits?
---
This. My PS4 takes 30 seconds to load a bush in the wild if i am overweight and sneaking.
---
Near the cliff, boat and acid extractor?
---
The engine isn't really designed for it. Fun fact, the metro trains in FO3 were actually NPC's wearing a train as a hat because that was somehow easier than making an actual vehicle. Also, when you "board" the train you're putting on a hat that changes your field of view and makes it look like you're inside the train.

There is no way that you can play all the relevant story parts within 20hrs w/o cheating.
---
Are you shooting her in the air?  If so, don‚Äôt do that, you‚Äôre wasting ammo. Wait until she lands and shoot her in the face.
---
Well keep in mind the perk ninja makes is to when you do a sneak melee attack , it does about 3x damage I think. And the queen has A LOT of health and damage resistance. 
---
But to answer you, I take 
---
whiskey. 
---
Ya guai ribs
---
Ya guai roast
---
Deathclaw steak 
---
Glowing meat steak 
---
I‚Äôd suggest also taking a nukashine since it increases melee damage by 100%. But during a Queen event I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a good idea to randomly disappear in the middle of a fight. 
---
Those animals are easy to find and kill. 
---
The drugs I usually use are overdrive and psycho buff . I‚Äôm not sure if they stack together or if they cancel each other out. (Sorry) 
---
Strength stat should be 15+ your unyielding for another +15. But the perks I recommend for maximum unarmed damage is 
---
Strength-
---
unarmed 3 
---
Martial artist
---
Incisor
---
Perception- 
---
glow sight
---
Endurance -
---
Radicook
---
Charisma-
---
Tenderizer 
---
Intelligence
---
Nerd raged
---
Agility 
---
Ninja 
---
Sneak 
---
Luck
---
Bloody mess 
---
(This doesn‚Äôt mean those are the only perks you should have, it just means those are the ones I have on my build that I use for damage when it comes to unarmed. If curious about my actual build I can always give a full detail another time)
---
Mutations I have that matter when it comes to melee damage are
---
Adrenal reaction. 
---
Talons
---
Twisted muscles 
---
Carnivore (I think doubles benefits from food buffs)
---
I have more mutations,but they are irrelevant to melee damage.
---
Sorry if the post was long. Hope it helps.
---
Forgive my typos. At work.
---
No, that‚Äôs my neighbour! Just in the next body of water across from it. That‚Äôs a nice spot too though
---
Honestly, something as basic as accessibility for people with color blindness has been a standard feature for a lot of games for years now. Hopefully this is something that can get sorted out for you in fairly short order.
---
Unless you don't want to be on a team.
---
I don‚Äôt know if this was completely coincidence, but my last SBQ fight, I moved a bit away from everyone and started using the taunt emote. She seemed to really not like that and landed on top of me three times!
---
Triple xp again would be fun
---
I have to do a lead run every few days. I have some pickup spots where there are a lot of barbells laying around, and I do the farmhand event pretty often. It takes about five minutes and the robots drop a ton of steel and lead and theres about  a million pencils inside the ag centre. I also have both a junk and a lead extractor at my camp and i take over workshops fairly regularly.
---
I use shotguns for events and swarms of ghouls but the rest of my perks are on rifles so i ALSO go through a ton of .45 and 5.56. But i keep a 10mm on hand for low level areas to conserve ammo. And my snipers take different ammo so i try to take out enemies from a distance  first if possible. I don't have to grind for those, i usually come by them naturally and have plenty to spare. 
---
Energy ammo goes in my vendors, explosive ammo goes in the points machine, and then I still buy it when I see it for one cap.
---
That frog one is amazing.
---
I was on a server where we beat her in 5 minutes, three times in a row. It was insane. A group of guys was putting out massive damage. Noticeable damage to her while she was in the air. When she landed she was getting evaporated. I think of the guys was running bloodied but not sure what else was going on. My shotgun build isn‚Äôt very good for the queen :( This was on Xbox if that matters.
---
I agree with a lot of what you have posted but wanted to clarify a few things:
---
Magical weapons are weapons that are available in game but a combination of their fire rate and certain legendary perks combine to give an unexpected level of damage. You can not one shot a SBQ with a magical weapon.
---
Hacked weapons are just that, people have hacked the coded limiters on weapons to give them god like damage. I understand this happens more on PC but I have seen it a few times on XBox. These are the SBQ ones shotters 
---
Duping - lots of different methods for duping, it gives the duper an advantage with consumables but for weapons they had to own it to dupe it anyway. Of course they can sell these items for cash or caps. It has a greater impact on the purchaser, lower level cherry picking the 3* legendary they want. Of course the in game economy is impacted as rare items become not rare. 
---
The game is quite a grind at times so people will look for loopholes to reduce the grind, whether that be duping ammo rather than scavenging lead etc or purchasing a weapon that would not normally be available to your level.
---
In my opinion: 
---
anyone caught hacking should be banned
---
Caught duping, there are so many different methods, indeed Bethesda give you perk cards for it, also there is a culture with the other fallout games where we all did it (the difference being they were not MMO games). The responsibility should be on Bethesda to patch the exploits as they arise.
---
Magical Weapons, these are available to all &amp; quite common, not a game changer. These wouldn‚Äôt be my primary concern for patching
---
One shot the Legendary, hacked weapons aside, this is about player etiquette. I think some of the confusion comes from this game trying to be all things to all people, is it PVP or is it teams, or is it community? The etiquette would depend on how you view it.
---
If you can‚Äôt start your own INT team and do your own thing for +2 all specials, that‚Äôs up to you
---
The only sane person here
---
yes. I've seen that at least once i looked down and was basically dead, all i was doing was building at my camp
---
Because they are useless.
---
Those glasses don't look wasteland enough.
---
I use VATS for everything.  Things move.  Things aren't always right in front of you.  One button that snaps to target and locks on to it is amazingly useful.  Except for the bug I was mentioning, you can't miss.
---
Shotguns are also fairly decent at mid range if modded correctly.  Their damage also goes much higher with VATS hits than aimed hits.
---
[](/grumpypip)Wait, is that actually a clever joke about the Water Chip from the original Fallout?
---
Lone wanderer possibly tho. Idk.  Maybe.
---
He‚Äôs talking about prime receiver
---
I have an open nat with the usual Xbox ports opened. Are there some others I'm unaware of that pertain to this game in particular or more than just the usual suspect ones that need opened?
---
 I never had an issue before I'd say the last update or two? I usually party up with friends but when I come home from shift I'm solo and will tag along in whatever and I get spammed sometimes for not being able to use my mic.
---
Lol I can see that. The wastelanders dailies are somewhat unique(admittedly photos was an attempt at doing something different), but they aren‚Äôt very fun and involve a lot more fast travel than gameplay. 
---
I enjoy most the public events though. Bethesda I think just needs to offer some solebound item or something that will keep its rarity despite duping so players feel like the fort is worth it. Project in Paradise is such a fun swarm event to me but no one cares for it or the small chance at ok loot. 
---
Both were good, but double xp seems more valuable for sure. Think score needs a bit more love to be worth as much as do weekend was. I hopped like 19 lvl over only 2 days I got to play then and my rank on the boards sky-rocketed.
---
Right below the dam near the highway 65 sign on the map, there is a random event spawn. One of the possibilities is a dead trick or treater who will drop Witch costume plans. I‚Äôve been casually trying to get that random event for months lol. I‚Äôm sure it would be easier if I focused and farmed it buuut I can‚Äôt focus.
---
I actually just had one appear in my inventory, not sure where it dropped. Is it event exclusive / fairly rare?
---
Id love to actually play nw but muh frames...bush wookie it is i guess : /
---
Ohhhh so I should scrap the mods I have in order to be able to craft them?
---
I'm pretty much there. My camp is perfect and I wouldn't change any main structures, so I buy little decorations here and there. I don't forsee buying a big bundle for a while.
---
To be fair, I can do that with an Instigating Lever Action. Not even a "magic" weapon.
---
Discord man there are tons of communities to form friendships with. Heck some of them run their own events and competitions to keep it fresh.
---
Is it just me, or were SBQ legendary drops way better  before wastelanders?
---
Other than her DR, as others have mentioned. Check your Perks. If your Fixed has an automatic receiver, run all the Commando Perks. If you pull the trigger for each bullet you fire, run Rifleman Perks. Add Tank Killer and Bloodied Mess for good measure.
---
Also, just because the weapon is Bloodied, doesn't mean it'll do massive damage. You need to be below 20% health to hit the peak performance of the weapon. You'll need Perks like Nerd Rage and Serendipity to survive. Mutations are also almost always a must have.
---
Also, Bloodied or not, Ranged weapons aren't effect by SPECIAL or Food/Chems as much as melee is. My Bloodied Sniper can do about 250/300 a shot to the Queen's head (with multipliers). My Bloodied Melee can do 1500 per swing crouched under her head swinging.
---
This happens when you lose the "well fed" buff...or after any food/chem that increases your max health wears off (Vodka, for example).
---
I changed from x01 to t51 and picked up ricochet and now I have hundreds and hundreds of stimpacks because I never take much damage,  I have to constantly vend or drop stimpacks
---
Would people run it even if it was +25%? That makes it better than Two-Shot and maaaybe Anti-Armor at *best*, but it wouldn't change anything about Bloodied or Junkie's.
---
I'll have to try that the next time I'm online to see if I get a response from anyone with a mic that's in team.
---
I flip to a party and have zero issue so I just find it mind boggling the game seems to be having such trivial issues... But then I remember it's Bethesda and nothing is out of the norm. üôÑ
---
I have a bloodied black powder piston that does 3,500 damage without even being specced into pistols.
---
I was on holidays during double xp AND my dailies autocompleted TWICE. What a rip. Double score was useless though, since it didn't count towards weeklies. If it had, then people would have been playing like mad to double up on the repeatable.
---
I think the other dudes concept is better, since Mutants shouldn't be for obvious reasons as strong as Bloodied and Junkies.
---
I still have my BE25 Dragon hanging in my camp. Shame it breaks so fast.
---
I just want her to land a few time so the scorched creatures will spawn.  Sometimes people kill her so fast that doesn‚Äôt happen.  That‚Äôs xp loss right there.
---
It‚Äôs honestly a mishmash of different 3* legendaries that I‚Äôve come across. I don‚Äôt really run a specific or optimal build. I think the most helpful piece is an arm piece that reduces ammo weight.
---
I do have an unyielding Secret Service torso I wear, but that‚Äôs mainly for the jet pack. I like the aesthetics of the Scout armor + Secret Service helmet more.
---
It's way too predictable.
---
I like to blow shit up with exploding arrows
---
You really should go for the shielded enclave underarmor, it would be a major upgrade over your current, and is easily acquirable by getting the shielded plan from Tanagra town.
---
\+3str +2per compared to your protective +1str +1per (+2end does nothing)
---
\+9/13/5 compared to +8/8/8 for dr/er/rr
---
Yeah? I have a J2525 right now but I'd like to look at that
---
Zombie defense, and deathmatch have my vote.   Of course they will need smaller lobbies or the engine won't handle it well.... sometimes the lag in nw makes it barely playable, that's with wired connection and an ssd
---
I blame that Deathclaws don't have a pack. In Fallout 3 and New Vegas it was honestly the fact that you ran into 3-5+ Deathclaws more than how tanky they were. Radiation Rumble (when it spawns 3 Deathclaws) is one of the few times I see more than 1 at a time and even then rarely see them down a player unless there's only 3 to 5 of us.
---
With this they probably still could use a bit more health and faster animations.
---
He is talking about scorched weapons, not scorched receiver. Who would recommend using different weapon when talking about a different (prime) receiver?
---
19 with a nuke and tube, 18 with autos no nuke
---
5 weeks I think
---
Heavy gunner pa build, way less luck involved.
---
Dude.  I found this for the first time yesterday but in a different place.  Weird. Weird. Weird.
---
No bud, don't be sorry, thank you very much for all the info it's much appreciated. Thanks so much! I didn't realise nukashine gave 100% damage increase haha
---
Sorry to disappoint your confirmation bias, but i am here since beta. Get over it. you are just a bitch. want some cheese to your whine?
---
Just saying... There are actually scorched receivers.
---
&gt;'m creeping up on Rank 99, and I've won 3 matches without ever firing a shot, playing solo. I don't enjoy PVP so I exclusively hide in bushes, prefering to play as a pacifist.
---
So it¬¥s more of a hide and seek game for you. Not PVP
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons
---
Never shoot her in mid air or use Tank Killer on the SBQ, it staggers her and she won't land.
---
Yeah, but they are so "rare" I never seen one in 3000h.
---
It's good if bugged, just like any other shotgun, but it comes with bugs (also the usual shotgun bug..where outside of vats enemies regen the dmg you do) you almost always miss the first vats shot, sometimes it also locks you out from using items (including stimpacks) reloading and sprinting. Have to do one melee attack or holster it to fix. That can often mean death if you're bloodied.
---
Saddest part? This has existed since wastelanders released, and I hear gauss rifle has had it since launch...
---
I‚Äôve been reading several threads, and I haven‚Äôt been doing a lot of the things I‚Äôve read. My guns don‚Äôt do much damage. No matter where I go, the enemies are always way over powered for my character. Leaving the area and coming back doesn‚Äôt change. I just learned that guns and armor do not rank up when you do. Which is a wtf....it feels like this game has very little forward progression. My shit isn‚Äôt getting more powerful, just the enemies around me. Bethesda really destroyed this game in my opinion.
---
Please explain how the perk is bad for the queen fight? I use the perk, I don't want to if it is a bad thing!
---
Yeah they removed some and add new ones, should be interesting
---
Glad to know this, that had always driven me crazy. Even though I use a bloody build I'm tempted to get that healing factor mutation.
---
&gt;(other players break the jet pack and you can like stay at her level) 
---
How is this done?
---
This is killer, it would be so cool to start a Fallout warfare with outfits and Airsoft BB Guns fit to the world of FO. Badass!
---
it hasnt for a while
---
K
---
What am I missing about double XP once you're past level 50 and are happy with how your character is laid out?  
---
I imagine most people here are well past level 50 yet it seems everyone is really excited about double XP and I don't understand why, can someone please educate me? To me XP/leveling up is pointless at this point so what am I missing?
---
Foundation is full of liars. I hate Samuel even more than Ward.
---
The fact that 3 death claw Kills score equals chew some bubblegum is laughable.
---
Deathclaws scare the shit out of me if I run into one in 4.  In this game I don‚Äôt even care.  It‚Äôs much worse to run into mirelurk king.  Even those wild green bloat bag ghouls with the windmill arms.  Way scarier than deathclaw now.  A shame.
---
AFAIK Zorg (sp) moves one spot per day, you have to beat him.
---
Which one? They're all benefital to every build.
---
It isn't guaranteed that you will learn the recipe when you scrap it, but there is a chance. If it is a mod that you really want on a weapon or armor then I would save it until you learn the recipe, but if not I would scrap it just to get a few extra resources. If there is a specific weapon or armor that you are wanting to learn the mods for then it is recommended to scrap as many as you can. If it is something like a Hunting Rifle you can probably get a bunch by killing super mutants, but if it is something like a handmade then you probably won't find many out in the world. You would then want to craft a bunch of level 1 rifles then turn around and scrap them. 
---
There was a post yesterday detailing how many of each weapon or armor you would likely have to craft and scrap to learn the recipe.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hyy3jc/fallout_76_scrap_to_learn_calculator/
---
That one game where I placed my camp, I noticed after I had done it, that I still had two team members alive. I was able to get to them, and having no weapons or ammo, I just stayed close to one of them and actually revived him when he went down once.
---
what platform are you playing on? I'm on PC, and I might have an extra witch costume on one of my characters. I'll be jumping on shortly after 2pm EST.
---
Get yourself a bloody ultracite gatling laser and a couple of fusion cores, slot the Power User perk so the cores give double the ammo and it's a face roll to reach the damage requirement for loot on the SBQ, even without using heavy weapon perks. I use rifles but always swap to a laser just for her.
---
Hmm, that one's kind of tough, I can't think of any places that have assaultrons in the lower level areas. Best bet might be Watoga on the edges of the city. They would scale to your level of you happened to be the only person around. Whitespring also has some but all the bots will aggro if you attack them. 
---
Your best strategy against them is stealth if you can. Target the torso (their weak spot) with sneak attacks and they go down pretty quick. Alternatively, a shotgun to the legs with Enforcer will cripple them to make them a little easier. They will still crawl after you if you do that though so be aware.
---
Lmao that‚Äôs not hating. It‚Äôs stating a fact. I too used black powder stuff at the start and I too liked how OP they seemed. Were they actually OP? No.
---
Yup, I remember that it requires an intelligence of 8
---
the vehicle would probably be slow, like a brahmin cart. Think of the Event: "Riding Shotgun", but slower
---
That's why I like Rocksy. She doesn't pretend that you're anything more than her hitman. Ward is just either totally deluded or full of shit. My money is on the latter considering he will sometimes tell you that the item in question isn't even important that it was about sending a message and then in the next breath state that sometimes he wished violence wasn't always the answer.
---
You've seen the skins from this season....be careful what you wish for.
---
I have a magic gauss minigun, (I think?) So it's not a big deal.
---
Lost Home. South of watoga has a chance of a trader spawn. 
---
I bought the witch costume and hat this morning. 
---
If you're on the xbone i can give you the costume
---
I never knew this. Seems like a much more likely reason she never lands than the "don't stand on the bunker/fence/tent" BS. I've literally seen the queen land on top of the bunker and a tent before.
---
Less risk equals less reward. Couple mutants with 10 while aiming for a decent rifle.
---
Update: apparently there is a chance for one to spawn in the Toxic Valley. Can't remember ever encountering this one personally but this is what the wiki says:
---
Clarksburg - One may be found inside the hardware store on the upper floor.
---
He sleeps funny too, doesn't seem to understand basic bed usage.
---
and if you have an item in your inventory, it registers as a "completed task"...
---
... clearly, this is bordering on Synth behavior
---
You ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt care less‚Äù, to say you ‚Äúcould care less‚Äù means you care something therefore could care less. Whereas I think you mean you care so little that it would be impossible to care less. (Sorry I‚Äôm being that guy)
---
I‚Äôm with you.  Everything I found googling is kind of old.
---
I see people selling the western outfits for exorbitant prices.  But I can get you like so many western outfits like this *finger snap*. I guess you used to only get these through an event?  But the claim ticket robot is handing them out like candy down in his claim ticket room.  I see these outfits going for 7000 caps or so.  Dude. I sell mine cheap.  All you need are pleasant valley claim tickets.
---
I love outfits.  I am always on the look out.  I read the drifter outfit is common.  But until the other day I had never found it before.
---
Not sure if the game pass version is different, but there is no cross save between linked accounts on bethesda/steam to xbox, much to my disappointment when I came back to playing
---
That's a fun area to build. I had a base over the river on each side of the cliffs for a while. Just NW of that silo.
---
"Last osmosis kit"
---
"We actually have a couple dozen of these, but it's the principle"
---
Remember though, Ward used to be a Raider.
---
I got great results while using vampiric auto weapons. Lots of enemies and lots of hits. Hard to die until the boss gets angry at you.
---
Hah ,that's very good ! Good job!
---
We are starting the 5th week today of an 10 week season.
---
ah, you haven't gotten very far at all in that questline then!
---
It's a tack on to the scorch infection cure. If you haven't done that yet, finish that, and then get on with the overseer. She'll start you down the line.
---
Important part, when it comes down to it, all I will say is make sure to keep both groups in mind (Foundation and Crater/raiders).
---
You won't have to start over.
---
That‚Äôs the exact problem I think needs to be figured out. Hopefully through a more standardized economy. 
---
Mutations for instance can be sold in-game for 1k caps- granted at a slower rate, but on reddit you would be lucky to get 400 for them. The buyer and seller are both getting better deals by having a trade hub that would normalize that value as well as sell it more quickly because anyone can find the item you‚Äôre selling.
---
Say I have an item that is usually worth 200 flux. With a trading hub flux is publicly listed for 100c a flux let‚Äôs just pretend. I know I need the 200 flux, so I sell my gear for the same value of that 200 flux. So I sell it at 20k caps and buy that flux without waiting.  So overall it just reduces the inconvenience of selling through reddit and players have a guarantee that the item they want is worth so many caps. Vs the current system where if you trade someone on reddit for caps there‚Äôs no guarantee those caps are worth the item you are actually looking for. If a stable market shows you those values, you don‚Äôt have to worry about the item you‚Äôre buying not being enough caps.
---
TLDR: 
---
Sorry super long one and I‚Äôm really thinking out loud a lot with this. introducing an in-game economy/trade hub makes caps more necessary for trading, rather than putting in hours of work trying to meet a player online in hopes they‚Äôll trade an item with you, and increases their convenience, which will normalize values as well as make caps a more useful currency again.
---
edit: tried simplifying some thoughts. Clearly it didn‚Äôt work.
---
Red asylum dress, forest camo/BOS/white powder/white springs jumsuits, Jacko suits, responders firman, mr fuzzy, emmet mountain hazmat, blue ridge caravan, longshoreman, clean spacesuit, deathclaw/crazyman/Oldman winter/raven fasnacht masks, leather coats, tattered field jacket are some of the most notable
---
... Because it's so much fun to descend upon noobs whilst being level 445 and watch them shit their vault suits lol. Then I drop them a zillion bullets and stims and try to convince them to take it
---
Because your supposed to use heavy weapons, go buy a non legendary gatling plasma from the enclave.  If you ever couldn‚Äôt loot the queen, it‚Äôs because you didn‚Äôt do enough damage.
---
That's what works. You can get rid of the wood piece, my alt doesn't run it and the sbq can land right on top of me never leave caution. I use the wood on my main- his set is a bit different, maybe a weight thing between the 2 sets and the wood puts it over the spot of real invisability. You only need one shadowed mod. It's about getting pure stealth not like chinese armor. AP is a issue with high health builds.
---
I should just make video, show one hitting everything carrying events xD Soloing arktos the whole bit. I look at unyielding as pretty much a newbies build, it's easy but it still doesn't match up when you can run only 7 agility on a proper cham set. My bloodied goes into danger sometimes, unlike this set.
---
Cham set you stop and lose all detects, it's not about the sneak. I made a video on it in resort while back [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XI4Koej-Vc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XI4Koej-Vc)
---
Here's ghouls [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGlOxnSJbz8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGlOxnSJbz8)
---
I dunno why everyone always gets all mathy about it(obligatory.. i was told there would be no math)
---
simply allowing it to stack 3 times would be a huge boon compared to how it currently is without going ham on it...
---
PC here. GT is OldSchool1966. Five toons with five different camps across different regions.
---
It's a perfectly legitimate strategy in a game which rewards staying alive and that's marketed towards people who have probably spent more time playing single player games than online shooting games and therefore don't have the skill to outshoot people.
---
The workshops are fair gain, but attacking the cat was definitely in bad taste.
---
I am waiting for an Angry Turtle video showing that wearing wood armor plus a piece of troubleshooters makes your drill the new meta because Bethesda.
---
Even though we have all been doing the SBQ for ages I always wonder why everyone still take pot shots at her in mid air, especially if Tank Killer is used she will just stagger and never land. 
---
You used to be able to cripple her wing to the make her land, but that was patched out.
---
How do you know what ‚Äúall‚Äù duper‚Äôs do with duped weapons? (Obligatory lol) Lots of different duping exploits used over the past 18 months and you know where every weapon went? Someone call Bethesda this guy knows every instance of duping &amp; where the items went!!
---
I‚Äôm believe it. No one in Foundation had the guts to get ride of these parasites.
---
Where was this set up?
---
I remember having handmade plan in beta. I would made hundreds of handmades every day for this sub.
---
Fallout 1st doesn‚Äôt get a larger budget? It works like that in ESO for number of items in your houses. Surprised it doesn‚Äôt here.
---
Banned?
---
Where's the negative with mutations? &lt;1 reduction in SPECIALS? Or other effects that become nothing with Class Freak? And all gets improved by Stranger in Numbers? Nowhere close to drawback with Bloodied running 20% health or Junkies with all withdrawal effects to manage.
---
Most players who have been keeping up with dailies and weeklies have passed Zorg and are moving into the third section of the map. I missed a few days and I'm on the same slot as him. As it progresses, it's going to be harder and harder to go up one slot per day because the number of score you need increases each level and thus beat Zorg since he goes up one slot per day.
---
I don't pull out my gatling laser very often as it isn't bloodied, but I did it just for the lolz a couple days ago only to discover I have 44 cores.  I toss anything under 80% so, yeah.  Rounds for daaaaaays.
---
Woah! That‚Äôs awesome! :)
---
I think Ward is the bad man of the Wasteland. He doesn‚Äôt give things away he‚Äôs got his own little racket going on. Sells said item and then gets someone to kill the guy and get it back. To then resell on again and again. Hate Ward big time üî´üî´üî´ü§Ø
---
The way I see it, the death laws in 76 are like the radscorpions in 4. The scorchbeasts game the deathclaws‚Äô place as the alpha predators, while the deathclaws get relegated to being weak enemies that are just really annoying to kill.
---
**Then go play something else.**
---
There is far more than 20 hours of gameplay in this game. 
---
I started a new alt and even just focusing on getting the main quest &amp; vault raid done as quickly as possible, ***and*** knowing exactly where to go to do so, ***and*** getting that alt up to level 50 ***and*** knowing my build plan ahead of time, ***and*** with supplying that alt with solid gear, it still took more than 20 hours for the main core content. 
---
Oh, wait, I guess your post was actually *‚ÄòI beat the game faster than you losers, git gud scrubz.‚Äô*
---
My apologies. Had I known you were just bragging about being a Gamer Gawd, I would have simply chuckled at your arrogance and moved on. 
---
I thought you might have actually had a valid question beneath all that posturing. My mistake.
---
I have one. Ok I'll do that next time
---
Consoles can. The game engine can't. FO2 is a whole different thing from the 3D games.

It‚Äôs not to bad tbh. If u do the weekly and daily‚Äôs then it‚Äôs a level a day without add ons
---
thx for that, I'm actively searching now for a Junkies FFR or a Junkies
---
when i want to cause myself mental harm. i like to imagine what if a company like rockstar spent 8 years building a fallout game. think of how good that would be. we'd have vehicles. we'd have a good 3rd person perspective. movements would be smooth. gunplay would be immersive. as is, bethesda just doesn't do state of the art gaming. 76 itself is pieced together from old assets, some which are well over 10 years old at this point.
---
Easy tiger not trying to trigger you !!
---
Exactly this. I don't need to have a massive base active all at once, but I keep finding new areas I'd like to build in and new ideas to use. However, I spent a bit of time getting my current base right and I don't really want to discard it forever/have to rebuild it completely if I want it back.
---
Haven't had a ban email and I've never duped anything in game either so unsure if/why they'd ban me?
---
I‚Äôm looking forward to it!  I like new additions here and there. Keeps me on my toes.
---
Someone correct me if I'm wrong but I believe you do not want to be addicted to chems that you actually use, since you need to be in withdrawal for the junkie's dmg buff. Yes, getting addicted to chems you use will mitigate the withdrawal effects when you take the chem, but you will also lose the junkie's dmg buff.
---
I tried to use Shards and they're pretty awful, not worth the grind for materials
---
Something is wrong with your build if u do almost no damage with a bloodied fixer,even if its a 1*. That is if u mean u cant get loot or get rewards from the event.
---
It‚Äôs xawkwardkate :)
---
I would contact Beths and see what is going on.
---
Awesome!
---
Great job!! 2 thumps way up!
---
Thanks!  Maybe one day. 
---
For now, I‚Äôll make sure with some Fancy Lads Cakes. And maybe a visit to WestTek for the free roof pie.
---
We had 40 seconds left to kill it because it barely landed. Luckily we did
---
You should be in the game
---
Geez sold a bunch at 100 caps
---
Basically, because [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/3e0svq/this_was_how_the_train_in_broken_steel_was).
---
I can agree with that. I‚Äôve been doing bloodied commando for a while when I got a two star bloodied combat rifle. Does amazing while on ground but in air not cutting it. Last week I got all the luck I can get when purveyor gave me 3 bloodied weapons in a row and one was a three star bloodied fixer. With the switching of perks I did. If scorch beast are on ground I melt even quicker but  in air there‚Äôs this bug that it shows me hitting headshots but no movement on their health. Just wait until they land and have concentrated fire and blow her head off
---
There was a mod in Skyrim where if you took a cart ride, you would actually ride in the cart, as opposed to fast travel.
---
It would flip over quite  bit, and you would basically be in the cart, riding on your head.
---
You can reload and murder him to death as many times as you want
---
It‚Äôll be like Animal Crossing: Nuked Horizons and they‚Äôll add mutant raccoons to the game.
---
I progressed much more with the double score weekend... but I dont mind another double XP one again.
---
Or Charleston even. Both would be awesome though
---
Being in a team is not the only thing that ruins sneak shots. If your target is attacking something else, sneak bonus won't work whether solo or grouped, public or private. In my experience I almost never get sneak damage in Radiation rumble, Line in the sand or Guided meditation. Even on private server sometimes it doesn't work against the Queen because she's attacking non-scorched mobs around.
---
Done by next week
---
I am absolutely stealing Ninja Santa üëç
---
I think they meant "break out" the jet pack, as in use it.
---
Do you have the Power Armor keycode?
---
You find that &gt;!nowhere. You‚Äôre doing nothing wrong, it just seems to be glitchy sometimes. Try logging out then back in again!&lt; and that should hopefully work for you.
---
It depends on the character I am using. My bloodied commando goes there to kill, my grenadier goes there to BOOM and my responder just collects ore while wearing PA and hopes for the rest to protect the workers.
---
If I am lucky, I am lucky. If it fails, it's just a game.
---
are these videos from private server doing solo kill? most of them are.  in solo stealth commando is very good yes (because stealth multiplier works), but public events its is different story and stealth commando damage is like 2.5-3.5x lower there. 
---
maybe your fixer triggering magic damage though - at the end your perks multiply magic damage so if you have magic fixer it will melt much faster than magic heavy (without perks).
---
It‚Äôs strange. 
---
I play in english but I‚Äôm Italian and sometimes I‚Äôve tried to open tickets in my own language. Result? A real person gave me answers in 25 hours and he also gave me Atoms compensations for the bug report (first time 800 atoms, second time 600 atoms).
---
Instead, the tickets opened with english support were answered almost every time ‚Äúcopy-paste‚Äù, after many days and they didn‚Äôt care about giving any type of compensation or rewards for the report.
---
Edit: the tickets were not about SCORE problems.
---
Turning down sound effects might help. 
---
Otherwise maybe just not have them powered.  Keep a regular vendor powered so it shows on the map, and the Joe ones unpowered.  People can still buy stuff it just won‚Äôt light up
---
We can't even nail 4x6 drywall to our camp ceilings, and that's a static QOL fix.  Can you imagine Bethesda trying to install a train.
---
Stunning ! Everything from the details to the general cosplay is realy well done !
---
Yes aa works for both energy and ballistic and those are good rolls... but rerolling wont get rid of this caster, it'll give you an additional one with different effects.
---
Yesterday I did a few events solo or with only a low lvl guy and I died several times (One Violent Night, Monster Mash). I wanted to test the DR on the Chinese Stealth Armor, so I didn‚Äôt use any buffs, and I died twice on One Violent Night when I got swarmed by Charred Ferals after my stealth was exposed and the lvl 10 guy that was there couldn‚Äôt do anything to help...I then did Monster Mash solo, and I died from a swarm of Charred Ferals once my stealth was exposed, again...I was annoyed and it got me me thinking of looking into the SS weightless armor and revamping my armor setup...Because once the stealth of the Chinese Armor is exposed, which happens quickly when there‚Äôs a swarm, it‚Äôs practically useless on high level enemies...I do love the stealth setup but I‚Äôm starting to think more DR is possibly the better route...Let me know if you or anyone else has done this and their thoughts on it???
---
Damn that's ridiculous. They should at least put a warning on it for the time being.
---
Two people are enough for max rewards. And a single collector can get really close too.
---
Key element is to have a task and do your job. If you are there to collect, forget the workers. If you are there to kill ghouls, then, KILL ghouls!
---
I don't use them by myself, but when i visit other people to buy from them,   
---
it is quite annoying to meet these.
---
I'm more scared of the elemental ballsacks than the Deathclaws, and that's not a good thing :/
---
That looks amazing
---
I want venging machines that hunt down customers and force them to buy my .50 ball ammo.
---
PC user. I too have experienced this in the past week. It has occurred more often and at totally random times. I find no common element across my toons prior to crashing.
---
A lot of bloodied builds use the lifegiver perk for this reason.  Rank 3 gives you +45 max HP...and if you use the speed demon mutation, there's a bug that causes your health to regenerate back up to 45 if you drop below that threshold -  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-W1DPhUCRpQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-W1DPhUCRpQ)
---
It's pretty rad, friend.
---
There is definitely room for improvement in the realm of high health. Just adding some new mutations that have an impact at high health over low health would help a lot.
---
The issue is like you mentioned, there are so many things that stack together at low HP that the high health builds really struggle to keep up. Adrenal reaction alone is a significant argument to just keep your health low - No changing of perk cards or gear needed, just hovering around 20%-ish and you now do more damage than before. Add in other things and you start really leaping away from anything else.
---
If I had a wishlist for upcoming patches it would be some new mutations and legendary effects that are targeted towards higher health builds. Potentially even more creatively than just health at X%, like every 10 actual hp you have currently is 1% more damage. While being at max HP would obviously be beneficial, you don't really rake it in until you start stacking up endurance and max HP perks/food. If you remove the adrenal reaction drawback my current build is 400 hp, 480 with psychobuff. A perk/legendary/mutation effect like that and now you're not handicapped by being at full HP, running low rads, and powerful healing effects. Would really like to see some damage output viability from a super beefy high hp build.
---
25 v 25 would be fantastic! I played a little ESO a few years ago and the PvP battleground Bethesda made for it would fit in pretty well in this game as well.
---
It had its own issues and quirks but it was enjoyable overall.
---
I hope Bethesda does have something more in mind for PvP. I know the PvP player base has been neglected and feels very neglected. This would go a long way in restoring some good faith (note that I said some!)
---
Well done.  I love seeing the Nuka-Cola hanging on your side.  Is it filled with real soda or something else?  What does the bottle cap look like up close?  Did you 3D print the cap or did you repurpose a Coca-Cola cap?
---
Double XP is great. One weekend I took my characters from like 161 and and 180 and I took them both to 200. I don‚Äôt really need perks. I‚Äôve started to gather level 1s and 3‚Äôs of ones I use.
---
This was three double xp weekends ago. I know I did it to myself but this was the last time I wanted to play 76. 
---
I‚Äôve been fueling my 76 sessions since the on the FoMo from not Finishing the legendary run. It feels like Todd, Atom and the Mothman are exacting their pounds of flesh nightly as I hunt my three legendarys or wait for leader of the pack or uranium fever to come up.
---
I pretty much play all night Tuesday to wrap daily‚Äôs and weekly then try to have nights off where it‚Äôs just the daily‚Äôs the rest of the week.
---
Double score was a godsend. I got to play The Outer Worlds (groan) and For the King(best $10 I‚Äôve ever spent) and I had fun with games again.
---
I‚Äôd really be okay with them waiting on the next season till winter so it can drop with fresh content for the grind not same old same old.
---
TLDR: I got to play other games this weekend and got double points with double score, double xp would have necessitated I play 76 all weekend for the same kind of points.  It was nice, let‚Äôs keep both.
---
That‚Äôs up to you. The old main quest is substantially the same, minus a few NPCs you may meet that have no bearing on the story.
---
Im about a little over halfway.. 64 I believe. I don't finish all the score dailies especially the nw ones. I missed the whole double xp thing cause I was on vacation, and I play pretty casually other than gearing up hard still. After that man in a cage hanging from a tree camp item, nothing else is all too interesting. I also haven't used a single one my lunchbox. So it's doable even without the boosts imo.
---
Nothing i think it is glitched
---
you "only need" or they don't stack? because shadowed stacks, the more pieces the harder you are to detect. also escape artist and muffled mods I think all but make armor weight/noise irrelevant. there's no reason to use wood considering shrouded does nothing.
---
you were also getting in danger constantly in the first video for just moving around, that's not very good stealth. chameleon is good for artificial lights and avoid being spotted when an enemy bumps into you but not much else. if you want invisibility go with the CSS instead.
---
On PS4 the tattered field jacket, leather coats, and Camo jumpsuit are becoming more rare than the red asylum dress and responders fireman outfit due to the latest dupe. I even found a red asylum dress in a vendor for 5k.
---
From what I‚Äôve seen the emmit mountain hazmat is still pretty rare. At least according to a couple recent marketplace trades.
---
It seems the pleasant valley tickets have led to the western outfits becoming common.
---
Edit: a word.
---
I think he‚Äôs just very passionately saying that he‚Äôs not against ppl having god tier builds as much as trash weapons with a broken mechanic being able to do the same or more dmg as a player who has been fine-tuning their build for months.
---
Insurgent outfit was at one point.  Marine combat helmet I rarely see in vendors (plan dropped during Miner event).  Crocodiles I think still are.  Deathclaw Fasnacht mask.
---
I rolled a assassin for mine. Thing does amazing when it hits I don‚Äôt think I bought any mods for it also
---
I need the same for my stimpak diffusers, a cage which only opens again, if you buy 5 of them at least
---
Nah, I actually played during double XP.  I just want to coast right now until I can get this mountain of legendaries dealt with.
---
This has been my take away from it as well in regards to solar v. Ss.  It's nice to see some numbers behind what I have been experiencing though.  Thank you for the breakdown.
---
I run a "b tier" solar set (4 vanguard, 1 hunter, 2 sentinal) and even with that I can face tank near anything in the game thanks to dat heal over time.  My __only__ fear is glowing ones when I have rad  worms, and the queen sitting on my face, those rads fuck me up.  Il always rep this armor for full hp
---
very talented you look great
---
There's a crosshair right there
---
I always assumed this is what was actually happening.  There are a few things about Ward that affirm this:
---
1. He settles for nothing less than you murdering the thief.
---
2. If you don't murder the thief, Ward badmouths you at Foundation and gets your reputation lowered, which is something not even Wren or Rocksy do at Crater.  And he *never* lets you forget this.
---
3. Ward outright lies when he tells you that the osmosis kit is rare, and then admits that they have tons of them and he had you kill the guy out of "principle."
---
4. He keeps asking you to retrieve tools no matter how many times you betray him, which would suggest that he doesn't actually care about the tools.
---
The osmosis kit. He has a bunch of them, but it‚Äôs the ‚Äòprinciple of the thing‚Äô. Even after I tell him I had to kill the bastard.  It‚Äôs a fucking filter, you fascist!!
---
Now that I‚Äôve maxed rep with Foundation, I let the ‚Äòthieves‚Äô keep it and just pay me caps. I don‚Äôt even have to go back to Ward to tell him he‚Äôs not getting his gear back. 
---
Maybe eventually after the 27th water-cooled bonesaw goes missing and isn‚Äôt recovered, Groundhog Paige will come out of his hole in the dirt and deal with Ward‚Äôs bullshit.
---
I haven't ran into any deathclaw in Appalachia for a long time... This is what I don't enjoy in 76, too, that deathclaws don't seem to be as worse as they used to be. There are lots of other beasts that make you panic more.
---
Actually, I have seen her land in the middle of the fences right on the bunker.
---
Dude, same! I pulled a AAE combat shotty off a legendary watoga robot (back when those existed) and it was my favorite weapon until that horrible nerf, now it just sits in my stash :(
---
But the queen is affected by Hunter, not Zealot. She is an animal according to data mining.
---
FFS YES! I am fully aware that I have 31 unopened packs. I will open when I want to, thanks.
---
Seriously?  How much are you charging for those?
---
Absolutely love this. I unfortunately dont have the balls to do cosplay ü§£. Well done putting it all together üëç
---
It doesn't do a whole lot. I never understood the draw of FFR weaps when they already have a single digit fire rate. Explosive or 10% aim 50% vats crit are much better options.
---
The economy was "permanently screwed" when they made pretty much eeeeeverything in wastelanders permabound
---
Wow! That‚Äôs awesome you are very talented. Appalachia‚Äôs newest Hero!!!!
---
gold cards give one point now
---
Extremely incorrect. Why in the world would you think that?
---
'IMPOSTER DEATHCLAW' is how they should name the current ones
---
On pc, when you‚Äôre viewing the Legendary Run board you can press R to be prompted to spend atoms to skip ahead.
---
Why would anyone pay for a red dress? You can find them on the floor in a few places. Also it seems every other ticket gives a red dress or western with or without chaps.
---
Hopefully the One Fallout update will fix this. As fun as it is to one-shot everything with a bloodied, I agree Deathclaws are being portrayed as if they‚Äôre these Uber strong enemies, but quickly lose any sort of danger once the player has leveled past them. That being said, I used to be afraid of fighting a SB too and now I just let it shout at me from the sky and wait for it to touchdown for a 1-2 shot kill... One Fallout just needs to happen fast.
---
this 1000x
---
Huh? I never said anything of the sort. I was responding based on the other comments from FOUR HOURS ago. I have been playing the game since beta so I have seen all the ups and downs, as the only time I didn‚Äôt play was when my hubby and I moved 1300 miles and I was offline for 10 days. 
---
I have however seen people trying to get legacies for caps and the seller laughing their tushy off at the offer.
---
Power user doubles the clip giving you 1000 rounds per full core
---
The extra daily challenges, double xp event, and double score event are their compromise for this bug. I know it‚Äôs not enough, but from their perspective this is the solution.
---
Actually, the location of the trick or treaters has switched with the locations of the 'ski outfit plans'. The trick or treaters now spawn in the savage divide. 
---
If you are looking for the trick or treaters, look up old videos for the location of the 'ski outfit plans' in the savage divide. Farm those spawn points to find the trick or treaters.
---
I did, it  unfortunately won‚Äôt let you place it down. The worst part was there‚Äôs plenty of flat land out there, it‚Äôd be a great spot to build but it won‚Äôt allow it.
---
45 seconds though is more than enough time to get 1k damage in with a lot of different builds and non-broken weapons.
---
I've seen Queen die in the air, far away, without mutating, in something like 5 seconds.  There are actual broken weapons out there.
---
And of course melee food stacking is busted, anyone can wipe her out in melee in 2 seconds flat.
---
I've had this happen on two different characters. You need to advance the other main quest, up to the point where it sends you back to Rose. She will then do both that conversation, and the Wastelanders conversation back-to-back.
---
&gt;!After you do all the repairs to the scorched detectors in the mire, the final step you are prompted to do by the pre-recordings on the computer is to take a program and a explaining note to Rose in order for the system to be "active". When you are on this quest step and talk to Rose it will trigger both conversations in a row.!&lt; Visiting Rose before reaching that step in the original main quest line is unlikely to work.
---
Red asylum dress. Not the regular red dress.
---
I want some cleaner looking ones as well. 
---
It doesn't need to be pristine but fuckin hell you'd think you'd be able to build a chemistry bench with wasn't stained and full of holes.
---
Damn good job, the rifle looks amazing!
---
why are people still surprised that Bethesda does not make changes to the game that would take actually Competent coders and developers?
---
Pipe is Pipe.
---
I've only seen a handful. Theyre definitely rare for me, even though they can get high level!
---
Thank you so much, I was able to complete the last challenge with five mins left!!!
---
ahh okay that makes sense.
---
Pipe... Pipe is Life.
---
I've only seen it when I die.
---
No, I wasn't aware that I needed one.  Is this a requirement for using any PA I find anywhere?
---
(I didn't look at the spoiler- if this is a plot thing, I want to find it on my own)
---
At this point, I think it‚Äôs just a team-building exercise
---
Dang. I wanna find the pipe.
---
How are Talons or Twisted Muscles beneficial to non-melee builds?
---
I am going to kill myself. I did get that plan for the ski outfit though.
---
I had a tame megasloth.  We lived at Whitespring Resort in blissful harmony for less than twenty four hours whereupon he was beaten to death by a pack of Feral Ghouls.   
---
I howled at the moon in despair and vowed that I would never again sweet talk an innocent Megasloth into coming to live with me, when all that awaits them is death and destruction.
---
I have 2000 hours in and still trying to find an alternative to my Unstoppable Monster. Talk about a Queen Killer...
---
Survival was THAT good...
---
Okay, it was actually just a joke. You‚Äôre not doing anything wrong. Look at the spoiler. It‚Äôs not really a spoiler.
---
The albinos in Radiation Rumble aren't bad, but for some reason the level 91 ones out in the world are just pathetic.
---
True about the Raiders. Good thing I have 3000+ antiseptic.
---
Nope, just some items, the scrap box, and private world that almost no one seems to use.
---
Assaultrons beam also proc the magic effect. Lvl 24 beamed me from 100 - 10% and Im 450+, use full solar and vampire heavy gun lol
---
I just send u a pm
---
I want Gramps to follow people around hounding them to buy something.
---
Lol just checkt, and here is you post, uploaded for 0 sek. Perfect timing, love you
---
Did you like sleep? You leveled 75 levels in less than a weekend? Jeez I‚Äôm only level 85 and I‚Äôve been playing for a few months. How they heck did you also knock out half of the board in a weekend?
---
Reddit is a dumpster fire of trash humans.  This is why most information has moved off to discord and the like.
---
We all know what the real problem is, and it's not explosive laser weapons...
---
Bloodied builds need to be nerfed into the ground.
---
You ever looked at someone with a gauss rifle in game? They're still friggin' huge! Especially with the suppressor.
---
When you break down energy weapons, though, you realize it's a lot of plastic, so while bulky, probably nowhere near as heavy as the weight stat claims.
---
That goes for most weapons, though.
---
No way you're getting a 20lb hunting rifle in real life, unless you have it in a concrete block. They're like 7-9.
---
Although as far as size, I personally have an old (~1890) shotgun and it's like four and a half feet long, and it's not too bad to carry and shoot.
---
If you're running rank 3 class freak, a lot of the mutations are worth taking.
---
I run a gatling laser power armor build with max class freak, and use mutations: Adrenal Reaction, Bird Bones, Chameleon,  Electrically Charged, Egg Head, Herd Mentality, Marsupial, Scaly Skin, Speed Demon, Unstable Isotope.
---
what is in the Secret Service - Protect the Gold tab?
---
RIP vertibird power armor. Yeet another week.
---
What‚Äôs the first tab?
---
I've been hitting refresh for this post. Thank you.
---
You'd be in the vast minority for people who actually cared then, cause double XP with lunchboxes + berry mentats + mutations + brain bombs/brain fungus soup let people hit the cap of 4000xp per kill so every 3 kills was 100 score and 2 kills after 3 was another 100 score
---
You had people get 50+ ranks purely off 100 score repeatable during double xp weekend cause it was so nice
---
Each wave in Line in the Sand was like 20k xp
---
Love the outfit, and the rifle is above and beyond.  Love the weathering and paint job on it.  Any photos during construction?  Would be nice to see the process behind such a remarkable build. Great job.
---
No screenshot of the featured stuff
---
Maybe, but I doubt it. The joke was in FO2, about a Vault (Vault 8; i.e. Vault City) that got shipped way too *many* water chips
---
I MUST KNOW WHAT'S IN THE SS TAB
---
thanks for doing god's work btw
---
Thanks I Appreciate all feedback  
---
It all sums up.
---
There are many perks that work well with low health. Also the combination with unyielding and bolstering gear. And adrenal reaction mutation. If you use all this 20% health is no big deal.
---
Withdrawal effects have almost no difference on a high level character if you choose the right addictions.
---
Same concept with mutations. 
---
If you are a rifle build you have no use for melee mutations it‚Äòs just the negativ effects. Over all I use 50% of the mutations. The rest would only have negativ effects on my build. If you decide to use 10 mutations you can still have your 25% extra damage.
---
Craft it yourself using corn, mutfruit and tato alongside purified water at your camp.  It‚Äôs called vegetable starch at workbench.
---
Damn I think I scraped that hazmat suit the other day, such as life
---
I'm curious if those shooting targets provide damage numbers.
---
What is it your using?
---
Your post is always a welcome effort.
---
Exactly!! üëçüëç
---
Worst case is buying it.  Anglers in general carry a bit.  They are found in the toxic valley in general and sometimes en mass near Grafton Dam.
---
Army bases have duct tape as well.
---
You can also set up a farm with corn, Tato, and mukfruit - with the right perk cards like green thumb and super duper, you can make your own.
---
See since there is technically no safe place to live then you should be able to stimpak like in fo4. Maybe even make it something like a treat we have to craft to revive em. Because its pretty hard to tame something the way they did it and its never worth doing again. No matter how much you want it. With how it is right now i would rather pay 5000k atoms for a pet (That doesn't die bethesda!!!) Then to go out and tame one for it not to even make it to my base.
---
As others have said, missing the first tab. Impressively MEH week.
---
Well atleast randoms cant just kill them anymore lol. That used to be the problem, atleast they got wanted and killed by the owner.
---
You can make vegetable starch-&gt;adhesive.
---
Grow corn,  mutt fruit, and tatos. Cook them with purified water to make vegetable starch, scrap for adhesive.
---
Are you on PC? I have a spare set of plans that I can give to you.
---
no vertibird power armor, why even live
---
You left out the most critical page!
---
I'm on the toilet right now.
---
Camo paint for ss armor, camo for ss under armor, ss themed bobble head stand, firing range posters, cinder block wallpaper, ss back pack and ss weapon skins for guass weapons.
---
Thats not even... legacy weapons aren't "magic" weapons and the difference in the damage potential between bloodied weapons, legacy weapons and "magic" weapons is not even fucking close.
---
I found it directly under the power pilon near the giant tea pot water tower. These random encounters are my only reason for playing now.
---
thanks, didnt know that
---
Yes. It‚Äôs he same odds regardless
---
Had this bug on one of my alts.
---
I had to continue the main quest (start of Free States part) by going to Abbie's bunker.
---
I didn't try returning to her till that quest line sent me back to her, so i don't know if you can return earlier.
---
When I returned to her as part of the Free States quest, she did the normal Free States dialog, then said, "You look like you have something else to say" and then she carried on as usual with the wastelanders quest.
---
if you know, Which outfit has that red stop sign on the arm? or is that some random shoulder armor?
---
 Nice, rifle is the new unarmed
---
supposedly, the legendar rng is the same for all creatures. meaning a 3 stars molerat could drop you a B2525 handmade. but the queen also could, and routinely does, drop a 1 star nocturnal rolling pin.
---
Same here. Thought It was just a visual bug but then noticed I was overencumbered and realized I had higher health than when I server hoppped.
---
I just want him to change his clothes once in a while.  Every time I see him in that same, tight flannel I just think he smells to high hell.
---
I said the same thing immediately, guess my atoms are safe for another week.
---
Dude you're right but you're also on the losing side of this. It's not irony that another top post today is the Queen taking too long to kill.
---
Some people want her over and done with in seconds. I personally like it more now than it ever was but we‚Äôre on the losing side of this debate.
---
Just don‚Äôt shoot her in the air if you have the perk equipped. It has the potential to stagger her and cancel her landing animation, which is usually the main reason her fights take so long
---
I actually saved them, because you never know lol
---
Plant tomatos, corn, and mutfruit at your camp. And then build a couple of water purifiers. Then you can craft vegetable starch at a cooking station.
---
Heck, they already had cages in FO4.
---
I‚Äôve never had to craft adhesive in this game. It‚Äôs literally everywhere if you just explore a bit. üëç
---
Ew
---
Arkos Fridge 50% discount for F1st user I think.
---
If you can find tool boxes or hardware stores they usually have wonderglue or duct tape which both have adhesive
---
Of course to both of your statements.
---
Ah- this might be relevant, then: when I try to use the PA station, it tells me, "This station is already in use by another player."  There's no one else around.
---
It's the only thing I want
---
Pipe is Life!!!
---
Wasn't that bug fixed with the last hotfix?
---
Who isn‚Äôt?
---
Why would they release that so far ahead of the brotherhood dlc?
---
I got a 2* BFFR Ultracite Gatling Laser from a 2* ghoul just the other day.  
---
Yesterday i got a QFFR15 Tesla Rifle from my Ally's fetch quest.  
---
Never ever got a single thing worth selling from SBQ or the Wendigo Colossus.  
---
RNG is RNG. The only thing that changes is what is included in the loot pool (learned plans included or not, etc)
---
The power armor set is 9000 I know because I grind that 4 weeks lol it total what 9000 but each piece are 1000s
---
well.. for one.. you can use stealth with a commando too..
---
also.. if your bloodied build is done correctly.. do you really need stealth at all?
---
Same. That and the handmade skin that makes it look like the assault rifle from fallout 3.
---
Double score would be so much better
---
Also would like to know that. Though my hopes are low
---
Ha!  *Whoosh.*
---
Bloodied commando and Bloodied stealth can use the same perks. I am stealth, using Bloodied rifles, auto rifles, and Bow + crossbows. The only perks I have to switch out are the Rifle, commando, and bow perks.
---
I think the "special" sales for Fo1st members is still a thing. got a bloody arktos fridge in the last tab that's not in the screnshot.
---
1st tab???
---
Thanks for that. I appreciate it.
---
Didn't think to combine the two thanks for the idea, and also...y not?
---
Dont forget green thunb and super duper.
---
Auto pipe rifle...you barely see what happens...just a flash lol
---
The robot music? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nN4rwngDg-0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nN4rwngDg-0)
---
I've been trying to disable it. It's super easy to do once you've located the correct sound file but I couldn't find it in sounds01/02.ba2.. gotta keep looking, maybe it's in other ba2 files.
---
Bethesda pls we just want black clandestine paint for the SS armor üò≠
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve seen like 2 times. Usually it‚Äôs an ok length fight for a decent group, say about 2-5 minutes, but I‚Äôve been there when someone comes in with some glitched out weapon and literally just blasted her in less than 5 seconds, none of us got enough in to tag her.
---
wish I had known about how useful vampire was before I scripted a bunch of vamp gauss mini's.
---
The skin for the SS armor is nice, but how about some basic color swaps for all armor? Black/gray/blue etc so we can mix and match pieces better. Bethesda seems to be obsessed with green camo and ghillie suits.
---
Save for next week as next week we get the weindego event and I‚Äôd imagine they‚Äôll release better stuff then
---
Lots of people have said to plant the tatos, corn and mutfruit but another thing you should do is always slot green thumb and super duper when you spend a while shopping at player vendors. Pick the crops from every camp you come across and use them to make even more adhesive than from just your crops at home.
---
Are people still unaware after what 2 years of this game being out that shooting her in the air can / will keep her airborn? There are multiple perk cards that can‚Äôt instigate a stagger effect and when she‚Äôs flying around and get staggered she goes through her cycle of flying again. Also placing tents around v9 can also keep her air born. If the tents are placed in certain spots they will take up some of the room for her to land. Also don‚Äôt stand on top of v9. Either in a group or by yourself. She can‚Äôt land up there and if she targets you while you are up there she won‚Äôt come down. Queens have always been finicky in this game
---
Gotcha, thanks a bunch!
---
Anytime!
---
I am able to make the witch costume for you if you want. I am on PC.
---
At some spawns in cranberry bog theres a chance for 5 kings to spawn. Happend twice, ofc I died both times lol
---
You can set SPECIAL so you can rotate between commando and stealth. And rotate between commando and rifleman if necessary
---
In terms of damage, bloodied stealth commando is top tier. I assume by bloody stealth build, you mean bloodied rifleman, and I'd argue that's just as good. Bloodied Heavy PA is up there too, but I've never played it myself.
---
Only going to be working for 1 more week though so keep that in mind, it's getting patched.
---
Also Turbo-Fert!
---
jesus christ, added. No idea how that one didn't take
---
Yes. Its a 1% drop rate. Keep that. Dont anyone tell you otherwise.
---
Looks awesome!! Great job
---
I just hope this post doesn‚Äôt get removed like mine did..
---
Another lackluster week. To be fair though, they did give us two great weeks beforehand. Can't really complain. I'll just hold all my atoms till next week.
---
Rule 10
---
In Fallout 1 and 2, they were an instant death sentence on most encounters. You‚Äôd travel somewhere and pray not to have one in your path. If they were, often the goal was retreat to survive. New Vegas came the closest to bringing that terror to a 3D game space with that quarry because they had room to swarm. Olney in Fallout 3 was close quarters, so a bit of a challenge if under leveled. But overall, Beth really lost the plot with deathclaws. Kinda sad that radrats and bears often require more bullets to kill than these apex predators.
---
You can get GOD ROLL on 3* radroach if there is such a thing
---
Pretty sure my main weapon I got off a 3* radrat at back of the steakhouse
---
not getting killed by molerats is a great plus in my opinion. there's also the sneak multiplier. it doesn't work in groups, but being hidden away from damage alone is a great reason to sneak.
---
Assuming we can believe some people this wasn't out "standard" ban wave and managed to hit a lot of people that would usually be on the periphery, the small time dupers and people that "just" received a lot of duped stuff.  That could likely mean that Bethesda is getting better/more serious about catching people.
---
Also you realize this is how bans work in most games right?
---
It's rare to see people just get instantly ban hammered and lose everything unless they're SERIOUS offenders, most get a strike and a warning and then are fucked if they keep things up.  Bethesda isn't even going soft enough to give people the usual  three strikes and has warned people that the next time will be their last.
---
Correction, I'll be done by next week, misread
---
I agree with this. We shouldn't blame the players, but we should blame Bethesda (what's new lol)
---
The playerbase should not be expected to go to online forums to find strats. Everyone is on a fence or is shooting at her in the air (with those perks equipped), because that is the logical thing to do. Why wouldn't you shoot her in the air, and if you run heavy, why wouldn't you equip one gun army?!
---
It's absurd and hopefully the AI is fixed in the next update
---
Idk if anyone already told you or you know it already.. But when you're missing some components tag it for search from crafting menu. It makes it easier to spot stuff you need. If you're on pc I could give you some and repair your armor if you want.
---
Thank you for the convenient service! :)
---
No super duper at level 22 so for immediate circumstance that wasn‚Äôt relevant, though true for level 50 or above. 
---
Green thumb is of course very useful.
---
Added the SS page, somehow it didn't take my capture.
---
Use this  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic) 
---
it will help you find ALL of the things
---
Ally fetch quest give me the best weapons sometimes. I‚Äôm always getting explosive weapons from Beckett.  Not that RNG is affected. But I get lucky with Beckett sometimes. I sell them
---
Bloodied stealth and bloodied commando can be one in the same. Max perception, agility and luck. My special is 2, 15, 3, 1, 5, 15, 15. You can swap the commando and rifleman perks out whenever you want. I run bloodied and junkie on the same build.
---
Dont need mutations to run a junkies PA build!
---
[](/flutteryay)
---
Short answer: yes. It‚Äôs possible. Just rare. Any good drop is rare. I didn‚Äôt play during the beta, but I have been playing since launch, and I have gotten ‚Äògood‚Äô drops from normal 3* enemies. To name a few, quad explosive harpoon gun (before they changed that), tse combat rifle, ghoul slayers explosive lvc handmade, executioners ffr lvc handmade, bloodied explosive shotgun, bloodied explosive pipe rifle... granted, most of the good things I have now came through trades.
---
I honestly did not know about "magic" weapons before reading further into this post.
---
I still think bloodied needs a nerf...
---
Not if Jeff has anything to say about it. Bethesda seems VERY reluctant to do anything PC specific.
---
The rework has so far been creating newer better cards and getting rid of some of the shit ones.
---
She's just a bullet sponge and time sink. The least they could do would be to give you a 3* roll. Same with imposter and project paradise.
---
Caps of course
---
Added!
---
It's a separate underarmor and not a skin. And from what I've seen it looks like a camo re-skin of the Secret Service underarmor.
---
In run PA build with 15 intelligence, stacked with egg head mutation and PA helmet modded with internal database.  Stack that with inspirational perk on a build team and that adds up to around 27 intelligence which means quite a bit of XP.
---
Yes  I know about unyielding armor and what it can do for intelligence.    I'm a heavy weapons build and heavy weapons are just better when wearing PA because of the stabilized perk. Period. I don't run bloodied and  don't want to.
---
The Queen's farts smell sooooooooooooo bad.  I'd like a "gross" emote.  Better yet... a vomit one.
---
But is it it says its for the casual outfit so im not sure
---
WHERE ARE MY NUKA COLA NEON SIGNS?
---
Ohh god I forgot about this!!
---
Absolutely love the rifle. You did a damn good job with it!
---
I would say 0% chance.
---
Overall about 50% of mutations do work well with your build. The rest is just negative effects or useless for example melee mutations on a rifle build. 
---
If you decide to play with 10 mutations you get 25% extra damage. It‚Äòs up to you if you want to use talons or twisted muscles on a rifle build for extra damage.
---
Tru Tru but its good knowledge in a week
---
What lvl and build are you running?
---
One can hope at least. *sigh*
---
I love it! That laser is astounding. If only I could make a laser gatling. So cool.
---
Wow,  that‚Äôs terrible.
---
I have a theory that the original game included wastlanders (you can sorta see it in how the new story flows) and they noticed this when they made the release announcment.
---
My running buddy built a fire station in Morgantown that‚Äôs gotten a few stops and looks. 
---
I run in and kick off the siren on occasion.
---
6 more weeks
---
Level 55 should be on track I believe. Still plenty of time to make up
---
So.... nothing new except the bobblehead stand... super
---
I will close the post.
---
Bethesda doesn't care. If that bug means you'll play more in a desperate attempt to maximise your rank or better yet make you cave &amp; spend money on Atoms, great!
---
It's not right but Bethesda has clearly shown they don't care at all about customer service unless it directly impacts their short term revenue.
---
Thanks! I had NO IDEA. I feel bad for all the sbq fights I have ruined in the past lol
---
Ah thx
---
Yeah its fallout engine that is the issue not cars, for example GTA v
---
Yes, several times.
---
As others have mentioned, taking the time to set up some plants in your camp will help. The recipe is 2x Corn, 2x Mutfruit, 2x Tato, 1x Purified water = Vegetable Starch = 2 Excess Adhesive. If you don't have the green thumb perk, plant these plants in multiples of two. If you've got a supply of fertilizer handy, you can rapidly grow your supply of plants, and be well on your way to enough adhesive to use glue itself as a weapon.
---
There is a location called Becker Farm, almost directly south of Hemlock Holes, which I believe has all three of these plants available to gather. Collecting the fertilizer may be annoying at your level.
---
Also, if you haven't done so, flag Adhesive for search and make sure to look at objects in the world. There should be a noticeable amount, depending on if other players have come by looting the area you're at recently.
---
Lastly, if you're on Xbox I can just give you a handful of it, plus the plants and fertilizer you need to start. I have a ton because of a mild obsession with crafting vegetable starch.
---
Did bunker buster on a 25 alt, only time deathclaws were exciting tbh
---
Mine does the same thing." It just works"--Todd Howard.
---
Came to make this comment!
---
I think the bigger problem is the game as fun as it is, has so many poorly balanced, poorly implemented things that a vats magic effect is the only way to make shotgun even POSSIBLE TO BE USED. 
---
I wouldn't mind if they fixed high fire rate miniguns though..
---
Yes, I experience the same issue. I just removed it. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
No fix, but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve seen Bethesda reply to another post about this to say it‚Äôs being investigated
---
This! I've been waiting for these and the Nuka Cola wallpaper to come back.
---
I agree that these are arguably the best/ most fun to play. But does anyone else just compromise and run both? I have been running a hybrid Bloodied Heavy commando for a while now and really like it. I know I'm not squeezing üíØ% out of my damage potential, but I'd argue that I don't need it. At 6pts respectively I'm getting 45% each and haven't missed the extra 15%.. not as Uber as some posted damage numbers , but at the point you're one shotting what's the difference?
---
I have an instigating pistol for my gunslinger build. Great for sneaky 1 shots on tough enemies before switching to my main pistol or melee for the rest of the group
---
Well it was a nice oneshot weapon on wanted players lol, doesnt help now though when they got the 110 dmg cap. (Unless changed again)
---
I did not even think of the future game implementations that is a good point. However if they went solely with horses and dirt bikes it stays relatively small and more maneuverable.
---
Same üí©
---
Oh man I‚Äôm also chem free, my body is a temple.
---
That would be sooo awesome but you know
---
You're getting downvoted but you're right. I have a magic minigun and it behaves like a normal weapon when trying to hit a flying queen. Once she's on the ground and you can concentrate on one body spot it's a much different story.
---
Yeah, but I think that a OKish PC could handle cars with the engine, but I don't know anything about computers, so I might be completely wrong. Console peasant here.
---
yeah, tried it once and promptly scrapped it.  I would want it open all the time anyway.
---
It works on the lever action because the follow up shots come more quickly. A hunting rifle has to reload after each shot. I've used FFR levers and seen the difference, especially with Gun Fu, the follow up shots are ready much sooner.
---
SS - Secret Service. I thought of another SS when i saw the title damn..
---
just clogging up the system yo..
---
I got a 2* junkie handmade from a level 50 legendary dog.
---
so, yes.
---
I believe they‚Äôve said numerous times there‚Äôs nothing they can do. The extra daily challenges were for recompense, however the fact it is still happening, and that people who don‚Äôt have an issue also benefit from it, seems rather scant consolation. 
---
I finished the board, and I never had an issue. I also was on when the challenges refreshed a few times, sat and watched the list disappear and reappear fine so whatever the cause is, it seems to be rather random. 
---
You have my sympathies.
---
It is very frustrating that they havent been optimizing their engine. I still get a lot of the weird glitches from earlier FO games.
---
Noticed that dialog before the 1 time it didnt cut off early. 
---
I was like so I just travelled across most of WV, murdered someone who needed it for his community...and you have a few spares lying around....
---
Can you glitch the working one in there?
---
Secret Service Armor and Underarmor camo paints are sold separately for 600 atoms each! That such a terrible deal.
---
I'm pretty sure everything on the first tab is new...
---
The old main quest is almost entirely unchanged, speaking as someone who did it on the beta and then again (twice) since wastelanders released. A few small bug fixes, some additional NPCs that don't impact the quest at all, and I think a little bit of streamlining around the Morgantown Airport step (little foggy on remembering exactly what I did on the Beta that made it such a chore, but it was smooth and fast this time around)
---
Thanks mate. I am currently not active in this game but I would have missed nice things wirhout you.
---
Why?  To take advantage of it fully, you have to run below 20% health and use valuable special points for several perks and use Adrenal Reactions.  Yeah, my Bloodied Gauss shotgun does \~1700-2100dmg (max), but even with Dense chest and Fireproof 3 I one-shot suicide myself more than I like.
---
It's like anything else, you have to risk more to get more.  Us risk takers shouldn't be punished just because full-health builds think it's unfair.
---
This game has foxes?? :O
---
Can you tame them?
---
Yeah I was just thinking of getting on today and start to make ammo and make sure I have consumables for the fight. It would be pretty cool if the sbq and the colossus had a mini pet drop that followed you around but didn‚Äôt do combat or maybe it did? I don‚Äôt know just a idea I had just now
---
Why would you even want that skin? It looks terrible
---
nice
---
I was more just referencing the craftsmanship than the actually weight to them. Some of the weapons are big for sure, but their design usually feels sleeker in-game and makes more sense than when most ppl make a real one. I‚Äôd imagine the only things super heavy on energy weapons is the mods for it, the stocks and barrel attachments seem to be pretty big on some of them. 
---
But secret service armor is also made of a lot of plastic and is the strongest armor in the game. So perhaps plastic in fallout just refers to an easily moldable,sturdy material - something with plasticity to it rather than actual plastic.
---
&gt; if your bloodied build is done correctly..
---
Agreed.  Gray goes with everything.  But their typically oversaturated green camouflage options don't.
---
It's also why I think the Secret Service Backpack is arguably the best backpack they put out, because it goes with everything.
---
Ooo I can put actual trees on my barren camp! Whoops, no budget left.
---
I do not have that mutation I would love to get it. So it shouldn't be that everyone without speed demon has to waste caps fast traveling.  The map is just so big to charge for fast travel like they do.
---
50 caps
---
lol
---
Just redid my camp into a scavenger warehouse, that finder block wallpaper would be perfect if it wasn‚Äôt for the fact I‚Äôm now gonna have to reapply EVERYTHING to the walls
---
FYI The camo secret service underarmor can't be modded. You can't apply the mods even if you have them unlocked.
---
The camo from the armor doesn't apply to the jet pack either.
---
Yeeeeeeup! I keep it locked and closed now as a different kinda wall ü§òüèºü•µ
---
I‚Äôm hotwafleman look me up, I‚Äôll try to help you out.
---
It's not just the music, mostly the mechanical high pitched noises when they move their arms.  
---
But if you manage to disable it, i would be very thankful. mr.
---
I have played this game since the launch and have never participated in PvP.  But at level 365 I like to show up at someones workshop and watch then run and hide.  In the end I help them defend, wave and leave.
---
Wow it‚Äôs actually starting to piss me off how repetitive these are. Grognak bundle is back again what‚Äôs next week, another opportunity to buy the starlet sniper outfit? Thanks tho OP
---
Alot of the lockouts and VATS "miss every shot at 95% chance" are gauss pistol/shotgun/minigun bugs in my experience with the three.  My Fancy Pump doesn't suffer those.
---
Double xp, canned meat stew, couple perks and mutations with lunchboxes and MONSTER MASH, think I was getting about 1k XP per ghoul. Loads more I could have bolted on top to get more, think I gained about 20 odd levels.
---
All the SS weapons skins and backpack skin were out like 2-3 months ago. The weapon skins came out only a few weeks after the DLC and the backpack came like a month or so later. 
---
The armor and underarmor is new technically but who the hell doesn't wear an outfit that covers them? Lol
---
Ok, cool.
---
If you keep up with Zorbo, you will be fine. And, abouy 5 weeks or so.
---
This guy is the real hero
---
Instigating, Junkies, Stalkers, 33VATs, Limb, Bash are the magic effects. You only need one of these. Instigating, on it's own, is still magic.
---
I think it looks great
---
I'm in the exact same boat. I've had the dailies not reset once before but today I've had daily and weekly challanges not reset
---
Would have been a great opportunity to also release the Black Paint for the T-65 that's in the game data.
---
Odd.
---
Fallout 3 started the trend. Bethesda has never been able to replicate what the first games did with deathclaws.
---
That's a really good idea. I thin I will do this
---
I've come to accept them since my Bloodied GS will oneshot most mobs in VATS + full charge.  Just charge before activating VATS.  Not perfect but more reliable.
---
Cinder blocks are a welcome wallpaper option, but I'd rather we get an actual cinder block building set, like they one they used for Hemlock Holes or Morgantown Airport.
---
Other than that, pretty bland week, but I'm not surprised because I was struggling to remember what hadn't been released yet.  If you don't have the plant and tree bundles already, I do recommend them because they are quite versatile.
---
That's awesome. Can you make a laser musket next?
---
Erwischt :|
---
Fred's bbq shack has a set spawn of them, they also show up in my camp a lot. I don't think you can tame them
---
Pipe is life.  Life is pipe. Is pipe life?  Is life pipe?  Pipe life is
---
Boy their really trying to get us to spend our atoms on the legendary run smh.
---
I wish they would add mechanic heavy bosses, like the Imposter, but that is super basic mechanics
---
I just go to him and hand him the same scanner every day because, well Bethesda glitches. Though some days I like to just tell him I won't do anything for him just to see him get all indignant.
---
The question wasn‚Äôt when **YOU** will be done. 
---
The question was, how long until the season ends. 
---
This season ends on September 8th, presumably at 12 noon EST. Ten weeks from the start date/time.
---
Applehead230 look for me 'Send Me 4 I Am'  I will be up on XBox around 3pm EST, I have three nuke cards.
---
Yea you can't tame those if they spawn there, but I wonder if they show up in tameable encounters
---
Wow.
---
it's not that deep bro
---
[Cheydinhal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYG0YWdkSKI) map?
---
I run the BGM too and the necessary heavy perks.  It's not as OP as one would think.  I still have to unload 500-1K 2mmEC just to get a fair amount of damage in.
---
I've actually moved to Vampire gattling plasma and anti-armor stuff so I don't have to run bloodied build during queen fights.  The Queen's farts mess me up bad.  I dunno what she ate but damn.....
---
MORE BETH LIES.  
---
      
---
You cant fit casual mods to it! Bought it to fit Casual Shielded Mod.. and you cant - so the description is completely wrong.
---
But this is the correct answer?
---
Okay queen of the non sequiturs:
---
Why does it matter that it was ‚ÄúFOUR HOURS ago‚Äù the you commented? Should there be a ‚Äúbest before date‚Äù on everything you write?
---
Why does it matter that you have played since BETA ( a lot of us have)
---
You said in your previous comment that duper‚Äôs don‚Äôt sell legacy items for caps. This implies that you know what every duper does with their duped items. You then added a ‚Äúlol‚Äù to condescend to OP‚Äôs suggestion that they did. It rankled me that you used hyperbole &amp; then patronised OP with a ‚Äúlol‚Äù.
---
OP is correct in that rare items become not rare because of duping, none of us know how these items were eventually used. To say otherwise is hyperbole.
---
I just got off of it Lmaoo
---
Yeah this thing is terrible. I didn't buy one myself, but any camp I've been to with it has been buggy.
---
You are so right.
---
Unless you get a really great combo of Legendries, you can count on the following being ignored:
---
Light Machine guns, Gatling guns, (not to be confused with miniguns or laser gatlings) Pistols (because they are in the agility category), Missiles, Grenade launchers, Auto grenade launchers, Land Mines, Grenades in general (although I like pumpkin and cryo) -- Pipe Weapons , any one handed melee that isn't an unarmed.  any weapon that isn't max level 50 --- as some cap at 45 and suffer for that very fact..  Aything that does radiation damage, non heavy lasers, Shotguns UNLESS USING SPECIFIC Magic effects AND VATS), two handed melee weapons that aren't super sledge, Sledgehammer, Flamers (ammo), and unless you're a sadist, Bows and Crossbows.
---
Thats not to say you can't make these work, you are just shooting yourself in the foot needlessly to do so. -- I say this knowing I have a 1handmelee/shotgun/pistol character with 1perception lol
---
Why use camo paint for SS under armor when you won't even see it since it's under armor?
---
Or one person with a lot of food/ chem buffs active
---
I can help you with the response:  they won‚Äôt do anything.
---
Me neither, post is closed by the way
---
We actually had a school project where we had to make a short video about the pandemic. I made a video In which I put on the armor and gas mask. I made it really overdramatic with the voice over of the fallout 4 intro. The last shot was me standing in front of a supermarket at night with an epic pose. I got full points for this.
---
Today I try what others said like log out 1 hour before and wait for some time before log in....don't do nuclear winter... Etc.
---
And guess what, This week is the worst in this season for me. All dailies gone and only 1 weekly left....
---
For others:  I think he's referring to [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKo\_8XKVqGQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKo_8XKVqGQ)
---
He has a lot of "magic weapon" and "OP" vids.  Take them with a grain of salt.  It's clickbait even if I like his channel in general.
---
Honestly I think SCORE wise, double SCORE was way better.  That was an extra 2,500 SCORE per day.  You would have to to get 250,000 xp a day to make the same amount of score using the gain 10,000 xp for 100 SCORE challenge.  Even with double XP, that is a lot.
---
NW
---
They will tell you there is nothing they can do
---
Not sure what you mean by high pitched noises, can you hear it in the link I mentioned? If it's a sound shared by regular protectron NPCs it might be easier to locate.
---
Nice!
---
It is casual? Well... the military also has a casual underarmor...
---
Pretty much yes
---
Okay.  *Most.*
---
Wow so this is how the game is supposed to look. Looks much different when I‚Äôm playing on my OG 2013 xbox one lol
---
Looks amazing
---
Why?
---
Would you like to speak to a manager?
---
Me.
---
I think bloodied type builds could maybe use a slight nerf, but honestly, its because they designed 4 things to work so well together low health in a vaccum that once players put it together was like, oh hey... this actually makes the game feel more like FO4 --- aaaaand everything else is absolutely utterly garbage. I'd redesign this whole thing personally.
---
It says casual on atomshop but it is actually the same as the normal ss underarmor with its modding.
---
BUT
---
It is bugged and does not accept the mod, lost 8 fluxes for nothing just now, as i tried to craft it two times.
---
Someone melted a queen solo with a Gauss shotgun on video early on in Wastelanders, then I tried it myself with BGS and full unyielding SS set.  Nope.  Not even on private server.  
---
With all the updates, undocumented changes, and BS going around, take these with a grain of salt.  I've only seen legacy explosive heavy guns melt everything in sight, and THAT is annoying.
---
I keep trying to expand it as "SecServ."  It's not as convenient, but what are you gonna do.  "SS Armor" sounds wrong.
---
Thanks tips, that's why I said I misread.
---
Seems like it‚Äôs happened to a lot of people this week. Am I shocked? Kinda not really. Bethesda ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
whew. pretty sure i had just rifleman equipped and was hitting something like 4k? crits on super mutants non ultracite, so i can‚Äôt even imagine what it would be like with perk stacking...
---
If that was 3d printed then I need to fire up my printer and get some stuff made
---
Everyone bitches that this dupe ruined the economy. Can someone explain to me how this last weapon dupe ruined the economy, but the previous 5 weapon dupe waves didn‚Äôt?
---
This again
---
I sell like three of them per day.  
---
I know that they are needed for some tadpole quests, i got the plan   
---
a year ago, when it was available, but it seems that they got rare¬¥for some reason.
---
a proper bloodied build can still be killed by random trash mobs, even with all the relevant perks and effects.
---
I play solo anytime I do a challenge like that so I‚Äôm not just deadweight. It‚Äôs the courteous thing to do if I‚Äôm not planning on actually playing.
---
You're a true hero, sir.
---
It's an actual coca Cola bottle with an improvised nuka Cola label. And it's filled with Cola.
---
As much as I would love this I doubt Bethesda will do it because at some point they are going to sell us pets.
---
If you want a refund you need to go through Bethesda's site. You can't get refunds here.
---
We also have to take into account whether or not it was solo, public (low participation), or public (entire server) for context of "OP".  Because the God Howard buffs his Queen accordingly.
---
I submitted a ticket. The response I got had nothing to do with my problem, but was a generic response regarding score that is not being awarded. Good luck! To submit a ticket go to Beth/support/76/scroll down to black rectangle that says submit ticket.
---
A bloodied build
---
Funny how maxed out players, with maxed out ammo, and maxed supplies are the ones sitting up on the fences and FO1st camps. Just chilling, just saving ammo. Meanwhile any newer player is going to waste all ammo, chems, and be stuck in bum F Egypt when the SBQ finally dies. "Finally lands perfect jumps to get up onto the floating survival tent, only to find scrap boxes aren't available to you" F
---
I'm so glad! Got to look out for each other!
---
Hmmm. Still not showing for me. Weird.
---
Edit: works in browser but not in my app. Bizarre.
---
I had a couple of first time random encounters last night.  That was one of them with the same results.  Another was a scarecrow surrounded by broken explosive boxes east of Watoga.
---
Because hes clearly not from a vault, he most likely stole the gear and went with it just to get inside foundation.
---
He doesnt even have a pip boy lol
---
I got jumped from behind by a lvl 91 Glowing Deathclaw while also fighting a few Charred Ghouls and he basically one shot me and forced a respawn. Some of them still have that kick you gotta watch out for
---
To be honest I wished that the fire watchtower came out today
---
How much for the gun ? (Rocket Raccoon voice)
---
I have a very similar setup with a hidden 1x1 room on my top floor with the silent small generators in - i waited ages for them to be added back to the atom shop for this and they're great. The only detractor is you're limited to the number you can build.  
---
My issues with noise were eliminated with the turret bug where they disappear leaving the cable behind - zero noise, zero defense.
---
I don‚Äôt want a bundle every week. But I agree that it‚Äôs too much resale.
---
I have the same problem
---
You're badass.
---
  If you're doing well with your current build I recommend getting as much gear as you can before starting. as I think having the full 5 piece bonus from unyielding and a blooded weapon will help enormously as you fine-tune your character. 
---
  I tried it with only two pieces of unyielding armor and no bloodied weapon. so it didn't really work for me. I'm now hunting for a good Bloodied weapon and more armor as I did enjoy playing that way the extra special and perk Bonuses running low health character are insane. I did have trouble maintaining Nerd Rage.
---
  I found it hard to go from being unkillable almost in my current stealth Rifelman build to being one-shotted.
---
It is the sound that comes with the music, when the slocum joe bot does move,it makes very sqeaky sounds, but maybe it is embedded in the same sound file.
---
I'm not a modder.
---
Par for the course
---
He's not even wearing vault clothing, the dude just looted a Vault-Tec gift shop and claimed he was in a vault... Without a vault suit or pipboy... What a dumbass. At least Ward isn't lying to try and look cool.
---
Ok I get you, the system should be carefully crafted though and not end up like the typical mmorpg auction house.
---
I personally would love an improved trade window first :)
---
I'm not even surpriced..
---
Boushh is the Bounty Hunter she was disguised as! ;)
---
Me, but with my "team Responder medic" alt, especially when I learned fire mods don't proc Friendly Fire perk apparently and the flamer doesn't work (you have to melee with it! much fire!).
---
Can't you not wear armour with the stealth suit?
---
I hold my breath as the screen loads hoping it hasn't hit me, sorry for your loss.
---
I don't mind magic weapons existing but I sure as heck do mind people doing it on public servers. On some level, having a magic gun is fun and it's really cool to watch things like the SBQ just melt as you hit them.
---
I have a magic heavy weapon, but I've at least got the decency to stick to my private server when using it. I call over a bunch of friends with similar guns and we each take a few shots till she's down. Nobody wastes their time and effort coming to a queen only to get yoinked.
---
In publics it's regular guns only for me. I do want to make sure I get my tags in, but I'm not going to take it away from everyone else in order to do it.
---
Also I think he only lost his Nuka Tapper saves because he was exploiting.
---
100% agree well said
---
Respawn
---
I would love if they added a map (and then a loading screen option) for a Melee only mode. Could be Watago - would work well with all the trenches outside of the city. Melee is all but useless in NW I've found, so having a mode without just that would be a cool addition.
---
Thorn or ss. I'd say thorn since after 350 Dr its pointless. Unless you really want the jetpack. Also solar is pointless for a bloodied build
---
Yeah. But holy calzone an entire week of weekly progress is gone :/ that‚Äôs a slap to my face and not the good kind
---
I agree, my eyes went immediately to the coke bottle. You can get real Mexican coke on Amazon Prime, it aint cheap, about $8 for 4 bottles but they look like the real 50's type glass bottles. You can get blank plastic nuka cola bottles on ebay but with a 3D printer, who needs to buy online? Ammarite? But anyway, great outfit overall, except from thecoke bottle.
---
You can see guys' trunks with that outfit. I was laughing at somebody's ally just last night over that. 
---
This is just a SWAG, but I think underwear is part of the base model for humans, so it's probably not something they *can* fix. Maybe a costume mod for females that covers it up? Hard to believe this made it past even a casual QA, but.... yeah...
---
Bad ass 
---
I always wanted to do cosplay and always tho fallout would be good for it
---
Mirelurk kings are really the only thing that annoy me these days. Fuckers are nasty. That acid, lorde!
---
I like a 5-10minute fight.  I still have to dump thousands of 2mmEC to meaningfully contribute.  People want easy without taking risks and choices that inconvenience them.  It's human nature.
---
My Bloodied GM makes it so I have to farm acid, lead, and steel for hours to help with a couple fights, and I have to choose between the safety of PA or a full buttressed UY SS armor set (radiation resistance is not great).  People bitching about OP bloodied endgame builds is not something I give much care to.
---
Why even bother grinding the endgame and earning your gear?  If it's too accessible for the people that don't put in the work, it makes the whole experience cheap for everyone.
---
Did you take a berry mentats?
---
Agree us unarmed builds have to wait for her to land can get quite annoying. While we get in close on her she puts her focus on us so you heavy gunners can have free rain to lay into her
---
Did you take mentats? Some drug can do that if you take it.
---
Cool thanks! I don't see many talking about this, rare but not as desirable as the asylum outfits or travelling  coat. Still neat though!
---
Do y'all know if they typically reduce the prices for flooring before taking it out of the shop? I'm holding out for the pallet floor to see it it gets marked down. I definitely want it but I'm too cheap to pay full price up front if it'll be marked down the last week it's in the shop üòÖ
---
No
---
I‚Äôd agree,the only other one I Rock Is the shovel backpack jammy,that seems to go good wit most stuff.
---
Right now the closest we've got is the Colossus plushy that makes a noise when you "Interact" with it.
---
That said, I got it on the PTS and it's still pretty cool.
---
Restart the game
---
I‚Äôd have to agree. It‚Äôs all rather a shambles honestly, considering this board was the major new content as the rest was pushed back, and the response was lacklustre at best, especially considering the problem wasn‚Äôt fixed. 
---
One would hope or expect something more would be done when they eventually do get on top of the issue, but who knows.
---
Thank you! This is all good info peeps üëç
---
The Scorchbeasts smoke now has another colour
---
Who is going to take the plunge and test it out?
---
I would like another prefab camp (besides red rocket). I don‚Äôt have enough time to build a proper camp so mine currently looks like garbage.  One day I‚Äôll get around to it.
---
I have a full Unyielding heavy combat armor build already, does it even make sense to try and go for either then?
---
I've found my bloodied handmade does much more damage that my bloodied GS per shot.  It's not a bad option for those that want to help by keeping Her Majesty agro'd and limit her from flying off.  Definitely more usable when she lands than a GS or GP.
---
Do you have a link to datamined pictures of it, please?
---
Protip, if you dont have a hazmat suit to wear, have rDaway handy as well.
---
When?
---
Ok there are sounds like that in the files. They're not specific to the vending machine though, so if it works it will be disabled for all protectrons you encounter. I'll give it a shot later tonight and maybe I can give you the mod on discord or something (it will be a very small file).
---
The stealth suit has dr, any dr will reduce zerker damage. So you need to break the suit first
---
&gt; 3 people who know what there doing
---
They don't know what they are doing at all.  Melting a queen with magic weapons takes zero skill.
---
I'm at like level 33 with it at the moment so I hope I can get it completed
---
The different tents were monthly rewards. Every month you get something different, and sometimes it's a tent skin.
---
It won't be a huge difference. And you are best off just running your unyielding untill you get a full set of uny in the armour you choose
---
Solar only regens you, and your teammates health if your above 60% health. Not good for bloodied
---
Thorn vs SS is a hard choice. Thorn is gonna always be a 3 star when crafting, but is more expensive to craft. Yet, the mods are easier to obtain as they only cost caps and are bought at the vendor
---
SS provides unmatched mobility due to the jetpack. Its not as expensive to craft, but you can get 1-3 star when crafting. Its mods also cost gold so you have to grind more notes.
---
SS has much better DR/ER, and it does make a difference. Besides the legendary effects on the armor, the Thorn set does give you bleed damage on both targets and melee attackers, and a stealth boost.
---
&gt;The armor and underarmor is new technically but who the hell doesn't wear an outfit that covers them? Lol
---
I like to get creative with my characters generally, lot more you can do mix n matching armour rather than just slapping on an outfit and helmet and calling it a day
---
I switched from Bloodied to Junkies cause i got  tired of managing rads. I feel the dmg difference is pretty minimal atleast so far. Was in a Sbq and had no trouble dealing dmg to her either
---
Yeah, a raiders-settlers set seemed like a no brainer after the tents.
---
Wait until everyone leaves the event, and you'll be able to respawn. It's just server lag from the event and so many people in one place. Waiting just a few minutes works 100% of the time for me.
---
If you force-quit the game, you will still get the event rewards as long as the event was completed. But you won't get back your dropped junk or any loot from dead enemies.
---
Not on me, but you can see it in the storefronts for the gauss Minigun paint
---
You think that is worth 300 caps üòÇ
---
Very good point as well
---
You sit there, think about what you did wrong and like it
---
Seems to be every door I come across when it starts happening; not just the RR garage door. Doors in my camp, doors at the Whitespring, doors at other camps... it's more annoying with the garage because of the longer animation, but this has been a thing for a while.
---
Can I grab a link please
---
Who tf would downvote this?
---
Ok tell me your issue and ill fix it no need to be an arse
---
Just try it. Maybe start with smaller local conventions or something like that. Most people there are super kind and helpful with ideas to improve.
---
They are a reward for seasons 2.
---
Source? Pylon V13 works.!!!!
---
Oh, you're referring to the suit specifically. Sorry, I thought you were talking about breaking armour to wear with the suit.
---
The game is more than just the current challenge.  Have done all the quests?  There are a lot of story lines to follow in between your grind.
---
That better for you Lord ?
---
It's obviously a scam targeting new players.
---
It‚Äôs a drop from the boss I‚Äôm assuming? If so that awesome! I‚Äôd like to see guns or character skins / gun skin drops that have a theme to the boss you‚Äôve killed.. that would be cool to in my opinion
---
same thought üòÇüòÇ
---
Might go with the thorn over time then as of now I'd rather keep crafting to try and get a bloodied guase shotgun.
---
It's a well known bug. Sorry that it happened to you, but there's nothing to be done
---
1 look at my karma 2 Why the fuck would i scam a new player ? Im not a cunt
---
A quick search or look around this form could easily show you that this is a very well known issue.
---
Mawfuckin bootleg fireworks.
---
yup. i would love for the budget to just be increased (again) OR just give everyone two camps. 1st members can have their tent still. 
---
this would also help with all the fast traveling issues we have w/out any fast travel hubs.
---
Yeah I'd recommend getting the guns you want first. Then trying for thorn, it's more expensive than the ss to craft but at least it's always 3*
---
Bye scammer.
---
Ok asshole !
---
I had pictures of the construction, but I can't find the SD card anymore... It's made of 36 3d printed plastic parts I glued together. The print alone took more than 3 days. And the paint (with LEDs) 4 weeks.
---
The "magic" guns Angry Turtle talks about seem to shift often.  His [recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mRX-MEPzhs) was about "magic effects" instead of guns. 
---
It's shit like this thread that spreads misinformation.  OP's talking about either legacy weapons or hacked guns.  Not AT's "magic" weapons.
---
Was at the junk pile just south of deathclaw island on a riverbank.
---
I am actually happy that I don't "have to" spend my atoms. What I save now I can use later on to finish the run.
---
Please fix ALL BROKEN SKINS.
---
There is litterally 22 different skins in game currently broken in one way or another.
---
FTFU
---
I have Vampire Gattling for the imposter and a two shot gattling when I don't want to use my Prime Bloodied.  What helps is that two of them are 90% weight reduction weapons so I can carry all three.
---
Well I'm a non power armor build so.
---
I was wondering the same! I feel like the answer's *probably* "no"... but they'd be a lot more useful and worthwhile if they do, so... fingers crossed, I guess?
---
Yea that way I can at least get more scrip back. You can trade them to people who also have the plans correct?
---
Thirded
---
Doesn't keeping her in the air longer increase the number of times she lands, which increases the number of support enemies, which increases the amount of XP we can get?
---
That‚Äôs a big negative Tim.
---
Good luck finding me
---
My first guess would be because there are dozens of these posts a day and it's already a known bug.  Many posters and readers here feel constantly reposting the same thing without adding anything new is annoying and clutters up the sub.  Not saying it's right to downvote you, just answering your question.
---
I didn't brush my hair in the morning on purpose. Now I have a deathhawk and can do a lot more with my hair.
---
Or allow us to earn atom rewards for SCORE levels above 100.
---
I‚Äôm aware that you misread. That‚Äôs why I provided you the correct information.
---
I think the problem is, the vendors had all items purchased, so none left of the normal aid. Some days i go to the vendor and it is completely empty for aid.
---
I can agree to both of those! This definitely wouldn‚Äôt be a slap-dash ammo converter lol. Bethesda just can‚Äôt release enough content to keep up with the grind and still make it fun and that‚Äôs definitely getting harder with issues like duping. 
---
They need a better system where players are seeing a reward for their work but there‚Äôs more factors than just terrible RNG. Think there could be something pretty cool and still lore-friendly with it, and honestly I think this could be kinda a reward as the end to Act 2 of the storyline Wastelanders began. 
---
Caps are now backed by gold, it‚Äôs time to set a standard value for them so trading isn‚Äôt so much work for the average player.
---
Same name as here. But I'm not really active.
---
Or rubbers.

https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/daily.html

Have you played RDR:O? It's really, really bad. The offline is great, but oh boy the online is crap.

Thanks, I'm just gonna have to test it out myself.

150 atom will fix this. Pay up.

Or for him to whine about how we used the explosives, instead of making a well for the community.

Go whine to Paige, raider scum.

Ideal plasma caster imo is a quad, FFR, 90

actually it has 0 food and never leaves its camp

 *¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø*
---
USSS ;)
---
If it ends up anything like One Tamriel, they'll just wind up being even easier than they are now.
---
Perhaps just a damage cap like Junkies has. Like 50% health is the max damage boost.
---
Ugh!
---
Sure Crater has 1 more loading screen to turn in gold. But it doesn't have Samuel.
---
There is so many items that haven't even been cycled a 2nd time an were seeing some stuff 3-5 times.
---
Another thing I notice is ricochet specifically says no PVP, why doesn't serendipity have the same drawback of no PVP?
---
Let us know if this got you your atoms back.
---
Nice gun. Did you find it laying on the ground at a train station?
---
As someone who regularly server hops for tamable animals Iv never seen a fox that‚Äôs tamable, but I have had a rabbit, and a mole rat but unfortunately they die so quick when npcs attack your base
---
I can second this. Not only is the Camo SS Underarmor not just a paint for the Actual SS underamor, it is an item on its own. And you can't apply any mods to it. If you try applying a mod, it just wastes material.
---
So stranger in numbers won't stack or not a good card to share?
---
Pretty sure datamines pulled up Charleston and Harper's Ferry as maps a while back!
---
I'm hoping for Mount Blair, Watoga, Wavy Willard's, and something in the Savage Divide
---
Indeed, i've lost today 4500 SCORE points even if I joined after the time they spawn on the menu. AGAIN, I mean, i have lost like 8000 score point by now. Fuck them, fuck them soooo hard.
---
Try putting it in your vendor for 5 caps. It‚Äôll sell pretty quickly to those that do use it.
---
Even if you dont complete it you still will have some good stuff at the end of the day
---
Lol, well I cosplay only 76, I'd be honored to follow ya fellow Fallout Cosplayer. IG: Vaultboye is mine üòä
---
The only risk is your own potato aim.
---
The Chinese Stealth Suit took almost all the risk out of the equation.
---
Ah thank you , Happy cake day !
---
Doesn‚Äôt that eat up mad camp budget as opposed to one fusion generator though?
---
Sorry If it‚Äôs a dumb question,I‚Äôm honestly curious though,I may go that route if not....
---
I mean, it makes sense. Skimpy sounds about right when it comes to female armor in Conan inspired stuff.
---
A far better conversion than a male wearing the sniper hero's outfit.
---
I'd love if the last weekend (or really any weekend) was a double everything weekend. Double SCORE, double XP, double daily vendor limits for scrip, caps, and bullion. I'm sure it would pull back a lot of players (even those already done the legendary run), and would be a nice thing for those who are still trying to finish, or had to deal with autocomplete SCORE bugs all season.
---
Double score would have been great if the one repeatable weekly was doubled.
---
Anecdotally, I have gotten my best drops from the alpha at Arktos.
---
Your grunge inspired art is really good!
---
This vault suit is awesome! Did you make it yourself?
---
Heh, I'm tempted to offer both scout masks\^^
---
Now I tried the berry mentats. They produce a pink smoke.
---
Slap on Travel Agent before you fast travel. Saves a ton of caps over the long run.
---
Okay, that made me laugh. Take your upvote and get out of here.
---
Told you.
---
She doesn't land because Bethesda "accidentally"  disabled crippling perks. Shooting her in the air was not a problem when crippling perks actually worked. In fact, shooting her in the air with crippling perks enabled was exactly how you could FORCE HER TO LAND.
---
Disabled crippling perks is  the biggest problem with the queen  not landing, but I keep seeing threads like this blaming players for standing on tents and drop site V9.  And if players standing on tents  and V9 prevents her from landing, that is a problem with the game's mechanics, not players.  Telling people not to stand in the wrong place is telling them to use a work around, which would not be necessary if the game wasn't broken. Everything you are talking about is Bethesda's fault, not the fault of players.  Stop blaming players for broken game mechanics that Bethesda keeps failing to fix.
---
Problems you see with the queen event has nothing to do with player etiquette and everything to do with broken mechanics.
---
I think they should add a "creative" bundle where it unlocks a few basic colors so we can mix match and maybe not look like everyone else. I dont really care for all my guns or armor to be black or ghilli.
---
I know.  That‚Äôs about what I sell them for.  And honestly I feel like that‚Äôs plenty.  I just can‚Äôt comprehend paying thousands for free cowboy outfits but whatevs.
---
I'd be fine with Canadian wheels.
---
Dude, go with it. I rolled an instigating GS. I am not even fully spec'd up in shotgun and my base damage is 606. It is a lot of fun to use, and benefits greatly from demolition expert. (far more than gauss minigun)
---
Yes, VATS is hella buggy with it. Yes rubberbanding happens, particularly with scorchbeasts. But most of the time, I lay waste mobs. I routinely 1 or two shot the glowing lv 91 deathclaw at Hopewell. 
---
If you aim low, with enforcer you will crush waves of ghouls, either outright killing them, or crippling them all.
---
So a pay to win mechanic, kinda.
---
Leveling up after 100 really doesn't have any weight, besides just looking 'cool'?
---
I mean, if someone were to just jump on the game after downloading from gamepass, they'd see that if they just bought all the atoms to finish the season they wouldnt need to spend as much time as it takes to level their character. Same can be said for people leveling alts
---
It's not the biggest thing. It's not even that bad of an idea honestly. But there shouldnt be anything after you completed the season. You decided to grind it/buy it out for a specific reward, just to have it done, or because you had nothing better to do. We knew these seasons would be long, no one needed to finish it (by any means) as fast as anyone did. You made your decision, now you just wait
---
The bungalow and greenhouse are both available.
---
Also agreed. Particularly because I feel like the ghillie stuff is very situational - I like it while wandering around in the Mire, but that's about it... which is why I still rather like the outfit from the NW event; can just use that whenever. All the rest, though... *please* let me just get a *plain* black skin for the other armors!
---
What I've seen lately is the event fails when time runs out. And her health is still very high when it does. Being a melee build, this is VERY frustrating.
---
The point is to have her land faster and multiple times yes. But shooting her in the air will keep her from landing which keeps the support groups from spawning. When she does land she will fly off when she feels like it (not sure if anything triggers her flying up) and if people just keep their finger of the trigger she will land again quickly.
---
Unyielding Thorn Armor is pretty effective
---
Wow, same. I always wonder who else is just regally sitting on their throne, taking in all the day's information at that time.
---
I‚Äôll check those out
---
Vault 76 vault suit is Micocostumes, mass produced online but quality is great. The Vault 51 is a commissioned vaultsuit.
---
Please also disable the  Choose a Perk/Move a Perk option when we open up our Perks. There is already a button there to get to this, and most players over level 100 (and likely lower), rarely every buy a card or move a perk. Let us just go right to our perk cards.
---
Wish the Free States bundle (the other one than the one we had a month or two ago) would come back at some point.. I want one of those backpacks.
---
What zones do you look for pets? Cuz I've noticed different animals in different places
---
Oh good, I'm not the only one who managed this in the last few days! I also got some great pictures, from east of the Mire to west of the Forest. It's hauntingly beautiful out there -- no music, no ambient sounds other than footsteps, nothing but sunrises through the trees and rolling hills.
---
Toilet paper award üßª
---
I mean. I don‚Äôt disagree with you. But I have probably equal hours in 76 and rdr2 online. There‚Äôs not much to do. There‚Äôs bugs, but I wouldn‚Äôt say anywhere near the bugs in 76. And you can speed across the map at a pretty good clip without the game stuttering.
---
Is that your gamertag?
---
It doesn‚Äôt she will be in the air just flying with nothing spawning if you want mob xp
---
Do rad rumble for all that
---
Right? Yeah, it would look great, but no animals and a totally empty world. Could you imagine if, say, all the Super Mutants just disappeared one day and never came back? And Bethesda refused to acknowledge it was a problem? I just can't with RDO anymore...
---
Flatwood monster effect?
---
That's the one! Couldn't remember the name &amp; too lazy to move my finger to open Wikipedia mobile ü§™

You‚Äôre not supposed to be able to have sky high tents, this fight was out we‚Äôll before first there‚Äôs no benefit to using it just do the fight right and you won‚Äôt Vick yourself

Actually I‚Äôve experienced times where even though I didn‚Äôt seek revenge I was still locked in PvP with the same person when I respawned

I am 180 üòÄ

Pie is Life

Uffff thought the same üôà
---
Nitpicking here, your special points are set up the same as your adventure mode character. I'd say that can make a difference to the perks set up that you want in NW. Because you may only have 1 END special point but want to use a level 3 card or 2 endurance perks. 
---
 I'm wondering though how are your special points arranged in NW if you've never played adventure mode?
---
Thanks I got it
---
Saw that tent high in the air once, and thought it's hilarious. How people even do that? How anyone gets an idea about it? Incredible.
---
The damage boost isnt worth it if you cant reliably craft the ultracite ammo. While people usually sell the required materials at good prices, and with good perks you can get alot out of crafting. 
---
But, as I said. If you cant reliably produce the ammo, just stick with regular 50 cal
---
Now if we could get this pinned along with guides to other events the community would be in a better place.
---
Lack of servers filled with high level players. Since game went to gamepass on xbox you have lots of low levels about. Dont launch nukes at prime without checking server first to see player levels
---
Love it! Great job!
---
I had the option to put my free states jetpack on my t65 without knowing the plan
---
Dressed in drag lol nice dude. Congrats! Being a father is the best thing I‚Äôve ever done in my life.
---
Same thing happened to me twice in a row but worked the third time. I waited like 20 minutes to see if she would start moving but never did.
---
Hmm. The bobblehead stand, firing range posters, and cinderblock wallpaper are neat, I suppose, but a bit tough for me, personally, to justify any of them for those prices (especially since we're not getting Atoms from daily challenges anymore). Only one I could really see considering would be the posters, *if* they show damage numbers so you could make an actual firing range to test your weapons... feel like that's probably not likely, though, sadly, so... meh?
---
Ok first of all calm down abit. This wasn‚Äôt an attack on players. Also please read the post before you comment. Nowhere do I say dont stand on tents. I said don‚Äôt spawn them in the open areas that she typically likes to land. Not everything on the internet is meant to offend you bro
---
Personally glad to have a week without temptation. Atoms are scarce now so they can cool it with all the awesome shit that I can't live without.  üò¨
---
Bloody Mary
---
Do you need people to match your level?  I'm down for coordinating events.
---
personally I think that would result in some wacky, almost certainly bugged interactions between players and damage dealt.
---
the engine does not deal well with pvp. vats being broken is a perfect example.
---
Congratulations! You're about to embark on one of the most amazing, rewarding quests of life. Best of luck to you!
---
I didn't need you to do that, because I knew that info already. If I didn't know I would have asked. I misread the conversation, that is all. Next time I'll make sure I pay more attention, so that I can avoid arguments with neckbeards.
---
Who cares lol
---
And of course heavy radiation intake is just bad for everyone, worse for low health but still. I had to mess with my friends cause they're all unyielding and bloodied and were bragging about damage numbers. We all have the healing factor mutation so I just casually put on a maxed out rad sponge card and laughed maniacally as they all began losing their minds as their rads drained away and they were sucked back to reality as their stats plummeted and damage went to complete crap. It's sort of mean but when you're all running that build and constantly ragging me about your superior damage, no need for grim reapers sprint cause of your 300+ AP bars, and not needing hard bargain to get better prices. Well let's see what happens when I play team medic from the Vanguard's role. Wait you mean you wanted to keep those rads? Sorry about that boys.
---
If it‚Äôs like the water wheel or fridges that don‚Äôt do anything spectacular then I‚Äôd say they are only posters. But these are missed opportunities

Idk the scrap box already makes people hoarders and adding your to the survival tent and c.a.m.p makes carry weight perk cards basically useless and people wouldn‚Äôt have to get rid of anything making the survival tent a bottom less backpack
---
Nope, traded it for a few Handmades
---
one thing that i had to do for me when trying to get the perk loadout mod to work is make / edit the fallout76custom.ini inside game folder( where the exe is) as for some reason the one in the my docs did not work
---
That's what I wrote in the ticket. adding the  equivalent in atoms to skip the levels lost due to their inaction in fixing a bug that's been reported for over a year, but always ignored because it was profitable to them to not have challenges give atoms, is the least they could do to make up for it.
---
I do like the idea of hiding it in a monument.

I currently have a 1x1 building for my vendors that i tucked the compact generators into. At first it was just 3 to cover the 3 vendors, but then I needed more and more power, for lights, the shower, water purifiers etc...
---
I built my camp right outside helvetia during fasnacht and i really like the area so I'm still here, but now scorched keep attacking so I put up some laser turrets. In total I counted that I need 66 power to keep everything running. Unfortunately the max you can get from 20 compacts is 60, so I may just get rid of the shower.
---
I did find a way to cram 2 compacts inside each other and still connect them, so I can get all 20 in behind my vendors, so at least that'll keep everything nice and hidden.
---
edit: took some photos of my set up.  [https://imgur.com/a/MivQ4gA](https://imgur.com/a/MivQ4gA)
---
Good point.
---
It‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs bad to share but not everyone uses mutations, so it wouldn‚Äôt benefit everyone. Also, people that need this perk, probably already have it equipped and no, it does not stack (tested this myself yesterday). If you don‚Äôt have anything else to share, don‚Äôt stress, but try to share perks that don‚Äôt just support one type of build. Like, I wouldn‚Äôt share a Commando card because not everyone uses commando. Or I use a perk called Radicool that boosts your strength with the more rads you receive (excellent perk for a Bloodied Melee build) but that‚Äôs only going to help 1 in like 10 players I‚Äôm guessing.
---
Shooting her in the air should not keep her there longer. It should cripple her and force her to land, with the right perks. But Bethesda "accidentally" disabled crippling perks on the queen.
---
I'm guessing because ammo is an unofficial currency in the game. Just use a mule. I have 5 mules. My main charachter then I have a Weapons Mule, Armour Mule, Ammo Mule and Chems Mule
---
Can I ask how long it took to get through the purveyor? Unless you bought it off a vendor or the market.
---
Procreation is a hoax, it‚Äôs the 5G towers beaming out pregnancies.
---
You can not trade any gold bullion weapon/armor/camp item to other players. Even if they learned the plan also. They are all character locked
---
Pub
---
Just tried it. Yes, shielded lining looks like it can‚Äôt be applied.
---
Didn't get it from the purveyor. Traded it for weapons that I did roll from her / got from legendary enemies, took about a year to get those
---
I know for a fact shooting her in the air won't prevent her from going into her swoop crop dusting attack. I've tried. So I'm not convinced it resets her flight pattern and prevents her from landing.
---
And I'm not so sure about the increased damage resistancewhile she's in the air, either. My damage numbers seem to reflect a longer range. Not increased resistance. When she hovers close to the ground and I'm underneath her, my damage numbers are the same as when she on the ground.
---
Get that perk card that removes rad when you heal someone too.
---
This needs to change. They need to set us free but they add new things with even more restrictions.
---
I found in in someones vending machine ! But thanks for your commands ! Gonna keep that in mind next time i need it
---
I used to carry one or two around in case of Deathclaw. Nowadays, I'm more worried about Ants, Cave Crickets, and Mirelurk Kings
---
Thank you sir!
---
Damn synths
---
Thanks.
---
Have been sharing stranger cause I thought it stacked with itself if someone else shared it.
---
Will change to something else!
---
Ward is a watered down Rick Grimes.
---
It's their new way to curb duping 
---
I'm guessing most new weapons/armor will be this way
---
The truth is ive seen her land when people were on the fence and tents.  I have seen her not land when people were on tents and fences.  The game is broken and people are trying to figure out how to work around that and trying to communicate that to others in game doesn‚Äôt work.  This is a game problem.  And no one seems to really know what the triggers are.  Perk cards? Tents?  How about this?  Fix the stupid queen bethesda.
---
Make sure you get the ammo converter from this season. Likely you can get their without spending atoms but their may be other pieces you want from the board before the seasons end.
---
maybe They're waiting until after the Legendary Run event, so people will blow their atoms to finish it, then (maybe) have to buy atoms to get the paint? 
---
evil corporate marketing ploy... or Synth Behavior... tune in next week, same Todd time, Same Todd channel, same Todd face
---
Didn‚Äôt even know there was a season tbhüòÇ
---
Lol who hurt you? People weren‚Äôt kidding when they said r/f76 has the saltiest members. Did you even read the post? I never said don‚Äôt stand on tents. I said don‚Äôt place them where she likes to land. And I‚Äôm well aware of the janky game mechanics, iv been here since beta. I‚Äôm a little mind blown by your logic. Why don‚Äôt YOU contact Bethesda and tell them to fix the mechanics. I‚Äôm offering a couple effortless pointers to help make the event more enjoyable for everyone and try to negate the bugs of the event and you feel the need to start freaking out?
---
I just want the vintage football uniform underarmor to come back :(
---
a collectron for your camp
---
it's a trick, get an axe
---
I‚Äôll prime it for you if you want. As far as crafting the ultra cite ammo that would be up to you of course.
---
Thanks for the advice! I was looking forward to buy it when I got online
---
Same thing on PC aswell
---
Patience.
---
How do I level up on it?
---
I tried yelling at the sun, but got nothing
---
Isaac Dick
---
Agreed. Maybe get rid of some of the toxic players in the community while they are at it
---
What‚Äôs one of them?
---
A few people clearly.
---
Probably, but really will that change anything. People will always find a way to take advantage of it. And whose to say someone won't figure a glitch out to dupe those weapons and transfer them.
---
You no longer get atoms for doing the daily and weekly challenges. Now you get score points that progress your marker along the seasons board. Each level comes with a reward.
---
I can‚Äôt remove it from my inventory either to store it.
---
&gt;I never said don‚Äôt stand on tents. I said don‚Äôt place them where she likes to land.
---
You told them don't stand in the wrong place.   There  should be no such thing as a "wrong place."  The fact that there is means that the game is broken.
---
Wow, they managed to fuck them both up! Feel sorry for those who paid $12 for this crap drop.
---
Mike oxlong, Hugh mongus, Mike rotch
---
Ah right thanks, how long do I have until they expire?
---
Nice work, i printed a laser rifle a few months ago (not for cosplay or anything just to mount on my wall) and i have an almist complete plasma rifle that ive made, need to put the grip on it and paint it then it too is going on the wall
---
Do you have the bungalow and if so is it easy to setup items in there?
---
Or just play the way you want and have fun. This is a video game. 
---
Don't confirm to what others want just so you can make *their* grind more efficient.
---
Agreed. I thought I was interested in the SS backpack at 350, then I saw the shovel one for 400. Both look great.
---
I don‚Äôt really get these suggestions, if low HP is so tanky and has many amazing benefits but high HP is hard to maintain, then go low HP and enjoy the benefits and be happy?
---
I don't see why they'd have to add it to the Survival Tent.  Make 'em CAMP only boxes, if they were to implement them.
---
Alek MacLitt
---
I hadn't lost anything until today, then all together weeklies and dailies all autocompleted except the NW one that I never do anyway, and a single weekly.
---
8750 points, 4 levels, just gone. I've submitted a ticket in which I literally tell them that giving me the equivalent of those levels in atoms is the least they could do to make up for their inaction about this bug for the past year, and I encourage you to do the same, even if you don't care about the Season.
---
It was convenient for them when we lost atoms, but now that they've taken them out of the weekly/daily challenges entirely, they should be shamed into paying atoms to every one who lost levels.
---
Bloodied Powerfist, Get powerfist attack or swing speed with STR. 
---
Unyielding , +STR heavy combat set, takes a week to farm.
---
Talons, Iron Fist, Twisted muscles. Nerd Rage, Adrenal Reaction. Get Ninja perk. All that bloodied build stuff.
---
Get some Vintage Nukashine, glowing meat steak, mutant hound chops. All of these are easy to get your hands on.
---
Wait until she lands, spam the consumables, spam power attack. Should be over in 30 seconds.
---
STR should be around 50. Any additional consumables just feel like an unnecessary hassle.
---
Idk maybe
---
&gt;Fix the stupid queen bethesda.
---
Yes, exactly,  Speaking as a chronic nuke launcher,  I know for a fact that the event went  way smoother when crippling perks actually worked on her.   If you had several heavy gunners with one gun army perk, should would land and she was stay crippled on the ground for a very long time.  Ever since crippling perks quit working the event has been a nightmare.
---
No need to test.  Taking a chem ur addicted to does not negate the 10% damage given.
---
That would be awesome, I just hope it‚Äôs something I can shoot without actually destroying it. I‚Äôve wanted to set up a shooting range at my camp for awhile but figured it couldn‚Äôt actually be used.
---
I didn't mean that sprinting with speed demon was instead of fast travelling.
---
I meant that the landscape/textures/npc's etc take an age to load, and if you sprint around with speed demon you can see the delay. With a vehicle travelling any faster than normal sprinting speed the game would just glitch out constantly.
---
Yes this is wear I usually find it. This location is great for unique Headwear.
---
I'm over here wanting all the ride ons back so I feel you.
---
Hopefully they just give us something that uses existing exterior assets, and isn't just "a mini vault", as some of the leaked images have suggested.
---
Do you know how to read? Serious question. Only place I said don‚Äôt stand was ontop of V9. And why is your problem with me and not the creator of the ‚Äúbroken game‚Äù you seem to hate so much?
---
‚ÄúMid‚Äù September. You are probably so far behind that you couldn‚Äôt get to lvl 100 without significant grinding.  However you can buy levels with atoms. Wait until the last day or so to do that though. The atom cost per level is always the same but the score points to get the next level is progressive. Pays to spend atoms on your last levels than your first.
---
There's actually a simple fix/solution to this that is 100% reproducible and has successfully worked for every time, and it doesn't involve waiting.
---
But I got downvoted for it in the last thread like this. I guess people aren't interested in simple solutions...
---
Well its a bug they have said they are going to fix you obviously knew about it before hand like most of the community most of us do the sensible thing don't be logged in before the reset say 15 minutes before and log in maybe 15 minutes after reset.
---
HA HA XP MACHINE GO DINGGGGGG
---
Damn it. I already bought it.
---
Guess I'll just use it for NW
---
Some people claim that if you wait long enough you'll respawn. I've let it go for 15 minutes and nothing. Maybe it works for them but not for me.
---
Close the game and restart is all you can really do. You learn to avoid dying at the end of an event AT ALL COSTS. What ever you gotta do. Sacrifce junk. Fail the event. Whatever.
---
Omg i love you. Im a runner and hide til i he kinda fighter. Game changing knowledge
---
To each their own. There should be a flavor for everyone.
---
Yeah I am trying to get with ppl that are of enough lvl to kill SBQ. Since they added the game to game pass I have seen a lot of lower lvls there hiding and such during fight. I love that there are new ppl to the game but the servers are swarmed with them and hard to find servers with more then 2 or 3 lvl 100+
---
Do you even play this game?
---
Fair enough, I‚Äôm not bothered about grinding loads, just going to try and enjoy the game for a bit
---
Haha radiation barrel plan pls drop go BRRRRRRRRRe
---
So sure, but you're only taking about 10% of a bloodied build damage away (less is melee) that way -- most run at about 20% health (or +80% damage) but bloodied itself isn't even the problem -- the fact that bloodied stacks with nerd rage, and then adrenal mutation which all wants you be be at 20% health to work -- then throw in perks like Serendipity, and a full set of unyeilding armor, you're at +15 to everything SPCIAL , and furthermore you dodge about 1/3rd of all hits that would come your way, you also kill about 150% faster than everyone OR -- if you're in power armor, use emergency protocols, instead of serendipity, and your damage received gets HALVED AGAIN.
---
Meanwhile all other builds get the following Synergies: &lt;end of List&gt;
---
I do have it, when I used it I had my vendors in there. It worked great for that, but it did take some finesse to get everything situated the way I wanted it. I have heard recently that it‚Äôs got some issues with people being able to walk through the walls of it so I would recommend doing a little reading up on what exactly those issues are prior to purchasing.
---
Not gonna comment on your tone, but just for the record: did you go to either the Atomic Store or the Legendary Run before joining a server?
---
0. Still yet to get a kill. Still yet to even fire a bullet.
---
Maybe a knockdown will be more useful instead of stagger
---
Save them nothing good in the atom shop atm.
---
Awesome. Thank you I just remember some swarm quests that I have a issues with some of the swarm and I don‚Äôt want to fail
---
I promise I won‚Äôt downvote you this time.
---
Huh. It has on mine. Xbox
---
Yeah keep 2 frames, name them appropriately. I like to call mine ! PA Raider lvl 15 or ! PA Empty. This way it puts it at the top of the apparel tab for easy selection and you can see what you carrying. Put the pieces in the lvl 15  etc .. you can rename things to make it easier find and save time. Also only put 1 fusion core in a frame at a time, putting more will cause you to lose them.
---
Plans after completing the quest, but yeah. There's actually quite a few plans; Wendigo skin rug, the Colossus' heads on a stick... something else but I'm forgetting what.
---
I think that's what this is a test for. There's the plush Colossus and three "Cursed" weapons.
---
I don't know why they're Cursed as they have no drawback other than reduced durability, but I think they're trying to see how people'll respond.
---
They're also still the same rust and grime coloured skins you expect on the Pick Axe, Shovel, and Harpoon Gun.
---
If people like this stuff, maybe we'll start to see more with more end game down the line.
---
Heck, if this becomes the norm, it'd be neat if they went back and redid the SBQ in a similar vein: "Scorched" BoS weapons (say the Minigun, Gatling Laser, and Combat Rifle), and a plushy Queen that screeches.
---
Ward used to be a raider.  He's real embarrassed about it, and the only way he can truly love himself again is if he murders every last raider in the land one at a time.
---
&gt;  Only place I said don‚Äôt stand was ontop of V9.
---
You should be able to stand wherever you like with no issue.  The fact that you can't is a problem with Bethesda, not players.
---
Levels after 100 will mean a lot when Legendary perks are released if they do not change how they are leveled up.
---
My level 1 alt is Bollocky Bill
---
At this point I would be more than willing to pony up for that option
---
Gwendoline Sweet
---
Google it :P
---
Forgot about that honestly
---
So It does make double xp after the season a little more pay to win
---
I had a weird incident when the imposter fires her laser beam aimed directly at me while I was firing a Vampire‚Äôs ultracite laser into her face, I stood there full prepared to die but nothing happened. It‚Äôs as if my laser cancelled her laser when they were fired right at each other. Very strange few seconds as if time stood still.  Then shit happened, my core was empty and when I reload I got sent flying lol
---
^this üç∫
---
Awesome thank you for the info. It is just one of those things I didn‚Äôt do cause my dmg output for a long time was low or I would have to go through a crap ton of ammo
---
I just don‚Äôt understand how this hasn‚Äôt been fixed yet. It blows my mind.
---
It's a robot that wanders around your camp and collects junk or scrap while you play. Junk makes the word go round.
---
There's been different versions of it. Raider; the most recent version can also find guns and ammo for you (you have to change what it looks for) and don't forgot to lock it.
---
Surprised you got any time with her at all. Every fight these days, there seems to be somebody out there with bloodied, full-auto, explosive, anti-everything, whatever weapons that just melt her in three minutes flat. I've seen videos of people solo'ing her in under five minutes. It's absurd.
---
Solar is worthless on a Bloodied build.  Thorn is nice nice for damage, but the high rad resistance is really nice for a Bloodied build and you will be doing a ton of damage already.
---
That‚Äôs a creative name I must say
---
Hugh Janus...Toby lerone....Chris peacock....Emma roids.....mike hunt......
---
Wall deco. I‚Äôd think. I‚Äôm only lvl 65. So idk
---
Thank you. That and the "then vs than" thing is a personal pet peeve. LOL
---
Ok thanks for letting me know!
---
Exploit
---
Yup. If i stay and heal the NPCs nobody collects ore. If i collect ore nobody heals the NPCs. It rustles my jimmies.
---
It‚Äôs a blueprinting exploit.
---
Same, and I didn't use the atomic store.
---

Dickie Buckskin
---
I agree, I was able to progress better during double score. Clearly both are important to folks. Double score takes way less time and effort for us who can‚Äôt commit a lot of time.
---
Exploits. I think you can blueprint it from the workshop and place it at a camp. I saw a guy with 3
---
No vats is just bugged in general I've made a post about this before, and yea only some guns like the railway rifle and the tesla work in vats
---
Save it, Atoms are hard to come by now, only buy something you feel is super cool and you can't resist ..
---
I'm not sure if my instructions confused people or what, but anyway here you go:

/r/fo76/comments/hy7m32/whenever_you_die_as_encryptid_ends_you_cannot/fzb19xt/
---
Yea I'm going with thorn, seems like it was made for low health players.
---
As fast as possible probably
---
Don't forget about the food buffs.
---
This wasn‚Äôt an argument. That would imply the possibility that you were right. You weren‚Äôt. 
---
And it‚Äôs curious that an alleged ‚Äòneckbeard‚Äô can read a post before commenting... *but you couldn‚Äôt.*
---
Now, where exactly does that put you in comparison with ‚Äòneckbeards‚Äô?
---
Nothing I said to you was hostile. But it‚Äôs interesting that you decide to get offended. 
---
What‚Äôs the word for someone that gets offended at non-offensive content?  It‚Äôs on the tip of my tongue.
---
I'm waiting on Thanksgiving display cases, fish lamp and cat topiary
---
It's a glitch. Just loot it and go on with your day.
---
I just want them to bring back the the contemporary house stuff, I missed out the first time :(
---
shoot 'em in the face
---
Yup, it's there. Thx, i'm blind.
---
Honestly, if you earned and/or bought your way to 100 already, then congrats for finishing, getting all season rewards, and earning parole from daily challenge grind. That is all there is to any season pass system. So congrats on knocking out your first round of filler content as we wait for the BoS DLC. But did people really expect extra credit for burning through the season faster?
---
Same thing just happened to me, although logging into adventure is the first thing I did since I knew that doing anything else had a possibility of challenges autocompleting.
---
The challenges autocompleted anyway. 8750, or 4 levels of the board game, just vanished. I suggest sending a ticket in which you ask for the equivalent in atoms of the levels lost. if they get enough pressure probably they will realise that the year of inaction about this bug when the challenges rewarded atoms is coming to bite them in the ass.
---
I have this type of info engrained in my brain haha.
---
Wow, thank you! Didn't know it even existed as loot in the game.
---
cripple the legs
---
If you really have to heal the npcs in such a manner that you don't have the time to collect ore, something might be very wrong with your defense team
---
Not offended, annoyed.
---
Well hot damn I just got bloodied explosive version of those this week. I'm not big on PVP, but my map doesn't show owned workshops. So I get rolled in all the time.
---
target their legs.
---
Still, its shit DPS against SBQ, even with 95% VATS chance when SBQ is far away, due to the arrow flying animation, it ended up not hitting.
---
On top of that, draw speed is terrible. I may be able to deal 600-ish and 800-900 with a crit to the SBQ head at near to mid range, but the time inbetween, other weapon type probably can deal 3-4 times more damage.
---
Only when dealing with normal mobs, I will find it reasonable. I still get very high VATS chance at a long range.
---
(Mine is a bloodied build btw. 2 bows, 1 ultracite, 1 explosive)
---
Isnt the cat part of the spring bundle?
---
They do a lot of useless weaving too, actually making it easier to hammer them due to their sheer size
---
They should bring back the steal mechanic to allow stealth builds to snatch the items.
---
Remember when Legendary The Dragon's were actually achievable?
---
Princess Die
---
I second collectron for a "useful" camp item. I like the raider one, he gets me chems.
---
You'd think so, but no. Unless I'm incredibly blind
---
The powerfist with its mod is the best in terms of DMG of unarmed. But with the gauntlet you get the amazing ability to craft legendary variants and honestly make your own luck
---
Tank killer should be fine but stuff like one gun army I think does it. 
---
I‚Äôve found if I can communicate and everyone does the same thing that ignoring her completely, killing all ground enemies and only shooting her when she lands is the best method. 
---
I now do this with all SB‚Äôs, you concentrate on killing ground scorched it seems to trigger a land. 
---
When shooting her in the sky your damage is reduced and you waste your ammo. Mop up the ground forces and wait for her to land.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt. When there are clearly better things to buy. I made the mistake of buying the plan. I crafted one. I wasn‚Äôt impressed. And haven‚Äôt crafted any since. Just like I made the mistake with the gauss pistol. What a waste as well. Gauss minigun, gauss shotgun, ss armor? Much better investment in my opinion.
---
What's a CTD?
---
Which is really, really annoying when they get into a shooting match with your turrets.
---
1shot in the torso
---
I have it since forever, never bought it, it was free for awhile I think
---
Blueprinting exploit. Currently have 110 of them set up at 3 workshops in total.
---
Still thin skinned. Accept the information and move on instead of throwing a temper tantrum and resorting to name-calling.
---
But thanks for sharing your success story of how close you are to finishing.
---
Yes cause that's what makes the game fun is let's all just play the exact same way. There should be enough support of both styles so that each is an equally viable way to play but the top tier builds thrive on bloodied and unyielding to do the stupid stuff they do.
---
Shotguns! Hit the head to disable the laser or cripple the legs so it can't follow you.
---
Yep, which is why you'd think when the greenhouse bundle came out it would be included
---
Legs then head
---
Oh... I can build you one I think?

True. But if you want to free up stash space fast, nothing beats a huge clearance sale!

And the fates laugh at me
---
They're usually sat at the entrance to the tunnels and not caring if ghouls get passed them. Or they're just not paying attention. 
---
They don't seem to realise they could go grab ore and not put it in until 30 seconds to go.
---
Good luck man. And congrats. It‚Äôs definitely not easy. But, nothing in life has made me happier than my two children.
---
Todd‚Äôs ban hammer
---
Also true.
---
This sub is probably a surprisingly smaller percentage of the player base than we like to think. 
---
At least that‚Äôs how it seems
---
Definitely got faster progress with double score, but it also depends on your build. A bloodied/unyielding build will probably get faster progress with double XP due to the high INT gained from it
---
They must've had low sales #s with the down home and green thumb bundles, it's like every other week one or the other is back up for sale
---
That's what gets me about all these Power Armor skins that block half the screen.  I'm holding machine gun down by my waist.  How the hell is my left arm suddenly covering my face when I'm in first person?

Dog food is amazing if you're just doing workshops and don't want to worry about food, equip good doggy.

We need a new beast... Mirelurk Queen x Sheepsquatch x Deathclaw...a Queen SheepClaw!

Or a Deathsquatch Queen!

And it could spawn little broodlings that look like tiny deathclaws that run up and attack you.

What u need is a level 251 bloodied commando with full top end gear. Dies in one shot then

Love the rifle, every one I have seen 3d printed has been too small, this one looks like it's actually about the right size. Awesome rust detailing too.
---
I did a cosplay the summer after Fo76's launch but it wasn't as original as this. I got ahold of a couple Think Geek replica weapons, the plasma rifle and super sledge and found a nearly identical green jumpsuit like the mechanics jumpsuit in the game, some combat boots, and a gas mask.
---
And while carrying both weapons and wearing a backpack I decided I should walk very slow every where I went, since I was clearly encumbered.
---
It was a good time though, found some awesome props at the convention I went to, someone had taken oldschool glass coca cola bottles and made nukacola and nukacola quantum, and they took another glass bottle and made sunset sarsaparilla. He also took altoid like tins and made mentat containers, even had the flavored ones. In addition to those he had made almost every cap from the different bottled drinks that weren't alcoholic.
---
Love the creativity.
---
Yeah sometimes it‚Äôs nice to have something to grind for even if it‚Äôs silly. I haven‚Äôt played in a while because there‚Äôs nothing I really want besides the fixer plan and doing encrypted with randoms is quite a task
---
What are you talking about?
---
Do you play on pc? Or consoles?
---
Lol. That‚Äôs half a million 556 a day üòÇüòÇ
---
I only do enough damage to ensure I get flux once she lands.  Then I focus on killing adds for XP and the occasional legendary.  I only use about 40-50 rounds on the queen and whatever in other mobs
---
Perks from someone opening a lunch box,
---
I can understand the secret service under armor not getting to take the secret service mods, that would be pay to win as you'd be completely bypassing the need to grind out the gold bullion to get the basic plans for the underarmor.
---
The t65 is best by a tiny amount for defense. I think the strangler heart is the best since its the only pa that gives a bounse, even though its tiny it's something. Then the t51b/ultracite
---
So that actually verifies my theory that the event itself isn't hard but that the general iq of the playerbase is rather low. Neat /s

Agreed.  Both the Black Shovel and the Secret Service Backpack are really the only ones I use anymore.

You might've lost out on that deal. As a BSS powerfist is worth a good amount as it is the most powerful unarmed weapon

awwwwwww snap you used the "R" word.  like kicking over a hornets nest.  It's all very good advice folks should follow.  I look at it like this:  If a queen fight lasts 20 minutes I'm not gonna drop two more bombs on her. I might drop a second, but I'm more likely to hop servers.  The quicker and more efficiently she dies, the more time I'll have to run all the silos.
---
Same ones.
---
If both high and low hp get similar buff, there are no different ‚Äòstyles‚Äô, every single player will simply go high hp ‚Äòstyle‚Äô and game with be boring and no fun just as you described.
---
So is it just acorn bests then that have that explosive resistance?
---
You're question is a bit confusing. Like, what do you mean "not the models but the types"? Without further specification, the models ARE the types. You can't get something like x-01 ultracite.
---
Yeah, that one sucks
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
You can lower down the mutations negative effects and buff the positive ones, things you don't get from bloodied or Junkie. Your concept would break the balance.
---
Edit: tHeRe iS No BaLlaNcE
---
Usually they set the underarmors as casual, do you have casual underarmor mods?
---
I did everything I could to avoid the issue and still got autocompleted today for 8750 score. waiting and going directly into adventure is not a fix, and definitely not an excuse to let Bethesda fuck us over in the Run since they knew about this bug forever, and conveniently ignored it because the challenges used to reward atoms.
---
I prefer Ionized Meat. With just Carnivore enabled it‚Äôs 50% Food. Doesn‚Äôt spoil either, just like Canned Dog Food.
---
Don't assume that I need your information. I made my correction and wanted to leave it at that. You continued and now I'm annoyed. I chalk it up to lack of sleep that I misread the title, because I was up all night with a teething baby. When I'm in a mood I don't back down.
---
On a Appalachia is supposed to come out. ..........sometime. ...this year maybe? Bethesda
---
Actually found Mexican Cokacola at my local Walmart in Ohio, they also were selling it recently at Chipotle, saw it in the Chipotle app. Lol
---
I forgot to mention the red asylum unif (no hat)
---
 vacation till season 2 minus events and scip if you have a mule with months worth
---
This is for the new cammo one that came out today in the Atom Shop.    My regular SS underarmor is shielded, but the cammo is not a skin or paint, but a totally separate piece of underarmor.
---
Killing them before they wreck you is a good strategy
---
So you know you have the models. T 51b T 60 X 01. I wanna know what type of armour is best. Ie ultracite standard etc
---
Good luck getting that back man. No they clearly don't teat anything and they don't give a fuck at all. The firework mines double ur reload speed?! I also glitched going between fixer and gatling gun today giving me 250 in magazine and unlimited vats for a couple of minutes. No, i have no idea how I did it. Is this score bug just pc? I watched the old challenges disappear and the new one load in  for 5 days now and I've had no problem on xbox?
---
No problemüëç
---
I always love to see cosplay of people and videogames.
---
Hat is worthless
---
But apparently in the recent dupe the red uniform was duped a good amount. So it might not be worth the insane amount it used to be
---
Why would I want to trade anything on my person?? There‚Äôs a reason for vending machines!
---
Don‚Äôt assume I care what you need. You barely made a correction and still didn‚Äôt answer the OP‚Äôs question. 
---
If you wanted to leave it at that... then you should have left it at that and not replied further. 
---
I don‚Äôt care about your mood or that you didn‚Äôt get sleep due to a crying baby. I‚Äôve been there done that and still didn‚Äôt cop an attitude when I was wrong. 
---
*Now go take a nap.* ***You‚Äôre cranky.***
---
The 2020 roadmap. I thought most players were aware of it.
---
It doesn't actually take and use the flux. I tried multiple times to craft Shielded on it and didn't lose any materials.
---
There aren't "types" of armor. Ultracite Power armor is a *model*. 
---
At most you could differentiate between them with the mods they have? But they can all pretty much get the same mods.
---
Are they more susceptible to energy damage?
---
DXP + DDS.C.O.R.E
---
THAT WOULD BE EPIC.
---
What system/platform?
---
There's been a guy over on the market sub offering a decent price on dog food, maybe hit him up.
---
Pray to the Lord jesus it doesn't see you.
---
There‚Äôs a guy further down that ‚Äúcould‚Äù give two fucks, didn‚Äôt have the heart to tell him.
---
So as long as I am not sharing them it's all good. Excellent.
---
Think there was just a little bit of misunderstanding. üòä
---
Crash-to-desktop
---
Only specific Event animals are tamable. I think they are nonhostile as in white health bar when you aim at them. I took a few hours once and hopped on the event spawn locations in the Mire and never saw a tamable animal in that time.
---
Pipe is life. Life is pipe
---
New NW maps such as the Cranberry Bog and the mire would be fantastic.
---
Would freshen up NW for awhile.
---
Ohhh okay well I learnt something new then. I never wear power armour just I have this mission called miner miracles I'm doing atm so I figured I'd ask. Anyeay thank you
---
Too bad their camp budget is too high. If I have to choose between a red rocket building and a Nuka cola sign I'm going to choose the building.
---
3* enemy has a 1/3 chance of dropping any 3* item. Basically the chance of getting any particular combination of effects on a particular weapon is 1 in 346,410 (an old number that may be different now).
---
Awesome, I was hoping it works that way but I was told differently.
---
Yeah, but when the economy rises uo again I‚Äôll have something to trade with
---
I'd love to see it, but I would hate to get attacked by it.  This has me thinking of a fallout version of Godzilla.
---
If you're sniping someone, then you're engaging in PVP.
---
I‚Äôve never seen the pipe. I want to experience the pipe life. Is it only in Charleston?
---
The jukebox alone is enough to summon the wendigo.
---
The game is already that way as 90% of the players use the low health builds anyway. I'm not asking for the exact same buffs as low health because those buffs plus being at max health would be more unbalanced than the low health side of things already is. The drawbacks of being paper thin at low health should come with some great upsides when done right. My argument is that the upsides they can gain so greatly outweigh any upside that a high health can get that it is an unbalanced amount of love towards that build. As I said in the OP I dont expect a +3 stat armor set, but there is room in the game for some love or perks of being high health besides the utter crap that is the unyielding armor set. Look at the massive list of buffs and upside effects low health can abuse, in 99% of situations it is the superior build in damage, stat buffs, and overall uoside.
---
Im on pc
---
Gauss shotgun, very ammo efficient and very powerful, also works like a sniper in VATS with magic effects :-)
---
I installed an on/off switch to solve this issue
---
Thank you Mr Feynman
---
Are you on the same team ?
---
Before i did this event i saw so many posts and videos saying it was really hard. And then when it came to doing it i was like 'is this it?' People make it hard. I have had finished this with 100 ore and 4 scavengers with 1 random player that was there and failed when there's been about 8 people there. Clownshoes
---
Yup the best way to farm adhesive is to, well farm. When I get low on adhesive I will claim a workshop and plant corn, mutfruit and tato. You will pick these, then replant them until you have like 20+ of each planted. Turbo furt helps a lot, as well placing water purifiers. Every time you come back you can make a bunch of adhesive.
---
Alternatively, you can harvest goo from pitcher plants in the bog but make sure to pluck it out before it gases you and wastes the goo inside. This method is time consuming in a different way but than the first method.
---
Can you tame legendary creatures as pets as well? Like could I get a tamed legendary scorchbeast?
---
I actually like that camo secret service under armour skin since it'll match with the ghillie
---
Lol I guess that‚Äôs a trigger word around here. I‚Äôm 100% with you on that. They should last 10 min or so. Enough time to kill a few mobs and have everyone get their damage in
---
Many level 60 something are flexing their newly acquired freshly duped explosive energy guns it‚Äôs beyond hilarious.
---
Plays every time lol
---
A 2172-level player showed up at the SBQ this weekend. Lo and behold, the queen went down almost immediately and I got no loot despite doing \~500 damage.
---
Hey do you have the new orange Camp device paint btw? I have the issue where the camp icon wont show on the map, and my Ally always wander around just outside the build circle
---
let the "magic weapons" squad step in and u wont waste that much ammo  ‚úåÔ∏è
---
No problem. There isn't really a best option. X01 has big energy resistance, t 51 I think had the best physical resistance before t 65 came out? I think the ultracite had resist to scorched. But the excavator gets huge bonuses for mining and carry weight. 
---
It just depends on what build you're going for. 
---
Imo, regular armor wins for me because it can roll legendary effects.
---
Ah then i figured wrong. Was sure i lost some, must have looked at the wrong flux.. Goodie.
---
How many FU is a tree worth?
---
That's a good way to go too! Dog food is much easier to consistently find in the world whereas ionized meat you have farm a nuke zone.
---
The SS Camo Underarmour doesnt even take casual. I can add all casual mods up to sheilded and it doesnt take any of them.    
---
     
---
It probably uses the SS underarmour mods. Im not wasting gold to test that though.
---
Thats how I got mine. Had to steal special points to bring my aglity to the required 9 points FL requires.
---
I‚Äôve noticed that happening in PC. PS4 less so.
---
I see! Haven't logged in today yet so it's news to me!
---
I have it unlocked but I use the default one.
---
They just need to give more xp for player kills to entice confrontation a bit more.
---
The fact is you get more xp by surviving than by actually pvp'ing. Until that changes do you really blame people trying to rank up? Who wants to sit in lobbies and loading screens earning zero xp?
---
Oh right. Thanks mate.
---
first half of September
---
I really hope we get a plasma caster skin soon
---
I think the gun position on the screen changes depending on if you have the front sight attachment or not.
---
Everything is shared across all characters, and each character contributes to your progress as a whole. You won't have to fill out a new board or anything
---
edit: by everything I meant CAMP items, skins and whatnot. Consumables/stackables/currency (caps, scrip, gold) go to whichever character you claim them on
---
You are not wrong.
---
load watoga train, check, run to phoenix, check. hop.(reverse order) repeat. you'll find it eventually but that's the best route to check.
---
What‚Äôs a magic effect?
---
I feel the same way, currently I‚Äôve got a nice villa on a mountain side, a month or two ago I was in a wood shack down by the river. I‚Äôve been thinking of a strip club or a military check point for my next build.
---
Thanks, I look forward to these each Tuesday!
---
I might blame that first story on a random bug, especially if it only happened to you once. It's possible it was a cheater, but also possible it was a glitched Feral Ghoul (or something similar). I've never heard of a cheat that deals radiation damage before.
---
You can also take rads (and regular damage) just by standing too close to the fire. Similarly it's also possible to be rad-damaged by an environmental object you haven't seen, even one you can't see (rad barrels work through walls). I assume you accounted for these factors, though.
---
AFAIK Bethesda does literally nothing about NW cheaters, regardless of how many reports they receive or how obvious the cheating is.
---
So people who have the time to grind get bonus xp over people who don‚Äôt have the time? Nah
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs listed as an ATX item.
---
Just bought the plans and rolled five pieces of each leg, got an UNY for both. Looks like Beth listened and rains UNY on us now.
---
Duck, dip, dodge, dive, and duck.
---
I cannot go to that sub sadly
---
This post is 2 months old I have changed by opinion after further testing switched to cammando
---
absolutely absurd... who lets these things go through on bethesda‚Äôs end? these are things that if consumers are noticing and taking issue with, someone at the company should know to handle before people waste money on them... 
---
if you haven‚Äôt done this already you could probably request a refund via beth support. i believe they may refund atoms while letting you keep it.
---
üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èstuck at work, thanks for the postüëçüëç
---
Yes, it is Secret Service one. 
---
But..
---
It is bugged and the secret service shielded lining does not stick to it when you try to craft it.
---
PC. Have since the second round of the Beta. Still haunted by the sound the ticks made the first time I encountered them.
---
Having mutiple toons can really help one complete the dailies. I have five and for things such as level up, at least 1 toon is usually close enough to not make it too much of a chore if I don't have much time to play.
---
We don't mean to pressure you but hot damn we depend on you!!!!!
---
As with everything Bethesda.. There is a mod for that  fo76 only have mods on pc though.
---

---
I gotta try some of that shit!
---
To add to this, you can earn rewards on one character and claim the reward on another character.
---
That's fair. I play by and large because I enjoy wandering around and taking in the sights. SCORE is kind of a good motivator, but not to the same extent.
---
Having something to strive for is always better.
---
When the announced Vault 94's closure, that became my drive until the day it was locked up.
---
This is ENTIRELY not true. Items such as scrap kits, repair kits, Lunchboxes, scrip are not shareable items. My husband and I play on the same account, separate characters. The things that are shareable are camp items and outfits.
---
And the seasonal items ?
---
If this was a bundle (camo skins, guns skins, bobblehead stand, targets, and back pack) this would be awesome. Not sure why they didn't hold off on the backpack and guns skins.
---
You can't tame any scorchbeasts. I think you could tame legendary animals before Wastelanders... Not sure how it is right now because they changed some things like lowered the level of tameable animals after Wastelanders.
---
10 weeks from June 30th
---
PSA for everyone, Bethesda actually has a website with information about Fallout 76
---
The simple solution to that would be treating paints as paints, appliable to the object they modify the appearance to rather than being their own objects, something this game has for some wild reason never done.
---
edited my comment, forgot that consumables/stackables were also rewards lol
---
Waste of time
---
So cool. Love it. Great work.
---
Oh my god...
---
"***The only way to access ‚ÄúThe Bank‚Äù would be to have at least two accounts at level 50, so this reward is pretty much useless unless you have multiple characters.***"
---
So this amazing idea of yours would "force" players to buy TWO copies of one game?  Did you invent this yourself or someone helped you?  
---
Anyway, they are not going to increase bullion limit from 200 to 1000. You must be new.
---
Camp budget doesn't seem to be much of a factor, I managed to get a new Deathclaw pet (first one suicided I think üò¢) and my budget was nearly full.
---
I just checked the same 2 points in the bog (first one is north of The Thorn and second one is south east of it) and server hopped a lot (having 1st does help...), took me about one hour and a half.
---
Remember you need a weapon with no scope to tame, if you only get pacify option when you aim you can't tame the thing. You also need to be at least twice the level of the creature.
---
Map: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bsyukf/new_map_of_random_encounter_locations_found_by/
---
Red points are the ones you should check btw.
---
What? Do you not know you can have multiple characters on the same account/game?
---
The update is next week?!
---
I used to have 4 of them on my favorites wheel so I could fire four shots before having to reload them. It was seriously OP.
---
kinda surprised they don't have a "gold" SS armor skin
---
If you actually read the post, it seems pretty obvious that the OP did not mean two copies of the game.
---
Edit: hate to break it to you, but downvoting doesn't fix your bad reading comprehension skills.
---
smaller and faster with cloaking and anti armor is more of a challenge. Big ol characters just seem like damage sponges with periodic attack and defense phases. I like to have the 3D situation of the meshes matter as much as possible.
---
Since beta. And never once have I ever tried to tell other people how to play or worried about what they do whether it bothers me or not. 
---
Live and let live. 
---
The only time I tell others anything is if they ask for advice or if I have some helpful tips to improve their gameplay. 
---
Telling others how to play for your own sake is entitled and childish.
---
Nothing. The dailies/weeklies say they reward score but don't actually. So no atoms etc etc. Nothing until season 2.
---
Good points thanks
---
U/hellspawn010
---
Okay thanks !!
---
needs to be a really specific action that you guys do to trigger that, I tried to replicate and got once the auto-complet bug, but soon as I reloged it fixed, perhaps you guys are running a bugged mod?
---
Every single time I log in, my health is at 25 rather than the somewhere in the 19s that I left it in! This is beyond irritating and is only recently been happening - so now fixing rads is my first step. [Improved Health Bars](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/368) is a PC mod I use just an FYI.
---
Progress is Shared across all characters. But Lunchboxes, Fireworks, Caps, Bullion, Perkpacks, Repair Kits, Scrap Kits all go to the Character that redeems them. I use an alt for the Level up Challenges but wait until im back on my main to redeem things.
---
nice breh!
---
Would‚Äôve liked a SS pack instead of having to buy multiple items, but still a very cool update.
---
I could have misunderstood the original post, but could he mean multiple characters rather than accounts? I have two currently, one at 30 and one at 50 and if he means 2 characters then I think it's not a bad idea as I  have a good collection of legendary armour and weapons etc I could pass on when my 30 gets to 50.
---
At the end of the season.
---
Oh wow, do you have a link to the calculator?
---
Nice.
---
None of the doors was open for me. I spent ages looking for a key, or another way down. (I usually jump off the balcony at B5, but the quest would not allow me to do that.) I finally gave up and fast travelled out, but now Johnny won't speak to me.
---
Deep sigh.
---
Right. So. Jealous of your skills AND your 3D printer.
---
Looks awesome!
---
woah
---
I just one shot them with some cool shotgun I have. I have that and a bloody ffr handmade. For some reason I still find myself feeling weapon poor.
---
they're almost always dead when i get there though
---
Yeah, when I have to run anywhere up hill or in the savage divide I couldn‚Äôt imagine not having marsupial. It just makes my futile mountain climbing (habit from fallout 3/skyrim) not always futile.
---
Couldn‚Äôt live without it.
---
*she has increased resistances while flying* wtf is that crap, stop misleading people, im doing the same damage flying or not (no, i have no room for staggering heavy perks, they not worth it)
---
With a sneak crit build, you can destroy ghouls and super mutants with them.
---
it was just in the shop for a second time just over a week ago.  You may have to wait a while.
---
Turn around and run away as fast as possible, whilst zig zagging so that head laser doesn't singe your ass hairs off.
---
Ha ha.  I just used a sheet of paper.  What level are you at?
---
that's a consequence of them porting over a nuka world mob without changing any of the values
---
Level 52?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I meant
---
Looks great! Keep cosplaying!
---
Yup, most likely the other bounty hunters got to them first.
---
Faster with 3 though, don't have to wait for the ores to respawn.
---
And get rid of the damn bra straps! You bet your ass if I was in the Wasteland in a skimpy outfit I would have hunted down at least a strapless bra. Bra straps break my immersion. But maybe make the outfits overlay the skin, so that they cover up the bra straps.
---
Cool bottles huh! And tastes nicer than regular coke coz real sugar üòõ Can I ask how much your stores sell it for?
---
Yeah I have perk loadout working, so IDK
---
Without Perks, what is the chance to stagger her?
---
I think on september 14th will be the last day.
---
My SS underarmor in general has been all sorts of screwy. I‚Äôll log in and it won‚Äôt have my Shielded mod applied or any mod applied, other times it‚Äôll have Protective applied (which I didn‚Äôt even buy the plan for), and then other times it will actually have Shielded
---
My intention with this post believe it or not was as you stated in your comment ‚Äúif I have some helpful tips to improve their gameplay‚Äù. Please tell me how I‚Äôm not trying to do the same. You know the scorched earth event has some annoying issues and the points I was bringing up were in an attempt to help others enjoy the event and smooth it out more too. I‚Äôm honestly not sure why half of you are salty af thinking I‚Äôm trying to ruin everyone‚Äôs gaming experience. I mean does doing anything I listed negatively effect your gaming experience and would it not improve it? Would you rather spend 25 min watching the queen fly around? Or do 3 queens and a sheep in 25min?
---
That's what I was guessing.  Maybe they will give us Atom challenges during the break between seasons.
---
Yup, 1 week away
---
Zero mods here.  Did exactly as I have done every day for the last month, with the exception of stupidly going into atomic shop and claiming my free icon first before going into game.
---
Flux - Plans - Repair kits - Treasury notes. 
---
Legendary items are more or less a pointless grind for a usable item, particularly with bullion plans which are mostly endgame. SS sets you can roll to your heart's content. T-65 armors, the solars and strangler hearts, etc. 
---
Legendary items are basically only scrip fodder 9 times out of 10 any more.
---
I always drop my duplicate Sheepsquatch related plans at the end of the event. If everyone did that it should be easier to complete the full collection. I just have two left, not sure which they are
---
Got the raider one recently. Guns and ammo is great. Ammo is obviously useful and the guns to break for steel. I'd third this purchase.
---
I have a two shot, that breaks even faster.
---
You have to craft Camo Secret Service Underarmor, it's not a skin
---
The T65 is the best one by a mile but requires gold.
---
The ultracite and T-51b are the best economic armors.
---
Excavator PA gives a neat bonus to carry weight and you mine 4 times more ore. But it gives very little protection.
---
Wait really?
---
Sneak, then destroy lower limbs. If they detect you they will sneak themselves and then it gets a bit messy.
---
Basically reason #9643 why the Chinese Sneak Armor is the dogs bollocks.
---
Ho! Ha Ha! Guard! Turn! Parry! Dodge! Spin! HA! Thrust!
---
If your on about the fast travel mat then yeh feel free to put them down at each of your workshops.
---
Don't worry. They will add a SS bundle in couple weeks that has all the current SS items + one new super great unique looking item for 1800 atoms.
---
They were originally bundled together when they first came out and I think the bundle was on sale a couple of weeks ago as well.
---
They've been there for workshops for as long as I can remember. They only removed them from C.A.M.P.s.
---
I don't like walking around things, I get bored really easy.
---
I felt this way when the reloading disables all legendary benefits bug was goin on. I deleted the game for a bit only to come back and find out they had an event where they finaly handed out kegs. If you dont really love the franchise, enough to overlook the insain amaount of bullshit in this game, then you arent guna have a good time
---
Either that or as someone else here brought up it would be a range thing. I feel it‚Äôs both but I could be wrong. Also I said that you probably aren‚Äôt doing any meaningful damage UNLESS you have a good build that‚Äôs perked up correctly.
---
After you or a nearby player opens a lunch box, if you look under effects in your pip, you‚Äôll get detailed info on any active party favors
---
yeah some people was talking to not enter the atom shop and nw first couse was going to bug the dailes, others sayed that even login on Adventure first was bugging the dailes either, I have not a single clue on what's doing this and bethesda is the worst company on letting that happen with out a compensation.
---
edit: cleaning up and making more readable
---
Yeah I heard about to raids in the games were really buggy so they closed them down which sucks cause that‚Äôs exactly what would make me play a lot more! Oh well I guess maybe one day
---
Nice. Now head over to r/daddit
---
"Didn't even sign in around noon."
---
Makes no difference when you sign in.
---
I doubt it. I wish they would, but doubt it. They won't give us free atoms anymore now that they got what they wanted without massive outcry. Talking about removal on atom rewards.
---
There are a lot things that work well with low life like nerd rage, adrenal reaction, unyielding/bolstering armor,... 
---
Thats why bloodied is so powerful. 
---
And as junkie with 5 addictions you get in total only -9 special points or -7 points and -20 damage resistance if you choose the right addictions.
---
A shielded underarmor alone can give you up to 7 special points.
---
I‚Äôm honestly not sure. Same as any other enemy perhaps?
---
Think I read you cannot remove it from your camp afterwards, so be careful what you wish for. üôÑ
---
Sucks.
---
Yeah.  You're fine.  This is what I recommend:  do all the daily and weekly challenges, (duh).  Then if you have to use atoms from the rewards, you can.  But only use them for the FINAL FEW LEVELS.  The cost of each level increases dramatically for score, but doesn't increase at all for atoms.  You earn 2000 atoms throughout the race.  That's 13 levels you can take off at the end.  Only do this if you can't complete them through score though, no point in wasting atoms.  And... that's it.  Sorry for no recommendations on specific challenges, but assuming you can do all of them, you'll be fine.
---
Youve been playing for a little while huh?
---
Just curious, why wood? Are you running Berserkers?
---
Assassins Creed: Black Flag style. I used to do that too.
---
How many of these posts are we going to get per day?
---
 Never had it before today.. now have it constantly.. so annoying
---
Tough
---
I'm aware of that. When you craft the new camo one, it is not casual as advertised, but normal SS type that takes the new ss linings. But they won't stick like i wrote.
---
Well Bethesda proved to me they don't care. Saves me a lot of ticketing with support about cheaters. I thought I was helping the game and the devs by reporting obvious dupers or hackers but apparently they don't give a rats ass so I'm not going to either. Anyone got any BE lasers lying around I've been dying to try them.
---
Give more display cases.
---
Pretty please. üôè
---
I went to the Abandoned Waste Dump in The Mire for two of the three kills, and it was weird going in with a full armory and just mow down the two Matriarchs in it. I remember being scared the first time I went through it back in year one of the game.
---
I run through Huntersville WesTek and the abandoned Bog Town for the Super Mutants.  Then hit WS and then Charleston Capitol building for the high level ghouls.  I will server hop the Capitol building because it seems like they almost always respawn at full level.
---
Thank you, I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not fucked aha
---
That damn kill 3 legendary creatures. Either takes 5 minutes or 2 hours. Only Atom decides.
---
Wendigo Colossus will come on patch 21 along legendary perks. 
---
Season 21 is supposed to come August 4 if all goes well.
---
That's the problem, I LOVE the franchise. I've played every fallout game and I love this game but the constant bugs paired with the grind is honestly making me mad. And I don't like feeling that way about games.
---
Yes another cliff hopper !!
---
For sneak wood is the lightest, which is better. And it also has the best mod for sneak. It's incredibly overkill. But it would be the best for sneaking
---
When I just want to get the challenge done....start a new character. Run from the vault to the wayward and I'm done in 5 minutes.  The next day walk that same character to flatwoods, do the super easy water testing and done again in 5 to 10 minutes.  Usually the next day can still get another quick easy level in flatwoods.  At that point usually delete the character and start another when needed.  Every new character is a chance to roll the rare responders fireman outfit too.
---
If my actual character is close to leveling up though I will just grind xp and do it that way.
---
The need to give XP for actually causing damage to other players.  All or Nothing kills XP sucks.  And at the end of each match you get an insult from the governing computer about how much you suck.  All for like hardly any XP.
---
Screw this I'm going to sit in my bush now.
---
I never spend 25 minutes watching the queen fly around, I'm powerful enough on my own that I'll kill her on about 3-5 minutes depending on how much she wants to fly around dropping poison clouds. 
---
I dont notice what others are doing because I'm busy playing the game instead of watching what others do. So no, what everyone else is doing doesnt matter to me. 
---
You listed in your title that theses are "rules" for the SBQ event. Your intention was to tell others how to play, in hopes that you'd get all these great reactions of praise and thanks for enlightening all of who are so ignorant apparently. So that when you fight the queen you don't get annoyed at everyone doing it "wrong." I'm not salty, I'm not even perturbed. I always comment the same in posts like these, because they pop up just about every day. I remind people that it's okay to play how you want, because it's just a *video game*.
---
For the past couple weeks everyone on the sub has been saying not to sign in around noon so I assumed.
---
Can I add to this, I've heard that having more than one character increases the chances of the auto complete bug happening? I want to make a character only for NW mode so I can spec my special points better.
---
I‚Äôm level 200 and I‚Äôm still fixing my build to accommodate both non-PA and PA Bloodied builds, so the extra points to switch SPECIAL and learn perk cards are pretty nice. Some people also completely revamps builds with enough points.
---
Yeah, talk to him and ask about his life. Former Raider.
---
I was surprised tbh, that I could.  Just don't spend those atoms on anything else, and wait until the very end to level up with them.
---
Yeah really does.
---
I think it's because I switched character from an alt to my main on the menu screen before going into adventure.
---
I wasn't playing nuclear winter prior, and I wasn't online at the time of the refresh, which I believe are popular believed causes.
---
Fair point. I‚Äôve farm regularly enough in nuke zones that I tend to always have a good supply, though. 
---
And if I run out... *Cannibal* is a fun option, lol.
---
I won‚Äôt, I‚Äôll probably buy a few extra atoms too in case I miss any more challenges
---
You cant trade ATOM items.
---
Noice. Voiry noice.
---
So you don't actually have a clue what you're talking about. If you're going to make a post blaming other players for doing things wrong, maybe back it up with facts and evidence? Your post is just full of speculation.
---
Ehn, they were and they weren't.
---
They were dodgy early on but that got fixed pretty quick.
---
The only bug that really stuck was introduced late and fixed with Wastelanders: the inability to destroy the pipes with ranged attacks. It was really noticeable in the Silos as you couldn't bust up the computer cores anymore, but in 94 it made Meltdown hell as you barely had enough time to do anything on Expert.
---
Otherwise there was a bit of flawed game design at points, the key cards in Washout always spring to mind, but overall I loved it.
---
Hell, the GECK chamber in Meltdown was probably the most fun I've had in this game because of how hectic it was.
---
I'm really hoping they'll say something about Vault Raids at QuakeCon this year.
---
FU? U mean pink flamingos?
---
If you do buy some, again, wait until the very end.  Don't buy something before you need it.
---
Please no. I mean double XP was nice but it makes us all feel obligated to grind the entire weekend. 
---
Double Score was so much better cause it didn‚Äôt take up my entire weekend.
---
Yes. Flamingo Units.
---
I'm having this issue with alot of doors in general, not just the red rocket garage.
---
Then play something else for a bit and come back when theres more to do. It wont feel as grindy anymore. Thats what i did with red dead and now theres a new role!
---
Great friend you got giving you duped items just after banwave...
---
Yeah I‚Äôll save them all for the last day
---
What's the point of buying anything with Atoms when the budget space to my CAMP is laughably low with hardly any assets in it. 
---
Yes, I'd gladly, even use my Atoms, caps, gold bullion what have you to increase my Camp budget space.
---
Eh ...
---
(a) I may have a problem
---
(b) I recently switched to a straight up XP farming build and am kinda only playing the one character right now (INT build). I prepped for the weekend w/ build and gear tweaks and laid the groundwork w/ the wife that I'd be gaming a bunch.
---
(c) I played a bunch. Like a metric ton.
---
My INT was probably around 55 min for the entire weekend, was always grouped and had my cranberry relish going constantly. I farmed sites if there were no events, and farmed the hell out of things I could. I had 2 separate "Super Mutant Horde" events that I farmed for like an hour each (until someone else came in and killed the master), I ran the Whitespring (kill everything outside fast, didn't go into houses), West Tek, Steakhouse, Harper's Ferry and the South fissures constantly, and the one by Hopewell when I went back to my base. I did every Line in the Sand, Radiation Rumble that popped up as well as Distant Thunder and Surface to Air. I was not shy about spending my 20 leader bobbles (and a few INT) and lunchboxes (nor my Love magazine for the other 5%). I swapped groups &amp; server hopped if things got slow.
---
I didn't quite make level 500, think I hit 490 something. Yep, about 75 levels.
---
Take the chance to enjoy the game again, whether you had an op build or not
---
Just enjoy the struggle of the low levels
---
Asking for hand outs is quick and easy, but you'll get more satisfaction by working your way back
---
I also read a couple of times that flamethrowers suffer even more from the "it hits but the hp ain't dropping" bug. :x Which is a shame because weapons like the plasma gun are highly versatile since you can also put a flamethrower mod on them.
---
Sorry man, something's gotten in the way I don't think I can play today
---
Oh but it gets better! While the Camo paint for the Secret Service ARMOR works as a paint and without issue, the under armor is a whole separate thing to craft that you can only apply the casual lining to. So this thing I spent time grinding notes and gold for...anyone can now have with a casual lining? This last bit confuses and worries me. Anyone have a definite answer?
---
G.o.a.t
---
The nerf to 2-shot went too far. It went from a top tier legendary effect to bad overnight. 
---
I don't think it should go back to double damage (maybe 1.5x) but at very least it shouldn't impact durability.
---
Or Bethesda could fix their game.
---
No worries. I'm about to go to bed: I work night shift.
---
All good, we all do it at some point haha
---
Tell me about it.
---
The shrouded mod on wood armor is still bugged and doesn‚Äôt apply any stealth bonus.
---
They never left workshop menus. Just player camp menus.
---
Aren't explosive weapons kind of subpar against the queen I mean 1000 fuel for just a queen fight seems like way too much ammo for that much effort.
---
Got a non explosive bloodied flamer myself and I just go to vendor to vendor to get my fuel. Crafting ammo for it isn't worth it since you get so little.
---
What this means, if you've not done this, is getting 1.5 - 2k for each lvl 68 super mutant, 4k for the sentries at the Whitespring, and near 4k for scorchbeasts (80s for sure, 50s I don't remember)etc. It takes preparation and you have to shift your build around some, but I overkill anyway - so some points in Thru Hiker aren't going to kill me - nor a refrigerated backpack instead of armored.
---
I am, however, getting tragically low on ammo. I need to farm flux in a bad way.
---
How many TSE Plasma wielders does it take to change a lightbulb?
---
I signed in at 6pm and it hit me. Obviously don't be playing during the rollover, but after that, there's not anything you can do to avoid it. If it hits you, it hits you.
---
Q25 cryo, you‚Äôre  welcome
---
Which makes it even more ridiculous.
---
The sad part is that we've been asking this since the BEta, but alas here we are 2 years later...
---
The weapon I used for a long time was the .50cal you get from Beckett's Ally quest line.
---
Replaced that with Gauss minigun when I finally unlocked it.
---
The Gatling gun is a really well rounded heavy gun. Hits hard, good durability and really ammo efficient. If you want better DPS on the Queen you'll want to look into the .50 Cal or Plasma Gatling. A good Ultracite Laser Gatling is also viable, but far less durable than the ballistic weapons.
---
The point that I'm making, since you're very obviously just not bright enough to get it on your own, is that someone making a mistake doesn't mean that they owe you anything for it.
---
1.ammo converter
---
2.craft them in mass
---
3.lucky hole mine (0-200 fuel per run)
---
I can guarantee he‚Äôs no duper. He‚Äôs a very active member of this community. I‚Äôm sure what I have is a dupe but everything he gave me were from trades made on this sub.
---
Ya totally. Ur right. I have no idea what I‚Äôm talking about. All speculation I guess is correct. I mean I only play this game every day since it‚Äôs release. If only been doing at least 6 queens a day for the past 206 levels. I clearly have no reason at all to bring up these points that others have openly agreed with me on. But I guess they don‚Äôt have hard numbers on a spreadsheet for you so fuck them too right? 
---
What honestly happened to most of you here that you are taking this a personal attack?
---
I haven‚Äôt yet but once my weight gets over 1000 lbs my game starts to lag pretty bad and I imagine I could make it crash if I kept mashing keys during those moments. I try to take it easy until I get to a workbench too scrap everything.
---
I‚Äôve never had to hunt down anything. I approach Foundation, the daily pops up, talk to Ward, quest complete. 
---
Glitch?
---
I don‚Äôt have the raider shielded plan.. but I would love to put that on an atomshop under armour so there is no way I can scrap it.
---
Now I am :)
---
While the Roadmap says "fall", I still don't have a clue what it is supposed to be.
---
Lol I got yelled at for walking in front of someones explosive minigun
---
Rofl, oh man! Lol. It's amazing how dumb a good portion of your morons really are! LMMFAOROFL
---
Feel free to come to my diner. I've got some pie and Fancy Lads Cakes for you!
---
Yeah I literally spent all of my play time double xp weekend doing scorched earth. It was on constantly. And PACKED. I wish that double score had come with extra weekly and dailies. A week like that, with double score on the weeklies as well, would be very welcome
---
The shrouded mod is still bugged and doesn‚Äôt apply any bonus to stealth.  Armor weight is also irrelevant if you use Escape Artist.
---
As of right now, any armor with a shadowed mod is best for stealth boosts, assuming you use Escape Artist.
---
Pray for leader of the pack and then race that poor level 10 player to screw them out of their only possible chance to complete it.
---
Or run riding shotgun 3 times and hope some jerk doesn't sprint through and steal the only guaranteed legendary like you were doing to that low level. Lol.
---
On the other hand, I mostly have marsupial because I don't like playing in PA and I don't have the SS jetpack mod yet, so ... it's the cheap alternative, I guess. And the sense of freedom you get from being able to yamakasi your way out of a place is fun, too heh.
---
Imo u are the one to gtfo..
---
I hear you. Was doing a queen yesterday with a guy who had a good cryo. To bad he was only using it on her when she was in the air. Never when she landed would he freeze her. That queen took 22 min. Landed twice
---
We are probably taking out the raiders that Rocksy sends to kill Ward for abandoning them.
---
Alright, have a good one bud
---
I'll go one further - every Stashbox skin should come with a matching Scrapbox skin.
---
Been a while since I've seen a good raider girl cosplay
---
That he bribes with equipment, which he then sends us to kill.
---
So your friend didn‚Äôt get suspended?
---
The wolf pack event near Tyler Fairgrounds seems to pop frequently. That gets the challenge done quickly.
---
I like camo and ghillie but even I'm starting to wonder why we have 4 different versions of green camo PA
---
I just sent in a lengthy support ticket, not it will be read by a real person, stating my disappointment with this. I've been grinding like crazy since I'm behind, only to find out I lost out on 8,750 S.C.O.R.E.. after doing the math, to make up for it thats 875,000 XP I have to farm now just to make up for today and this weeks challenges
---
Another vote for the collectron. Which one you choose (raider, communist, scavenger) is up to you (whether you want junk, food, booze or ammo as your main collection item). I had the scavenger for junk but I switched to raider for ammo since I had more junk than I needed. 
---
If you're really into designing your camp I'd recommend packs like the contemporary camp bundle or the green thumb bundle, but all of that is just cosmetic. 
---
The only item that actually serves a useful function is the collectron. Every camp should have one imo.
---
Craft flamers, lowest level. You get 100 fuel after each craft, craft like 30-40, and your flamer never will be thirsty again.
---
Also, you can scrap those flamers, to get some materials back.
---
What do you get from these lunchboxes ? And how do you get them
---
I bought the SS backpack yesterday and it looked a bit too small to me ... isn't it?
---
Or when my teammates in NW romp around in PA shaking my screen :/
---
Once again sir, I did not say all duper‚Äôs don‚Äôt sell for caps, and provided my own personal experiences with how the ones I have seen respond when asked to sell them for caps, tis all. 
---
I mentioned the 4 hours because it give context to my response as it was based on other individual responses. 
---
And I mentioned beta because you said 18 months which I took to assume you did not play at launch which was over 20 months ago. 
---
Hope that clears up things. Toodles and have a good day.
---
No. Have been playing together everyday for two weeks.
---
I use the Plasma Caster and .50 Cal for general use, I use a primed Ultracite Gatling Laser for the queen. Works well in terms of damage and using all three means ammo is never problem.
---
We started the 5th week today. So, at next monday, we will be at the half way mark.
---
I was super excited about the ammo converter but then I actually got to using it. It's so frustratingly tedious to use that I deleted it from my camp to save the budget. I'd rather spend resources &amp; time crafting and scrounging ammo than clicking hundreds of times just to buy a few hundred shotgun shells.
---
Yea and you can't put shielded lining on it.
---
And?  Yes, it is possible for people with very specific builds, gear and a full litany of buffs to destroy the SBQ in short order... that doesn't have anything to do with someone walking up with no specific build, no buffs and just a single weapon with a particular broken legendary effect and liquefying her.
---
They went all out on the weapon skins, and I've been waiting for the free states 10mm smg separately for a year now so I'm happy overall. 
---
Can anybody confirm if the stanley skin still bricks your weapon and makes it unusable? It would be pretty embarrassing if they released it again without fixing that but I definitely wouldn't put it past them
---
Also, the problem with double score is that if you're one of those "lucky" fellows who get their dailies auto-completed, it's just a regular weekend to you.
---
I think there should be a bonus for that. Maybe call the effect Pure or something. Maybe give it a 50% damage increase, since loosing out on mutations is pretty big.
---
Yeah, unfortunately it seems people think doing those two things will prevent them from getting hit. I'm not sure why, since there have been so many people like you posting about still being affected.
---
Obviously still don't do those things, but just remember there is no way to 100% avoid the bug.
---
Or when you're looting a corpse and someone stands on top of it while you're scrolling.
---
But you didn't check out the Atomic Store or the Legendary Run before logging into a server, right?
---
Lol bro! Then an enemy kills u and u loss ur flux... I feel it!
---
or the best
---
None. Because they turned into goo when someone walked in front of them
---
Same here, Not a huge fan of the look with t-65 but saving the 2000GB right now is worth it.
---
Stop staggering her while she‚Äôs in the air, and people won‚Äôt walk in front of you.
---
They will eventually fix it. What would suck is if you didn‚Äôt get it now and thus can‚Äôt use it when it is finally fixed.
---
haven't been stuck at work since this whole covid thing started :'(
---
Don‚Äôt do that. I use my tse .50 cal when she‚Äôs in the air; it has better accuracy than my plasma that has the scatter mod
---
Yeah, they should really remove those weapons from the loot pool.  
---
Oh. Wait..
---
Same thing happened to me. I almost rage-quit the game and never came back. Because I was only level 40-something when I attempted that mission, it was (and still is) the hardest thing I've done in the game by far. I really hate that assaultron, and I really hate Ra-Ra for putting me through that crap TWICE. She needs a good whoopin' from Gail if you ask me.
---
I forget what I did to fix it but eventually I tried the mission again and it worked. Maybe try server hopping?
---
It's not a new bug or exclusive to the RR garage.  It rarely happens to some of the regular doors in my camp.
---
Well there's the ally quests if you haven't done those too...but yeah, there wasn't really that much added.  I mean I guess as far as Fallout DLC goes it's probably on par with the ones we paid for in the past.
---
Wrong garage door.  The RR prefab garage door isn't powered and just opens on activation like a regular door.
---
Can we also add that your stable fluxes not be in junk but in Misc. because after spending a good enough time in the queen, i got the flux i needed for a jet pack (which has taking me forever to get) only to DIE by a random scorched mirelurk queen and some a-hole takes my fluxes, leaves the rest of the junk, just takes my fluxes. It's making me go full raider mode at this point and just taking it if i can't gain it.
---
Oh my bad!
---
I've been making alt characters to even utilize the new items. Camp budget is such a massive problem. We really need cellar hatchs with their own instanced budget.
---
Yeah, bloodied sniper/commando/bow can use exact same special layouts. Very versatile once youve got all the cards.
---
To start, i would recommend rifles. With bloodied/unyielding even a plain ol combat rifle can devastate mobs. Handmades are good too. Personally, i dont like levers. Their ROF is just garbage. Firing 10 fast shots is far more dps than firing two slow ones. Hunting rifles are noob traps imo. High base damage but garbage everything else. They are loud af too, even silenced. Whereas, pipe revolvers with rifle stocks are whisper quiet.
---
And I haven't had a day off work since covid started. Yay me.
---
Full SS and super stims lets me triple conduit.
---
This is the best subreddit for getting downvotes
---
I logged of this morning for that reason alone and it happened to me too.. Oddly enough its actually never happed while I was logged in during the reset, only when I log in after. Its the 3rd time its happened to me and 2nd time on my weekly challenges. Im just going to stay logged on from this point on
---
I see much more players NOT agreeing with you. I'm also not saying any of your points are wrong. But they are speculation, nothing more. We need data miners on this stat! HeHe. Cheers!
---
You can grind out the WL gear if you want... And/or grind out the legendary run.. Or you can wait for the next big content drop.
---
TSE Gatling Plasma is garbage, so no loss there.
---
they never fix it.
---
Everything you just wrote was honestly not my intention. If I could change the title right now I‚Äôd repost it as ‚Äútips‚Äù or ‚Äúfriendly advice do what you will with it‚Äù. I rarely post here so I forgot how sensitive you all are to maybe being shown a different way of doing something. Only thing that makes me annoyed and was the cause of this post was that a lot of queen runs take way to long. A discord and I constantly launch triple queen runs all day long. We mostly launch in public because we want others to join in and it‚Äôs more fun with more people. But public queen fights USUALLY go on a lot longer than if we did it with 8 in a private. In a private nobody shoots her until she lands and she ALWAYS lands within a min. Private queen fights take 2-3 min or less. Public takes at least 15 on average. When you get majority of players shooting her while she flies, standing on top of V9 shooting her, or not leaving enough room to land it‚Äôs taken 20min or failing the event. That sucks cause it‚Äôs a waste of time and effort which yes is annoying. If you see someone doing something that negatively affects the event and by extension everyone participating in said event whether they realize it or not are you the bad guy for trying to bring it to their attention?
---
Levelling without stealth is just silly. Stealth is more damage, more safety, more convenient, more everything.
---
Because this engine is still full of more holes than swiss cheese. It could be memory errors, it could be something not loading in properly, it could be too many things loading in properly at the same time, it could be an interaction with your hardware not bowing low enough for the game software, it could be the planets are not aligned in your favor today. Fallout 2 is to date still the least likely fallout game to crash
---
Did you fast travel everywhere and fast click through all terminals?
---
You are hilarious keep making this shit up it might cure my fo76 induced depression.
---
That is a very kind offer!  Thank you!
---
if you are on PS4, I try to keep speed demon serum (amongst others) in one of my vendors...
---
My 1 star bloodied fixer has a higher base damage  than my 3 star bloodied handmade and is by far superior. You just got a trash version I bet, there not all amazing.
---
Yes! This is a dream come true! Ill take 5!
---
*Throws Flamingos at cashier*
---
And I would honestly love to provide you with real legit data numbers but what I‚Äôm stating is things I‚Äôve experienced with the event from doing it 6x minimum a day for 206 levels. I‚Äôm not just trying to be an ass and control people. I‚Äôm just trying to make it more enjoyable for everyone
---
Exactly! Sometimes I will find them everywhere, but other times it only seems to be in those events (and hordes, uranium fever, etc)
---
Edit: some jerk just boxed me or of leader of the pack. He tapped the leader. Cool, now I can get a shot in. As I try he unloads on the wolf before I can even raise my weapon. He then continues to kill the remaining 3 before I get to them. What happened to honor.
---
That sounds like BS, honestly. I'm running five characters, and I haven't had the autocomplete bug even once (yet). Don't know if this actually helps, but what I'm avoiding is **all** of the following:
---
* Logging out of the game directly from NW mode (**always** join a public or private server after an NW session),
---
* Being logged in during or around the reset,
---
* Going to the Atomic Store, NW, or the Legendary Run screen first thing after a reset (**always** join a public or private server first).
---
Doing this has either saved my ass so far, or maybe I'm just lucky.
---
There‚Äôs more than 20 hours of base content.  That‚Äôs not fiction. 
---
And if a *video game* is sufficient to cause you actual depression, you need to see a therapist.

While bloody builds can do more and take more damage, the reason for that is specifically because we are working with 1/5 of your health. And it‚Äôs not like players don‚Äôt get that prefix perk if they can‚Äôt use unyielding. They just need a different one. The point of bloody is to take the risk that you could die much sooner than a Tanay build, so while I get where you‚Äôre coming from I don‚Äôt think Bethesda should be making any major changes on this system. 
---
If having full heath gave you perks and cards comparable to a 20% hp bloody then all that means is we‚Äôre sacrificing a major stat in the game for no real benefit. Perhaps some fine-tuning, but I would be ticked if Bethesda released improvements that made the dmg and def of vanguard players even close comparable to a bloody when our gameplay is built around injecting diluted stimpaks to make sure we can keep up with the tanks.
---
It seems to pop frequently until I need it to haha. Usually not a problem but some days it just doesn‚Äôt want to pop
---
You know, your point might be grasped a lot more effortlessly if you used a little tact yourself.
---
My suggestion is and always will be weapon skins. It's the only thing you are likely to see for a large proportion of your play time. Camp items would be a close second if you spend a lot of your time on that, but then you have the ever-present issue of camp budget. Weapon skins have no budget, will always be visible on your screen, and tend to not be *as* buggy as the camp items. Although the screaming eagle skin gives some of the worst bugs a run for their atoms
---
Well yea..
---
I am torn, I want to get the bundle, but at the same time I want to finish the legendary run...
---
Maybe one day we can get a vault suit we can wear as an outfit....  Not nearly enough vault-tech blue in this game.
---
Yeah....same thing just happened to me. 9000 score up in smoke.
---
Logged off from private last night like I always do. Didn‚Äôt log in till 2+hours after reset. My game AND Bethesda launcher hard crashed when I first tried to load in to my private. When I restarted, everything loaded in fine but I was hit with the bug. 
---
The only non-repeatable weekly that didn‚Äôt auto complete was the vats challenge. Shows 10-50 completed..and I hate using vats so I am extra salty lol.
---
 On the plus side, I guess I will have more time to spend in NW...
---
just wait until they fix it
---
A heavy weapons build is largly similar to a shotgunner build as far as your Special spread goes. I grabbed the Gauss Shotgun on my Heavy Weapons character and haven't looked back since. There's a bit of a learning curve to it, and it will take some time getting used to it's VATS weirdness... But once you hit your stride with it it'll be really difficult to justify ever using another weapon again.
---
I think he's ripping off his former Raider buddies. He "sells" them equipment that's laying around and then recruits you to go get it back, rinse and repeat. 
---
His stock is unlimited, sort of like the way used car salesmen get people with shit credit in a bad finance deal, makes a few bucks on the downpayment and then repos the car when they inevitably fall behind on payments, slaps a new sticker on the car and resells it again.
---
Ah, didn't know you could do that since I don't use that mode much.
---
That‚Äôs what I was thinking but I just wish they‚Äôd put stuff out that doesn‚Äôt need fixing it‚Äôs really annoying
---
The irony of you calling everyone else sensitive is hilarious. 
---
If you and your discord team are so efficient and capable then it shouldn't matter what everyone else there is doing. My buddy and I run SBQ fights a lot too and it almost always comes down to just us two being the main source of damage. I dont feel the need to run and tell others what they're doing "wrong" according to what I think. I let them play the game, collect their loot, and move on.
---
I‚Äôve had a pet death claw and I currently have a pet mega sloth at my CAMP. Tameable animals only spawn in certain locations I have found and take a hell of a lot of server hopping to find them spawning on their own because can‚Äôt tame them if anything else spawns around them. I got both of mine at the south mountain lookout just below foundation. If this doesn‚Äôt make much sense there is a few videos on YouTube about taming animals as pets
---
Same, had to remove the stupid thing.
---
I went straight from the main menu into attempting to load into my private.
---
Oh btw for your sneak for the Queen, do you stealth boy or Chinese suit or do you just crouch for the sneak effect to take affect?
---
Thanks for the reply! I‚Äôm currently leaning towards the direction of picking that up and maybe putting the SS grind on hold. But I do want that jet pack and I‚Äôm soo close haha, only 2 more days of handing in treasury notes and I'd be there. Decisions to be made... I should add that I do feel like I'm always out of AP so I'm not sure the jetpack would be great for me.
---
Do you run the same perk set for the heavy and shotgun?
---
I FOUND A SECOND PIPE!
---
Truly Pipe is a benevolent god.
---
They were never removed from workshops, just from camps. What a recent bug (or feature?) has removed from workshops is the free travel to owned ones whenever the generic workshop symbols are replaced by individual icons.
---
If it has the Atom store symbol next to it. You can‚Äôt give it away. To anybody. It will automatically be destroyed the second it leaves your inventory. 
---
Same applies to camp items. You can‚Äôt build them at another player‚Äôs camp.
---
Black rimmed specs. One of the first things I picked up in fallout 76!
---
its unmoddable. You cant put the SS underarmor mods on it either, i have shielded unlocked and it just bounces when i attempt to put it on, the sound plays successfully, though.
---
I want to say some people had luck lobbing grenades down there to kill it quicker than the crickets.
---
i allways thought i was the only one who got them autocompleted whilest dancing naked
---
Maybe? I am biased because Ive had a  JE model for the last year, and it is the most fun OP weapon I own. I just don‚Äôt recommend using it indoors
---
Or there using weapons that ain't up to task slow fire rate on gatling gun been a major one I see people trying to use.
---
I totally think it would be cool if they did some actual mutation when that happens. Even if they move faster, attack more viciously, become glowing or something. Would def feel better than making it a bullet sponge like it feels now
---
The trees are surprisingly few flamingos, especially given their visual impact.
---
Im still newish but there are not nearly enough negative effects. What we get are extremely minor inconveniences, if that.
---
They can't scale back the monetization. This game will shut down without it.  The game clearly didn't sell the number of copies they wanted it too, and what money they did earn probably barely covered things like music licenses, voice actors, advertisers.  
---
At this point the game is starting to go borderline F2P with gamepass, I woudln't be surprised if it they offer it as a free game on PS+ soon.  
---
Even if their other IPs are doing well, they won't take money from successful IP and invest it into a failed one.  If they are moving money they are moving it into the next Fallout, Starfield, or Elder Scrolls game. 
---
Basically I see it as the "take it or leave it" phase of the game.  They will still trickle stuff in over time, but ultimately - they aren't selling new copies of the game, so the only way they are making money to keep the lights on is monetization, once that trickles away they'll keep it in a maintenance phase for a bit, then shut it down. 
---
my best guess is 2022
---
Normally my team I may with on weekend can do it with 3 player max 4 every time no issues.
---
One thing I'd add from the PoV of someone who is familiar with living with and operating firearms. Finger stays outside the trigger guard unless the weapon is up and aimed. I imagine an AD with an energy weapon would be quite a lot of splash damage. 
---
It makes me wince every time I see it, fake weapon or not.
---
Yeah I logged on at 11:30 just to check the atomic shop (didn't even join a world) and now only have 1 NW daily and the critical hit weekly (which was already 20% completed) when I log back in at 2:30 Eastern time.
---
I have seen the from .99 to 2$ in walmarts in USA and Canada
---
Basically the same perks.... I just swapped the heavy Gunner cards for the shotgunner ones, put on Skeet Shooter in perception, and since I stepped out of my PA for it I replaced One Gun Army with Serendipity and Power User and Stabilized for Demo Expert.
---
I have absolutely no idea about firearms tbh (I'm from Germany) but I'll remember that next time.
---
Prepare for the whackiest gun in the wasteland.
---
Want to hit that huge deathclaw 3 foot in front of you with a 95% vats chance. NOPE! 
---
Want to hit that ant behind a wall that you cannot even see with 0% chance. YES! 
---
Slap a single point in gun fu. makes it way better
---
scrip fight - Salt n Peppa vs Devo!
---
  When a problem comes along, you must scrip it....
---
The Chinese suit is definitely easier to hide with but it takes away all your unyielding armor. Which is not good at all because it will take away all your extra strength and the rest of the bonuses. 
---
So for agility I have six points. Sneak 3. And ninja 3. 
---
When the queen lands. I wait about 5-6 seconds for the queen to attack other people and focus on them. That way I know for sure I can hit her plenty of times until she eventually notices me.

Here's map with locations of random events in Savage Divide where trick or treaters can spawn.
---
Na. I love my instigating exploding fixer; the weapon I mostly use... I don‚Äôt really use the TSE Plasma... only for the scorch queen same with all my other heavy weapons.. usually use my rifles
---
Same.  Appreciate your posting this every week!
---
Awesome!  Make some makeup on the hands and face to give that real down-and-out Appalachian look and you're there.
---
Congratulations!
---
It uses the casual lining mods like every other Atom Shop under-armor. It says so in the description on the store page. edit: apparently it's bugged either way?
---
Ok thank you I didn‚Äôt see that
---
Thanks for the reply, can't wait to test it out tomorow. Thanks again for all your advice!
---
I usually check the road heading NE from Pumpkin House to the RR Megastop. There's almost always an enemy group spawn at the military vehicles, and 9/10 times one of them is a legendary.
---
Uhm... isn't the SBQ immune to the explosive effect?
---
Just stop shooting if she is in the air and close to death. Smoking ash pile in the sky is no fun.
---
Mines and other explosives work great for this.
---
Set a mine before you try to sneak up on them.  First shoot, then grenade, then run back past your mine and reload.
---
isn't there a tommy gun already... but what about a Toddy Gun
---
I'm on Xbox and it's never happened before. This is the first time.
---
Hm, wacky in a good or frustrating way? Do you think I would be better served with a different gun as a secondary?
---
I'm not saying give the same benefits, just that there's could be something for high health specifc builds out side of one armor mod, even just some more love to the team medic solar armor type effect, where we get to buff or support our team or players in our area and we get a little buff in return for that support we provide. And I love the idea of Vanguard's being the "Tank" what kind of a tank gets perpetually worse the longer the fight go. The only time high health Vanguard's is a true tank is when we're playing heavy gunner and power armor roles. As a stealth sniper and VATS rifle build I'm not that tank, as soon as I soak up that first big hit and my hp dips my defensive numbers go to absolute crap. So yeah I believe armor buffs to the Vanguard's stuff would be appropriate to make us tanky so that way when we take that initial smack we're still in a decent position to take the other, ricochet let's us throw a little back from a hit vs serendipity you just dodge it outright. The only people who can't see the massive imbalance in low vs high health are the people with low health builds. Throw on Vanguard's stuff and try to tank and you'll see that in the long term the low health combo of always being at your best defensive numbers no matter what and serendipity outweighs the Vanguard's who just gets worse and worse the longe the fight goes.
---
I asked the same thing a few days ago now n a Facebook group. Apparently it‚Äôs a bug and will be getting addressed to add in helmets
---
I am similar with vamps ffr ultracite gatling laser. Never die. Takes a little bit of time to kill. But, vampires have all the time in the world. Working on the PA though going to get all the T65 pieces soon.
---
I haven‚Äôt gotten there yet. But there have been a few posts lately about it. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a confirmed bug and they should be there or not though.
---
That is what I did. Lob grenades, wait for the flies so I can find the corpse
---
Yeah, tried that a few times to, along with constantly firing Tesla while going down the tunnel, no luck üôÅ
---
been seeing the same thing on PS4 lately, team and area.  Can see the speaker icons lighting up, but no sound comes forth.
---
Workaround is platform level party chat.  
---
But thats several extra steps when all you want/need to do is area chat with a random player.
---
thats extremely amazing
---
Spot on. FO4 didn‚Äôt have any server upkeep, didn‚Äôt have to employ anti cheat tech, didn‚Äôt manage releases across multiple separate platforms all with their own intricacies. Bethesda needs to monetize the game some how to keep it alive. Either they go subscription based and everyone buys fo1st or they monetize individual pieces of the game in an attempt to raise money without being too pay to win.
---
Yeah my only issue is o have no idea where I need to go due to having so many markers on the map
---
Cosign.  Good strategy.
---
*Legendary Assaultron Intensifies*
---
wacky as in what i described =0 
---
You'll make shots you should have no chance of hitting but miss easy ones repeatedly. 
---
Naw! get it. It's the best gun i've ever used. I cannot imagine using anything else. 
---
just make sure you get used to jumping and shooting otherwise you'll blow yourself up a lot.
---
They started adding exclusive monthly skins for 1st just not scrap box skins
---
Yeah its a bug I imagine, can't think of anything else it could be. I've been unable to find it either so I assume it is screwed. For now I've been wearing the clean spacesuit helmet with it.
---
So don‚Äôt buy it.
---
Now that the shadowed mods work on every armor type that has them, as long as you get the perk Escape Artist, you can use any armor type you want.
---
If you're looking to absolutely min-max sneak, get a full set of shadowed unyielding agility harder to detect Thorns armor with a Fixer - you'll get one extra sneak bonus from the full set bonus.
---
Honestly I don‚Äôt know. But the gun is still very mean and all of my guns are bloody explosive. So it‚Äôs as good an option as any.
---
I believe it. Ward's a fucking asshole. "Heh, we've actually got like 68 osmosis kits, but it's the principle you know." 
---
Yeah Ward, I know you're a goddamn douche-canoe.
---
Fuckin' Ward.
---
It's just a huge ripoff
---
Honestly didn't check the price but the other reply might be on the point. I personally like the marketing and imagery for Cokacola but I generally drink Pepsi because it doesn't seem as acidic and is a bit sweeter. Sorry. Lol
---
To be honest. Those fuckers won‚Äôt die when I blast them in the head multiple times
---
Fireproof 3 makes a huge difference on this. Since I equipped it I haven‚Äôt killed myself with point blank shots.
---
Gatling gun is a great choice for everyday  use against common enemies.  It's good enough for a queen fight. But  if you want to do even better on the queen, consider 50 cal, Gatling Plasma or Gatling laser.
---
I use Gatling gun for everyday use.  For the queen I use a Zealot's Ultracite Gatling laser with a prime receiver.  The 50 Cal from Beckett's quest line is great too though.
---
I use Gauss minigun occasionally but the damn thing eats ammo like crazy.   It's one of those weapons I use when I have ammo for it, but I don't go out of my way to keep it supplied it because its appetite for ammo is a bottomless pit.
---
This sounds so fun!!
---
How good is SS armor?
---
Except it still gives you the option to apply the "shielded" mod....ugh.
---
Hold up... that‚Äôs what I was doing when it happened to me!
---
Gorge Junkyard üòÅ
---
She is, but for some reason she takes a TON of damage from the flamer. Maybe because it's the new fire damage type?
---
Gorge junkyard has one, kind of between the workshop station and the house.
---
Hopefully we'll get to find out numbers etc soon! Since the crippling was fucked, it's a bit of a nightmare at times! Thanks again!
---
I just buy fuel from other other players, it's way too expensive to craft often.
---
Noice!!!!!
---
Same damn thing happened to me. Two weeklies auto completed. Two. Thousand. Points. Gone.
---
I know right I thought the last person that commented had the answer but I can‚Äôt apply any mods to it
---
Fits right in with Portland. Great work.
---
We had a bunch of level 200-300s on a server running stealth/heavy builds. Once the queen landed her health went down so quickly she couldn‚Äôt even regenerate. It was insane
---
Thank you! I dont use facebook but im glad to hear its in the works.
---
Yeah, I was amazed at how much lead came from just farming the bots at the vault, ag center, water treatment plant, and under Mama Dolce's.   (I have all the "kill robots" atom challenges done except the one to do it barehanded.  No thanks.   The atoms aren't worth the carpel tunnel that one might cause.  LOL!)   So I might have to start doing lead runs too.
---
Yeah I made the mistake of crafting it once. The only problem is many players ask for 3 caps a fuel. I can‚Äôt afford to pay that when I ask 1 cap for .50.
---
Good tip. I will check this out later
---
Guess the trees and bushes are some old thing brought back because it is the most exciting thing for me. I couldn't believe you get all variations for that cheap.
---
Fixed on PTR. So next week stimpacks will be a thing again...
---
Space babies, I tell ya man.
---
Good to know its supposed to be there, ill for sure try out the clean helmet with it!
---
I prefer Pepsi. Coke gives me chronic acid indigestion &amp; doesn't taste as good. The Mexican version is better though but overall I'm all about the Pepsi!
---
Well from personal experience back when I was friends with Hotkarl he was around lvl 1056 and a guy speaking in third person called "Shelby," ran over to us and started calling Karl "master" and crouched in front of him to simulate bowing. The reason he was doing this weird stuff was because he saw Karl's high level and figured that if he kissed his ass enough, he could get duped weapons (Cause some people believe high level automatically translates to generous duper). Long story short, Shelby got impatient because he didn't get what he wanted in a timely fashion, despite grinding a large amount of steel within a week for Karl, and started throwing a tantrum.
---
Now when you look at this duping fiasco, you have a lot of people that were going around kissing ass in order to get stuff from others, when all of a sudden a dupe comes out and makes what their going after suddenly accessible. Naturally, these immature entitled people who were forced to work for their duped guns (like Shelby) are gonna turn on those people for not just handing them what they wanted. In short, some of the people bashing others on reddit and some youtube comment sections are a bunch of Shelbies.
---
The second part to the equation comes from the people who sell legacies for real world money. When the dupers made everything available, the prices for their goods drastically dropped (no one was gonna buy that $1000 dollar BE Gatling plasma on Ebay before or after this dupe). So naturally, like the Shelbies, they flocked to reddit and youtube to bash on the dupers cause they messed with their money.
---
The worst part about it though is that neither group are sure (or care) as to wither or not you're guilty because in their minds they're just going after the boggyman that pissed them off, "The Dupers."
---
And another problem - if its the "casual" mod, that doesn't give you the benefits of the Shielded SS Mod as well - which was kind of the point.
---
I think she has headaches because there is no Jet in Appalachia
---
Thanks. Been l9oking for this one for a while
---
I dunno about the lmg or gatling gun, personally I've used mine way more than legacies.
---
Well my gatling gun, the lmg is a bitch on ammo consumption. The Gatling is super conservative on ammo and with the right heavy weapon perks hits like a truck.
---
I agree with all the other points, I really wish Bethesda would make missile launchers, fat mans and grenade launchers viable, I love using them but its like throwing a water balloon at a house fire
---
It's good but it's missing shadowed mods for all the limbs. You'll get quite a bit more armor though, and the grind and RNG is painful to get the full set.
---
Shoot them in the legs from stealth.
---
Did you throw the, as soon as you entered, or did you travel down the path a little before throwing them? I‚Äôm running out of ideas lol
---
Yeah that‚Äôs so stupid they should‚Äôve made it where it‚Äôs just a skin instead of a whole no under armor you can‚Äôt even mod
---
I just do corn, didn't have to but they nerfed my collectron
---
I think its level dependent - with double XP benefiting lower level players, and double score benefiting higher level players.
---
I got a lot farther along the legendary run during double score weekend than I did levels in general during double XP.
---
At L22x, its a lot of XP between levels - I think I gained 3 levels during double XP weekend.    
---
 But making 222 or 225 doesn't really make much difference.  
---
To someone under L50, however, double XP and getting to L50 that much faster is a great thing.
---
  Double score, however, got me some dozen steps farther along the path, which is (arguably) more satisfying, and (arguably) better for high level players.
---
The scrap collectron.
---
If Bethesda can't track this stuff and fix each individual account, then they should just own up to their mistake and award everyone 5000 score points. I have probably lost more points than that, to be honest, but I'd settle for 5,000.
---
just don't buy it, i saw it i do want it but ill either wait for it to go on sale or i just wont get it
---
What are these "magic" weapons people are talking about? is it just another name for Legacy weapons?
---
So I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôll do ss chest piece for the jetpack and thorns for the rest, would that be good?
---
[I got it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hd60k7/owlet_it_does_exist/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) 
---
But it had no meat on the corpse.
---
That would be incredibly daft for them to not include the helmet...
---
... which pretty much means they didn't include the helmet.
---
Have you seen the T-65 camo bug?
---
[T-65 with Camo paint added](https://imgur.com/gallery/MoHH5o7)
---
it‚Äôs because bethesda knows people want it, so they don‚Äôt have to bundle it with a bunch of other crap you don‚Äôt want to jack the price up
---
I'm a recent joiner - did the collections harvest crops?
---
I think it looks cool.
---
Wondering if you we‚Äôre coming is because you go out on dangerous missions that you might not survive (remember to an npc it‚Äôs real) and technically it‚Äôs a shed not a house out in the wilderness, and the smell it‚Äôs the smell of radiation and rotting corpses
---
Okay. I was aware of this. I have an instigating pipe gun that is my highest damage gun but I don‚Äôt use it often due to needing other perks. So I roll lever or guass for high damage.  I thought there was an update. What you mentioned has been a thing since day one. Sorry if this sounded jerkish.
---
Meat hook is same. Uses one hand and unarmed. But I haven‚Äôt tested recently. Someone in another post mentioned it was patched or soon to be.
---
No I don‚Äôt have the t65 I got the strangler heart which I regret grinding for lol
---
you should email that idea to Bethesda.
---
When you switch servers, restart the game and the workshop icons won't change. It's annoying and seems to be the only workaround that I know of.
---
I have a little of everything, but mostly carrots. Carrot soup gives me adequate food and water and I don't eat much, so I don't usually cook anything else. The rest is for the daily grill one, and people who happen by
---
Yup,if you‚Äôre willing to use perk points you can mitigate most of the negatives. There really isn‚Äôt any drawback to running multiple mutations. I‚Äôd definitely like to see some more negative results from mutations. Personally I think it would be fitting when the Enclave and BOS make a return to Appalachia that those factions won‚Äôt want to deal with you because you‚Äôre mutated, especially the Enclave. Currently there is zero incentive to go mutations free.
---
I only kill myself like once a day now. Not worth the 3 points for me.
---
The communist collectron got some really good soups, the loot pool was limited but I was happy with it, now they just get all sorts of random crap
---
Fuckin work! 10/10
---
U got no idea.... I would rather have given it to another high level, then to have a newbie sell it for 100 caps
---
I think if that happened to me, the PS4 is going straight through the front window!
---
Ah :(
---
I don't think the green hood is. Found 2 on my wanders in morgantown. Both in the place with the tents on the road. Seen people sell them for 500 caps on the trade forum
---
And i scrapped a bos lab coat a few hours ago so i hope not =0
---
Niiiice!
---
I'm an herbivore, so I live mainly on fresh homegrown melons and carrot soup. And of course a little adhesive farming as well...
---
corn for my soup and a variety of other things for people to help themselves to
---
Got me a vampires mini the other day and ran it at encrypted and I fucking loved it, yea the junkies has a high damage output but the vampires helps so much with the pylons
---
Savage. 3 times is just playing with a person's emotions.
---
Have you been trying to keep up? What's your progress?
---
I genuinely want to complete the damn thing.
---
I‚Äôve been hit 5 times and not once was I logged in around the time. I‚Äôve been saying for weeks now that wasn‚Äôt the main cause.
---
I love a good soup, in FO76 and real life. Didn't realise you could borrow crops from other people's CAMPs, but that's cool.
---
I‚Äôm here to comment again to say I also didn‚Äôt see your second comment. So I made another one to clarify. This exchange is kind of funny to me now. Haha
---
I've had that a few times, had something to do with alt tabbing during a load screen (fast travel). Some times I can bring up task manager to close the game.
---
I've had it happen once as you describe where I couldn't access task manager to close it. I had to hold my PC power button. This happened when I left the game on main menu screen to go eat dinner. The game really doesn't like being left on the main menu for some reason, I always make sure to shut it down now.
---
Did you meet a faun named Tumnus?
---
And the whole map has like 1% of flat ground to put it properly.
---
I've asked for this before... Many times...
---
Well technically I asked for a "disappointed" or "this game sucks" emote but same thing.
---
Another self entitled pin head telling others how to play the game that they payed for , if you want everything done your way stay on a private server
---
gourd
---
I could say the same about u bub
---
I was hoping it would give me a quick source of dirty water, like a placeable stream/pond, so I'd have a source of boiled water other than a slow ass pump.
---
Is the fogger in there somewhere? I'm just not sure if I'm not seeing it.
---
And this! Also, get close. Like, can see up their noses close. The last two tames I did I had to be all up in their shit and they did not attack me and I got the prompt.
---
I felt like it was, yes.  But I didn't really mind because most of the backpacks are quite large. In fact, even the Black Shovel one is wide enough that your elbows clip through it when you run.
---
Yeah but that is an engine/optimization issue. If they did a rebuild of their engine and worked on it for 76 it could have been much smoother. Also not to shit on the graphics but it is not like they made a massive leap from 4 to 76, so I was pretty surprised how laggy it can get until I realized they used the same engine.
---
I don‚Äôt really have much to use in Endurance otherwise, at least for my build. 
---
Plus it helps against Sierra Bravos as well.
---
What's the gourd for? I'm hearing lots of good things about soup.
---
Any idea when they‚Äôll be available?
---
The sooner you figure out that you‚Äôre wasting time by being on the subreddit for a game you don‚Äôt like, the better.
---
Actually stay here and waste your time, and keep giving people good laughs from your comments
---
I was a high health build. I definitely understand the differences and why you think bloodied are stronger. Saying that we only defend it because we are bloodied is a straw man. I can argue you‚Äôre only attacking bloody builds because you don‚Äôt like them. Doesn‚Äôt get us anywhere. 
---
The reason more ppl favor bloodies like I do is it‚Äôs more fun to do damage endgame than tank it. If you‚Äôre getting smacked hard enough that you‚Äôre about to die I really think that‚Äôs build optimization. I was absorbing plenty of damage even without blocker and other perks like that. I just couldn‚Äôt get enough kills as a melee for it to be fun. Bloodied have access to only 3 perk cards that I can think of. Unyielding is the only worthwhile bloody armor meanwhile and it doesn‚Äôt give any health or def benefits. So the only difference between a bloody and tank‚Äôs defensive stats is a couple cards that use up a good number of our perks points. Whatever your defensive issues are sound like optimization issues and understand we aren‚Äôt just running around taking bullets like it‚Äôs nothing just cause we‚Äôre bloodied. We use a lot of diffused stimpaks to stay alive or have to use cover to jump from enemy to enemy. Most of us just don‚Äôt care too much if we get knocked down in fights since there‚Äôs no real punishment. I‚Äôd be fine with solar being a better team heating gear, but you‚Äôre already getting an armor with basically a 4th legendary perk. It‚Äôs already something bloodies can‚Äôt use.
---
Also, as others mentioned your example of using vats on a bloody is because vats are currently broken. It hardly works in pvp for melee players and ranged weapons do nothing rn. It would be extremely rare for serendipity to dodge 3 in a row, as I haven‚Äôt ever seen that against even regular mobs.
---
yes, it would be nice, but its been almost 2 years and its not on the roadmap so...
---
Indeed, they let you go hog wild with them.
---
I've also heard it suggested that one could use the Shrub as a Nuclear Winter trick.  Instead of seeking cover wherever shrubs naturally exist, you could just place your own! üòÇ
---
Well shit, I traded a good gun for it
---
Ahhh I thought you meant previously as in previous titles. Tbh I prefer the lever. Yeah, I think it was patched in the last update
---
No.  Legacy weapons are only "broken" in that they can put out more damage due to the combination of the explosive effect with the damage/rate of fire of energy weapons.  Magic weapons are just plain broken.
---
Yes. The pip boy won't reflect it. But it does work
---
cranberry relish
---
martyrdom drop a live gernade when killed
---
Sounds pretty much like me. Lol
---
I used to drink it like crazy when I was in high school then I started getting these really bad cases of heartburn, stopped drinking cola all together for probably 6 to 6 years, and use in the last 3 years started drinking it again, but I always have it on ice, seems to help.
---
Been on some servers for hours with no events that pop up.  Others are more regular.  Both types usually are full of people.  IF you're really hunting events, I'd jump every 20-30min if you don't see anything new.
---
Is it worth it?
---
Lmao weve got 2 seperate conversations now haha
---
Same, and all the stuff for booze, cause I‚Äôm a junkies build. Melon life unite.
---
Ceci n'est pas une life.
---
corn, tato, mutfruit, gourd, melon. then farm some blight can make 3 juices and three soups that stack and handle food+water w herbivore, also adhesive but digested goo is way faster there ;)
---
I do corn and razorgrain so I can make nukashine to put out for visitors to drink. There's extra corn which I make into soup cuz the rapid AP regen is useful in a pinch.
---
Yeah, tried that.
---
I just did two SBQ in an hour, laid down 1.2K rounds of 2mmEC, and I got no stable flux despite being there for 5-8min each.
---
This.
---
Rush thru the Vault, go to Wayward, talk to Duchess, place your CAMP, craft a throwing knife.
---
Done.
---
Its all about range. But you clearly said she has increased resistances while flying, never heard that before anywhere
---
You could but we both know its not true because I am not the one crying and calling people names when things dont go my way
---
The booze stuff I always just grab at Silva/Billings, saves me a lot of budget.
---
Well you need all 5 pieces of Thorns to get the sneak bonus. If you're set on a Jetpack, you might as well go full SS.
---
Do you have a favorite location to launch nukes? Sometimes I‚Äôll get on with my friend and we do our own thing usually and we both gain from events but sometimes I want to do an event with someone....make friends and what not lol I don‚Äôt expect to be rezzed much to be honest. If I die I die lol I will respawn anyways. I‚Äôd prob prefer the mic for communication purposes, specially for an event....it‚Äôs just easier.
---
Yeah, tried it before and it doesn't work. I guess they have to fix it.
---
Lay my thang down, flip it, and reverse it
---
You‚Äôre a medic? That‚Äôs pretty cool! Good to know people are pretty friendly in the game. I did get randomly killed while out and about by a higher level guy who was in full armor and now I‚Äôm a bit hesitant.

You don't need to have the armor to get the paint.  The only glitch would be if you could apply one paint for a certain type of armor to another type of armor, t45 to t 65, for example.
---
I have 5 in ironclad but may change that as I dont often die. 
---
Also happy cake day
---
I just bought the SS backpack, but it kind of bothers me that there are no straps. It's just kind of on my back. I tried taking my outfit off and it still looks the same. Just kind of attached to my armor.
---
Oh really? Good to know, thanks!
---
Bethesdas official response has been there is nothing we can do about your lost score. They added in extra challenges to make up for it... pretty lame response we all know they could provide atoms to those effected to buy the levels they missed.
---
I don't find it necessary. Since their damage is so insane anyway. I prefer to just run gunsmith
---
I have a friend that‚Äôs a pharmacist in game and I trade a lot of hefes/ Bocks/ lead mimosas but mostly use hard lemonade myself, I just buy the vodka from vendors and lemonade is so easy to craft.
---
Same here. I really want fireplace and the final bundle. I grind like crazy (over 2000 hours in game) so I'm at S.C.O.R.E. lvl 52 at the moment but this the worst its happened to me so far. The last 2 times about half were completed. This time it was all but 1 daily and 1 weekly
---
Thank you for a fact based, intelligent explanation of camp budget limitations. I will save this post and preach it to whomever will listen.
---
Rusticated very cool
---
I wish I would just type the amount rather than assault my arrow keys.
---
Good to know! I might try and switch it around as well for extra xp. Thanks!
---
Understandably so. You could move your camp to an oil resource node and farm acid off of bloat flies. The oil resource only generates 5 oil max though.
---
To farm bloat flies for acid you will need a brahmin pen and a bloatfly syringer. Point a turret facing towards the brahmin pen and I usually box the brahmin in with fencing as well to prevent wandering. Shoot the brahmin with the syringer and then kill the brahmin. A bloatfly should come out of it and the turret will target the bloatfly. If you shoot the fly before it dies with the syringer, it will spawn another fly when that one dies. This process can be sped up if you get a friend to help you and you both shoot the target with a syringer then it will spawn 2 flies but it can get pretty chaotic very quickly. The bloatfly glands break down into acid. Also a small chance to spawn a trash legendary fly. 
---
Also recommend having extra razor grain planted in case you need to start over.
---
Maybe until patch 22, so around September. 
---
I heard they delayed from patch 21.
---
It will be interesting to see how the BoS content later this year compares to Wastelanders.
---
Personally, I think they need to stop this practice of saving everything for one big update, and having almost nothing new (and ostensibly "B-team") in-between.  A steady flow of interesting new events would be more worthwhile to me.  Wastelanders also was ill-conceived from the standpoint that players had *every* incentive to blast through it as quickly as possible.  You could literally finish in a day what it took them months to complete, and all of that content was one-and-done.  That doesn't seem like a sensible design for a game struggling for content.
---
&gt;Personally I think it would be fitting when the Enclave and BOS make a return to Appalachia that those factions won‚Äôt want to deal with you because you‚Äôre mutated, especially the Enclave
---
That is pretty crafty and consistent with lore. I like the idea!
---
Both should be deleted.
---
My crew and I spam SBQ nukes usually, we drop three in a row til the server is tapped out and then move on to a new one, lather rinse repeat. Mind you we're all level 300+ so that's really all there is for us to do.
---
When I'm doing my own thing, I'll nuke Whitespring on a private server or nuke my cobalt farming spot down south (it's always entertaining to see people run down there wandering around like... *Why TF did someone nuke this?*)
---
Sometimes I like the break from constant Queens just to wander and do stupid events.
---
You are in luck, AngryTurle has made a new highly detailed video about these "magic" weapons and how to identify one...
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mRX-MEPzhs
---
I'm not quite sure what you're talking about. Not everyone runs with a team on public servers.  My stealth commando with a B2525 Fixer can get 600-800 damage per non-crit shot while the SBQ is flying. I personally avoid doing too much damage for the sake of other players, but not everyone is so kind.
---
"Magic" weapons are a major problem, for sure, but fixing them won't fix the bloodied min/max tryhards.
---
This is why i only buy the scavenger collectrons, nothing else unless it's REALLY good
---
That's good going 2000 hours, I'm approaching a thousand although times like now I doubt my reasons why ha ha
---
I've been lucky any this is the first time it's happened.
---
 Can't knock your perseverance not giving up on it. 
---
May your score be safe from this point forward my friend.
---
As far as I know, no.  Only the Radioactive Barrel from Radiation Rumble does this (and the Radiation Trap).
---
I agree
---
They are all like that, though.
---
Of course you‚Äôre welcome.
---
Fucking nukes were non stop....  I easily cleared like 30 queens over the weekend, and i wasn't on obsessively, either.
---
No, they do not.
---
Source: literally me, a planter owner.
---
Nah. No one forced them to rush the season. Earning nothing is a just reward.
---
Negative friend. The barrel with the coliflower looking thing on top is merely a decoration.
---
I have a lincoln-logs house until I get better walls. Where do you find that really nice blue wooden wall I‚Äôve seen people use?
---
That's what I did, I provided them with proof of my level and how many levels this bug costed me and told them giving me the equivalent in atoms was the least they could do since they actively ignored this bug for over a year when it involved atoms.
---
The reply said that Customer Support aeren't allowed to give out atoms, but assured me that with next week update they will fix the bug and reveal their plan to compensate users who got affected from the bug.
---
Honestly while I appreciate that the response wasn't automated, the fact that they still refuse to tale action or communicate about what they intend to do to be pretty disheartening and infuriating. I spent 800 hours of my time in this game plus countless hours in the PTS to help make this game better, and this is the best they could do.
---
It randomly spawns all over the map. It does exactly as OP.
---
Dang that looks good. Nice setup.
---
Just go and throw yourself into the toxic river and play hippopotamus it's what I do.
---
Thanks - just wish it didn't take a mod slot.
---
Nope, none of them are rare.  
---
There's a spawn location that will spawn a BoS labcoat most of the times.
---
Are they? I never noticed it with the Pioneer backpack, but it stood out to me immediately with the SS pack.
---
If you want another labcoat hit me up. Lol but is the bomber jacket rare?kinda bought one in a vendor while I was at max caps for 1k
---
Heard they are, I was gonna ask for it but he declined
---
Gotta get that sweet sweet rad barrel for that healthy green glow
---
Well, I paid 50 bucks for this game, the least they could do is to make it work decently.
---
Forgot to thank you for this sick write up.
---
You should be able to use casual lining mods. It mentions this in the discription on the Atomic Shop.
---
Edit: I have not purchased it, because I don't like the bonuses of the casual lining mods. I might have misunderstood what you meant about the lining not working.
---
Broken in what way? OP? Hacked? Devroom?
---
Lead is easy enough to come by with excavator and a trip to Luck Hole mine.  (I get about 600 ore every trip.)
---
Some junk does contain copper: light bulbs, fuses, I think high power magnets, et al
---
Lead: rat poison, wooden blocks, pencils, paint cans, some toys, et al.
---
plastic: pool balls, all types of plastic containers...
---
there's and iron deposit on the east side of bolton greens, a copper deposit on the west side, and a pool table and lots of steel in between...and 3 lead deposits a slight bit east of all that....
---
and I camp on the acid node just to the NE of all that :)
---
I'd suggest finding either the plans for a radbarrel or a gamma gun you can shoot a wall with
---
I really appreciate your help! I‚Äôm just late to the party and it‚Äôs a lot to take in all at once
---
Yes, everything is bugged in this game!
---
No kidding?? On other PA, paint is a separate line from mods. If that is so with T65 then that's a major bug and should be reported to Beth.
---
It‚Äôs because it‚Äôs glitched, it‚Äôs either gonna be in the atomic shop or a future season. I crafted a whole set besides my main one hoping it will transfer to the paint slot when it actually releases
---
Why do you always take her side?
---
I was going to say, this happens to lots of other doors as well. It seems to be most consistent with this particular door from what I‚Äôve noticed.
---
12 crippling the ghoul...enforcer card...shotgun. 
---
Dont finish the ghoul, let them rest on the ground and do the collect part
---
I did the same after a settler became incredibly stank over some damn Bobby pins. 
---
‚ÄúI said good day si...‚Äù
---
You were saying?
---
I stopped having the fast travel bug once I got rid of the healing factor mutation, I would suggest that
---
A lot of movies made here in the US use instructors to teach actors the little signs that turn an actor holding a prop into a dangerous looking survivor. It gets more complex at a Con or in a group photo. 
---
The first rule of firearms is to never allow the barrel to cross anything you don't want to destroy. Handling your laser rifle like a real weapon makes it look like a real weapon. 
---
If you do cosplay at cons, it's best to have a case that doesn't look like a rifle case and only arm up inside the con. But US police are poorly trained and heavily armed. Going to a Con with a prop weapon, discuss it with the staff ahead of time,  if possible. I almost got arrested for an empty tactical holster once.
---
As noted, it does not.  If you want a rad barrel I am pretty sure that other players can place them for you at your camp in a standard team.  If you need it on PS4 just let me know.
---
I don‚Äôt have that mutation
---
Yeah I walked 10 minutes East from spawn and basically got annihilated by two Yao Gui. Used up 20~ stims and all my shotgun ammo to kill one..
---
Plus the legendary weapons are so rng based it‚Äôs really frustrating to min max
---
I‚Äôm actually afraid to log in and check my challenges to see if they are complete. Tuesday‚Äôs used to be exciting for Fo76.
---
That would be nice.
---
Thanks, much love‚ù§
---
You on xbox?
---
I just gave logical explanation, I don‚Äôt even like her I like the wandering settler more, she‚Äôs nicer and less annoying
---
Ps4 mate srry
---
Spawn near Morgantown HS in Morgantown. If it takes you more than 2 matches to do, just give up on NW altogether.
---
500 to 1k is pretty standered for the bomber jacket
---
Thanks. XB1. But I appreciate the offer
---
I thought this was a great idea until I saw your comment... Oh HELL no....
---
Base damage...606. That doesn‚Äôt even make sense in my brain. Is the game even fun anymore at that point?
---
By earning S.C.O.R.E. completing the daily and weekly challenges.  On the main menu look at the Legendary Run menu option.   It explains it there.    The lunch boxes are one of the prizes you can earn.
---
Shoot legs.   Avoid the head laser blast by hiding behind things.
---
I can see why she says it‚Äôs like camping, most camps are some derelict looking wooden box that she lives in.
---
I really wanted to like NW but with hackers on PC it's a pain in the ass. Sorry, Bethesda.
---
Oh, well darn apparently there is something else that can cause that... You have any gear or perks that cause you to regenerate hp by chance?
---
Actually that is where I spawn. Sometimes a dogo will be around but none today.
---
You have to be a little more specific. Is it just a dog you saw and you liked? Is it a dog that you have already tamed? Which dog
---
If you wanna go over bored with dps then hell yah
---
It's a Christmas miracle!
---
you really need to hang up the  Bombs away mobile  over that ;) congrats
---
This is getting ridiculous. Everything they release is now more likely to be bugged than not. I'm actually surprised now when something cool is added to the game and it actually works as intended, which is sad. That's not how game development should work.
---
why be bloodied then.. just be stealth?
---
it's the catch-22 loop.  
---
* To keep players engaged they need more content
---
* To add new content they need money
---
* They earn money from engaged players
---
It's clear they simply don't have the manpower, and I'm sure COVID doesn't make things any easier with things like getting a voice actor in to record lines.  For Bethesda's part, as a larger company, it doesn't make sense for them to invest in this game further.  
---
For them to release meaningful content on a more rapid basis, they would need multiple development teams that were staggered.  A handful of agile teams all with different tasks and then working towards different release dates.  They seem to barely have one team.   For them to do more would probably put them in into 24/7 crunch time.  
---
Like I said, it's take it or leave it.    I'm sure they are taking a gamble with gamepass.  They are hoping that by offering it on Gamepass they will get some additional 1st subscribers and more micro-transactions so they can feed more money into that catch-
---
My expectation, in the coming months we'll see lunchboxes offered on the Atom shop (can still get them from SCORE).  I wouldn't be surprised if they also added some additional functionality to 1st subscriptions to try to push the monthly income (maybe a new type of stash box that holds something else)
---
Check the front by the buses and behind the building too.
---
Nah, it happens on all my characters regardless of level and what I have equipped. It‚Äôs just a weird bug that was introduced when they added in the fast travel countdown. No idea what the cause is, but it‚Äôs a silly bug
---
Well, reset happens in the middle of the night for me and autocomplete hasnt happens to me once.  There‚Äôs a decent amount of circumstantial evidence that the reset plays a part
---
Dude, they're trying to lead you to an Inari shrine. Follow em. Just make sure to pet them when you're done.
---
Sorry.
---
This week's stuff was really lame.
---
This is the internet. Facts and reality have no place here. Most of the local residents are scared shitless of facts. Huh, kind of like real people, come to think of it.
---
I watched a video and ontop of a cliff in the bottom right there's a level 1 very small dog. All I know is I need level 3 animal whisperer
---
Too bad. It seems I missed both times then. :(
---
Can't have strategy in this game - look at the shambles of Rad Rumble and Encryptid. This player base doesn't want strategy.
---
I did the nukashine mission, and promptly forgot all about it. I think waking up in a random spot put me off it, but in hindsight it was actually kinda cool, and I reckon I night have a go at making more. Cheers üëç
---
Won't let me put any lining on it.
---
The trees are really nice.  Glad more people have the opportunity to get them.
---
I agree. Most people just don't bother with Taming. It takes hours and then when you get something you want it either bugs out or someone kills it. Not to mention the perk slots it takes to tame!
---
I've heard about not eating or drinking, or anything that heals over time right before as that may affect it!
---
I plant 1 of each crop due to budget. If I want to farm adhesive I will harvest my corn, mutfruit, and tatos and take them to a workshop where I will plant them. To farm them, I will harvest and replant until I have a considerable amount going and then come back and check them out every once in a while. Water purifiers help as well having a cooking station and scrap box.
---
To be clear, are you looking in the "mod" section of your inventory looking for a mod there, or are you saying when you try to mod the weapon the plan it says it unlocked is not unlocked?
---
Marine wetsuit is very, very tight. It's the same with the Scout armor chest piece, albeit not as bad as the combat chest. Shame, though, because it's the best looking of all the underarmors...
---
Can you place one for me? I can pay in caps or water you need
---
I have to admit, I preferred the double score, it helped a lot for me to catch up.
---
The best would have been double score on the dailies AND the XP weekly. If everyone could get 200 or even 300 score for every 10K xp I think you would see a lot of players out there.
---
I‚Äôm not exactly sure which dog you‚Äôre talking about, but yes you‚Äôll need animal friend3 And it has to spawn by itself. It may not even be tamable
---
It auto completed twice for me when I was logged in at the time of reset. I always disconnect before the reset time and it didn't happen anymore.
---
I would post a video but the sub won't let me
---
Tato, mutfruit &amp; corn for vegetable starch.  Extra corn so I can make whiskey - and make grape mentats.  Gourds for cranberry relish
---
If it's by harpers, you gotta make mutt chops outta it Cuz it's not tamable.
---
Yeah it's definitely annoying, and that's why I always through out the removing of healing factor since that's what fixed it for me. Sorry you have to deal with it and hopefully Bethesda will fix it soon
---
I lived there for four years and I agree.
---
Also having lived there when all the water was contaminated I laugh every time I see toxic water in this game
---
Yeah I looked around at some other posts, looks like its bugged... and it isn't linked up with the casual lining mods but uses ss lining mods.
---
Message me your psn I‚Äôll give a yell when I get on tonight (pacific, US)
---
I did finish as well and now I am finishing with another 2 alts. First time it's cool. Second, not so much. Third is a pain in the ass.
---
you might consider healing factor mutation.  It will reduce the number of stimpacks you need to carry.   when combat ends/no threats detected, it boosts you back to 100% health (less rads)  If you have rads and pop a radaway (or diluted), healing factor will increase you heath just as fast as the rads go away.
---
alos think about the Twisted muscles mutation - but if you want to maintain ballistic accuracy, you should have (at least) class freak2.
---
Incisor for armor penetration, martial artist for swing speed.  Glow sight for extra damage against glowing enemies.
---
bloody mess (if you have enough LCK points to support it)
---
If you are in PA, the motion assist torso mod will give you +2 STR.
---
Underarmor: Shielded BoS underarmor is +3 STR, and Secret Service Shielded is +4 STR.
---
Vampire weapons will help keep you alive.
---
My goto is a L50 1\* vampire switchblade.  When I go to WS, I swap it out for a FSS Ghoul slayer switchblade. (yea, I know those are both 1H)
---
Armor with faster AP regen will help Power Attacks.
---
adding u/ladydevann for some visibility - i've consistently noticed this travelling to player camps as well
---
In order to understand the great mystery, one must study all its aspects.
---
Seriously incompetent, if that's the answer you're looking for
---
That was fast! Thank you
---
Still, It would be nice if armour didn't warp the second I put it on
---
How much better is it with the perk?
---
Yes a vault tech skin like the small generator would be cool
---
I‚Äôm also waiting for crafting station skin bundle lol
---
Thank you.
---
I've drank so much river water I'm legally half Manatee.
---
Yes but bloodied makes you an absolute Glass Cannon and Junkie isn't as Powerful as Bloodied. Your concepts numbers are much to high, a 25% Damage Cap is enough and percental increased defences are not a great idea, they need also like 25 if Mutated, wich ends up at 125 wich I think is enough, regarded you have them no matter how high your HP is.
---
I don't know how much FU they take exactly but I know it's insanely low. I was at 0% left one day and I was still able to put down 3-4. I'd wager they are one of the cheapest items able to build.
---
I know. With the marine wetsuit my character looks like me IRL (I'm very slender). It's an acquired taste...
---
8. Bloodied builds can gather ore just fine. Don that snazzy Chinese stealth armor or hazmat suit and all it takes beyond that is about one diluted RadAway per tunnel.
---
Uggh got em. Thanks!!
---
You definitely can do this, and should do this.
---
Now if we could only be allowed to plant the damn cranberries!
---
I think you spent a lot of time and care on this cosplay and it shows! Great job!
---
Its a postapocolytic door that has suffered 25+ years of neglect, sounds like its working perfectly to me.
---
Is it cross play????
---
For ward, do you happen to have one of the items he‚Äôs searching for?  I‚Äôve had it to where if say he wants a power pack and I have it already, he bugs out.
---
Rocksy seems to have issues on old servers (perhaps the game has issues with making new encounters after a point).  Have hoped to private servers and it worked fine, if that‚Äôs an option for you.
---
This is awesome and an original character (to my knowledge)! Bethesda, make this girl an NPC and/or companion in Fallout 5!
---
maybe you triggered the quests but they're not currently "active." check your Pip Boy to see if that's the case.
---
Pretty much lol
---
Interesting. Tempting.
---
I got everything except gourd
---
Not sure why someone downvoted this I clipped it on my profile so free to check it out lol
---
Hmm I didn‚Äôt ask lol I have a clip of it happening moron
---
Xbox
---
Yup lol
---
I‚Äôve just noticed they were different cards, problem is I also just hit 50
---
Looks great. One suggestion- crack one of the lenses of your glasses. Not for real, but you know those window cling decals people have on their cars? Use some of that material to make an overlay to put on the lens then draw cracks on it to simulate the look of battle damaged specs, without actual damage.
---
Yea they never get triggered!
---
Go to westek and you can literally collect toxic goo(rads in a bottle) to have in your inventory when a healthy dose of rads is needed! There is a giant green puddle near the entrance.
---
I did the quest line as well, I didn't know you could get an assaultron, I guess I missed it.
---
This is why Crater is actually the good guys - they tell the truth. Even if it‚Äôs the cold hard truth, they tell it
---
A cool looking Saturnite laser rifle
---
Ok.well in that case I will not tell you what I paid for it...would you like a 3000 cap bomber jacket?I make drastic decisions when I'm near max caps.üòï
---
As some, whose endgame is base building, I'm 100% with you.
---
Building is just bad and Bethesda should feel bad. 
---
So many little things, that are easy to fix, and would improve alot but here we are 2 years later and not much happend.
---
For example: why do stairs only clip in the middle of the floor??  Why Bethesda?
---
Gunsmith x5 means you can go through thousands of rounds before repairing.
---
The funny thing is that there‚Äôs no reward for fixing her robot, yet I still do it every time I see her.
---
Noob question, what do lunchboxes do? I have a few but never used them
---
Grouds for cranberry relish, corn and razorgrain for nukashine vintage and carrots with corn for drill of the grill, still need to plant some nice looking tatos
---
Supposedly, it uses the "casual" shielded plan. But that doesn't make any sense either - since it gives you the option to use the regular "shielded" SS mod.
---
BGS needs to make a statement.
---
In the original example, mothman is what's taking up so much of your budget.
---
I don't think anyone "comes up with the values", per se; I think they're calculated based on the number of polygons, vertices, gpu memory, or some other factor intrinsic to the model. Therefore, if mothman has more vertices and polygons than the red rocket building (which I expect he would, as he is a fully articulated creature) the billboard with him on it would have a higher builder budget cost than the building. To expand, even though the building is much larger, it is just inherently less complex than mothman. An articulated human hand in the game might have a few thousand polygons, with over 10,000 spatial points just for a hand, but a simple/flat wall 100 feet wide and 20 feet tall only needs one polygon with 4 data points to make the wall, and then the texture gets applied.
---
This isn't so much to help you out, but to help other people out and keep the servers running smoothly. By limiting a server instance to ~10 players, and limiting each player's camp to ~0.2gb of video memory (I'm making these numbers up for the example) you can know for certain that you'll never have some combination of crazy players with insane bases all log into the same instance and crash the entire fo76 server. Also, by limiting each player's camp, you also know that even a player with the minimum system specs 1gb of video memory will never have their game crash because another player happened to place an insane base too near a quest objective or something, and they can't approach it without crashing the game.
---
Now, if the billboard simply has a picture of mothman on it, they (Bethesda) need to figure that shit out, because it sounds to me like instead of taking a screenshot of mothman and compressing it into the billboard model, they're trying to render mothman in the background and "compute" the image displayed on the billboard. Wouldn't be the first time that games do stuff like this to cut down on game size by actually rendering cutscenes, and rendering things you see on television screens rather than simply exporting a video that would always be smooth, but would take up a huge amount of space, and wouldn't scale up nicely if someone tried to play in 4k or 8k. Or, assuming they exported the original video in 8k to be future proof, they just added 12gb to game download size for a 30 second video clip lol. 
---
The billboard alone, blank, should be way less complexity than even 1 flamingo. So if the mothman billboard doesn't have a full model of mothman draped over it, with all the ragdoll physics enabled, there is no excuse for it to be taking up so much budget and it should be reported as a bug.
---
It good for the Nuclear Winter mode. Because it's camo and all...
---
I bought it for that purpose only, for the most part.
---
Yes the plan it says I unlocked from scraping the weapon did not unlock
---
You‚Äôre a saint!
---
Aw man.
---
Don't tell them. I've had it for the last week, and enjoy quick xp.
---
That sounds amazing. I was in Encrypted and no one was tanking the pylons so I RadAway‚Äôd, put on my troubleshooter gear, and after the event was stuck walking cause I couldn‚Äôt find any good sources of rads. Carrying them sound like the plan. Thanks for the tip
---
Why is hitting level 50 a problem?   
---
My comando character runs all nine comando perks for a 60% damage boost.  Recommend. 
---
Also, Bloody Mess in Luck for another 15%.
---
Isnt everything on the atomic shop pointless... havent spend an atom since day one
---
For the love of The Pipe, I just want to grow my own cranberries!!!
---
Definitely OP in all the wrong ways but not hacked or devroom.  There's certain legendary effects that if used on certain weapons in certain ways will just break the games damage system.
---
Woah! That looks really cool!
---
What does "economy"  even matter in a game like this? 
---
I'm happy that so many weapons got duped so now more people will he able to enjoy a good weapon
---
Sure they can, but they still have to watch out since you still get 5 rads when in a hazmat/commie armor
---
I'm just a seasonal farmer. Carrots, tato and razorgrain are what I grow during meat week season. 
---
Got to keep chally fed!
---
I haven't seen one of those that I can recall. Where do they spawn?
---
I have a executioners explosive .50cal for every day use.  It works well on just about everything.
---
I keep a vampires explosive MG42 for extreme burst DPS and healing.
---
I have a zelots FFR gauss minigun that I primed for the queen.
---
I have a ultracite Gatling laser (anti-armor I think) because green pew pews are fun!
---
And finally a vampires Gatling plasma for sustained survival.  Tanked all 3 pylons and got punched in the face by the imposter while using it, so I think it works well.
---
Do you use weapon artisan? It can double durability
---
Some weapons breaks faster than others
---
I was joking.  "Why do you always take her side" is a thing a person complaining about their relationship says to their friends who offer any defense of the other side.
---
I use mine to get her through her regeneration stage and to the half-life mark and then I just let everyone else take her down. The people that melt her in seconds are just going to get all our weapons nerfed again.
---
How are you spending hours looking for a creature? I dare say you are you doing something wrong
---
That's the theme of Fallout. No faction is perfect, it's about choosing the lesser of the evils.
---
I purchased the Shielded SS under armor plans but I am not able to mod it. I also have the Casual shielded plans but that won't work on it either.
---
Also wanted to ask if you use turbo fert, I love it and only grow 4 of each crop now and with two fert grenades and green thumb get the yield of 24 plants, I even carry a couple of them with me when I‚Äôm adventuring in case I need to raid a players garden, then I just regrow it for them if they are home and may need it.
---
A friend and I tested it I shot four times normally and 4 times in VATS all four VATS shots were dismissed and three of the four regular shots missed him entirely, I'm using two heavy metal limbs, a heavy combat chest and leg, and a marine leg, the marine leg is hardened, the heavy metals are molded to their best numbers, and the heavy combat pieces are both BOS modded to top numbers. I dont see any build optimization that are gonna get in the way.
---
Wonderful....
---
I didn‚Äôt really take anything you said seriously I assumed the whole post was troll post I just did the same

Iron Fist and Martial Artist
---
Man i would love something like this.
---
12% more damage at 5\*. It increases the 20% damage bonus from Explosive by 60% to a whopping 32% damage bonus.
---
this is a marathon, not a race.  Enjoy the trip.  Follow the overseers questline.  It should keep you in more or less level appropriate areas.
---
Unlike previous versions, try not to pick up/horde everything.  Your storage is not unlimited. Most materials are actually really plentiful once you learn where they live.
---
Sell you excess materials to train station vendors.
---
Stay on the west side of the map for a while.

The only time mine auto completed was when I did the NW one the day before, haven't done it since and haven't had the bug since. Idk if that's the cause but I'm not playing nw again
---
My strategy ... full rank of weapon artisan to get double the normal durability when I repair. I run with Luck of the Draw (I think that‚Äôs the name) that gives a chance for weapon health restoration. It‚Äôs been surprisingly effective, but just one person‚Äôs experience.
---
I'm sorry about that man, but use hard bergain perk next time I usually see them for 1800 if I can remember well, at max 2200. some mentats will help to.
---
Edit: Also if you are in team, you can reconnect to the same server
---
Mines also always closed and then Closes when I click open
---
I don‚Äôt understand. What‚Äôs the glitch? Did you not unlock them in the legendary run?
---
Both. I have Grenadier, so I just lobbed Nuka 'nades the whole way down. The blast radius on them is huge
---
I hate the ones that go invisible and go to an open field with a couple of trees.
---
For the life of me I could not find that bitch and she kept killing me with her beam 100 miles away because she kept locating.
---
I guess not.
---
Thanks man, will give this a try tomorrow when I go again! Much appreciated!
---
This may be the single most effective strategy the community has against people using those hacked, duped explosive gating plasmas. :-D
---
Can spawn inside the antique store in the bog region.
---
I used to have corn and razor grain to make ballistic bock, high voltage hefe and the occasional rad ant lager. Now I just go to those two massive farms just south of the Nuka cola plant
---
Thanks so much that‚Äôs really helpful
---
.50 cal shotgun machine gun, biggest culprit in my experience.
---
Lol it‚Äôs not even a hack but ok..
---
Ehh, the caps isnt that big of a deal I make alot from my shop alone typically ammo and weapons sometimes armor more just annoyed to have started it and been disconnected. Was only doing it for the treasury notes
---
I use the Arktos Pharma backpack, not even sure where it came from tbh, the Arktos Lab Coat &amp; a surgical mask &amp; I go around CAMPS dropping off meds. Coz RPG. üòé
---
Occasionally there are 3, the initial 2 and once their killed a 3rd one can spawn, although I've only ever had this when I've been in the cave with another player, never solo.
---
Sweet! What legendary effects are you rockin?
---
That looks awesome! I would love to see a Nuka-Cola replica accompanying it as well
---
Some mods require different perk cards in order to apply them... Have you tried toggling (forget how it's worded) "all craftable" and seeing the mod you want, to check the perk card that might be required?
---
From what I‚Äôve heard after 50 it takes a lot longer to change your perks? Thanks thought will look for bloody mess now!
---
No kidding
---
For me, i get really stoned and throw on a vaporwave playlist. Works wonders for me.
---
People make it seem like NW challenges are impossible.
---
I grow some fantastic mutfruit in the Forest region now compared to when I used to live in the arid climate of the Savage Divide.  I've also got some good quality melons which are all organic.  My razorgrain is just okay but I'm not too concerned since they aren't in season yet.
---
The tire one from the raider scabber bundle goes nicely with everything too, except ironically the raider scabber outfit which clips on the shoulders.
---
What happened?
---
I was actually able to snap this garage door onto the prefab only once.... then my server crashed and it wasn‚Äôt there again lol it just works
---
You can't apply mods to it - you can try to craft (you have the option), but it won't take.
---
Yea they are a lifesaver sometimes but I'm not sure if they are affected by carry weight perks
---
I started playing around the same time you did and I kept unlocking the same strength perk cards cuz I stupidly thought I could have like 10x strong backs üòÖüòÖ haven't heard of perk scrapping but that would be super cool
---
FWIW, that's similar to what I've seen.  Long range plinking at the end of your range does very little.  Point blank while she's hovering or swooping appears to give more, possibly approaching full on-ground damage with ballistic weapons.
---
And my intent isn't to attack bloodied builds just to say that there is a large enough discrepancy to show a little love to the high health beyond just Vanguard's. All of the stacking effects on low vs high is largely favoring low. I'll play team medic if I can get something back in the mix, vs just taking lower defense numbers and only giving the favor to my team, in combat self heal is cool but maybe a temp buff from the heal to my team, a simple +1 to a couple stats for a period cause I healed or maybe my health buffs for healing. Its hard to wanna stay high versus just giving into the trend and going low health when the upside is just a single set of armor. Everything else that helps high health is just as usable to low health (Healing Factor, ricochet, vampires, etc.)
---
Oh I see, I just bought it but haven‚Äôt tried it yet
---
Bethesda moved the backpacks location on your characters back with the "Backpack vanity update". Basically all the backpacks are now located at the same spot on your back, as they are just skins now and not different backpacks.
---
The update caused a lot of bugs that still haven't been fixed... Some of the backpacks like the Red Shift backpack now clip through your characters spine and shoulders.
---
Hopefully bethesda fill tweak some of the backpacks spots one day...
---
Had the same issue and scrapped it again immediately.
---
Hope this post get noticed and we‚Äòll get it fixed soon
---
I‚Äôm a hoarder. I‚Äôm sure I can figure out a few more bottles.
---
Could be worse, they could be stuck in a bundle for 1500 atoms that consists of junk you don't want.
---
I used to run a melee build and I would carry around a Gatling plasma for the big bois such as sheepsquatch and SBQ and then had a handmade for back up if a mob started chasing me at Whitesprings and such.
---
Don‚Äôt forget a camo one too! Can‚Äôt get enough camo and ghillie in the magical world of fallout
---
LOVE the rifle, great job :)
---
Small ones are for outside water but give the lowest yield. If you don‚Äôt want to be by water though they‚Äôll do a job. 
---
Others need water yes.
---
Commander Daguerre‚Äôs headaches are contagious. I get them every time she mentions them
---
My thoughts exactly. I don't expect this game to be around in 2 more years.
---
Seriously, I don't even expect "Lover's Embrace" anymore, but this bitch won't stop nagging when I get home.  When I go to bed, I can't even get "Well Rested" anymore.
---
It does take more XP to get a level up, but you‚Äôll be finding top level enemies more, so it should pan out fine.  Hit the high level events with other players and you should move along quickly.  
---
Join Build teams for more intelligence.  This provides more XP for everything, even cooking.  Sleep and cranberry cobbler for a 10% XP boost.  Cranberry Relish boosts that to 15%.  Scorchbeast Brain gives +4 intelligence I think.  Brain Fungus soup.   Lots of ways to boost XP rate.
---
I would invest in a 1 Star and 3 star version of each cards. Playing all 1 Star cards gets you 30% extra damage instead of playing one 3 star card for 20% damage.
---
i managed to surround my current camp with an entire grove and i still never even reached that close to half way on the build budget, and keep in mind this is talking about *almost* fully fortifying a ring/wall of close together trees to form a grove around *almost* all of my camp. if you want trees for whatever purpose, they are very much worth the atoms.
---
Honestly just five corn and five razorgrain so I can keep the punch bowl stocked with ‚Äòshine.
---
Also incisor. Get talons mutation and twisted muscles too.
---
Congrats man
---
It all plays out over time.....
---
Totally agree. Wish we had the UA/Outfit option for all types of UA.
---
A Vault suit as casual Outfit and i‚Äòd be happy.
---
You can collect 50+ dirty waters during the drink animation and its 0 rads making it the best water device in the game but I also once thought it was terrible but I was wrong
---
A paddle ball should always be your sidearm
---
From the purchase price of the game.  Free future content was a selling point they used to get their sales.  I am under no obligation to keep spending any more money after that, especially considering the lack of actual content and the bugged state of the game almost 2 years later.  If this was a free game, I likely wouldn't care about all that, but it's not a free game.  If they can't retain a playerbase, it sounds more like the game is lacking something, which is their problem.
---
Too clean. Roll around in dirt/mud for about an hour and you'd be perfect.
---
It happens every so often....really hard to tell what might be the root cause.
---
I've had it happen a handful of times, out of hundreds of launches.
---
Cliffs directly above the Freak Show/ Allegheny asylum. Cranberry Bog, the Mire and the Savage divide as well as the Fissure prime nuke spot in 1 photo.
---
Also the Pylon next to bog town, the Rockhound, the entrance of vault 76.
---
I though assaultrons had instakill in fo4? So did deathclaws.
---
This happened to me once.   It's like it didn't register me for the event.     
---
Today, it happened with Awol.   I had to FT away, and then FT back to the event.  It's like we need to check if the event is actually showing up under "Events" to make sure we get the rewards.
---
You can also do this in Nuke Zones to infinitely gather materials for Stabilising Flux.
---
It's a bug in the game that deals with normal everyday weapons, Fire Rate, and Legendary effects and no one knows how it is really working. Hence "Magic Weapon". If they Deleted them they would have to Delete half the Weapons in the game.
---
They update the atom shop on Tuesdays except for some sale items during the week
---
may want to check out adrenal reaction mutation, you have to run low health but you can actually do up to 150% damage, even with all 3 ranks of commando maxed out and using 9 points in perception, you are only getting 60% more damage.  
---
it seems lower level i really focused on damage perks like commando and rifleman but once your higher level or get unyielding armor or have a good legendary weapon you should be able to do plenty of damage without having any perk cards equipped
---
Great costume.  I would definitely snipe with my Gauss (for the sneak bonus) if i saw you walking in the distance on the torn up road I was following to Watoga.
---
Stay safe dweller
---
I'm still saving up for the bundle of last week so I don't mind having a week with less interesting stuff
---
Maybe, but still love me them crickets and their delicious Waste Acid. 
---
Don't judge what I eat breh.
---
Whitesprings can yield at least 15 flux from just one pass-through of the ghouls and plants.  
---
I do SE for the flux too, but it sure isn't as productive as WS.
---
PS4 :/ thank you though!
---
It used to hit 50% and stop that went on for some time, eventually it would jump to complete.
---
something else too you may just want to invest in rank 1 of each commando perk at first, thats +10% for each one, so thats +30% for 3 points.  alternatively, if you were to spend 3 points and max out one of the commando perks thats only +20% damage
---
Go figure right...
---
I dunno if I have that one,I got the free states &amp; an arktos one,but I think I may have missed that one.
---
I‚Äôll have to keep an eye out for next time it hits the shop.
---
Edit:spelling/f‚Äôin autocorrect.
---
Good point. I guess just fix it ffs lol
---
The weindego event is next week idk about a full update
---
I use them to make a thick defensive wall in nuclear winter
---
Ahh man, I'm on ps4 unfortunately, thank you though
---
* Bloodied unarmed stealth (one hit kill)
---
* Bloodied Stealth Commando (a few bullets)
---
* Bloodied explosive or faster firerate heavy weapon
---
* Any magic heavy weapon (aim for the torso) as long as you can take it out before if fires its laser
---
I've been playing the game since beta and have over 1600 hours played. T-65 requires no effort or RNG really. I just recently got Ultracite Calibrated Shocks from a Scorchbeast during Line in the Sand and Targeting HUD from the Queen a few days later. 1600+ hours potentially vs 8 weeks max.......
---
Thanks for that addition, nearly forgot about that!!
---
I feel it but just because I don‚Äôt use gunsmith. I use gunsmith 1 Star and 5 star demolition perk cause I go for power... my junk takes a big hit tho...
---
You're welcome. I hope it was helpful in some way!
---
I'm on PS4. Thank you for this info though!
---
Ok love the rifle, the wear on it is amazing. I like that you stayed true to the game with that one metal armor piece. All in all it‚Äôs a great cosplay that you can keep refining, and adding too. Congrats vault dweller.
---
Are you sure you aren't playing Animal Crossing üòÇ
---
C‚Äômon, everyone knows about Cop A Squatter by now, surely. I figured there might be a lore reason that unequips my Wedding Ring when I put on my Brotherhood Knight suit is all.
---
Dig it ya‚Äôll!
---
The more you know
---
Depends on the grind you want to chase, but fair point.
---
I'd say it depends on your build but keep in mind you can use gatling plasmas and lasers without the need of str perks to ease the weight of ammo. Those use the int one, batteries included.
---
Yup, I have one it's great. That bear arms is a god send. I carry a bunch of heavy weapons
---
They could fix it if they knew how the game was letting it happen n the first place. That is the problem.
---
I know that dog. Its a static spawn and doesn‚Äôt work as a camp pet.
---
Settlers because why raid a gold vault for a faction that would make its content completely worthless? Even though the approach changes after getting in, the initial background of the Raiders is absolutely senseless. Also the raiders team is a pain in the ass and I would kill Jonny if I get the chance that lying untrustworthy POS.
---
I am on ps4. Thank you though! Appreciate it.
---
Your build is what‚Äôs most important although I will note the SBQ  negates all explosive damage.
---
I'd say t60 is the most economic to craft and repair.
---
I feel like it‚Äôs a trap
---
I hardly ever do this event.  My experience is everyone wants to kill ghouls for leggos and the people gathering ore are stuck doing only that so we can finish the event.  If I show up and I‚Äôm the only one collecting I usually leave.
---
Shotgun to just use in VATS and it will wreck if it has bashing damage or VATS hit chance legendary effects. Doesn‚Äôt even matter what the primary effect is.
---
I love you and simultaneously hate myself.
---
When I can one shot a level 91 glowing death law with max shotgunner perks thats garbage.
---
I feel like you're ungrateful for advice.
---
That is by no means reliable. YMMV. Nowhere is really. I've done 3 full passes of WS before and gotten not a single HRF, and very few of everything else. I've also gotten a lot from one run. 
---
The XP, the repair kits, and the best place for crimson/violet flux trumps most other drop spots easily, especially if you use primed guns. Depends what flux you want and WS is by no means the be all and end all to make it definitive. 
---
Nowhere is that reliable unless you farm the shit out of it, and I did all my WS farming back when it was gameable and actually fun with like 20 legendary drops a circuit. 
---
These days, it's boring as sin and not that productive.
---
Cool ty
---
Be on the lookout for nuclear briefcases too. Ive found a couple.
---
dont forget to tip your fedora afterward
---
Maybe he‚Äôs Kellogg‚Äôs Dad
---
So many things I don‚Äôt know about you‚Äôve just told me! It‚Äôs just time to grind then
---
Inside the storm?
---
Did you check under all the furniture?
---
heavy gun is the exact same build (in special point). so you can go easily for hv. just change some cards
---
It only happens to bloodied builds. I‚Äôve only had it twice and both times I had a lot of rads or low hp
---
Yea sometimes I'll spawn on the edge and go into the fire. And see what i can find.
---
It's all those things but the loot drops for the first couple years are crap.
---
Yep. Way back when we got the ability to turn on damage numbers I realized her damage resistance doesn't change when she's flying.
---
Really not sure how this kind of misinformation keeps getting spread.
---
I found mine a while back just past the steakhouse with the supermutants
---
It's fun to do and can really pay off. I never found a briefcase but the landscape looks really cool while you're in there.
---
Horde events are also a good way to farm.  Just don‚Äôt kill the alpha.  Finding a cricket, Yao, or a snallygaster all give you good amounts of acid
---
Yea the briefcase i found was deep in it. I died on my way back out with it.
---
pipe is... life.
---
I would agree that the offsets are all over the place.  On my Metal Armor, the Secret Service backpack sits quite low, whereas the Black Shovel is quite high (as it always was).  The Jangles Backpack I unlocked from the Legendary Run clips quite a bit into my back - I assume it's mostly a copy-paste of the Mr. Pebbles backpack from earlier.
---
every time.
---
So, still no love for the Mole Miner Gauntlet? üòî
---
Had 2 weekly completes, just like last week.  Guess I can count myself lucky.
---
With kindness
---
I can make ya a witch outfit on PS4, along with anyone else
---
Pipe is indeed life!
---
Keep them. If you have them equipped your weapon reloads will be super fast.
---
Great job, totally got the looks. The rifle is beyond amazing
---
Oh is that why reload was light lightning the other day...
---
You mean the one thats in Angry Turtles YouTube video posted a few hours ago?
---
Also they can't/won't do anything to help! Have a nice dayüôÇ
---
I thought about bikes too but I just dont think they could work. Take cranberry bog. How awful would that be to traverse in any vehicle. I couldnt imagine. The only road through the swamp is really bad, and the mountains are very jagged.
---
It would be fun to have, but I dont see it coming anytime soon
---
Dude you keep making these. You‚Äôre a champ! Always lovely to The browse The goods when you aren‚Äôt online &lt;3
---
Lost two weeklies this week, same as last week.  Was not logged on during reset.  Logged in 4 hours after.
---
Friended you.
---
Shotguns pair nicely.  But that won‚Äôt prevent the level 500s from killing at range.  Best to have a good rifle as a backup.  I sort of ruin a hybrid build. Spec‚Äôd for melee but found myself missing out unless I used a gun.  Opted for a shotgun/rifle build.  Can still perk load out for melee if I want to as I have 14 points in STR.  
---
I don‚Äôt have it yet, but the Gauss Shotgun might compliment nicely too
---
Yup, thats the reason why i was asking the question. I already hit lvl 100 in legendary run and used up the fireworks because i thought they were useless lol. I was wondering if you can trade them at all but it turns out you can't.
---
1200 if you want both SS underamor and armor camo skins!
---
If it spawns, in the Appalachian Antiques. Either on the bottom or top floor :)
---
Outstanding detail and creativity!  Truly talented
---
This is true, however quite time consuming waiting for the next wave. Another player could come by and end the event too by killing the alpha. To still get the reward from these events I recommend bashing the alpha with the butt of your gun before farming the mobs. This ensures you still get the legendary loot as well as the event reward, other wise you get nothing--- you must damage the alpha to receive any reward.
---
Irrelevant, they could have made the server wait for a load complete message from every client then send out the unlock player controls message to everyone. This way the time difference between two players gaining control of their character would be negligible.
---
Have an upvote for weighing it in flamingos
---
no worries. If you're really looking for it, I'd suggest farming the traveling Responder Vendor Bot that spawns near Charleston Station. If you run south of the station over the train tracks toward Charleston Trainyard and then back toward Charleston Station there is a random spawn that will sometimes be the Vendor Bot.
---
The vendor bot always sells the Nuka-Cola clock and Cuckoo Clock plans and rare outfits including the hunter's longcoat, tattered field jacket, clean rangers outfit, clean spacesuit and spacesuit helmet, and the halloween witch costume and skeleton costume (I'm sure there are others, but I've gotten all these from there).
---
If the spawn is anything other than the vendor bot, server hop and try again. Some times I've had an hour+ of server hopping before I got the vendor, other times I get him after 2 hops.
---
Good Luck!
---
Yup same. I use the other door now lol
---
My 1h melee packs a lightweight Gatling for SBQs when it's good to deal some decent range damage. Effective out the box but if you switch over just 3 Strength perks (or more if time allows) its good to go in seconds with a nice +60% boost. The Gatling is also a surprisingly effective sniper, no big zoom but far more accurate if you snap shoot single rounds.
---
"HOURS" lol
---
I think  I have mine at \*3 and it's a nice balance honestly
---
When it auto completes, do the challenges disappear, or are they listed as complete?
---
Someone put a link on here to a spreadsheet of where people should ideally be up to. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs 55 or something like that.
---
I wish everyone planted gourd for me to use. I only have my one carrot, and it's for looking at.
---
My weeklies weren‚Äôt auto-completed, they just disappeared. What do I do?
---
I just took the door off...
---
Don‚Äôt buy anything when it comes out.  Everything comes back at 20-50% off eventually.  Patience will get you all the same stuff with a portion of the cost.
---
I always thought it was pretty quiet already
---
Same üí© different day
---
Can you use butcher's bounty in it?
---
But ultracite and t-51b offer better stats IMO
---
If you're on PC, go to c:\users\YOURUSERNAME\Documents\My Games\Fallout 76 and edit your fallout76prefs.ini file.

---
Gunsmith has no effect on some weapons at the moment, I equip rank 5 and my Gauss shotgun breaks after 1 run of Whitespring and West Tec, after being repaired 200%
---
There is a glowing red bit which sometimes makes me wonder if they have specifically moved their crit zones. They do uncripple which is pretty cool.
---
It is time consuming, but the cricket one is really easy - especially paired with stealth.  Having a private server helps too.  
---
Havent tried the syringer trick, but sounds like you‚Äôre only killing a fly at a time.  So a few flies a minute?  Seems equivalent to killing the 3 spawns that show up every 30 seconds or so 
---
You‚Äôre technique would work any time though and not require the horde.  So that‚Äôs a plus üëç
---
No, there is a constant hight pitch turbine noise.
---
Alas I'm on Xbox so I can't manipulate things. Thanks though.
---
I did wonder about that
---
Thanks. Haven‚Äôt done his quest line yet as he is just chillin at my camp serving me frozen daiquiris.  Looks like I know what I will be doing next
---
I didn‚Äôt know they uncripple that‚Äôs pretty radical
---
Don‚Äôt use the pentabarrel, it uses more ammo and gives less DPS. Use tri barrel
---
I would say the bloodied is the best, then the executioners and then the 2 shot
---
I've been playing since day one. And never touched a NW match. It doesn't fit my role-playing.

I've decided to go for a post Apocalyptic hermit, with a strange set of survival skills. He gets everything right, but perform terrible wrong, but still goes right in the long run. How about you, guys?

Previously lasted weeks....
---
I have a level 45 Plasma Gatling but minimal ammo for it and don‚Äôt think I can make the ammo quite yet.  Are Gatling guns level capped at 45?
---
Yes, but unless you are near it, it isn‚Äôt noticeable.
---
They're all worthless as far as price goes because you can't sell them. They're "worth" 120 scrip altogether. The best one is the Bloodied, but the Executioner's is not a bad deal either. The TS one is meh..
---
Haven‚Äôt seen a Plasma caster yet. Is that a random drop or a quest reward?
---
Same is true of nuke zones, wouldn't want one of those in my camp either lol :-)
---
Hey there! We've got this on our list to be addressed. I don't have an ETA for a fix yet but will let you know when I get one.

How're they supposed to know it's an exploit and not a buff? - it's not like those things have any other use whatsoever, guessing that yet another bug was actually the intended effect isn't beyond belief
---
ouch. if it helps, you seem to have a lot of company today.
---
It's actually a very quick process once you get the timing down right the turret does all of the work. You don't need to switch weapons besides the initial brahmin kill. You can spawn a fly about every 5 seconds or however long it takes for the turret to acquire its target.
---
Theres not always horde event and this is a tip for players of all level. You don't have to leave your camp or do anything special besides initial setup. You can equip happy camper and just sit there and vats and shoot while watching Netflix or something.
---
It's pay for cosmetics or pay to win. Bethesda needs to keep the game monetized so they can keep the servers running. Would you rather they lock valuable content we rely on for the core of the game behind microtransactions?
---
I have also found the pipe outside of Watauga. Pipe is life!

yes, how silly of me. equipping a thing bethesda made is an exploit. by that logic, bethesda used the exploit themselves... is placing my camp an exploit? is walking an exploit? is there a way to NOT use an exploit in this game?
---
Last night all the robot attack waves came out but the prep did not progress then suddenly it finished and I was able to launch, variations of this has happened a few times.
---
I absolutely love the cosplay, but maybe you should consider contacts or get an old pair of glasses to rough up? I feel the glasses are *too* pristine for being post-apocalypse. I love the rifle though!
---
Ah alright, then it's some weird unrelated isse that allies and pets stay outside the circle then
---
My biggest issue is we are telling them what we want for our camps, in my case I want a big display case with more than 4 slots. But they continue to ignore what the players are actually wanting.
---
Aside from all the standard strength Shotgun Perks, Skeet Shooter helps IMO and Gun Fu. I use the Gauss Shotgun and love it, it might miss a 95% shot of a target right in front of you but it can also blast that bloatfly a mile away that‚Äôs behind a tree with a 1% hit chance
---
Me too
---
Wise words, sadly we don't know when it will come back either. Big Game Hunter bundle is right up my alley but idk when it will come back.
---
uh oh
---
Thats the DLC we've been waiting for
---
I guess the elder as it‚Äôs the last one you can learn, but it takes time and lots of tech data to get there.
---
Being able to customize your flora for your camp is nice.  I camp in areas that could use extra green and whatnot. I think it's worth it.
---
Yeah the tech is there. It's just that they've painted themselves into a corner by making a combined six levels of Charisma perks related to animal taming. They coul change them to pacifying only, I suppose

---
According to this post this doesn't happen anymore.LMFAO!
---
What rolls on yours? I‚Äôm wondering if particular rolls are more bugged than others.
---
If someone gave it to me, can I still find the other paint jobs that came before it?
---
Should definitely be a new First benefit, if there‚Äôs unique tents I dont see why no scrapboxes.
---
It‚Äôs not the loading screen. As Ward would say ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the principle‚Äù
---
Damn, was hoping for the helicopter PA
---
heh- I have two warnings on the [beth.net](https://beth.net) forums for naming and shaming Nuclear Winter cheaters :P
---
I can tell you this, the forum mostly is monitored by volunteers\\interns in the respective offices split up by time zones.  And yeah it can be pretty subjective- someone probably reported you which is how they saw it.
---
I reported the bug to the CMs when I saw Turtle's video and they were already well aware of the thing.  But they don't really control when those things get fixed so ... yeah, best you can do is inform them
---
and don't worry about the forum ban- you get 5 :)  
---
EDIT: just so you know I ain't shitting you :   [https://imgur.com/a/sW4NCEc](https://imgur.com/a/sW4NCEc)
---
The lining is atom shop, but all the mods are still bought with gold.
---
Does it say they give a reloading buff? No, and it‚Äôs also obvious that it‚Äôs a bug. What does fireworks have to do with wearing reloading? Nothing. Absolutely nothing
---
As long as they add lots of bushes i'm okay With it hahah
---
Lolol yeah that is ideal but never guna happen. Just picture one guy standing in front of a dam with his hard had on and clipboard in hand. He notices a crack, plugs it up with his bubblegum, then walks on. Only to find another, even bigger crack. He puts 2 sticks of gum in for this bad boy. Aaaand he walks along to see some guy banging away at the damn with a hammer. He takes away the hammer, tells that guy to leave for a little bit bit but when he comes back he can have extra pay and his hammer back, then proceeds to chew the rest of his gum patching that hole. Thats all sorta an analogy for how bethesda deals with fixing their game.
---
Does the scrap one collect wood?
---
I remember walking all the way around the map just to avoid the deathclaws that are on the main road to the strip in New Vegas. We need that feeling back.
---
Not everyone knows about the tent that you only place outside the fence for dropping off scrap ;-)
---
I've heard it can prevent you from earning the previous tiered paints. You are supposed to acquire them in order to unlock the next one. There is one paint that is supposedly unobtainable now called Initiate.
---
Theres plenty of guides on here already about bos paint and tech data, you can find more information there.
---
I don't know, but when the trees have the same shitty space requirements as harvestable plants, then the trees can not be placed side by side in a way that they'll cover anything let alone protect.
---
The faster reload is a bug and therefore the abuse of it is considered an exploit
---
If you learn it, no.
---
Initiate, the lowest one, which has become legacy and can't be acquired anymore except from someone who already knows the plan (or, for some reason, never learned the plan).
---
Human horde events would be interesting but personally Id kill for more NPC driven events along the lines of Radiation Rumble/Riding Shotgun
---
Yes but I just assumed it was a feature, not a bug. Either way I removed the door.
---
I am currently
---
Yeah. That what‚Äôs I have heard too. I still haven‚Äôt learned the first one as I want to get duplicate plans to sell.
---
If Bethesda wants to earn some major points with me (and others I'm assuming), the next big world boss should be a giant raging scorched Deathclaw.
---
I've found say I'm travelling to my camp it won't work but if I travel to the nearest point to my camp it will no idea why.
---
If you're going to use it in Vats, go into Vats and right back out, then back in and that should make your shot hit 1st time. I've tried it and it works for me.
---
Heck, I'm about to scrap the blue one I have set up because it takes up a lot of build budget when filled up. Sell one that you can craft fully filled using one of each bobblehead as a component, that doesn't take up much budget, and we can talk.
---
What do they have to do with anything at all? Why even give them out as a reward? so they didn't read the description or something - assuming they're purposefully spreading an exploit seems a little extreme
---
I have run into that several times.  If I have some scrap circuits to give her, or to fix it myself (I forget which), then the robot is fixed and everyone is happy, but you don't get any sort of reward for it.  I have also given her a fusion core and found out it causes the robot to explode.
---
Hey- thanks for taking this over. Sorry I kinda disappeared on everyone
---
This is how it should be
---
Stealth. And with a 50 cal with a piercing mag that gives like 20%armour ignore
---
Best thing is never report anything, just ignore it, if Bethesda choose to do anything, then up to them. They seem to be really confused and chasing their tails at the moment.
---
It's bought with good bullion once you complete the Wastelanders dlc. It's not too expensive compared to other things you can buy with gold bullion and works similarly to the Gatling gun, in that it's single shots with higher damage.
---
I'm not even tripping off that. My issue is starting it 7 minutes early with nobody there and turning on the SAM and turrets that'll eat up most of the xp and assure that there are half as many bodies to loot.
---
I thought they did have negatives and they just weren't listed.
---
I have this happen every single time idk why I deal with it.
---
Yeah it takes a lot of patience and it‚Äôs not for people that suffer serious fomo.  Somethings do take months to come back around.
---
I usually wait to make any type of purchases and watch for feedback either in a discord or on here before I decide.
---
Didn‚Äôt know for the selling, sh*t. Thanks !
---
I think it's a great mechanic. If you want to carry more stuff it makes you a squishier target. If you want decent carry weight with no drawbacks just craft a standard.
---
I think the "point" of the high cap BP is to throw it on after farming to get to your destination, I don't think it  was to be a full time thing. We all just have hoarding problems and I'm guilty of it too.
---
At level 54 he might just not understand the event etiquette.  Or he's just a dick.  Can you park the terminal on that one?
---
Shhhhh. Let's not bring up how OP the new mods are. They'll just nerf them like everything else in this game. Lol
---
I got lucky with a Berserker roll as that‚Äôs my build
---
This isn't specific to the red rocket door.
---
It happens all the time to me in whitespring.
---
Bethesda has a very bad habit of beating up their players rather than acknowledging it's their fault. They are about the most dysfunctional corporation I've ever had the  dishonor of purchasing a game from. Sooner or later they're going to have a class action suit place against them. In Germany they had a return the money people paid for the game because it was crap.
---
/u/BethesdaGameStudios_  Obviously does not do any sort of testing before pushing out these items. They only care about the money. Some people will ask for a refund on atoms but most wont.
---
When someone with an explosive heavy weapon starts killing everything instantly I just swap to my bloody explosive 10mm and tag everything as fast as I can. I'll just use some common ammo, do no real damage and let them feed me XP.
---
is this post satire? if so it's spot on! if not, somewhere a child has lost their balloon :-(
---
My guess is he just doesn't know. "Park the terminal" that is a term I'm not familiar with.
---
I'm just waiting for more playable content, so i got a reason to use my hard earned grind.
---
Yes. You can also keep using all the junk in your scrap box, you just can't add anything new.
---
Oh nice.
---
Railway rifle the brains out of their heads
---
The same thing happens to me every time I first login to the game and for the life of me I do not know why. It usually fixes itself after a brief period of time though. I gave up trying to figure it out.
---
Very nice! No Super Mutant or feral ghoul is safe!
---
LOL. I always start it right away. Need a head start to get some tags in.
---
Neither am I but from context maybe he means enter the terminal so nobody can active it until you say so I.e when more then you and a level 54 are at the event
---
The laser rifle and armor are absolutely amazing.  Truly, one of the best Fallout cosplay outfits I've seen.
---
It would be awesome to have something like that in game. 
---
What if they obtained the legendary effect of the weapon or armor that they drop once they attacked?
---
Of course that would mean it would have to be the same effect for everyone, but still random rolls beyond that
---
Just under Monongah mine there's a rail track with two small crates and a medium crate as a constant spawn then down the hill there's a small mud slide with 2 more small and another medium crate.
---
That's what I got from that as well. Honestly not a bad idea. I wouldn't have had time on this one, little fucker was fast. I'll definitely keep that in mind for the next one.
---
I've experienced this bug as well and could never find the cause. The "solution" is to buff your STR even higher with chems, booze, or perks. 5-10 more carry weight should do the trick.
---
Ask for refund. The item is broken so it justifiable. Chances are you get to keep the skin too
---
Did you ever get this figured out? It said you bought it in may I would message Bethesda and also include the screenshot of the receipt and they‚Äôll sort it out pretty quickly their customer service is pretty good
---
I disagree. With the amount of grind it takes to get higher end items or functions in this game, they should feel like rewards not punishments.
---
Like why does the secret service armor not have deep pocketed available on all pieces? If we have to grind for so long to get these things, they should feel beneficial, op even, considering the level of grind that Bethesda finds acceptable.
---
I got a flaming compound bow for just such occasions.
---
If there was a thing Beth aught to be annoyed at this is it - not only did you potentially cheat them out of buying atoms, You also don't have to log in and get forced to look at the atom shop for the next few months. If they are as greedy as everyone knows they are, they would crack down on this even though they never fix bugs or anything important to game play...
---
I didn't even know the turrets and Sam reduced the XP. Whoops
---
Repair maybe but you can get a free full set of ultracite which is hard to beat
---
I love that fight, it‚Äôs probably the toughest little encounter I have these days, gotta use the terrain to your advantage.
---
I haven't had it happen even once. I also don't have the fast travel bug. I play nw often, and I stay logged in during resets. Or not. Maybe it's bloodied?
---
Additionally, MODUS should offer to make our mutations more permanent (like starched genes) for 2000 bullion and the same to unstarch that set. Perhaps this level is the one that interacts with mutant armor and results in visible change. Allows for two layers of mutations for dedicated mutants (temporary and bound).
---
The classics never go out of style
---
At level 54, he could be a new player. From his perspective, he‚Äôs just completing the event objectives. He probably turned on the turret because he needs help to fight scorchbeasts. Things like waiting before starting events are courtesies that players eventually pick up; at least, that‚Äôs how it was for me. Nothing you described was too horrible.
---
Yup, you claimed it in the atom shop, all emotes, badges, outfits stay with you. Scrap box as well, you'll be able to use what's in there, but won't be able to add anything. dunno about survival tent, if it stays, probably not.
---
I think he is from a vault... He's actually an agent from 79. He can't really disclose which vault he came from for obvious reasons.
---
He's also got a bunch of fancy plans and is assisting AC in recovering all the gold bullion that got taken from the vault.
---
I am on PC, I play from Australia so I might not see some of your CAMPS.
---
Unfortunately. I expected it to be powered like the garage door when i bought it.
---
It happened the same way to me. Support replied that with Patch 21 the issue will be 100% fixed and they'll announce what they intend to do  to compensate users who got affected by the bug.
---
Honestly it would have been so much quicker to just give out the atoms to level up with as compensation for the lost SCORE.
---
Something is definitely up with carry weight these days. I've lost around 40 pounds of availability recently and I can't figure out why.
---
Yeah, read the note on the table in the office trailer where he‚Äôs been mostly sitting at. It‚Äôs his diary. The dude is kind of messed up.
---
Unfortunately they added a change a while back that allows you to access a terminal even if another player is using it. It pops up a weird PA HUD type terminal screen. I think this change was added when they introduced backpacks to allow many players to access exam terminals when everyone was rushing to get BP unlocked.
---
Are you sure they knew you were even there?
---
RN?
---
I have played FO76 almost exclusively as a single player.  I do not play for hours on end, but will occasionally play for a couple of hours here and there.  I have not found it to be too difficult.  I am at level 83 now.  
---
I do enjoy it much more now that Wastelander‚Äôs has been introduced.  It feels more like the older games.
---
A tip for getting plans and recipes.  Go around to player vending machines and you can pick up things cheaply, depending on how they have them priced.  
---
Enjoy the game.
---
The tent does not stay.
---
Can they not just split the computing power? Offload some of it onto the xbox itself and some on the server. Make them temp files so that when u leave the games they are erased or made unusable and overwritten so that space can be used when it needed next. Although I kinda feel like they would screw that up too.
---
I'm not sure that I can conclude from your post that the player doesn't know how it works.  It may just be that they have a different style of play from yours.
---
Not everyone is all about getting as much XP as possible, or calling in more bodies to loot, or "sharing" the event with other players.  Some are more straightforward.  The game says *"You gotta go here and do this thing"* so they go there and do that thing.  They're not worried about trying to game the system for maximum rewards; they're just playing the game as presented.
---
He kept doing the 'follow me' emote I assume in response to my bo and angry face emotes so he either knew I was there or was calling to other people. Either way he wasn't waiting for shit.
---
The daily challenges for the Legendary Run reset at noon Eastern time, every day.  The weekly challenges reset at noon Eastern time on Tuesday, every week.  If the time that the weeklies disappeared was around noon Eastern time, then that is when they are supposed to switch to the new week.  However, you should have seen a new set of weeklies to start working on.  I know you said you are scared to log in, but you should probably log in to see if you have new weeklies to start working on.
---
Some players don't have time to waste waiting for someone to *maybe* show up.
---
No, it was this week‚Äôs weeklies that disappeared, less than an hour ago.
---
I don't remember seeing him before freeing the SS members from the vault, but I know for a fact people in Foundation were mentioning someone else who lived there that came from a vault before I ever even entered 79. Samuel is just a poser.
---
That's a very valid and good point.
---
Heeeeeeyyyyyy I could buy it? Waddyawant?
---
Sadly, house cats have such a small amount of health, they will die instantly if a mole rat breathes on them. I even had a tamed deathclaw that was nearly killed by a few bloodbugs before I frantically logged out to save it.
---
 It definitely could have been a glitch in your case, but it's still nearly impossible to keep a low-level creature alive for more than a few days.
---
I'm on xbox. You sure you want this? Like, really?
---
I have a legendary mirleurk king and I'll never move my camp because it's the only legendary tame I found in 800+ hours
---
Scrip fodder. I've had one and although you'd expect the inherent damage and explosive effect would make it a good back up for low level areas it's badly hampered by a low firing rate, awful reload, and the two shot effect might as well be called Random Accuracy. It's basically unsellable and I much prefer a souped up pipe pistol.
---
If you want someone to give you a readers digest im on ps4 and haply to help. Egroegy is my psn name
---
100% agree with you there. I'd say the SS backpack and the responders backpack are the best ones on the atom shop. I usually wear the blue ridge one though tbh. Give us more bags dawg
---
Nope. Only fissure sight prime spawns SBQ.
---
Damn. Ps4. Sorry bud
---
Trees are nice but I think you'll only be able to place them far away from each other because.. decoration system. I only bought a plant on a barrel and a lamp because I always wanted them. I loved the other pack with plants much much more, put those everywhere in my camp along with green deathclaws guarding my camp.
---
Maybe they just wanted to complete the event, which can be done solo, and don‚Äôt care that other people just want to farm XP
---
I get that but what about the other BP mods? All of the other like armored, insulated, lead lines, refrigerated all reduce the BP carry to 30.
---
Check it out though, if you don't wear a backpack at all, no penalty but no bonus. This whole game is about trade offs and it's supposed to remind you NOT to horde. The purpose of some of these mechanics is to find what works best for you in certain scenarios. If there were no drawbacks in some these things then every one would all feel compelled to do the same thing, the system also creates diversity.
---
Should've aimed for the head!
---
Oof. Sorry for you too.
---
Didn't they fix that a few patches ago? I used to do exactly that, but at some point it stopped working. Is that method working again?
---
I believe you, but I think your link just shows people their own accounts page, it did for me anyway
---
How much acid does this yield per hour?
---
Inspect the item I thought mine had worked but it hasn't it crafted like it had but it not worked.
---
Right now
---
Yeah that was my thought. Just wanted a second opinion. Thanks!
---
Dumb question from a semi-noob what is TSE?
---
Exactly. Maybe it's the mutation isotope that's causing it? Who knows
---
No, not horrible at all. Just a minor inconvenience actually.
---
OH!  Sorry, but I did not know what time it happened.
---
You may be correct, I'll have to verify later today.
---
Huh every time it happens it always and I mean ALWAYS leaves two incomplete.. wonder if that means anything
---
There is literally no way NOT to use this "exploit" if you equip the thing and then go on about your business using your gun. It's like eating or walking in the game...
---
Two Shot Explosive. Valuable legendary effects.
---
It has to be that event was push from last update for the future one
---
That's a weird thing to shorten.
---
To the right biuld it's nice but the roleplaying people are few and far between so it might take a while to get ride of it
---
Doesn‚Äôt use ss mods uses casual ones
---
Don‚Äôt be sorry! I should have clarified. I‚Äôm just upset I missed out on an easy level or 2.
---
don't equip weapons, and kill robots
---
Power armor punch liberators?
---
Yes, yes they are. Businesses want money. Wouldn't you?
---
First, I‚Äôm only about 400 in.
---
What I‚Äôve done is take a high str character, equip a weapon and drop it to get bare fisted, then go to whitespring where the mischief night ended.  In the corridor between that area and the spot where the squirrels spawn are 2 robot generators.  Clear everything out in the area then hang out here and punch robots.  The handy‚Äôs are easy, the protectrons are a bit tougher but equip ninja and other damage boosting perks outside of weapon and they‚Äôll help.
---
I just completed this a couple days ago, while using DCG, I would suggest doing multiple watoga runs for the bots.
---
I've got them all unlocked just won't craft
---
I‚Äôve always thought that a relocating prime site would have been better for this game. 
---
Using the existing site, if during a week on a given platform it gets nuked X number of times and the Queen dies then that seals that fissure.  Next week the prime site is spawned at a different location such  as the mire or the toxic valley, along with increased enemy spawns.
---
Hmmm strange.
---
Wait what?  I had to go through 100 legendary modules to get a full Unyielding set.  I'm not doing it again Bethesda.
---
Nah not that way, I mean proper pets that join you on quests or can stay at your camp
---
Good point, hadn't thought of rpers. I'm probably going to scrip it.
---
Yeah, it seems like there are too many factors to pinpoint the problem sometimes. Sometimes, I can put my weapon away and I‚Äôm able to fast travel. Other times I can walk ten feet away and be able to faster travel. Otherwise, I just fast travel to a nearby location
---
This. And I also think the engine they're using isn't really designed for online play, so my guess is the developers have to use a lot of hard work to make simple online things to work smoothly. And since they don't/can't allocate a lot of development budget to the game, we're stuck with little things that are added on. I hardly think we'll ever see any meaningful QoL updates, especially when they're about technical things.
---
what shield lining does the SS under armor use normally?
---
This is kind of what I was looking for. Thanks.
---
Ahhhh ok that does sound nice.  I haven‚Äôt acquired one of those yet.  The closest thing I have is a explosive hunting rifle.  Which is useless because the reload speed is awful.
---
This made my long 12 hour day at worth worth it. Still working but looking forward to hopping on!
---
Tesla rifle, great durability and tags everything.
---
The gauntlet works?  I‚Äôve tried that and it doesn‚Äôt increase the kill progress.
---
Yes. He's using an "exploit" and must report to the hangman's noose immediately...One of the games biggest cheer leaders and nicest guy in the world is now a criminal exploiter with this logic. Lock him up.
---
No, that can be good if you make it a .50 sniper rifle. But not worth it if it's low level.
---
+33% vats hit rate. Enjoy the carnage.
---
Same here, that's my usual "WHY WONT THIS FUCKING THING WORK" routine too.
---
Lmao DCG literally "unarmed" weapon. This game cracks me up. Thanks for the tip mate.
---
I rarely use PA anymore. I might give that a go.
---
I finally reached rank 100 but what will I do with the extra scores? Serves me for  buying them.
---
Among other things, yes!  You can get a bunch of wood wandering around too.
---
Vampire Gatling weapons. I just out-tank them.
---
inside the Whitespring there are a lot more lv 8 Mr handies that can die in a single punch. Keep a single weapon on you that can quickly get rid of the assaultron, and you'll have a much easier time inside the hotel than waiting near a bot stop machine outside.
---
33% VATS chance seems to be a ‚Äòmagic‚Äô effect.
---
Would have been even nicer if the lunchbox bug didn't ruin it. Got hit with that again last night when some asshole opened five of them on purpose at SBQ just to bug everyone there. Going to just avoid popular events till they patch that.
---
do the quest that turns watoga robots friendly and then just server hop watoga killing them until its done until its done. time consuming but if you are determined you can get it.
---
After the unarmed one there is a without weapons one. It only works if you're bare fisted.
---
Oh god no, please god no
---
I dont use anything else ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Unless you plan to make selling water a way of leaving, a couple of small ones, that don't need water, are more than enough
---
Oh :(
---
Yeah I converted it to a .50 the other day and sure it drops low level scorched and stuff but it seems low level to me.... takes too many shots and them having to reload in between... may unload it soon
---
Cman guy, it only takes 20 seconds to reload a six shot revolver. Its not thaaaat bad.
---
The purchase price of the game covers the initial development costs. Same as a single player game that has no continued development beyond bug fixes.
---
Continued development, server costs- this are all things that need to be paid for beyond the initial purchase... because they are continuing costs. Can you buy a car and then never have to pay for anything on it again? No, you have all kinds of continuing costs for it. 
---
SOMEONE has to pay for those things. Yes, you don‚Äôt *have* to... but understand that if everyone else had the same mindset as you, this game would shut down in 3 months. So realize that your continued ability to experience this game is dependent on other people being willing to spend money on things like Atoms and FO1st.
---
You're on to something tc.  I just read a classified document that says Ward works for the Clinton foundation.  Makes me wonder what these thieves really know.
---
I'm waiting for the gramophone.
---
Lmao yeah. I don't know why the loot gods gave me this of all things
---
This is exactly why i don't buy things from atom shop anymore. Everyone has it.
---
I glitched mine out to have 150 shots in the mag lmao so I'm all good
---
Same thing happened to me lately. I was so p off. I rebuild the place with new features better than the last but its not quite what it was. I really hate that bug.
---
You may not like it, but the simple thing is: this is a commercial product. You've paid money to play the game and you got entertainment in return. And you can get mad about broken promises, get frustrated about things that could be (which I totally understand and relate to), but in the end it's about getting entertained by a game.
---
All in all I think I spent about 150 euros on this game and so far got almost 400 hours of play out of it. To me, that's a lot of entertainment for my money and I'm satisfied. Sure, I see a lot of potential wasted on this game, but I don't really care. There's more to the world than just Fallout 76.
---
You actually spawn at L1 with 1/1/1/1/1/1 stats across the board. Then a second or so later your stats and level update.
---
I‚Äôve got some old radio vacuum tubes that need to be found if you‚Äôre up for the quest?
---
Care to give any more info?
---
I dont have it either. Think its a bug.
---
fusion cores, railway gun ammo, cannonballs, mini nukes, missiles.
---
All stupidly heavy.
---
Ah yes we get something for free but people still whine about it. Be happy you don‚Äôt have to pay for it.
---
So I guess everytime we kill one of those Raiders to help out Ward, we are contributing to the 'Clinton kill count'
---
look i'm not saying he's a time traveling synth meant to depopulate the region. 
---
because that would be crazy.
---
He pulled a whale out of its tail
---
The August update is on the 4th
---
‚ÄúFurthermore, other responders are correct in stating that those that have these duped weapons don‚Äôt trade them for caps lol.‚Äù
---
I can‚Äôt see any disclaimer in the above? No ‚ÄúI believe‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat I have witnessed‚Äù or ‚Äúin my opinion‚Äù, or even ‚Äúmost duper‚Äôs‚Äù just an emphatic statement. A statement with a ‚Äúlol‚Äù at the end to drive home how incredulous you believed OP‚Äôs view to be.
---
So now when you are saying ‚ÄúI never said that‚Äù what you mean is ‚ÄúI never meant that‚Äù 
---
You have yourself a wonderful evening with hubby.
---
Whaaaaaat? I'm wasting at least 3 perception points! Actually I could have level 1 three commando card (+30) plus level 1 three rifleman cards or tank killer
---
I like how easy it is. I'm different from many other gamers. I don't want to be challenged by a game. The more I die, the less I want to play. I love the power trip of one-shotting things and tanking through a room full of enemies. It's what I've always loved about Bethesda games--reach a certain level and suddenly the game is piss-easy and your character is basically a god. 
---
The power trip alone isn't enough to keep me playing for several hours a day. 350 hours in, I still haven't gotten tired of the grind for all the late game items. I got my full set of SS armor but won't stop until I have a fully upgraded T-65 PA set, a fully upgraded gauss shotgun, and an armco ammo appliance.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve done all that for every other robot challenge a while ago. This is my last one and I‚Äôm at 4/1100 complete.
---
You're ahead of the pace.
---
So....you‚Äôre upset that other people have the means to have things that they think are also cool? Yikes. Just wait until you find out other people own Fallout 76...
---
F
---
Maybe if they actually made it a full double score WEEK that includes both dailies and weeklies, then it would be better
---
Those wouldn't affect my carrying capacity, which is what I'm talking about.
---
What happened next!?!?

Peanut butter mate. Peanut butter. üòâ

---
Since patch 20...
---
The suspense is killing me...
---
This bug has been around for a while now.  I‚Äôm not sure what triggers it.
---
+4 strength! well shit, time to go and grab me the blueprints for those. Thank you
---
Super stims are good but try quantums combined with psychotats.
---
I was at one last night that some level 76 guy started solo and seemed unprepared for. He grabbed one conduit, died, and left. I only came to do damage so I was at 20 health. There was one other guy there not grabbing any conduits and getting downed repeatedly so I just popped a few radaway to go to full health (then shuffled to place my tent and drop weight so i could run again), a psychotats, and two quantums and grabbed all three conduits and downed the thing with a b2525 handmade in about 30 seconds. I don't think anyone else was firing at it. I'm still not entirely sure it's health didn't bug and drop too fast but the weapon I was using wasn't a magic one so it shouldn't have.
---
old and busted: bush wookie.
---
new hotness: nuclear storm wookie.
---
Dunno. I bought a skin I fell in love with from first look and in 3 months of playing this game I only saw it once on someone else. I mostly buy camp items and outfits that I really like tho. I don't meet many people wearing same outfits, neither do I see camps filled with same items I have. Could be just a coincidence? But I'd say it's not bad if it resulted some new friends or fun memories. not many players are ready to spend atoms on cosmetics, so I mostly see around stuff that was free especially stuff from legendary run xD
---
Considering it circumvent the whole "buy our fake money to buy cosmetics" process youd think they'd have fixed it by now then
---
Dont bother with NW unless its something piss easy, like placing your camp, you get more points by just playing adventure mode instead.
---
For example, starter island in Fortnite is the same cell?  Gulag is the same cell?
---
So if it‚Äôs literally just me fighting her, standing on my tent for the entire fight, and she still lands while I‚Äôm not using anything to stagger her, how does that make ‚Äústanding on a tent/fence‚Äù true?
---
Where is the Coca Cola bottle I can‚Äôt see it ü§î
---
I'd rather have the atoms we got before to choose what I get
---
What does casual in this context mean?
---
Oh cool, I hate free stuff and making sure no one else gets to enjoy it as well.
---
Hopefully they get their shit together before releasing clandestine versions.   Also super bummed to hear that it's a seperate suit that needs to be crafted and not just a skin.  What a waste of flux if you already have shielded SS under armor.
---
I don't even care about the plan; I just need to find someone to sell me 3 of the actual diffusers.
---
My camp budget is used up putting walls back to back so i can wallpaper both sides.
---
That's awesome, really been missing it.
---
Does leveling up your agility make you more stealthy?
---
I was thinking a randomized attack pattern, and the ability to detect stealth as well as an assaultron.  Something that would kill most players instantly.
---
Honestly I just want to see deathclaws be terrifying again. I miss the old ragdoll effect when one would hit you.  Or trying to go by the mountains in new Vegas too early and getting obliterated instantly.
---
Fertile soil event ( I think that's the name ) in the forest  region or the wood collectors just to the north.
---
Bethesda, the only company that rather tells its customers to heck off on forums instead of actually patching anything. Seriously, adrenaline, one of the communitie's favourite perks has been bugged for more than a month now. A MONTH. "BuT iT's FixEd On ThE pUbLiC tEsT SeRvEr" oh cool, THEN WHY DON'T THEY UPLOAD THIS FIX IMMEDIATELY.
---
I love free shit but usually when a company fucks up that badly they respond quickly, apparently not bethesda
---
Unless you are planning to make water for selling, then you don't really need any of the purifiers. Just doing dailies/events is enough. I sell \~40 purified water daily because i don't need it. Just from rewards.
---
I never really understood how vats worked and wanted to figure this out so i can make a good sneak build
---
Bloodied/unyielding synergizes exceptionally well with stealth. Due to stealth you can avoid having to take all of the tank perks in luck and use the damage/convenience ones instead. Then you also get that sexy 2.5x damage bonus on TOP of your already absurd bloodied bonus.
---
long way to go and many wasted hours. good luck.
---
Hm, you have a fair point. Radiation rumble is such a shame too. I can solo for level 1 rewards and get a ton of xp. I haven't tried to push to level 2 yet. But in public worlds it fails so quickly its shocking.
---
Nice idea, thanks. I'll buy the brambles today and have a portable bush system.
---
Maybe should be them who waited to release a product until it's 100% operative, as all the other brands do
---
Critical meter full = use a shot to get a guaranteed critical hit. Might have to press a keypad button (triangle on PS4) before you shoot.
---
Crit hits can do more damage, heal teammates, etc depending on weapon perks and character perks.
---
There are dozens of posts about this already. No. Nobody can.
---
In about 25-30 mins me and a couple other people are gonna do nukes, Queen's, and events so why don't you join us then?
---
Sounds cool
---
nope. we don't know why. hoping Bethesda fixes.
---
Oh I checked earlier and there was nothing yet
---
Not sure, but with armor that makes sneaking better or a Chinese stealth suit, plus there‚Äôs a perk in agility for 75% sneaking, you‚Äôll be almost invisible to enemies
---
I gladly pay the 4 flux to get camo one (when they fix it). Since i'm using ghillie SS armors. Matching set :) And it's annoying as hell when the boots are part of underarmor, not armors. Meaning when using Ghillie Armors your boots are currently wrong color. Ghillie is camo painted, and boots are the basic grey (if you use the normal ss underarmor).
---
Don't worry, I farmed it in the Mire as well for few days before i found out it's the wrong place. Just to warn you, even if trick-or-treater spawn, they might not have any or some plans at all. My first witch didn't have any plan, second had both plans, and next i found skeleton who had only mask plan... So prepare for a grind :P
---
Take Rad-x to suppress mutations. Fast Travel then works.
---
I go back and forth on the Gatling gun myself, its probably the inclusion of the Plasma Gatling/plasma Caster that made it fall off my list, though the Gatling gun is still a solid weapon. 
---
I want a grenade character to not only be viable, but a specialization worth going into -- same with medics, same with tanky support character , One handed melee should have a point, other than well you can sneak attack really fast, but you'll be one hitting them anyway, so who cares .... I was SO excited when I saw the "friendly fire perk" that I built a power armored "cleric build" (at launch) -- only to find out it breaks so FAST and ammo is SO hard to get its not worth it =/ 
---
I want this game to be what it has the potential to be, some poor design choices (most likely by a rush to completion) is all that stands in the way, they've made a lot of progress in the Year I took off, but man so much more to go.
---
Not sure if you've used the latest version but it's changed a lot. You can filter the chat a lot more.
---
It's a non issue.
---
- Yes High Capacity Backpack does decrease your Energy Resistance and Radiation Resistance by 60 points but so what?
---
- There's NOTHING in the game outside an Assaultron's Death Beam that calls for high Energy Resistance there's just not enough enemies in the game that use Energy Based attacks.
---
- You can easily make up the Energy Resistance loss if you take the Grounded Mutation that gives you +100 Energy Resistance (Scaly Skin Mutation gives you another +50 Energy Resistance and +50 Damage Resistance).
---
- You would be surprise on how easy it is to hit the Energy Resistance and Damage Resistance soft cap so even if you don't make up the loss with Mutations you will can hit the Soft cap pretty easily if you try. 
---
- Radiation Resistance? Just pop some Radaway.
---
You need a gun to cripple scorchbeast wings. Shotguns combined with the enforcer perk are nice.
---
Sadly it ain't worth much, the single action is considered by most to be the worst handgun in the game.
---
Don‚Äôt know if this is meant to be a joke? But if not, as soon as your crit meter is full, you can execute a critical hit. The faster/sooner the meter fills, the faster/sooner you can use that critical hit(in vats). I dont know if it‚Äôs true, but I heard that critical hits ignore all armor? I‚Äôm sure someone else has that answer.
---
I suppose it depends on what is fun for you. FO76 has never been about being a true tactical shooter. Blasting things with a gauss shotgun is pretty fun man, I actually spend a lot of time in the lower level areas junk and item gathering and I gain no small amount of catharsis blasting some lv 6 scorched in the face. 
---
but other than that, you gotta hit with every pellet to really be a one-shotter. harder than it seems, particularly with VATs acting up all the time. Mobs can still swarm you, Ghouls move real fast and are hard to hit. High level super mutants are still a challenge, you need to be fairly close and they can chew up your health, particularly with automatic weapons. If you are not careful even in something like Uranium Fever, a mole mine can get through and lay a smack on you. 
---
You can deal damage, but you aren't god mode or anything.  I would also say despite that 606, which I think push up a bit more if I fully min-maxed, I am more lethal fully spec'd into heavy weapons and I go with my Final Word or the brand new AA/FFR gauss mini gun I just rolled. I can hit at further range, with tighter accuracy and chew down a health bar in a blink.  Line in the Sand is a great example. I can stand on the wall and mow down wave after wave. If I run the GS, I have to be out there in the crowd, and those waves of scorched can be hard to hit on the run!
---
The mods highlight in the menu but when you craft the mod you want nothing happens.
---
It is pretty bad. I just got a decent Gauss pistol so I'm leaning more to scripping it
---
Yeah I'll get that
---
And then unicorns and rainbows appeared....and the entire player base jumped up and cheered.
---
If you want to build a big one, then yes. There's a small one that you can put on the ground. I don't need water much, but I have a few big stations next to Wayward for new players to pick up. Stay hydrated!
---
Is it just me or did Bethesda really phone it in this week? 
---
I feel like the only thing they did was do the camo texture on 2 models &amp; the cinder block wallpaper. The targets look familiar and the black bobblehead stand uses both an existing model and existing texture.
---
They arent going negative. The minus next to the number represents a penalty to the stat, not a negative. Just as a plus means the stat is getting a bonus.
---
The casual Underarmor mod.  If gives 3 int/char and something else for shielded.  It certainly has its place but is not optimal for many builds.
---
To do critical shots?
---
I would stick it in your vendors for a few days first some one will probably buy it. Maybe 1-1.5k
---
Bethesda is that friend we all have, that between two chances is always taking the more embarrassing one
---
Most of that crap is over priced.
---
I must have had a bad trip. I sniffed the pipe, and had to fight a snallygaster. I started worrying that I was going to die, or pass out and wake up on a cliff side. The pipe's got me all paranoid, man.
---
I'll try it. Couldn't hurt, right?
---
Use concentrated fire so you can do headshots consistently.
---
Pressing Y on xbox executes a critical hit when the meter is full. Several perks and legendary effects assist with Vats critical usage.
---
Long story short. Any hit in Vats fill the meter. Y button executes the shot when full.
---
I noticed this weeks ago when I got my first bunch of them and thought it was due to my speed demon serum. I'm not going to use them but will keep them equiped for the buff!
---
How about a ton of Scrip and increase max cap to say 5k or 6k? 250 scrip from the endgame boss would be nice. This way you could purchase modules for endgame item rolls.
---
visual bug? u can calculate weight capacity u have with strength 9 and check it.
---
i have 1 end and when i join the server and "herd mentality" gives me -2 i still have 1 end
---
They do. And ignore all effects. Basically a guaranteed hit for max damage depending on weapon type used.
---
Time to bring my dragon off the shelf and have some fun. Wonder if it stacks with speed demon.
---
#FingerTrick missing a finger... LMAO!!!!!
---
Before they nerfed Strangler Heart you could afk farm a specific spot where a lvl 8 robot popped out with no other enemies around. You could equip any weapon type and the acid melee range damage was considered a kill with that weapon. You can no longer do this
---
&gt;Only place I said don‚Äôt stand was ontop of V9.
---
This is a work around to prevent the game from  getting messed up.   No work around would be necessary if the game was not broken.  Which it is. And that is the real problem, not players violating your arbitrary "rules."
---
Yeah I'd be willing to. I don't have much to DPS the queen besides a Bloodied Gatling at level 20, but I can try!
---
 My GT is Creoxys. Just shoot me an invite when you're on
---
Are we able to contact across platforms? I'm on Xbox.
---
WOW! So awesome!!! Now all you need is Dogmeat, LOL!!!
---
Doing it on purpose for the explicit fact that it gives increased reload speed is one thing. You're able to unequip grenades easily so using it knowing about its ability is an exploit
---
You need to work from a larger pool than just a  few shots, but as I said vats fire doesn‚Äôt work at all. It‚Äôs not because of bloodied it is just broken. And serendipity only has a 45% chance to dodge. There‚Äôs not really much else to say than that, as I haven‚Äôt heard of any bugs with it and most players I see use it on the field see the perk work less than more often.
---
That being said, there are already a lot of differences between most bloodies and your build that have no connection to bloodies. You don‚Äôt have the dodgy or blocker perk, which would stop a lot of damage, and only a 2 pt END build without life giver or fireproof. Bloody mess would give you a 15% dmg boost to every wep, and class freak at 3* with strange in numbers would help a lot. If you‚Äôre worried about getting attacked, there are a couple mutations that would punish a melee atk and work well for high hp. That being said, your build seems really squishy, so I‚Äôm admittedly confused why you‚Äôre even going for the high hp build when you haven‚Äôt put any points into endurance stats. You‚Äôd be a lot better off just committing to bloody with that build imo. Also, the adrenaline perk is currently broken, so it won‚Äôt do anything at least until the next patch. You‚Äôd be better off replacing it with dodgy in the meantime.
---
Another thing I had forgotten to mention, bloodies can deal a lot of dmg but I doubt that if you‚Äôre seeing problems with them in pvp that is bloody related as you can only doing a max of 2k I believe, and that‚Äôs before the dmg reductions from armor and perks. 
---
Idk if you have, but I‚Äôd suggest look at a bloody build, I don‚Äôt think ppl realize how few perks cards we have that are low hp related. If you are wanting a tangier build the ones I mentioned could help a lot! Just depends on whether you want a max dmg build like you‚Äôre going for or if you want high hp
---
The idea that devs need money to keep online games running is sound.
---
The idea that all of the money they get-- or even a majority of it-- goes to the game maintenance/servers, or even development, is bullshit. It was bullshit when people used this excuse to cover Blizzard's ass while they made billions from monthly subs in WoW. It was bullshit when applied to the major studios who started to churn out their own MMOs so they too could squeeze the cows. And it's bullshit now.
---
Equilibrium is a mask to cover the priority of profit. And seeking profit is of course totally fine; except when it damages the gameplay, except when it makes the play experience worse; except when it alienates customers.
---
We have 3 forms of monetization for a game that's been struggling ever since launch to live up to its triple-A creator: cash shop, sub, and now the season grind ranks. That's an embarassment.
---
Also, you can't take a core feature of a game, like camp building, and bury virtually every new camp item behind the cash shop (or now the tedious, linear, grindy season run). I know some of you really just think that camp items are cosmetics and nothing more, but it's funny to me sometimes that you don't seem to realize that camp building is a gameplay endeavour, and camp items are like our ammunition, which means it's not just cosmetic-- it's not a reskin for your armour that you just buy, equip, done. These are items that we use to create things, for our pleasure and others', and creating those things interacts with currency systems and scavenging and trade. So getting new, interesting, functional or just aesthetically nice camp items is critical to any game that includes building. They are \*not\* merely cosmetics.
---
I'm sure you'll disagree, but the reality is what it is.
---
I want my atoms back!    
---
It's useless.  
---
And, same, you hear the crafting sound,  but it won't put the lining in.  Xbox.
---
VATS? Have you tried negative accuracy? Don't know if it's possible with the gauss, but all others become sniper guns as all pellets hit (if the shot hits).
---
Thanks for the speedy reply yo. Appreciated
---
An eye bot that plays John Denvers "Country Roads".
---
I guess it could also give you metal and electrical scrap missions.
---
Because it‚Äôs not a bug if it‚Äôs an exploit.
---
Edit: add an /eye roll for emphasis
---
Cool story.
---
It doesn't really have an 'endgame,' though, right? Because then it would change things for everyone else (ostensibly). Like, I'm guessing there's no actual cure for the scorched disease, for example. Structurally it'd be impossible to pull off.
---
Nevertheless, I am getting pulled in. I see what they were going for even before Wastelanders. It does feel like the payoff isn't there in many sites -- like the simulation vault at Vault-Tec University -- but I keep finding things to keep me going.
---
Great idea for going to player vending stores. I hadn't thought of that! Only time I went into one, I felt like trespassing and didn't really know what I was doing.
---
If they don't like people "exploiting" their bugs....and just having something equipped is not "exploiting" in my book...then perhaps they should fix their code.  Ridiculous.  What do they expect?   We get these things and are just supposed to let them sit in inventory?  Many thumbs down.
---
It messed with me a lot when I started my muty build.
---
They will fix it quite fast as it is atomshop thing, and it directly affects their money flow when people stop buying it and those that bought it demand refunds.
---
My game is doing the same thing. And it was immediately noticeable because I always stay underweight for constant fast travel. 
---
When I turned the game off, I was at my preferred workshop, had scrapped eveything, made my batches of ammo, and reduced my weight so I'd be ready to go when I played again. The next time I turned it on, I was 35 pounds overencumbered.
---
I don't take drugs or eat anything or DO anything that might increase my weight benefit, either.
---
And this keeps happening every.time. I log in. Probably for the last week or so.
---
I usually go on later, so this is the first time it's happened.
---
Punch! Kick! Block!
---
Not being able to name known cheaters and problem players always seemed dumb to me.  It might actually be helpful to somebody if I know infamous names to keep an eye out for.
---
The game isn't about tradeoffs. Armor doesn't have negative effects.  Weapons don't have negative effects.
---
I understand serums having negatives but the backpacks are dumb.
---
Ahhh yes now I remember seeing Casual in my mod list when I modded my underarmor a while ago. Thanks!
---
They fixed that last patch. Allegedly anyway, they also claimed to fix Ward from wandering and that was clearly a lie.
---
Ok I can‚Äôt mod the SS under armor I bought with gold to be camo and I can‚Äôt add SS treated lining to the camo one or what ?
---
Same. First few tries despite my absolute fear of PvP were enjoyable and I felt like I can get used to this and "git gud" someday but hackers said "nope".. got oneshot out of nowhere with some lesser gun today and instantly died wearing marine armor,didn't even let me to call for help. I mean maybe it wasn't cheating, but was suspicious, I was sitting in a bush well hidden and then some guy oneshots with a rifle and I instantly die.meh. i now queue solo to just place a camp and quit.
---
My cards are so focused through perception, agility, and luck that the others suffered as I need 5 INT for modding purposes, I am damage focused but it feels like the only way lean heavily into those numbers is bloodied and I wanted to try and do something different vs 90% of the builds of my type but the more I look, bloodied and unyielding feels like the only way to really take it to the next level. Also I was not aware of adrenaline having a bug, thanks for that bit of info.
---
A two shots explosive can be crap but it's still a two shots explosive. Also it's a light gun so you're not in a hurry to sell it as it doesn't take much stash capacity. 2000c and in a month max you'll have sold it
---
He's also an alcoholic, look at all the empty booze bottles in his office and bedroom
---
He probably tosses that stuff out the walls of foundation while shitfaced and then some random guy passing by finds it in the grass, then he asks us to retrieve it and makes an excuse cause he's too embarassed.
---
This monetization isn't bad compared to Battlefront 2 at launch, were you either play for 40 hour to unlock heroes, or staight up pay like, $100 for them. That is a predatory microtransaction.
---
The fact of the matter is that you are complaining about something that makes your camp look pretty while Battlefront 2 players had to wait a year for all heroes (that change the combat of the game) to be free.
---
This is just my opinion.
---
No sadly. One moment.
---
They should remove the bugs and crashes too, ‚Äòcause they aren‚Äôt a fun part of the game either.
---
I still have my topiaries from the first time this happened.
---
The fireworks mine? Absolutely works. I actually just posted something about this a couple days ago. The reload is insane.
---
I'll try it, thanks!
---
I'm missing three mods for the fixer/combat rifle and the handmade. I scrap and I scrap and I can't get those last three. Are those the ones you purchase the plans for? Is it like that for all weapons, the last three come from plans?
---
Edit: just read the first blue line of your chart, I think I need to buy the plans for the last three mods. It's usually night vision scopes I think.
---
That's good. Ideally I just want to get the stuff and just take a break until actual further content is released. This battle pass/waste landers was me coming back after a few months off due to grindy boredom.
---
Well the reason the camp budget exists is because the game will slow down. What I mean by this is that in fallout 4 if I built my settlement really big I would notice the game really slow down when I walked by/ near it. Now imagine a server with 10+ people on all doing this
---
We would all love it to happen but with Bethesdas outdated servers ......

Find someone on Xbox to help you. These are good people. If you're good they will treat you well. Hope Appalachia in Xbox multiverse is happy and we'll!
---
PS4 user. Never kicked someone from a team, been kicked once. I get *slightly* annoyed when someone is high level and not sharing any cards, but I just have to assume that either A)they don't have 3 Charisma, or B)They don't have any level 1 cards and have less than 6 Charisma.
---
But even then, never kicked anyone out. Only time I bail on a team is if I'm the only one left and I see another one is open with some people in it. 
---
About the only bias I have... if I saw a "Building" team with a lvl 20 and a lvl 30, and another team with a lvl 200 and a lvl 300, I would probably go to the 200/300 team.
---
I finally did the sabotage option. Took a solid 15 seconds for it to turn hostile but before it could even face her she one punched it to death with her fists. One Punch Woman.

No? How not, if Explosive stopped dropping for energy weapons in patch 1.0.5.10 and 2\*/3\*  legendaries were enabled on plasma weapons two months later with patch 1.1.0.8? So please stop kidding yourself...
---
Looks like you are ready to put one between the eyes of a super mutant before it can tell how superior they are to us weak humans .
---
Lol same. Just quickly looked over my shoulders and said ‚Äúoh..... well I‚Äôll be on my way‚Äù
---
I hope they focus their attention on the ammo converter. I press my A button tenfold the times using that, than I press A to skip past the atom store pop up.
---
Lol u sound a little butt hurt
---
I'd say no, because It doesn't exist a 50. prime versi√≥n so you'll be dealing the same damage but using fluxes for the ammo crafting
---
can you use it in Nuclear winter as under armor at least? 
---
Tired of my tighty whities :D
---
I believe the SBQ is also affected by the Hunters legendary prefix.
---
That‚Äôs another solution.
---
Don't see why they can't give out some atoms to enable you to buy the ranks you missed.
---
Corn, tato, mutfruit, razorgrain and gourd. used to have melons and blackberries because I like them irl, but removed them later because I dunno if you can do anything good with them besides some alcohol.
---

---
I bought it thinking it was a paint skin for the SS under armor, nope.. crafted it and it will not let me add the SS treated or shielded lining to it this is ridiculous
---
Its not just the servers, the game engine is really old and patched up
---
Thats one of the reasons we have so many bugs, their coding isnt really like spaghetti, more like a tangled ball of yarn, where you pull one thread and the entire things fucks up üòÇ
---
Yeah I got bad news for you about that under armour....
---
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Did you do it with 3 different accounts?
---
True. ü§£
---
been there forever as far as i know
---
Just bought them. No damage numbers. They're just posters.
---
Also, I don't know if this has been fixed, but I used to get the Herd Mentality mutation by accident. The game wouldn't tell me and it wouldn't show in my pip-boy. I'd have to cure all mutations for it to tell me that Herd Mentality was removed and then I took the serums I wanted again.
---
I have the SS under armor(the one that costs gold)  the treated and shielded SS under armor lining plans and can‚Äôt mod it ....   I‚Äôm full mad üò°
---
Yes it is.
---
Armor has plenty of trade offs. Leather is light armor and has low DR but mods are easy to acquire. Scout is great lightweight high level armor, but the mods are not craft able and you have to buy them.
---
Weapons all have negatives: recoil, reload speed, weight, weapon class specification, etc.
---
Legendary effects are all mostly positive bonuses, which is why legendary gear is the end game. There are niche situations where a legendary effect can be detrimental to your build, but I won get into that. Legendary effects are mostly positive.
---
Perks. This is the ultimate trade off category. You trade qol for more damage or mitigation.
---
This whole game is a giant balancing act. You can't have every thing and be he strongest player too, and I think that's great!!
---
Damn. Thank you for your sacrifice.
---
F , hope next season you don't have to buy anything
---
Yup - that sounds right. You can use this post to determine which mods are plans:
---
Why are you disappointed? Looks fine to me
---
If you save Athena and put her in an assaultron body she becomes a trader and may appear in your camp periodically instead of another trader. You see her once I think guaranteed at the start and then its just random. I am guessing what happens is when the game sends a trader to your camp it just does a check to see if you saved Athena and if so rolls to see which trader you get. 
---
She is no different to any other wandering trader though. She has some amusing voice lines about counting birds. After the first encounter her dialogue is gone too.
---
Also I think you need to have Sofia as your current ally to get athena in your camp. I used to see her once every few days or at least once a week but after switching to raider punk I haven't seen athena since.
---
The trees are nice I brought them like 2 months ago when the pack was back on sale however I never use them, they just require to much CAMP space requirement. I do use the asbestos roofing though.
---
Every week half of the update is already owned items and bundles.. Exciting. Oh well.
---
Two shot isn‚Äôt valuable
---
I mean if you go beserkers then maybe the SBQ fight isn‚Äôt for you. Doesn‚Äôt justify fucking up the fight for everyone else.
---
Leveled up so many times mid-Line in the Sand
---
My instigating death claw gauntlet + radicool strength enhancer  + ninja sneak damage multiplier = 2,000 points damage on the first hit.   Big, bad brutes like Deathclaws and Grafton Monster go down in one swing.    I drink from the keg of victory!
---
No, it‚Äôs definitely the fences and tents. Very very rarely she will land despite that.
---
I think they ignore a LOT. And I can't blame them for some of it, but I do blame them overall.
---
Oh i see and thanks alot for this information. I been playing fallout since its release and never understood how it worked because its different in other games i played. For example, in the division you can hit crits multiple times the higher your critical hit chance is. The crit system on fallout always confused me until i seen your comment
---
I was sifting through some old reddit and it seems that way. Im not sure if it's been changed, but they could be a contender as well. Really just unsure if the anti armor or extra 30% damage would be best.
---
Southern Ohio here, they sell the Mexican coke at Walmart, Kroger, and some gas stations. Generally about the same price as a 20oz
---
Edit: come to coke
---
As soon as I finished her story I got rid of her with no regrets. She's so annoying, I can't help it. Beckett is also a bit annoying, but then again they're just NPCs with cycled phrases, but Beckett is sorta relaxed and he always thanks me for letting him stay and says that life is beautiful and there's no other place he'd rather be, etc. He never takes any of my crafting stations right when I need them like Sophia does. Can't count times when I regretted rescuing her.
---
I just logged in for the day 5pm central on PS4 and every daily except the NW and every weekly except the repeatable and the Crit Hits (which somehow is at 10/50) are completed....Did I seriously just lose 8750 score?
---
"but in the end it's about getting entertained by a game"
---
In the end it's about navigating corporate greed to try to find a product that is enjoyable and not attempting to get in my pockets weekly.
---
I'm satisfied with what I spent in the past; I am nowhere near satisfied with the current state, the recent state, or the proposed future state. Which is why I made my post and uninstalled today.
---
Also, yea, there's more to the world than 76. But I'm not on a 'The World' reddit, right?
---
I have SS shielded and treated it won‚Äôt take the linings at all
---
Yea squirrel, chickens and beavers all can be tamed if you find the right one
---
Bethesda added it to a special loot pool from an item called Mole Miner Pails. The event with those items has ended, but people can craft you one.
---
Thanks for this information. I really didn't know how vats worked because in other games like the division i played allowed players to gain any amount of crit chance. So crits on that game can more frequently
---
The plan was a drop during Treasure Hunter event.
---
Shit i miss all that
---
Several things, but mostly these 3:
---
* Even post 50, you don‚Äôt have all the cards in all combinations you want. Super Duper, Ammo Smith, White Knight, Chemist, Pharmacist, etc. etc.
---
* It looks like spare cards and packs are going to be the conversion material for legendary perks, so some may be banking / investing.
---
* If you‚Äôre playing XP is one way you can really get ahead on the challenge board
---
The only purpose is to complete really annoying weekly SCORE challenges
---
Yes it is
---
&gt; players had every incentive to blast through it as quickly as possible.
---
This is a key problem - I took my time, but that was mechanically the incorrect choice.  Don't gate your grind behind story!
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a pretty fair answer. 
---
But also spamming the sub with a known bug might ensure Beth to see the problem. I mean there‚Äôs a lot of activity on this sub. 
---
And We don‚Äôt know how much time they use here. 
---
But yeah it also creates the downvotes from users who sees these posts often.
---
But yeah you‚Äôre right.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm the same I hoping to get it finished ASAP so I can have a little break before more stuff is added I‚Äôm level 73 atm. I‚Äôve been screwed out of 6k score because of AUTO completed challenges, happen in the first week and than decided to happen during the double challenges days.
---
I like they vary it, for different play styles.
---
I do think they should run some of their ‚Äúevents‚Äù for full weeks though for people who have to work the weekend.
---
Good luck friend.... I've failed over 1000 acid worth.
---
If you search or check my post history I was talking to a player that succeeded with the PA trap method. But I haven't....its a lot of work.
---
They didn't even take money from a successful IP, or this IP before 76, to invest into 76. CLEARLY. Because the problem have been way too many and the cool stuff way too few. It's a shakey, gruelling pace of development, little trust established, and constantly trying to hawk us for money. 
---
Also, as I mentioned in a previous post, the 'lights on' excuse is bullshit and I feel sorry for anyone who still believes that in 2020. It was bullshit when it started over a decade ago and nothing has changed.
---
My last encounter was with an always headshotting hacker. He killed 17 people all with headshots. My PA was cut like paper. Many people were watching him. But he found a duo who were able to get rid of him.
---
The plan was available in the Treasure Hunter event and allowed those that learned the plan to craft the helmet for use by others (not just themselves)
---
If you really want one you could hit up the market sub and offer a couple hundred caps, you'd likely get a response pretty quick.
---
The armour is the let down, not very sleek or stylish is it?
---
Yeah I want him in an instanced zone so we can kill him.
---
I can give you one ps: ghoulish69
---
Just mention this post
---
&gt; Literally shaking and crying right now
---
.... bro
---
I'd like to see a Freddy Krueger skin for it.
---
it's a shame there always be people cheating. I don't mind cheating or exploits as long as it doesn't make it unfair for other players, which in this situation it certainly does. Shame
---
I think you're better off staying bloodied, but if you're priming that's additional damage on top of zealots/hunters. Anti-Armor has diminishing returns the more you stack. I only run with max Tank Killer and maybe the armor piercing mag mod. 
---
You might want to look into chems/magazines/food that might boost your dmg too. I haven't been versed enough in that to offer anything helpful though, but if someone else sees this and wants to chime in... :)
---
Yeah I've seen it in game and that door looks fine. People just gotta complain about everything.
---
sadly playing the world of bugs u will use exploits constantly:)
---
there is a way to boost ur special stats using unyeilding armor (+30 instead of +15).  so when u do it without understanding how it works it is an exploit and thanks to beth¬¥s rules u can get b@nned for that. so we are all vulnerable just playing this game. we all can be cheaters witout knowing that.
---
Double S.C.O.R.E. would be equally as awesome to double XP if the items earned from the Legendary run were a little more cooler (or even remotely useful).. So far I think a majority of the rewards are garbage from it. Its like someone over at Bethesda originally had a decent idea with the Legendary Run, but the powers that be just said lets give them lunch boxes, and scrap kits.. or small pieces of a gillie suit for various armor types. Where the gillie suit looks more like that fake grass carpet you see people use for their pets to do their business on..
---
That's exactly what makes those things good.
---
Sorry I only just came back to f76, what do you mean you spent $9 to get it over with?
---
Thanks for this information. You explain this perfectly. The other games i played like the division 2 allowed players to stack crit chance so i thought i needed to obtain a crit chance weapon to do crit damage on fallout 76
---
I have no clue. I always thought that we still get the score, but people say auto-complete doesn‚Äôt help
---
Basic color's for everything should be free, especially when it probably only took someone 2 or 3 minutes to go into the modeling software and change it
---
So it's the user's INTENT that makes the in-game activity an exploit?   Guess I'm going to go put on a tinfoil hat so that my thoughts can't be read
---
How is it bullshit? 
---
If a game isn‚Äôt seeing a ROI/costing more to maintain than it earns why would they keep maintaining it?
---
Edit: and to add to my thought, Let‚Äôs say the game was earning $100,000/year and the costs to maintain were $20,000/year.  It might look profitable of $80K a year, but if the game wasn‚Äôt meeting expectations, it might make more sense to move that $20K/year towards something that will return more than $100k a year.
---
Yes it‚Äôs all about profits and greed, that‚Äôs AAA games
---
My red rocket garage doesn't have a sliding door.  How do I get one on it?
---
Not to mention the daily weekly limitations of getting points for leveling it..
---
Ok thanks. I'll keep this in mind when using vats btw is there any perk cards that allow you to use less ap in vats? I only use a weapon that has 25% less vats cost but was curious about applying critical savy which i will after seeing the responses on this post
---
Obsolete game engine that never had a "Prime" to be refereed to as being past its prime, + servers operated by a bunch of clueless  wannabee business Hardware developers who thought they knew was game developers needed more than experienced game developers (and still have a reputation for outright Ignoring if not being openly hostile to there own Clients who lease there game servers) + Yes its Bethesda why do you even ask + unfortunately they need to support games run on the original Xbone
---
Yeah if the plasma carts werent such a pain to craft or find I'd be using my caster alllll day.
---
I agree with everything you said. A lot of people end up basically being bottlenecked into playing a certain way. Obviously the reason everyone uses fixers/gat plas/handmades because they are the most viable.
---
Friendly fire is useful for keeping NPCs alive in radiation rumble because you can use a shishkebab. 
---
They've definitely made huge progress, it's incredibly more stable since launch, and wastelanders made it feel more alive, but the amount of small things they could implement or change will definitely increase the potential for the game to last longer.
---
But for the love of god I really want them to fix the fast travel bug.
---
Bought levels with atoms
---
Totally. I regret it but I had to for Summerset Isle celebration in ESO amd Antiquity job.
---
I'm using a bloodied radium rifle or my fancy shotgun.
---
Not at all I'm putting war rider back on it after I took the pic
---
I just move a couple of steps and look a different direction, never been more than 3 tries.
---
I have the healing factor mutation.
---
Its less vats cost that helps the most for me, I have a quad bash damage fixer with less vats cost, with adrenal reaction and about 50% health I run the queen hitting 25 per shot then 100+ ever other shot with criticals. Numbers sound low but I can fire off around 60-70 round in vats and by the time I have reloaded my ap is full again

Actually yes. Go read the code of conduct and it'll tell you the exact thing

---
I need to change out my door frame any suggestions?
---
Yes i was curious about knowing how to the critical meter works but i just found out after reading the responses that once the crit meter is full a crit shot will be executed
---
This used to happen when I equipped/Unequipped carry weight items quickly over and over. Maybe try that for a fix?
---
Take a workshop and nuke there instead of your camp
---
Looks like PA mk1 beta :-)
---
What I find weird is that this one is sometimes there, sometimes not. I originally thought there'd be some quest that causes this.
---
Unless you have the Violet flux to burn, priming the Handmade isn't going to get you a whole lot extra damage on the SBQ
---
I run a commando build and wound up toting around a primed Bloodied LMG (limb damage, reduced weight) - limb damage is still bugged, so it does some crazy things to the SBQ and I only need to push out 1 clip to get the damage I need for loot. Ultracite .308 crafts at 172 rounds per fluorescent flux so it's pretty efficient as long as you're not using it as your daily driver.
---
Very nice to see solid trigger discipline even on a prop, kudos to you.
---
Also, nice cosplay.
---
In my experience, if you log in and challenges are missing then those challenges have autocompleted and you'll be able to see them next time you log in. Alternatively, it is also possible for you to see them listed as complete right from the get go as well.
---
Weird, I did all the Vault 79 quests on 5 characters and the only part I got stuck on was Johnny in that lazer room
---
I logged a ticket but it's stuck in "waiting on agent" (16304687).
---
I'm beginning to think it's the slocum joe vendors being buggy, so I removed them.
---
When it just happened again, I noticed one of my slocum Joe vending machines appeared to be stuck thinking somebody is in it. Even though I just spawned into the world, and nobody is nearby, it says I cannot use the vendor because somebody else is using it.
---
Looking at my vendor inventory, I actually see my items as if they were in the vendor, with a price tag next to the items and the prices. However, the # items in the vendor is listed as 0/30, on each vendor (I can post a snapshot if it helps).
---
After logging out and back into a new server, all of the item listings are gone.
---
It could be a state transition problem.  I'll play with it today with some friends to see if I can better reproduce it.
---
I appreciate that you showed what your abbreviations stood for. I wish more people did that
---
Thanks man, really informative I‚Äôm definitely going to try all those out, for sure the healing factor mutation
---
"complain about everything" hmm I legit play this game daily and love it. My bad I only get to in evenings and weekends for a few hours if I'm lucky. Guess we aren't allowed to say anything.
---
Every Red Rocket Garage CAMP that I've visited has had this bug. I haven't been able to open a single one normally.
---
People doing daily and weekly SCORE challenges
---
I used my alt for one level up score that was it. I used my main for 99.9% of the rest
---
Not saying any of the things you just said shouldn't be things.
---
Op is legit just saying the backpacks shouldn't have negative effects.
---
Which isn't too much to ask.
---
Oh yes. I think i seen that one. Have you completed it yet?
---
Damn!
---
No I mean when there‚Äôs high traffic my jet pack sends me miles in the air I noticed it on fascnat or whatever it‚Äôs called
---
Id probably prefer the double xp but this double score weekend was perfect timing for me because it gave me enough boost to pass Zoltan finally. I'm at the part of the board where I can no longer get a full square a day without grinding the repeatable and Id been breathing down his neck but not quite catching him with a good chance he would have pulled away again as the SCORE requirement continued to increase. I now have a 4 to 5 square buffer ahead of him so i think I should be good now
---
Since the score started I don‚Äôt see many nukes anymore.  I‚Äôm on Xbox,  i used to see at least one a night.  I enjoy the double XP.  But seemed like there was way more server crashes during it too.
---
Just happened to me as well. Was this not supposed to be fixed yet? How do I get my fucking SCORE?! üò°
---
Try using that fixer thing everyones talking about. Heard it was for fixing bugs ourselves
---
On the legendary run board it looks more red kind of. Maybe because I'm using firefly lights to light my dark ass sketchy shed
---
All I‚Äôve gotten from this is that the community hates boss mechanics and will only complain if we don‚Äôt have dps check bosses in the future. I pray the new dlc actually has fights with mechanics that need to be followed
---
People have spent more, you'd be amazed
---
Honestly, the way they started doing clothing in fallout turned shit at fallout 4. I loved how you could wear clothing from the opposite gender in new Vegas, and it would still look good, like Vera key‚Äôs dress being a quality tuxedo if you‚Äôre male.
---
It was an Atomic shop item during Valentine‚Äôs Day..week. üòä
---
Okay so I tested dodgy at 3 stars and the missed damage is nice but the load it put on my VATS meter was crazy cause a fight turned into a party during a scorch beast attack so I'll have to test a bit further for now and see if it's worth the extra load on my VATS meter
---
Fire watchtower...?! Are they adding one of those for camps?
---
I stick to a few specific themes. It makes staying within the limits of the game much easier. If it doesn't fit my theme then it better be useful like a Collectron that does my scavenging. And now that they've become stingy on the Free Atoms, I'll become even pickier.
---
Ohhhhhhhh. Shit i missed it it looks dope af
---
Well I know that now, and while hindsight says I should have learned after the last time that happened, it's still a terrible bug that's plagued the community and their builds, which is a huge focus for Bethesda, so you think they would make it a priority
---
Is it kinda pink? If that's the same one that I'm thinking of, to me it looks like something from a Valentine's Day atom shop theme. I wasn't playing back then but that's my theory.
---
Just check where Dr Zorbo is on the game board. If you're ahead of him then you're good.
---
Some pink some purple. But it's mostly pink. It was available during valentine's week just learned that too
---
I currently use that one. Its the crit meter that always confused me but the responses helped alot. Do you know any good perk cards the reduces the ap usage in vats?
---
That's a fricken brilliant idea.
---
OMG, I would LOVE that! I main Freddy in Dead By Daylight. Alas, I doubt Bethesda would want to go to the trouble of licensing just for a weapon skin. But I would buy the crap out of that!!! üòç
---
Ikr!!! Same here! I really want one. üòÅ
---
Yah I figured thatx but I wondered if switching to the ultracite ammo would be better.
---
the forum is honestly a shithole.
---
I always miss the good stuff lmao
---
You have posted this three times btw :-)
---
its amazing, they literally fuck everything up, no hyperbole.

I have never experienced this
---
CAN YOU TASTE THE FREEDOM?
---
So I should be jumping on my tent to make her land? I'm trying to get a cryolater, people been doing this mean nasty combo of gashes creezer and cryolater when she is really close flying or landed, and they will unloaded the cryo then when reload they will throw a freezer, and repeat. 
---
When I see this I know were killing her right then and there. I will stand right in front of her almost on her, aimed at her head with a bloodied gat laser and she died so quick.
---
Same kinda weird
---
I found it needs to be rotated to a very specific orientation to place.
---
I immediately purchased first when it came out, so tired of farming plastic to bulk junk so I could sell it. 
---
Stash weight went down by about 400 pounds, which I immediately filled with legendaries I don't need.
---
Or it was just an coincidence.
---
That‚Äôs from last week
---
Rifles. lol semi-automatics are so bad I forgot those existed
---
Are you accounting for stat gains and losses by being in a team? Many players run the mutation boost perk which could bump up your carry weight.
---
Unfortunately if you wear high cap BP all the time you will notice you soak up rads like a sponge. Ghouls and SB crop dusts are the bane of your existence, so is SBQ AOE radiation. I wear high cap when traveling, but try to put on lead or insulated when doing actual combat. A lot of weight problems can be circumvented with proper perk selection, legendary armor w mods, and anti hoarding techniques. Some of the stuff you collect adds up a lot more than you think it does.
---
Commando perk specifically.
---
Since it wasn't in fo4 and was a novelty weapon I loved it. Than I decided to try out the cool mg42 and I gave up on life
---
The did not fix the ash pile problem. I thought they did...
---
Not the queen but a queen mirelurk I think after the stranger heart event, I killed it, ran to loot, i was able to start looting before the ash pile animation, got like 3 of the thing (luckily I got that 3 star gamma gun) and poof. Gone the other person just look at me in his PA and ran the üëç emote
---
You do have to press the crit button (y on Xbox). It‚Äôs not automatic.
---
It really should just be a skin. I wonder if it's issues are a result of that.
---
Play to win.
---
Fair enough, I'll give you that.
---
there is a commie one in the pts files now. looks pretty cool
---
I did the same, one thing I was looking forward to the most was the new Gatling Gun Skin but alas the drum mag gets in the way of the Cross hair so you can't aim properly in first person. The skin is great on a fully modded gatling but that one issue is a bummer.
---
You can take on a lot of bloodied characteristics without long for the bloody build. For instance that dodgy boost to your agility would be a good replacement for adrenaline. One issue you have, which is have too is you have too many essential perks in one skill like. I only have 1* for all 3 unarmed dmg boosters and only 2* incisor because my strength portion is totally maxed out, your luck is missing some good perk cards that would boost dmg and def easily. That won‚Äôt matter on bloody or vanguard builds rather if you want that high vats focus or are willing to take some hits to you vats skills. 
---
Tenderizer could probably just be a 1* as the bonuses from it drop to only a 1% per a shot and if you want high dmg you probably won‚Äôt need more than 2 hits on most anyways anyways. Class freak would be a good replacement as it would boost your mutations. Suppressor could also be a good one to add if your concern is squishiness. Assuming you‚Äôre the guy shooting first, if the enemy isn‚Äôt downed your first hit it would reduce their dmg for no penalty to you.
---
Action boy could probably be a 1 or 2* as it replenishes much quicker with just 1 and sneak you could replace with an armor boost especially if you‚Äôre a ranged player! 
---
One of your luck skills could be reduced for the crit meter refill as there‚Äôs a lot but it‚Äôs still good.
---

---
You don‚Äôt need to take any of this advice, just some input on options you could take to keep from taking as much dmg. If there is anything you‚Äôre confused about or curious feel free to ask. I really think just a bit more optimizing could solve your problems!

3 people today had the same issue with a world disconnect. Only makes me think it wasn't even me kicking my cable that caused this.
---
10/10 would rob but not kill.
---
Not true lately the quuens been targeting the person standing on v9 and she just lands outside and runs up to the fence and stands there then usually someone else aggros her more anyways
---
You cannot say that you definitely know for certain unless you do a crazy amount of tests. I‚Äôve watched her melee people on tents and land in the bunker to attack people on the fence, so it‚Äôs certainly not ‚Äúdefinite‚Äù.
---
Do I have to be in vats to crit? Sometimes I see my damage in yellow when I'm not in vats
---
So Beth are mind readers now and we are living in Minority Report...
---
I got the auto complete for the first time last night. Closed the application before I could load in because I realized I had last played an alt the previous day. Saved myself a minute of load time in exchange for losing my challenges.
---
Darude - Sandstorm
---
Yup been happening to me since I bought the bundle, I got so annoyed at it I just removed the door completely.
---
I didn't want to type it out a bunch of times and it also made the post look clean without repeating the same words.
---
I feel they should just remove all building restrictions completely. Players can make floating bases anyhow.  Plus, what would it even hurt? Maybe add a few more trolls, but that's always gonna be a thing. I say just just let players build whatever monstrosities they please.
---
I wish!
---
Bud, ya get my vote for hall monitor of the year... I'll have my secretary wrap up a microwave oven for you shortly...
---
I see it as a warning to, to quickly find it before it dies to get a hit in.
---
Techno viking is coming. Fly you fools!
---
No it‚Äôs not, it does 25% more damage but split into two bullets and makes the accuracy terrible. Bloodied, junkies, anti armor, furious, vampires, and even instigating (on certain weapons) are much better than it
---
Used to be vegetable starch crops for adhesive.

Now it‚Äôs just razor grain for aesthetic

Good to hear that it was only your dailies though.

I have 200+ improved repair kits from running at least 3 scrochbeast queen run daily so now I don't give a damn or have to worry if a gun breaks in 1000 shots. Basically at this point, I can get more repair kits in the amount of times it takes for my guns to break and using them to repair the guns. And no I don't have gunsmith at all.
---
It's a robot farting.
---
Two shot used to be good but after they nerfed it it‚Äôs bad
---
Yes please. I would never play in adventure again
---
All i'm saying is that there are hundreds or thousands of people who have issues with challenges auto completing themselves, and nearly every single player has disconnects / crashes with this game. It doesn't take much for the two things to happen at the same time. Without them having something to do with each other. I'm not saying it is impossible, just that it can be coincidence.
---
Finally someone with the guts to help
---
I have to be honest. I get much better rolls WITHOUT my unyielding armor on. With it equipped I get far more 1 stars, compared to no unyielding and a Day Tripper giving far more 3*s.
---
Customer service won't help you by giving you score points that you missed out on due to the auto complete bug.
---
Chally?
---
Not entirely sure why you're so upset about being punished for breaking the rules?

Try the rug trick. Pick a small rug. Place tree on top. Pick up rug with tree and move to where you want. Should work. It's not perfect but at least it makes it placable.

What are the negatives for the WL BP mods?
---
THIS IS WHY WE NEED SERVER CHAT.
---
atleast on PC we need a server chat box. I legit hate having to fast travel to people to let them know I'm gonna run tbe silo so don't log off the server, ussualy higher lvl players cause i don't want to run it and then have it be filled with low lvls that don't show up. The other night I did 3 nukes for everyone. They loved it, and another guy showed his appreciation and ran encrypted for everyone. 
---
Only I showed up. Why do people sleep on the good events. On any new character. Idc my lvl I'm joining those big events. Especially since I'm pretty sure one of the upcoming updates will be giving lvl based weapon/armor rewards, instead of random. Obviously the type can be random but the lvl is based on your lvl

Also by the way forgot to mention the reason why I put fallout first in there So not everybody would have it and crash the game
---
Ok i will and thanks for this information. I literally always used vats with the concentrated perk and seen the yellow damage from headshots and thought that was the crits until i seen all the responses on here. Do you know any perk cards that reduces the amount of ap you use in vats?
---
Zax had too many beans, huh?
---
that actually looks amazing lol
---
Luck has nothing to do with the loot you get. Luck only affects item condition and critical hit recharge rate.
---
Just trying to suggest one of the issues causing the score reset because Bethesda obviously has no clue. My language in the title explicitly included the word  "seems." People are aware about score glitching at a certain time but the other cases don't have a clear cause.
---
Np.
---
whats your platform?
---
if you are ps4, I have all the serums, cheap.  I‚Äôm also mic‚Äôed, so cam share some other experiences easier than I can type them.
---
It's not pay to win because non modded underarmor doesn't do anything other than cosmetics.
---
So, it‚Äôs basically a skin for Nuclear Winter....
---
Omg.. Not this stupid rumour/hearsay again.. Servers have nothing to do with loot either. It is just RNG. I have \~2000h with this game i have NEVER experienced anything of the sorts. Meaning that somehow some servers would give some specific prefixes more or just more legendaries in general. That is just stupid.
---
Small water purifiers can be built anywhere and hold two water at a time max...so I build five as my character is thirsty all the time.
---
The large water purifier and the industrial water purifier have to be built on/in water.  They hold 3 and 5 purified water combined.
---
2 industrial water purifiers will have you swimming in purified water soon enough.
---
This is dumb thing to be annoyed about.
---

Nice butt.
---
Is it violet flux for every weapon type? Do you know how many rounds 1 flux make? I can run through like 1k rounds per fight sometimes
---
I strongly believe the rate of which enemy becomes a legendary has been nerfed
---
This is Joey from Friends, Fergie turned up....
---
Old news. I used to do this in Vault 94 and it would spawn max level Legendary Bloatfly's.
---
&gt;I‚Äôve hopped so many servers and the clubhouse is empty.
---
I read that in the OP's post.
---
Damn, I want this.  How bad was the grind?  I have no clue how to get all this
---
So putting more rounds out would be more beneficial than trying to get vats crits? Thats what I was thinking since it can be difficult to get the 95% chance of hitting during the fight. I dont feel like wasting ultracite rounds on a 35% hit chance
---
If it comes in this season it should be added in August since it is the last month of the season.
---
That‚Äôs why my DR was messed up, I couldn‚Äôt figure it out.  Checked and double checked perks, checked nerd rage. 
---
Unbelievable. What a waste of atoms. I let a lot of stuff go but this one pisses me off.
---
The chance that they would have ended up on the same server as you to see it and then copy it and then you end up on the same server as them again, is really rare.
---
I doubt they copied you.
---
Just got to the throne
---
I LOVE this. holy shit!!
---
Yea, I just leave it closed.
---
For the people suggesting combining the benches... Please no. It's slow and laggy enough in xbox without more changes that will break something or make it worse (on xbox)
---
Wait, do you mean workshops or CAMPs? Because if you're saying to remove the last PvP elements from the game and nerf workshops...lol. fuck that.
---
Very lucky indeed by the sounds of it! Will likely resort to using a discord/market.
---
Thats exactly what i use to think was the crit hit before reading the responses in this post. According to the responses in this post, you have to click the y button on xbox to execute a crit hit once the crit meter is full from vats. Im not sure what button it is on ps4 or pc
---
Underarmour skins are pointless anyway
---
I'm talking about player CAMPS only. Does not effect workshops.
---
I just don't want to have to use CAMP budget to build turrets.
---
You can double those numbers easily
---
We are closing on 100th post about this.
---
Yeah I saw that mask also but wasn't a huge fan of the vines on it
---
Not whenever they do 2/3 of the normal damage
---
But that's the thing thou I'm speaking from experience here I DO wear High Capacity Backpack all the time and the only thing that actually poses a threat to me radiation wise are being outnumbered 6+ to 1 vs bloated ghouls. As for Scorchbeast Queen Attacks they don't do enough Radiation that becomes an issue like I said just pop some Radaway ( I particular use Radaway: Diluted).
---
I understand that the High Capacity Backpack is not for everyone and everything doesn't use Traveling Pharmacy so they can't seemingly carry an unlimited amount of Radaway like me.
---
I also understand that not everyone uses a Full Health Build like me and to some Builds taking Radiation Damage means death (Looking at you Bloodied/Unyielding Builds) so to those builds yeah High Capacity Backpack isn't a good idea. 
---
But we're just talking about the present right now because outside those Bloodied/Unyielding Builds which will never have a solution to this weakness by design of the build 7 Weeks from now when Legendary Perks are implemented and people start taking What Rads? Legendary Perk you and me wouldn't be even having this discussion.
---
Beth logic
---
Wait.  Adrenaline works on private servers?
---
Haven't been playing that long either, started a month or so before wastelanders.  Found the vampires LMG on someones vendor for like 5k, the vampires plasma was like 8k.  The other weapons were drops.  I also keep a gauss shotgun on me, it's a zelots with + vats hit chance and I think  90% reduced weight.  I've named it "war crime" because it's a freaking war crime wrapped in hatred.  It's awesome for dealing with swarms of low level trash so I don't waste my regular ammo.
---
Definitely check player vendors for weapons though.  You would be amazed what people sell for cheap.
---
Players can't attack CAMPs though unless you've already shot back at them.
---
He really is the nicest dude in the fallout community. Just a pure genuine dude that doesn't play into any of the YT pandering nonsense. 
---
We most protect the turtle at all costs.
---
As far as I can tell from the post, not just PVP but everything.  Sounds like they don't even want ghouls or molerats to damage their things like some sort of Minecraft creative mode or something.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong here OP.
---
My technique is unique in that any player can do this at their own camp without dangers of the waste and minimal tools and plans required. Also this method is supposed to be an unofficial write-up for players to reference new and old.
---
Meant the pts, dunno why I wrote private lol
---
I was really pissed off that I couldnt mod the camo secret service under armour.
---
That's just what I've heard.
---
It's bullshit because: 
---
1. We have no idea how much it takes to maintain a game. So we can't factually say they need the money they make or ask for... we can only say something incredibly vague like "they need money", which I already agreed with.
---
2. Look at how much money major studios made off of their MMOs. Look at Blizzard and WoW. Can you honestly write with a straight face that they needed that money to support the game? BILLIONS of dollars in regular cash from subscribers for over a decade. This is not an exaggeration. They had over 10m subscribers paying $15/month, and people still cried out "But the servers, they need money for the servers!" after Blizzard followed their subscription with a cash shop. 
---
3. You will regularly see a studio asking for money; see them getting a lot of it; and see nothing change for the game itself. WoW's gameplay quality is subjective, but I think anyone who played it from vanilla through today will know that the game's overall quality, support, and pace of updates has not improved. There's probably a cap on how much money can actually make a game better and the rest goes into pockets.
---
4. There are FREE TO PLAY games with just as much and even in some cases less monetization than 76. How could those games possibly exist as F2P if maintaining a server or whatever else was that expensive? How does that make any sense? (It makes sense because the entire premise of 'Pay us more because we need it' is bullshit).
---
These companies saw an opportunity to claim "Look this is a different type of game with regular costs so we need regular money", and then sit back and laugh when the vast majority of gamers never stopped to question how much money is needed, how much money is gained, and how much money goes back into the game.
---
But the really fun part is that even if most gamers did ask, they would not answer.
---
My bad, should have searched before I posted I suppose. Shows how many people were willing to part with 6 bucks for it though!
---
Bad dog! Put the boot down! No, get that boot out of your mouth!
---
You probably want concentrated fire to zone in on head shots or other enemy weakpoints. Good luck!!
---
Shhh... Don't tell them. It's grindy enough as it is.
---
I'm tippin' something
---
They using the FANCY math over there!
---
They should take a look at ESO.
---
They have a similar monetization scheme with the subscription and housing items and cosmetics available only through the real money store.
---
However you can earn new items and cosmetics simply by playing the game. ESO has a pretty robust economy as well.
---
I programmed it to attack her, then when it started to go towards her I played hero killed it. Yea she became hostile towards me and now she‚Äôs dead.
---
Not all food builds spec out for food. It's an ad hominem
---
You can get regular crits but Vats criticals do more damage and ignore armor, abilities,  etc.
---
I guess. I like secret service look overall, and it does show through a little under armor if you don't have an outfit on.
---
and don‚Äôt forget Mr. Sandman! Coupled with Covert Operative you can do 3.5x stealth damage... uh but of course that‚Äôs only at night
---
Bwah-nah! 
---
It's just the train rolling into funky town.
---
I've noticed it today. There are alot of people reporting their challenges auto completing, me included, and that may have something to do with it.
---
No reason to down-vote someone for being right. Its a bug, exploiting it for gain is bad and against the tos and furthermore going to the official community to let everyone else know is bad which is why you received a warning and then coming here to bitch about it like anyone cares is even worse so full stop. Nothing else you say matters. 
---
This isn't rocket surgery people. Some of you really make me question my loyalty to 76.
---
VATs broke for ballistic weapons after Wastelanders dropped.
---
And yes, as far as I can tell, VATs still works for railway rifles.
---
I have never experienced this either, but only around 200 hours in game.  And PS4. I have seen them lose population, but never to the point the server shuts down.
---
Shhh don't tell anyone, but after the ammo converter (that sucks), nothing else is really worth getting :-)
---
At this point it's better to just turn in the terrible 1 stars to get a single 3 star
---
You're not wrong but EXP grinding without a bloodied build takes longer.
---
I've sacraficed my entire UNY DCG bloodied build for maximum EXP. 71 INT points.
---
Someone should've told him "yes" so we could go gank his mule. 
---
(I still have a shitload of gears and screws from that time I ganked someone's mule at the ammo factory who had 300+ pounds of stuff, some of that being 1k+ gears and screws.)
---
Preach
---
Eh, sure, you can be a nihilist about in game purchases and say nothing has any point. I get value out of cosmetics. Call it a matter of opinion, I suppose
---
Different flux for different ammo types, Ultracite 5.56 uses Violet, Ultracite .308 uses Fluorescent, others will use Cobalt, etc, etc.
---
Assuming that you can craft the necessary mods for the Handmade, you can always test it out. If you like the result, then factor in the Ultracite ammo cost. Lots of Violet to pick up down in the SBQ area that can be farmed for stable flux.
---
Personally I use a non-primed Handmade when the SBQ is in the air and for ground clean up. But once she lands I swap over to the primed LMG and get up in her face with it. Some rad resist chems (like Radshield) and Zealot's armor can go a long way down there if you're having trouble getting up close and personal to the action.
---
Touche my friend, I concur.
---
I'm mostly looking forward to that poison resist bonus.... Geez that will make me unstoppable.
---
Congrats!!!
---
If it worked, wouldn't it be though?
---
Its so frustrating beacause I do them every single day, I wish they actually gave a fuck about the game.
---
If you need a few rad barrels placed at your CAMP, msg me on xbox, GT: Wandering Dovah
---
What do you mean at this point? Isn‚Äôt that what we‚Äôve been doing since the purveyor was added?
---
I think it's just a noise it makes when you join a lobby to tell you joined a lobby while you're sitting in a 5 year long loading screen.
---
With FO1st I wouldn't be dropping much. But that is dirty.
---
ZAX‚Äôs Soul Train
---
But unless you wear no armour or power armour or outfits at all, you don't see it.....?
---
 After seeing the video by Angry Turtle, i wanted to verify if one of my favorite weapons was magic or not.
---
I use a TS AR with 33% VATS chance and recently bought a TS AR with FFR , assuming they would have the same damage output per bullet (2 in this case) .
---
Unfortunately, i was seriously unimpressed with the FFR version - see the numbers below.
---
Tests done on Super mutants and high level Ghouls around whitesprings.
---
VATS version
---
output per shot : 140 and 360 (so 2 bullets)
---
FFR Version
---
output per shot : 140 and 140 (so 2 bullets)
---
Same perks, same gear and both in sneak. This went on for the 10 minutes i tested it. 
---
Does someone know what is going on here? This shouldnt be magic damage as i am not using VATS whatsoever. I'm lost...
---
BF2 wasn't like that at launch, it was like that pre-launch and was changed in response to community outcry. 
---
That said, yes it was incredibly predatory. They probably figured they'd have a ton of kids and super fanboys of the IP who wouldn't question things.
---
But comparing a pile of shit to a rotten apple in no way makes either of them better. 
---
Also, I'm not complaining about something that makes my camp look pretty. Did you even read the OP? Camp assets are required to build, and building is a gameplay endeavour. Builders are gameplay enthusiasts who happen to have a creative side, they're not putting on a new shirt and calling it a day, they're investing hours into getting items, scavenging or buying materials, and creating things with those items and materials that they share with other players to make the world a little more interesting and unique. While doing this they have to abide by rules and try to find creative ways to do things they like.
---
Building in this game, as in any other game that includes it as a feature and has it interact with gameplay systems and rulesets, is not about cosmetics.
---
It‚Äôs to wake you up from your loading screen-induced coma.
---
That's still + 2/3 for free
---
If it worked properly it would just be a skin for the secret service underarmor and thus only available to people that own the secret sevice underarmor already.
---
I should have clarified, I was talking about NPC attacks
---
Its like being in an abusive relationship. Youre the problem.
---
Carnivore mutation, strange in numbers and cooked scorchbeast meat. 500hp and as a bloodied build tanking 2 pylons and shooting the imposter with my health regeneration faster than the damage in taking its the only way. Better than super stims
---
So i got tired of this happening to me too so right as she dies I run as fast as I can to a tent and jump on top. Wait for the all clear and hit the stash underneath.  The scream of a mirelurk king is the worst thing to hear...... i just think pls don't pick me, pls don't pick me....
---
a few dozen, he says... dozens! lol
---
That's correct. The budget is so limited as it is and turrets take up so much of it. I don't want to feel obligated to build them.
---
If I don't build the turret (as things currently stand), I keep coming back to CAMP and having to make repairs.
---
I hate the Settlers. They act like they're all morally superior when they're secretly still Raiders at heart.
---
I mean that just makes it worse ha.
---
‚ÄúConvincing Data‚Äù is not going to be attained by four data points. Spend 10,000 scrip and let‚Äôs see how it plays out.
---
Yes.  It's a rifle and "Rifles" come in two types.
---
Pew-pew type, and the PEW type.  Since it goes pew-pew  it uses commando perks.
---
Ah that makes sense. I was just curious for challenges since I am melee
---
I miss this!
---
That is so interesting. I just hit level 48 and I feel like such a fucking big time baller with my 55-60 dmg automatic combat rifle, it kills a lot of shit really effectively...as long as I don't go to Watoga, run into charred feral ghouls or assualtrons.   
---
I guess what I'm trying to get at is that I realize no matter what level you are in the game, there is always difficulty to be had.
---
I've heard the vault 94 mask completes the set bonus for thorn, go for SS chest for the jetpack maybe if that's the case
---
they gotta try and sell those repair kits lol
---
Ask them in your service ticket. It‚Äôs happened for a few people.
---
Semi automatic and automatic.  Theres also bolt action, muzzle loading, flintlock and flint wheel...
---
Yeah on PC it's space. I have to pull out the old shotty for these challenges cause it takes forever with the dcg
---
No kidding I‚Äôve been checking sporadically for like 2 months but now to find out it‚Äôs the wrong place.  :‚Äô-)
---
Maybe something like a generic knock-off? Frederick Geiger?
---
She's absolutely not pure RNG. If she were people would get as many fixers as they do pipe rifles and and missile launchers but that's simply not how it works out. The Purveyor was rigged from the start.
---
I know it kept saying it wouldn't load but it actually did my bad
---
sounds like you have it all figured out..
---
Would you be  willing to help a guy out . I'm not looking to insta kill everything but I would like to be able to do more damage when doing scorchbeast
---
That‚Äôs how RNG works. And four rolls is not a valid sample size. 
---
When there are players that have done 100 plus rolls and tracked the results and the data supports pure RNG over any alleged external factor?  There results are more credible.
---
No it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs 25% extra damage for free IF the second bullet actually stays on target
---
I have sent one in in both QUEST and CHALLENGES
---
Unless you're sharpshooting from across the map you will hit your target
---
Actually, Beth has already acknowledged it is an issue and claims it is a "top priority" but like I said not condemning nor condoning the downvotes.  Only giving an answer.
---
Good point! Lol it's layers and layers of not working like a fine onion
---
I‚Äôm honestly not sure but there are chems and food that do. Firecracker berry juice I think, also play an instrument for well tuned bonus
---
When did we start getting discounts?
---
They had a similar problem with modifications for power armor several months back maybe 6 months ago. we would try to apply them modification everything would go according to plan but it just would not apply it. Eventually they got that ironed out.
---
The bloodied is nice. To bad ffr doesn‚Äôt do a damn thing on a shotgun.
---
It makes sense. If they don't know/ can't add SCORE then add ATOM. It's how the challeneges were fixed before.
---
Especially if it was themed.
---
By posting about it, you're actively spreading the knowledge of the exploit. When you discover it by random - which many won't because many don't care about the fireworks and apparently it stops working after switching weapons - then no harm no foul. But spreading a knowlegde about an exploit is always frowned upon, by any game developer. That's why this subreddit NEVER mentions how the latest dupe method works. If you find an exploit, then report it and don't talk about it publically online.
---
Ok.
---
they list the fallout 1st discounts on the newsletter each week.
---
I love the theories.
---
Oh okay! Yeah that changes things lol. I was not aware. But yeah I totally hear you. Did not in any way mean to say you did the opposite. Just giving you credit for the fair answer.
---
I mean you/we could have just downvotes ourselves. 
---
Open communication is the way forward. 
---
*cough* Beth *cough*
---
Yeah, but what I meant was the 3 star enemies are only dropping 1 stars. You could completely empty out the legendary exchange with only 1 stars.
---
Got a link?  I‚Äôve seen advertised discounts for all players in regards to returning items but not exclusive to FO1st.
---
For what I understand crafting in your underwear at a white springs crafting table gets you a better roll.
---
FYI I've spent well over 10k, a lot, lot more in fact and this is only the latest of many runs of similar weapons, and this isn't the first virtually identical pairing. There's a big difference between rare and regular occurance.
---
The underarmor doesn't need rolls, or even legendary modules
---
This destroyed my crossbow builds. Now back to lever action and handmades. What's next? Covert Operative? Bloody Mess? Super Duper? All these are critical to certain builds and essential for resource gathering. They need to test BEFORE releasing buggy updates, PTS is supposed to do that.
---
They been giving discounts on items each week for months now people just didn't notice because they are not exclusive labeled as FO1st exclusive discount and is not listed under the FO1st tab.
---
Sounds a lot like a 'prerecorded response'.
---
You are using the wrong brackets use this one [ and after you do so state what you have and want. 
---
 Example below
---
[XB1] H: Offers W: lvl 35 and lvl 50 explosive 10mm Smg
---
I was wondering if someone was making super sophisticated bots or something.
---
3* items are supposed to be rare.. the only reason they arent is duping and to a lesser degree the purveyor
---
It‚Äôs confirmation bias.
---
You go ages without getting anything good and it‚Äôs random prefixes that have no relation so you don‚Äôt think about it.
---
Then you get two unyielding pieces within a few drops and it‚Äôs suddenly a thing
---
I'd have a very difficult time deciding between BoS and Free States.
---
Ah ok that could be the problem. Thanks mate
---
happy cake day!
---
arktos fridge this week is FO1st exclusive discount

https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2TUnMA1Z6vTZko5tWJ1R1J/atomic-shop-weekly-update-july-28-august-4
---
You looted the quest item when you didn't have Ward's quest available.  The quest item gets stuck in your inventory and autocompletes Ward's quest.  So it is a glitch, but an extremely useful one.
---
Np I had trouble at first aswell
---
You're looking at it wrong. There's no change to the damage output you actually see popping up, the magic effect is a hidden glitched damage that just builds up the longer you're shooting at one body part. You could be using the weakest heavy weapon possible and as long as you're fulfilling the conditions even if you're only doing one damage a hit the enemies health will just start to plummet after enough hits.
---
I have this all the time with my decon shower too.
---
Outfit is atom shop, jetpack is completing wastlanders questline and then about 2 weeks of getting bullion for SS torso and jetpack which is just doing a few quests and events each day, and then a bit of flux to craft it.
---
So every Tuesday is new Atomic Shop offers, it seems.  Good to know.
---
I don‚Äôt have any data - not even four rolls - to support your theory but I believe you‚Äôre right with regards to the item type. I think Fixers, Bear Arms, Cattle Prods and that ilk of ‚Äúneed the plan first‚Äù items are intentionally rare. But the same gut feel after tens of thousands of scrip spent is that the effects on the items is indeed random. So I agree with half of your theory!
---
To be clear, I am not defending Bethesda.  I'm saying they won't change anything.  
---
&gt;We have no idea how much it takes to maintain a game. So we can't factually say they need the money they make or ask for... we can only say something incredibly vague like "they need money", which I already agreed with.
---
Well, we can actually figure out a really good guess, it's not like the jobs and services they provide and require are so unique that salary information is, and you can figure out the cost of servers.  It isn't hard to do the math. 
---
But I'm not interested in that part, like I said - it's return on investment in addition to the cost to maintain (ROI/Cost to maintain). Every department (and I'm guessing Fallout 76 is it's own department or part of another department that rolls up, that's standard business)
---
they have metrics to meet.  If they can determine that the money they spend on FO76 is better spent elsewhere for a better return on investment, they will close shop on FO76. Even if they weren't being super greedy, that would be the smart thing to do.
---
FO76 is clearly not making some metric, they are pushing to meet that metric. But there will be a point where they don't see it worth trying to push for that metric 
---
Again, to be clear, I'm not saying "you have to spend money or they'll shut down the servers".  I'm saying it's clear they are trying to meet some metric and that's why it's been getting worse.  They're losing players and subscriptions, especially after the ban wave/suspensions.  They aren't sitting in a place where upper management says "it's ok to return money an investment back into this game".  Who knows the writing could be on the wall as early as 2021 and they simply are trying to milk what they can before they give up on it.     
---
edit: I guess I actually am saying it... but not as a plea to help them, but rather as simply a statement of fact.  If they aren't happy with the game is making, they will shut it down, and it's clear that the Devs don't want that (maybe it will affect thier job or raise) so they are pushing to get some more cash in. 
---
&gt;Look at how much money major studios made off of their MMOs. Look at Blizzard and WoW. Can you honestly write with a straight face that they needed that money to support the game? BILLIONS of dollars in regular cash from subscribers for over a decade. This is not an exaggeration. They had over 10m subscribers paying $15/month, and people still cried out "But the servers, they need money for the servers!" after Blizzard followed their subscription with a cash shop.
---
I would not compare a successful game like WoW to a non-starter like FO76.  Fallout 76 is not in the same situation as WoW, and never will be. Not even close by a long shot.    
---
&gt;You will regularly see a studio asking for money; see them getting a lot of it; and see nothing change for the game itself. WoW's gameplay quality is subjective, but I think anyone who played it from vanilla through today will know that the game's overall quality, support, and pace of updates has not improved. There's probably a cap on how much money can actually make a game better and the rest goes into pockets.
---
And I'm not saying give bethesda money. I would never give them money if I didn't think I'd get something out of it (such as my FO1st subscription). I think any existing company doing a kickstarter or gofundme can suck a big one.
---
I mean, I'm not the biggest fan but ghillie suits were an incredibly highly requested item from a lot of players. Especially in NW. 
---
I'd say my only issue is having it spread out across 12 different rewards instead of one ghillie pack.
---
Too liberal a definition of the term "exploit" by a company with two black eyes over this game... Did you used to turn people over to the authorities for copying 1 cassette tape to another? That's how Metallica met each other. Later, they all blamed others for doing a similar activity...
---
Just imagine the reputation fallout 76 would get if they just got their shit together and said: "Look, we f'ed up, multiple times even, too many times to be exact, but we've decided to pull ourselves together and fix every damn bug there is, balance the game with the communities help and make it the best damn fallout experience ever possible".
---
That would be amazing, sort of like a No Man's Sky 2.0. Heck, I would even buy 1st if they did that.
---
But nooo, management likes to torture their developers and the developers have no more motivation. I firmly believe that the management just put the "failed" brand on this game and that's why updates are coming out so slow and sluggish and BAD.
---
Edit: I wouldn't even give a cr4p about the atom shop not being purely cosmetic anymore if they actually made this game the way it should be.
---
I don‚Äôt need XP. I need SCORE.
---
But hey - why not both?
---
Not garrenteed at all.  I miss all the time with crits, super annoying

UmmMMM excuse me but there's a chubby sheepsquatch plushie that is ten billion times better than the ammo converter and easily the best thing all season, maybe all year. üò§
---
I really liked my old camp spot (near Sutton) and was there for months but I was constantly under attack by enemies and NPCs. I finally moved and haven‚Äôt had a single attack since.
---
I‚Äôve got a TS FFR handmade and it‚Äôs pretty underwhelming as well. I think TS and FFR just don‚Äôt work properly together or something.
---
Thanks!  
---
I just found this. I see that last week‚Äôs was for the Tire Cement Walls. I think that‚Äôs still available today. 
---
Personally, as a FO1st member since day one, I‚Äôm fine with it being limited to returning items.
---
I bet if I had logged every item I‚Äôve ever purchased from the purveyor I could find in that list several times when duplicate prefixes and even duplicate secondaries would appear. But like you say, that‚Äôs a tiny slice of the otherwise varied mix of the pie. Such is the nature of random numbers - sometimes the same number comes up twice in a row.
---
Ok i'll keep this in mind when completing the challenge soon btw nice find. Its insane how much more damage crit hits can do. I can't imagine how much it can do with the right weapons and perks.
---
This is a challenge? I often store my armor and weapons and go live off the land
---
I was talking about in game mechanics only but yes, that's all correct as well.
---
Funny he mentions it. I too opened this thread on the throne
---
You can type out whatever you want. I‚Äôd prefer video evidence, like what I‚Äôve seen before from the dedicated researchers. 
---
Anecdotes aren‚Äôt evidence. Sorry.
---
*Edit: And now you‚Äôve deleted your anecdote. Curious.*
---
I seem to get really close rolls if i buy from her too fast or when i craft pieces too fast.  I now wait 3-5 seconds between every item.
---
Personally, I feel like there shouldn't be any artificial incentives with a heavy FOMO-element to them to try and get people playing the game. The game should be fun enough to play without any of that crap, while keeping the absolute freedom of choosing to not play it for two months straight without missing out on any fun stuff.
---
Daily content is one of the worst things they could've started adding and I for one hope they realize this and take a new approach. Yeah, it's a great way to leash people and drag them into the game, but man can it leave people feeling like crap, and, it can also work to make it so that people will *only* do the daily chores and then get the hell out as soon as they can. That's been my experience, and the experience of pretty much everyone I know, with daily stuff from the past like decade and a half, of how long daily chores have existed in gaming.
---
Are you using the new skin for the camp module you get from the legendary run? If so its currently bugged out and causes the problems you describe here. Otherwise maybe post more info/screenshots.
---
IMO if we can get a 1* legendary item from 3* legendary enemy then we should get a 3* item from a 1* enemy
---
use imgur
---
It‚Äôs Bethesda, I doubt you‚Äôll get atoms lol
---
I am moderately proud of my weapons display. One of every heavy weapon, explosives (missile launcher ect) and some exotics, Spicy tenderizer, fully modded Vats Unknown, The Dragon... I don't put the little letters to describe what they are so no one has ever offered to buy one. Probably best described as a combo of cool( or neat) and wiwrd flexüëç
---
I have my old crafted hunting rifle displayed at my camp that I used from like level 50 all the way to lv80
---
grew attached to it so i keep it on my wall instead of scrapping it
---
That last part is potentially valid.
---
If you recently applied the CAMP module paint you get from the Legendary Run it will bug and do this. Change back to a different skin. You will have to move your camp to do it. :( ETA I think its the Future Tec one.
---
Every missing challenge before SCORE and I reported  they chucked it onto my accpunt eith photos for proof. Never had any issues and usually got them in 24 hours.
---
Yeah, definitely didn't get credited for it. I even logged in on a different character hoping that might do something and no luck. The dailies would be fine, I can make that up no prob, but the 6500 from the weeklies is a real let down.
---
It was like this at launch I think, if my memory is correct
---
Maybe that is my issue then - perhaps I just need to move to a new location.
---
There is no other half to my theory, I never mentioned the effects. They do seem like actual RNG. People can downvote all they want but there's absolutely no way stuff you need to learn the plan for first is as likely to drop from her as the normal weapons.
---
Ok i will look into those btw thanks for the help
---
I am since day 1 as well and I feel like paying for a service should have a bigger payoff like a discount on release. if they want to also have other discounts, sweet.
---
Wow.  I'm surprised my comment wasn't super downvoted.  I was being so pedantic.
---
I was playing. Logged out for like 30 seconds and logged back in, and the 3 weeklies I hadn‚Äôt done and the repeatable were gone
---
I have tse90 combat rifle and a tse Gatling I‚Äôm sellin.  Xbox
---
I need more excuses to say regally
---
For me, it‚Äôs 3500. For some reason, the repeatable disappeared
---
Ya I am using the new skin I will take it off and see if that works thanks
---
oh yea!! thanks =p - added them
---
Oh, I *know* I‚Äôve gotten duplicates or near duplicates.  But if those two occurrences are at #3 and number #789 out of 1000, no one blinks an eye. If they happen at #175 and #176, people freak out.
---
Humans have an innate need to apply an assumption of order to chaos.
---
That looks intentional...
---
Love it  need to do a fallout cosplay thinking of doing a gilli marine
---
I would swear that noise used to play when either one of your teammates went down, or when you downed someone else. Then it went away for a long time, but it's back as the alarm to wake you up from your loading screen nap. 
---
Also why do we have to re-team each match now?
---
Am I overlooking it or is the Fridge a Fallout 1st exclusive and you have the non-fo1st atomic shop? There is a fridge for 600 caps that you can put 15 items in and will have 50% reduced spoilage. No power required for it either.
---
Humans...
---
I wish I would have kept a level 35? I think two shot hunting rifle that was my go to for so long.
---
Does that skin go over any equipped backpack?
---
interesting!
---
yeah i didn‚Äôt have a fridge so i bought it, it was half off
---
Perhaps the question back to you is - did you change anything?  Swap out a perk? (or forget to swap one back after crafting, perhaps?)  Normally on a team, but now solo?  Do you have a disease of some sort?
---
Accidentally lose a mutation, or have one suppressed (I‚Äôm thinking twisted muscles here) Change a piece of armor and lost an STR point?  Usually run with lone wander, but were on a team?
---
As for a melee perks and mutations - After the obligatory marsupial and speed demon, I like healing factor, twisted muscles (if you have class freak2 or 3), and adrenaline.  
---
For perks, incisor, glowsight, martial artist, gladiator, nerd rage.  Bloody mess if you have the spare points in LCK (after starched genes 2 and classfreak2 or 3)
---
Since things that fly (SBs, vertibots, cargobots) and turrets are a pain in melee, I also have stabilized.
---
Motion assist servos on the PA torso (+2 STR)
---
either Shielded BoS underarmor (+3 STR) or Shielded Secret Service underarmor (+4 STR).
---
I personally bought it because a atom shop version doesn't show when scrapping armor or when selling it. That alone is enough to me. I also like and like to have cool versions of what i use.
---
&gt;The idea that all of the money they get-- or even a majority of it-- goes to the game maintenance/servers, or even development, is bullshit. It was bullshit when people used this excuse to cover Blizzard's ass while they made billions from monthly subs in WoW. It was bullshit when applied to the major studios who started to churn out their own MMOs so they too could squeeze the cows. And it's bullshit now.
---
It's not bullshit. It's reality. It may not be the majority of costs, but it cannot be ignored. Even if it is for example 20% of costs, then it's still a lot in the who scope of operating an online game.
---
In case of actively developed live-service game, the majority would be probably developer payrolls. You NEED to pay people who are developing the game further. In the end, it doesn't matter what the ratio of server costs to developer salaries is. The game needs cash to stay alive.
---
Live-service games NEED extra money, that's the reality. Some games restrict access behind monthly subsription. Some games lock content behind paywall. And some games lock only some extra cosmetics behind paywall. Every system has flaws. Every method of extra monetisation sounds awful when presented from a certain angle. But the general concensus is that monetising cosmetics is the least painfull way.
---
Nerd rage?
---
I feel like they would be much cooler if other players were allowed to Inspect them and see what makes them special, if anything.
---
Not on board with what you are suggesting but get where you are coming from to an extent. 
---
Move your camp around and try out different build spots.  There are a lot of spots on the map where you will basically never get attacked.  In the rare case you do usually a companion npc is able to kill them all without turrets.  My last build spot I could go weeks without repairing anything, and when I did have to it was usually a single stalk of corn.
---
On the other hand there are a lot of spots where you will get attacked constantly and it sounds like you set up shop on one of them.
---
Did it work?
---
What sucks is I was playing with a high level friend and I was the only one running into the mines grabbing ores. Everyone else is just shooting away doing the killing and I barely made 3/4 reward goal by myself. I had to avoid deathclaws and those big ass ghouls trying to do 50 percent if not more of the event.
---
I know right? There should totally be a ‚ÄúKeep Team‚Äù option! Then again, it shouldn‚Äôt kick you out to the main menu after every round, either.
---
I‚Äôd like to see true exclusives beyond the ranger armors and atomic camo, that actually are interesting and engaging. 
---
I end up wearing my Elder‚Äôs Battlecoat more often than any of my FO1st exclusives.
---
Doesn't matter really, you can't see their legendary effects or inspect them in anyway.  They could just be run if the mill non legendary guns as far as anyone other than the owner is concerned.
---
Then don‚Äôt toss nukes in public servers if you have issues with people killing it too fast.
---
The Favorites Wheel is generally super laggy for me, but I don't think it started with applying Ghillie stuff, although that's something I had done before.
---
CHAD: A fallout 76 Story is pretty good. It's a podcast though.
---
I use the Lost? emote because it looks like a clock.
---
That's some good advice. It's worth trying.
---
I agree with you completely.
---
Foundation thanks you.
---
this happens to me with all doors
---
Fun fact: Craft Throwing Knives.  Instead of using your equipped weapon, use the Throwing Knives.  Progress counts!
---
EDIT: For a much faster method (also risky), go to Whitesprings Resort.
---
You are right, Turtle. OOOOOPS I mean Gartman
---
They are adding pets though, so I'd just wait and get a cat that way. Keep something cool for now üëçüòâ  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.eurogamer.net/amp/2020-04-24-fallout-76-to-add-pets
---
You get downvoted but you speak the truth.
---
Amazing how many players still haven't an inkling of how the AI works.
---
Unarmed damage perks
---
Good luck
---
I listen to a podcast introduced to me by bethesda and a youtuber called CHAD: A fallout 76 story, its pretty good. Kinda like old time radio, which caught my interest. I listen to it from time to time, and i recommend it.
---
Very incorrect. Unless they are hidden and not firing.
---
I am GARTMAN!
---
Yah I went there after a sqb event and saw a dead one there too.  I think a bunch of mirelurks were fighting with it just before I got there.
---
My sloth disappeared somehow on sunday. üò•

EVERY DAMN TIME I HEAR THAT SENTENCE ü§£ü§£ ‚ÄúOH NO YOU DON‚ÄôT, BITCH‚Äù
---
punch robos at low level robot spawns, by the vault, the water treatment station, vault tec agriculture, mama dolces, ect
---
It has to do with her unarmed attack. If she can't reach you with it, she will take to the air or not land at all.
---
Wisely bought a console
---
Laughs in pc master race
---
The Unstoppable Monster. A bloodied gauntlet which was a reward in Survival mode.
---
And here i thought they should expand it to make it a wave event.  Make people really work the layering defense and funneling aggressors into kill boxes.  Of course they would also need to fix the lvl 5 super baddy that can shoot from 5 miles away.
---
This is my issue with the whole display feature. Is that a Bloodied 25 25 Fixer or the Fixer you got when you finished Lying Lowe at level 30? Is that one of Ward‚Äôs missing Medical Scanners it just a Biometric Scanner? Not being able to inspect significantly negates the purpose of displays of rare items.
---
Yes you can.
---
I realized that my radiation likes to reset itself to 25% every time I log out, super annoying. Thanks for the pointers though, but since I'm a total troglodyte I speced my character so poorly because I've changed my style (Over 4 times) since Beta.
---
One of the tents (xmas,raider) has navmesh so she can see and smack players on it. Sometimes even land on it.
---
The others do not, so she can't deal with it.
---
Your losing wt reduction items on your actual items.
---
I use a vampire SMG as a tagger in events, and dont stress over perks for it.
---
SMG has lower damage per shot, but fast enough fire rate to kill if necessary.
---
THat said, If yours happens to be explosive, I believe any of the related expl perks provide a benefit.
---
Publicly it makes sense, don't want witch hunts after a potential innocent player so they stop it altogether.
---
That's why I liked it. I had learned that if you're going to use abbreviations, you need to show what they stand for first and it's nice to see someone do that.
---
I know it's completely unrelated to fallout but it just stood out to me to see someone do that.
---
Also wrong sub altogether.
---
It gets really laggy for me especially during SBQ fights. Really annoying
---
The sheep staff has more damage then the super sedge. Plus it has burning affect and bleeding.
---
Bs. Our discord kills over 100 queens per week. No issues with fence standing. Tent placement is a different issue.
---
Edit: none of us shoot her in the air. That‚Äôs the problem - staggering her during her landing animation.
---
‚ÄúScorched‚Äú version.  (I‚Äôve seen a few in the wild)
---
That rug was a Valentine‚Äôs Day item the Atom shop
---
Objects placed within the real world are carefully optimized around with many shenanigans.
---
Sometimes you remove a part of bottom tire when it's a static object so player doesn't see it.
---
Same like when you enter power armour your whole body , equipment literally disappears to safe some memory. No need to game to calculate something that player doesn't see.
---
There is also occlusion culling method which is used in every game. Game will render what you see only from specific angle of view, ie items behind you vanish to safe memory. I'm not sure if it's applied to workshop placed items.
---
Or manually placed invisible volumes that tell the game "don't show until I move here or here".
---
There is a LOD system, each object has few variant of less detailed version that changes depending on your distance.
---
What I mean by those pre-placed objects by Bethesda are always optimised manually. That's why you don't see every building open but separated into their own "loading screen" cell.
---
We players who use workshops can't do that. If you ever played ARK survival evolved you will get it 
---
BUT Conan Exiles somehow managed to get their own building system work properly and is much much more complex and bigger and if I'm sure there are no budget limits. People have extremely big bases that load in seconds. That's amazing
---
But heads up. Bethesda announced they will add interior-camps. That could mean a lot higher budget limit so far
---
Didn't know that, thanks!
---
If they had a scrapping bench they would be really useful.
---
I had my first encounter with a hacker/cheater/call it what you will tonight. I'd just gunned down a grafton monster and was 1 kill away from the daily. Had a good weapon, a set of T-51b and hadn't run into anyone at that point, yet seconds later, I get blown apart without warning.
---
I'd thought someone got a lucky shot, but the weirdness started then. The guy was solo, had 25 kills (so half the server in other words and there hadn't been a nuke launch that could explain a tally that high so early on) and had no obvious weapon equipped. I watched him go over the Grafton dam and he acquired 4 more kills despite there being no signs of other players near him. I reported the name, blocked it and quit out after that.
---
I think you summoned the downvotes just now. I upvoted you at least but this damn sub  ...
---
That's the sad reality, because the in-game information is wrong more times than not.
---
I sometimes love to play as a berserker and you can imagine my surprise when the little character in a hazmat suit with 0dr suddenly sees two deathclaws staring into their face :D
---
work around is to lock both entrances and make sure the doors are closed when you leave the camp. worked for me so far. I think it has to do with allies wanting to get into the garage.
---
Best answer. I did all those challenges inside whitespring like this.
---
My spot was the stair at mid galleria where turrets cannot reach you but many robots spawn.
---
- ONE GUN ARMY
---
- TANK KILLER
---
- ENFORCER
---
- MODERN RENEGADE
---
Eh.
---
It would be tough.
---
You have weight reduction armor on, I'd assume. Entering power armor removes your regular armor, so everything goes back to its original weight.
---
I use it to make dense as hell bush cover in nuclear winter when I have to play that god forsaken game mode
---
Thats sad to hear. Thank for the answer
---
The spots she can land in or "see you" at are very small compared to the bunker.
---
It is easier to say "she won't land" so players don't get the wrong message.
---
Vats only. It's still pretty useful though.
---
Tank Killer triggers stagger. Wait for her to land
---
Wow, awesome! üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª
---
At least, not without knowing what Bethesda will offer for events in the future.  If they end up doing double or even triple XP or SCORE later on, for example...
---
Technically, we're not even at the halfway point if they keep to the 70 days.  I'm Rank 89 myself.  So, I think it's doable if you started now, but you're going to have to do everything right and hope the stupid thing doesn't glitch out.
---
He has a ghouls skin already...
---
NP.  
---
I got lucky and was pretty content with my build by about L56.  
---
At 221 now, I think I‚Äôve moved all of 1 point since I made L56. 
---
Started as a 1H melee/sniper (15 STR, 13 PER), but added the heavy perks when I started doing SBs regularly.   Charisma got shorted, but I  usually played solo, so it didn‚Äôt matter much.
---
if you're near California, there are some [people you should meet](https://www.wastelandweekend.com/)
---
And if he's good at fixing stuff maybe fixes your camp automagically?
---
You would divide by 0 and the game would implode in itself.
---
There are a few valid spots she can land on on the bunker. But it is very small compared to the bunker overall. 
---
It is better to say she can't land. Otherwise you need to show screenshots of the 2x2m area where you are standing to the noobs who are going to stand wherever they please.
---
It would be extremely difficult for you. You would have to do every single daily and weekly and on top of that farm 220k xp every single day until the season ends (40 days).

---
Me too.
---
Let me give you another scenario and see what you think.
---
‚ÄúHey guys, so I just accidentally found out that if you sell something to a vendor, buy it back but quit the game while buying it back, it‚Äôll end up in your inventory but also stay in the vendor inventory, duplicating it, so don‚Äôt do it! It‚Äôs a bug, very bad, don‚Äôt do it! ‚Äú
---
Now, what response to that would you expect?
---
I may sound naive, but what on earth is a "hexadecimal player name"?? I mean, I know what hexadecimal is, base 16 numbering, but....
---
If you‚Äôre going for rewards and not xp consider using a shotgun with enforcer to shoot out ghoul legs, just don‚Äôt kill them and not to many enemies will spawn, just be sure to coordinate with other players
---
I mean I've been playing since the beta, and the vast majority of the time that people are on elevated ground, she refuses to land. In cases where people are entirely out in the open, it's fine.
---
I didn't have to go until I read these comments...
---
That is very cool
---
Agree with the others.  
---
You have WR armor, deep pocketed armor, or backpack, or all 3.
---
Those are auto-unequipped when you enter PA.
---
On a relative scale, only gaining 35# isnt bad.  With 5 pieces of deep pocketed WR armor and a high capacity backpack, I gain over 300 when I get into PA.
---
One thing in common I seen all hackers I've come across had were guns that wouldn't stop shooting.
---
Yeah if they changed it to mighty (+25% base damage, no shitty inaccurate 2nd projectile) it would be much better and mutants should be exactly as op said , assassin's should be changed to include human NPC's aswell as players and buffed to 30% damage
---
614 damage that sounds low
---
Damn, well i will try to hit some low tier rewards, thanks though.
---
Have you finishes Belly of the Beast?
---
Lol! Too bad it doesn‚Äôt. Like I said, she lands.
---
