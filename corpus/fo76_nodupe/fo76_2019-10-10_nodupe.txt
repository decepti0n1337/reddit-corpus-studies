That is much much better than I have received.

---
If they want to use their instancing technology for Wastlanders and other DLCs, they will have to introduce a lot more interiors where it could be utilized ;)
---
Meanwhile for heavy guns it's the other way around.
---
Wait till Wastelander‚Äôs, you‚Äôll regret your opinion when the next DLC and patch wave releases. Human NPC‚Äôs, FO3 and New Vegas Dialogue System, Raider settlements and settler settlements in largely unoccupied and isolated locations, Backstories to Raiders and Settlers (the minutemen) and Private Servers (local worlds) with mod support to add extra content and bug fixes from the mod community.
---
Haha oops! Was asking a reply to go hunt for cute pics of the bears...but hey anyone can be my friend! Im Lvl 140
---
Just 2 more limbs to go for that sweet PA.
---
Do you raid with randoms or friends?
---
Nah, I've been doing the atom challenges too to outfit the camp because I don't want to buy caps.
---
Here is my tag 
---
MY1SIN
---
PS4 LVL 140
---
ANYONE can friend me!
---
I will hunt the map with anyone for cute pics!
---
I have no FO76 friends. No one I know plays. I'm a lone wanderer.
---
Truth, basic mechanics understanding puts you ahead of most of the playerbase, its a nice change when you get challenged occasionally. I‚Äôm not amazing skill wise either im probably slightly above average when playing a more skill based shooter
---
I like the Burrows. But then again I just played it for the first time a month ago. I‚Äôm in it right now and just picked up a 3 star uny scout arm ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
no, yes, a lot
---
That blows.   This toon is a dumbass.  Oh well.
---
IMO Reddit prices are different from in game prices where most players are not on Reddit. 
---

---
Traders who are active on the Market sub probably have a pretty good idea what an item‚Äôs value is. But players in game don‚Äôt have the same sensibility. 
---
This is why we sometimes find great deals and sometimes get nasty messages saying our prices are way too high. 
---
For my part, none of my best items is in my vending machines. I only place items there that I can‚Äôt trade for equally good stuff and then I price those items for about 20% less than I‚Äôd expect I could sell it on Reddit. To me it‚Äôs worth 30% to avoid agreeing on a meeting place and time, dealing with the trade glitch, dealing with a guy who says he has the caps but doesn‚Äôt and has to hit the vendor as soon as he‚Äôs farmed some items to sell, and so on. 
---
But as for a pricing standards by item/effect, that might work for in game PVMs but the Market gets too crazy to standardize.
---
A guy recently got a BE Less Vats fixer from the Purveyor and the market went berserk! Players offered multiple armor sets, weapon packages plus thousands of caps. It was insane.
---
I can see your point and I understand that you find enjoyment in the element of surprise that is so much more likely interacting with a human than with an NPC. I think that you and everyone who thinks like you have a completely valid point and ok, go have fun! The ONLY part I object to is that "I" and lots of other people like me don't want to play that game. That's it in a nutshell. No one is wrong. We just have different things we enjoy. THAT is why I thought the "Survivor Servers" were a great idea. Get everyone who thinks like you onto your own world where you can have fun and no one is going to complain! Just like me and my kind need to have our own place where we don't have to deal with an aspect we don't like! VERY SIMPLE!! 
---
Sadly it looks like there wasn't enough of "you guys" to support that server so now you're back here with us and so begins the complaining.
---
Build a camp and drop some water purifiers down. You'll never be thirsty again. Or you could plant lots of corn and razorgrain at your camp and make tons of soups with boiled water. Your hunger and thirst is taken care of.
---
Yup. Done that one a few times. Like tagging the super mutants that it is tearing apart for a lil extra XP
---
I‚Äôm level 140 and live in the Forest, because it‚Äôs a nice relaxing place to put down roots and build a home with no chance of being destroyed by marauding monsters. Worst I get is a few Liberators or Mole Rats, easily dispatched by a single machine gun.
---
My vendors are full of low-level recipes and items useful for new players or newly leveling-up characters, with plenty of foot traffic from my proximity to early-game Flatwoods locations. Water, food, undefended scavenging spots, vendor, all right there.
---
Yet in terms of gameplay content, yeah‚Äî there‚Äôs nothing much there.
---
There were some very short, generic caves that were recycled. Not actual "dungeon" style caves but big one room areas.
---
I wish we could have multiple camps (but only have 1 spawned), that'd at least allow me to experiment and try new builds. Current camp budget is maxed, can't really explore all the new shop goodies unless i scrap and start over. And that is something i don't really want to do given how much time i've put into my current camp.
---
No, sorry if I didn't explain my self well enough. I know what Incels are and by definition they are a pretty sad little group who seriously need help. I was commenting (and blurring my point) on the larger aspect of men without female mates because there are large parts of India and China where because of the one child rule and the bias towards (or in favour of) male children, there is now a huge imbalance. There are literally thousands of men facing the prospect of never having a wife because there simply aren't any women where they live. Oddly enough I don't hear about them driving a van down a sidewalk and killing innocent people at random.
---
Sorry for the late response but I got back to you! üëç
---
Yes I have seen this issue
---
I used to grind Challenges and Daily Quests in Survival Mode :( 
---
I wish I had the fortitude to get them done in Adventure Mode, but unfortunately, these dailies have become a menial task and are no longer a challenge. They really need to implement a harder server, whether it has PvP or not.
---
Yeah but that's really only held together by one perk, a good one don't get me wrong, but if stabalized wasnt power armor exclusive i dont believe this would be true.
---
PA is an iconic part of fallout and I just feel any character that isnt stealth based should feel more powerful by stepping into their "Power" Armor.  Instead all my toons above 50 feel kind of awkward and gimped ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
could you try to mine the crap out of the shielded drop rate for casual and raider under armor please? also the drop locations?
---
be epic if you could as been farming the raider one for nearly a year now :(
---
tbh,most important tip I'd say is up until level 50, I'd use any and all cool weapons I'd get my hands on as most won't be "viable" after a certain point. Don't min/max anything, don't plan for anything - just learn the game, screw up a little while doing that and enjoy! Because frankly, after level 50, things get incredibly stale and if you decide you'll stick with the game even after that, you'll have a chance to minmax your perks, weapons and stuff!
---
Haha he got you there
---
Im a fallout fanatic.  I‚Äôve played them all and still revisit New Vegas occasionally.  As a day one player with over 1200 hours, and arguably an equal investment, maybe more..  I can only agree.
---
They need to do something or I am going to move to 2077, or Outer Worlds...  The only silver lining is I can return when I‚Äôm bored of the above games and see what has changed.  
---
I hope they ‚Äòsee the signs‚Äô
---
It‚Äôs really up to you. Wanna use rifles? Stack the rifleman perk cards. Same for pistol and heavy weapons. Lock picking and hacking are always good to get. Bloody mess and adrenaline perks are going to give you increases to damage and action boy/girl give increases to action points. I run a heavy weapons bloodied build. I‚Äôm basically a glass cannon, I do shit loads of damage, but if I get mobbed I‚Äôm going to have a bad day. My buddies run the opposite of that with heavy weapons so they tank for me while I burn down targets. There‚Äôs also the charisma cards that can give buffs to you and your party. Lastly under intelligence there are cards that will repair your gear to 200% and will keep your gear from breaking down too fast. 
---
Oh and pipe pistols when converted to rifles benefit from the pistol and rifleman perks so you can double dip on getting more damage from them early on.
---
Tank Killer actually works with all rifles, regardless if they are automatic or not. Same for Ground Pounder even though it only mentions automatic rifles.
---
No, Skyrim was infinite because you could play vanilla content in this massive sandbox and then once you were finished all of that you had community generated content, some of it even better than what the original developers released.
---
Thanks
---
Dammit. Thanks anyways
---
I just sell mine. They do trigger the side mission, but at very random times, at least for me.
---
That's quite a few words to admit you have no idea that, while it DOES shoot chem darts, it's NOT used to "tranquilize" anything.
---
And the challenge is to figure out the most effective way to kill a bear with a weapon that only does about 30 damage over 10 seconds - without dying before the bear does.
---
The intent of the Radstag, Wolf, and Bear hunts is to get you to figure out the most efficient way to fulfill the requirement - which is to use a different weapon to reduce their health,  and then use the Syringer the coup d'grace.
---
Snarky comment aside - Your welcome, glad I could help.
---
I'd like to see our choices actually effect the world we're trying to rebuild. Like how people react to us and so on, kinda like fable, like if we look evil then they react a certain way.
---
Skyrim's dungeons also had interesting stories to figure out through environmental story-telling; this is my favorite part of Skyrim, and I hope 76 adds these kinds of dungeons to the game following Wastelanders.
---
If you pick one up it triggers the quest but it seems that you can only put in one at a time. I've got over 100 just sitting there. Even when I do the quest with more than one it just takes one
---
I‚Äôve run into one about half the time when I visit the NAR Repair Yard, west of Watoga Station. Usually a Legendary Sheepsquatch fighting other enemies there (Supermutants or Scorchedbeasts). You can fight at range from inside the barracks, once you deal with the other enemies.
---
Funny, Fallout 1 had a more Mad Max aesthetic. Fallout 4 felt less fifties more 60s
---
Dude if u have ps4 you better ad me!
---
Tickets? I assumed frog legs were rewarded once you leveled up randomly? I didn't know about these tickets..?
---
Instigating Explosive Fixer is better.
---
The wool Pooh is gonna get you
---
Oh very handsome guy. The human isn't so bad either!
---
But then she would be mildly uncomfortable.
---
Yeah they added this thing where when you get a duplicate it gives you an ‚Äúoverseer ticket‚Äù you can use towards buying a new perk you don‚Äôt have. Frog legs costs 10, whereas a more common one or less OP one would be like 1-3.
---
Yeah that what happens to me aswell, like when i pick up a new one it triggers the Quest and only that single new one i picked up gets turned in.
---
My friends and I endgamed a long time ago and haven‚Äôt been back since. Too many other good games to play rather than sit and make an alt or camp build to justify this games existence. We‚Äôll probably come back when that Wastelanders thing hits but not right away. We‚Äôll wait for the new bugs to be sorted out, which probably means we‚Äôll never play again.
---
Where can I see that it cost 10?
---
That sucks. Stupid question you know frog legs takes about 9 agility and you can only have one card for each special. Kinda annoying as my build is low char so I can't use any of the high level char cards in me. As for the tickets that's kinda crappy.
---
Hm ok, i will try to drop some more randomly. Maybe it will trigger.
---
I got my swamp cat pet a while back, since then its brought much joy to the visitors to my camp and has even inspired them to get pets of their own.
---
They r worth doing as you can get the bos power armor paint schemes eventually. For the rest just sell them. They don't give many caps and although they weigh nothing clears up your invent
---
Yeah, I have 13 agility and unequipped my other agility perk so I could equip frog legs. That's when it said I didnt have enough special. Which is fine whatever I'll just try again. But the thing that's infuriating is that it took my 10 tickets and frog legs is now once again locked meaning I have to spend another 10 to unlock it again and hope it works this time.
---
I'm waiting for the game to get more difficult, like a hardcore survival mode (I affectionately call it 'Nightmare mode'); it's just too easy for me right now, I can't even enjoy the game for what it is.
---
Sorry but I'm not watching any video. 
---
Post a picture and a description if you're serious. 
---
Otherwise I'm just going to assume this is a desperate ploy to get views for your channel.
---
My Gauss Rifle rounds fire in FO4 VATS slo-mo... so that‚Äôs nice.
---
Yeah it has some seriously screwed up glitches. It may not give you any joy but put in a ticket with Bethesda. It may not get your tickets back but hopefully they.might fix it
---
Yes. Fix adventure then bring back NW. it‚Äôs a ‚Äújack of all trades‚Äù situation.
---
Thats what im trying to get. Never rly bothered about that but yeah what else should i do with these things ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Alright, guess im gonna just sell the old ones and pick the new ones up one by one. Thx for ur Info.

---
Yeah it seems like it. Atleast for someone else i know. But for me i still had a good bunch left from Looting and also bought some from random Vendors hoping i could turn them in.
---
I havnt seen this on the queen fight but has been happening the same way on AWOL armaments event the gusty will glow but never gain his stars
---
Present.
---
Hit up the filthy casual discord/subreddit and then jump to a bunch of camps looking for gatling plasma. Then randomly look for flatwoods monster and then idle for 29 minutes while watching epic rap battles of history and mst3k. 
---
All in a days work.
---
I'm not saying it's ideal, but survival challenges were easy regardless, the biggest factor of course was the lack of quick travel.    Not much lost if they added those weapons for AM challenges.
---
And it's not a fair comparison between survival challenges (which were partly made to boost survival populations) which were very easy to the end game raiding rewards of the vault.
---
The only one you turn in is the one that triggers the quest. Just toss the others. They‚Äôre pretty common.
---
It's like they left space for later development so they could continue work past the minimum-viable-product stage because they were planning to fund continuous development from long before the game was ever initially released. Holy shit! Crazy right?!

Sure. Bloodied Unstoppable Monster has no rival. But with shotgun healing enemies and those damage caps from survival, people discovered commando was dangerous.
---
I got halfway through and quit from boredom and irritation. Annoying small ( and sometimes flying ) bullet sponge enemies while gathering 50 of something isn‚Äôt a fun time for me. 
---
And hours for maybe two to three 1* or 2* legendaries?
---
No thank you.
---
I couldn't even find the place to submit tickets for in-game bugs on their support page. They have multiple categories to submit tickets and none have a category or sub category for in-game bugs encountered. So I just put it under the closest thing i could find. Doubt anything will come of it but here's hoping.
---
I don't know about the burrows. I don't make in-game choices based on meta-game knowledge so I've never found my way there.  I actually understand the fundamental challenges of Role Playing Games and don't ruin them for myself and everyone else with literally everything I do all of the time.
---
A typo. Don't you love predicktive text. And before you say it Yes I know. It was on purpose

Of course, you already knew that. Who else would it be?

Try the one on top of the watoga high school, next to the ransacked tent. that one is almost always there since they stopped the legendary protectrons from spawning.

This is one that can actual affect stability. Idk why it's not fixed yet.
---
This.
---
It didn't used to. Flatwoods monster doesn't have the alien tag. There's another similar creature that's blue instead of purple. That one ALSO didn't have the alien tag.
---
Vendor bots buy for 1 cap at stations.
---
Why yes, thank you for stating the obvious.  Doesn't change the fact that despite that there still is too much emptiness in the map even accounting for leaving space for further development. Almost like the game was super rushed near the "end" of its initial release.  The current state of the map and endgame is why I'm hoping Wastelanders fills the map with more places, people and things to see and do.
---
You‚Äôre gonna have to abandon it and start it again. But be prepared to repeat this process.
---
What system do you play on?

Oh, sorry, forgot, here it is, btw i works perfect for me and on my son's computers, but other's dosent seem to notice any difference...

---
I've been having this problem ever since the SBQ events of about two weeks ago.  It's just everyone going there and looting the place.  You can try jumping servers but I've literally jumped probably eight or nine times and maybe found only one or two ammo bags that someone missed from before.  Yesterday was the first time I found Camp McClintock fully stocked with ammo bags.  And what happens? I get killed 20 minutes later and all my dropped junk bag glitches out.  Which included my scrapped ammo bags.
---
I constantly add and remove mutations for myself and my friends, since I can make all 19 serums on two of my characters. I've experimented with this a lot, because the cost to me is almost nothing. 
---
All of your mutations show in your pipboy stats under Effects. Sometimes you have to scroll down a bit to see them. Sometimes it's confusing right after you've taken a serum, because you'll see the serum effect at the top of your Effects screen and the mutation effect at the bottom. 
---
You should also never take Starched Genes off. It's too easy to accidentally take RadAway or step through a decon shower and lose a mutation. The notifications when you lose a mutation ARE bugged and often don't appear. Likewise, you'll often gain a mutation you don't want, even from the smallest radiation hit. Taking a Serum with Starched Genes on has zero downside. It does not prevent mutation acquisition from a Serum, and the card clearly says that "You will never mutate from RADS."
---
One other thing to consider is that you may simply being looking at the wrong character. If you have multiple characters or accounts, their mutations may not be the same.
---
&gt;endgame
---
Grow up. 
---
The whole concept of "endgame" is horseshit. You rushed through the story, ground to high levels, and ignored a lot of what you could do and now you're crying that you're out of content when you ignored most of what is there.
---
Ime if you miss with a vats shot, the next shot i connect will deal its damage.
---
An instigating LE is brutal, but have a furious or AA to back it up for long fights.  
---
I run both a stealth sniper and a stealth commando.  I‚Äôd take the furious either way on the fixer and look for an instigating HR or LE for a sniper build.
---
I run around and kill many things, I  sell legendarys at my camp really cheap if I don't want them and can't get more script for them, I do a lot of events, and I like to make my camp look pretty and hunt other people's camp for plans I don't have
---
If you are on PC, I can show you 10 at Poseidon, 7 at and near Whitesprings, and more than a few at Morgantown.
---
I'm not as familiar with the Morgantown ones as I've found many of them more recently but I'll do my best to get them.  There are 3 that I'm certain of and at least a couple more that I've found but are a little trickier to find again.
---
I used to experience this. But dont believe the % chance. Generally I see me missing shots that are closer, not actually farther away. Like i can shoot enemies through walls almost, but god forbid if I'm trying to hit the enemy thats right in front of me.
---
This is why I wont buy weapons or armor from a vendor or trading site, i have to earn it.  Not saying you didnt earn yours, just that buying it would ruin the game for me and I would have nothing to do.
---
People shit all over me when I said taking survival away was a bad idea, now the survival people make the newer adventure mode people uncomfortable, because they literally can‚Äôt do any damage to a good build, nothin like watching a bunch of 0s in your damage numbers as you get boned for your petty Morgantown airport workstation, cause that‚Äôs like one of the only ways to pvp in adventure.

I doubt that's what it is. Nukes get launched all the time, just join Scorched Earth for the far superior repair kits. I have so many of them I use them exclusively to repair my armor instead if mats.

18 is the cap. You can have all 19 mutations at the same time, with the exception of not being able to have both Herbivore and Carnivore at the same time.
---
I'm not a metagaming bitch so there is a lot to do because I don't use broken builds that make the game too easy.

In Skyrim you spent a lot of time in caves. In FO4 it was building interiors.  All fun.  In FO76 I just ran around looking for something to do or managed my inventory.  Not Fun. Work.
---
I did what someone else recommended, which was to remove the mutations cards and go through a rad shower or pop some radaway to remove my mutations and start over. When popping radaway, I got a notification that I'd recovered from Herd Mentality, so it's apparently bugged in such a way that it doesn't show up in the active effects tab of the pipboy some time.
---
Check out all BOS fire bases in the bog. Each have at least one or two easily

Grounded can be verified easily enough by looking at an energy weapon's damage output before and after class freak is removed. Your energy resistance will also be higher than your armor provides for.

I have a maxed budget camp and was able to tame a deathclaw. Its not hard. It can die and can sometimes be buggy but i think its worth it. Word of advice a megasloth sounds cool until its groaning all the effing time lol

&gt;you can only have one card for each special.

That is not true. You can have multiple cards for each special as long as you have the points required.

I only have one character on one account. I ended up doing what someone else said to do, removing the mutations cards and popping some radaway to start fresh on mutations. Got a notification that I'd recovered from Herd Mentality, so it was apparently bugged in my pipboy to not show up no matter how much I scroll.

Ahhhhhh yes, the Mules. Every one needs love.  And it's not much we can give out. We had some peeps just leave the bag. And I assumed the "Mules with a moral compass" were the ones who walked away....

You're like locusts. It's disgusting and everyone knows it.
---
The map is divided into [six named regions](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-12-21-fallout-76-map-level-zones-5076).  Each region has its own general appearance and difficulty level.
---
It can be useful to know what they are called and where they are as some Atom challenges direct you to do a thing in a particular region.
---
Same here.
---
That's a no, then. It's still crap.
---
Have you checked the Bethesda site for what they have done? Everything that had added or done is on there. Bugs are still present and probably always will be. Like the others said you gotta decide on your own.
---
Turn on the damage indicator and try a non-headshot crit shot vs non-crit shot.
---
Headshots do double damage. There is a separate sneak multiplier, usually if you're crouched with a high enough Agility stat relative to your enemy. Certain receivers can boost critical damage, as can certain perk cards. It's hard to sort all of those overlapping multipliers without being careful. Best to just use the damage indicators and do a scientific test yourself.
---
Apocalypse mode?
---
Scorched mode? Just throwing out ideas for the name nightmare mode works well too
---
Nice!! It‚Äôs cool so many people also appreciate the audio. It‚Äôs outstanding.
---
As soon as you discover them in game their name should appear on the map, scrawled in charcoal or pen or something.  In fact, we should be able to jot our own notes on it too.  What's the point of a real map if you can't write on it?
---
Yes! I'm doing the exact same thing. Watching, waiting
---
You get em from free range event. They are rlly rlly rare, and only drop if all 3 cows live. So as a level 300 player that has done the event lots of times and still dosent have the sheep thrown spike, I wish you good luck.

You get them from the Free Range event. Rng.
---
Pretty sure I just discovered 96 today and, yeah, it was shut up tight.
---
Ahhhh shit okay thats makes sense i was like yo wtf i have scrapped sooo manyüòÇ
---
I appreciate your viewpoint but Bethesda doesn't give negative opinions on their own content. My question was whether the game has improved. I was hoping to find out from people who where critical before and may have changed their opinion. Due to the block-chain, the updates are all huge. I don't want to pay $70 updating it to find it hasn't improved. The fan-boys seem hostile, here, as usual. The community is as bad as the game, as usual. So unlike the FO4 community.
---
Today was my first time getting all the ballistic fiber junk at Camp McClintock. It was satisfying.
---
I would be able to forgive it more easily for this particular issue if what none-quest interiors and locations there were had more holotapes or notes. Post BETA one of the big defences people cried out was that the game had vast amounts if lore, with locations full to bursting with holotapes and notes. Except when I finally bought the game about four months ago now, I found that isn't technically true.
---
There \*is\* probably more actual dialog in the holotapes than in the main story of any given game, and maybe even more than in the ambient and passive dialog too, but it's massively weighted towards Main Story locations. The main story has roughly 700 lines of dialog across all the 'forced' holotapes, Rose, and MODUS. I know this because I took screenshots of each and every one because there is something deeply wrong with me.
---
Vault Tech Uni for example is set up as something of a spectacle. Yet, inside are two brief holotapes about two different students thoughts on the school, and handful of terminals with sketchy Vault-Tech teaching methods, and the actually interesting 'testing' experiment is a couple of thousand words all crammed into one terminal and a bit extra on the Dean's terminal.  I don't recall a single normal 'note' and both 'fluff'/irrelevant holotapes are about ten seconds each. And this is one of the bigger and more 'important' none-quest locations. 
---
I don't think there is really anything in, say, the Uncanny Caverns for example.
---
How many people can be in a party?
---
&gt;Okay whatever, half the game is broken on a good day, so maybe its just another bad day.
---
Literally laughing out loud ahahahahah
---
Playing Nuclear Winter, where early round HP and damage resistances are much more consistent and easy to track helps. With plenty of recorded game play and 2 characters @ level 99 and 109, respectively, I've observed that the damage indicators are accurate, with the following nuances: the numbers displayed are your total damage DELIVERED (after accounting for the enemy resistances) and... while the game may accurately display damage DELIVERED, sometimes the game simply neglects to deliver the damage to the opponent. I have video clips where you can clearly see that, on occasion, every 4th or 5th hit to the enemy will simply fail to affect the enemy's health at all, despite the displayed numbers. All of the other hits are accurate and reflect the actual decrease to enemy HP.
---
I've made a radio replacement mod that includes it.. I haven't published it anywhere though.
---
not saying that's wrong but NW works very differently than the base game. at the very least I'm almost entirely positive the displayed damage for explosive GPs do not represent their actual damage.
---
NW as a multiplayer shooter in the same vein as Battlefield, COD etc is criminally underrated imo. The maps are way better than what BF has to offer and it's a hell of a lot more tactical than COD. This new Morgantown map is proper good shit, anyone who wasn't keen on the original should definitely check this one out it's a completely different ball game.
---
With repeatable bosses that drop unique rewards? What a concept
---
I want asbestos stick-on ceiling tiles with gold marble veining, and flecks of glitter. Just like grandma used to have.
---
even dads are crying at that one
---
4 i think
---
My god. I do the same thing
---
A decent Halloween event can keep us interested while we are waiting for Wastelanders. Vault Raids we‚Äôre supposed to do that but it didn‚Äôt work (not surprisingly).
---
The fixer is not part of the drop pool. The only way to get a legendary one is from Mumbles and only if you know the plan for it
---
You need to know the plan to get versions from the Purveyor, but either way it doesn't drop from legendary enemy spawns.
---
Totally agree. Morgantown is awesome, there is so much variety in terrain which lends itself to a lot of different strategy. You can still hide in bushes of course but there are buildings to take cover in, cliffs that overlook the town to snipe from, lots of possibilities.
---
You have to know the plan and you can only get it from Mummbles
---
What about other games that have an end game, is it horse shit there too?
---
Sweet thanks for the info!
---
Congratulations! Did you successfully make Battle Bot 131 times in one day or several days?
---
Anyone know if the plan is worth a trade or just caps?
---
How much damage are you dealing on a hit. As H-t- mentioned, there is a critical threshold where armor and armor pen don't matter, and this threshold is armor=\~15% of damage dealt. Super mutants have around 150-200 armor, so with a base amount of pen getting around 40% pen from mods you only need to be dealing around 500 damage to get over the armor entirely (99% pen technically), which with a hardened instigating sneak crit isn't that difficult to achieve. Armor pen is most effective on weapons whose damage is below 150, and utterly pointless on weapons dealing over 1000 (except on the queen because reasons).
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99kssHaD_yY
---
Not really. I'm still having fun playing.
---
Fixer feels made for commando. Instigating is great for one-two hits weapons. But you can't go wrong. Even a regular fixer can get the job done.
---
How is it broken?  Isn‚Äôt it by design it uses both perks?  Just like pipe guns/rifles. ü§î
---
The dungeon puzzles were pretty braindead tho.
---
You are correct. Which means you keep shooting critically until you hit and 'spend' that critical.
---
&gt;  Private Servers (local worlds) with mod support
---
Wastelanders isn't adding that.
---
They havnt really added any substantial new systems or really content in general. Hell if you look back its just tons of bug fixs , a few quests BR mode thats just a thing , a vault "raid". Its really disappointing compared to ESO's first year with huge changes and improvements and quiet a bit of content was added :c.
---
Got the witch costume just last week near the bridge southwest of Harper's Ferry.
---
There Is something like a 'perfect' timing with it. You need to fire not too soon, not to late for it to work well. And if your first shot was 95 and it missed, exit and re-enter Vats, because you'll keep missing.
---
I would also take Yakety Sax during the encryptid event.
---
Same. Everyone keeps asking for new icons and different hats and crap. Like that‚Äôs really what you want the developers spending their time on? NPC‚Äôs are the only thing that will get me playing again. It‚Äôs gotten pretty stale since there isn‚Äôt any real content.
---
Yup if you ever hop on and see 4-7 camps around sutton, that's us. Tesla Bros are the worst, total hacks. Thankfully you can counter them with distance, and a nice ffr rifle.
---
&gt;Each of those vendors has a 3% chance to sell one of the seven different Dense plans. So, 1/7 x .03 = 0.43% (1:238)
---
Wow, thank you for the very detailed answer, I think I get it now! Someone else, in another thread, said that they are still available,  but not with any of details you've provided.  It's a available, just very rare. 
---
Thanks again, very appreciated!
---
Correction, a 20s Western with 50s sci fi, 30s horror, and late 40s.. I don't know what to call Lonesome Road
---
nah, whales (tiny minority of content consumers that pay a shitton of additional money) make up nearly all atom shop sales
---
*Starts taking Nukashine for a beautiful scenic view.*
---
I saw someone's camp with hundreds of nuke mines in a pile. Strange dupe glitch for sure
---
True I just wish it was a tiny bit cheaper you know
---
I need evidence of this theory, because I have fought her tons of times and sometimes she lands, sometimes she doesn't, sometimes she lands and stays there until death and sometimes she never lands. 
---
The only sure thing is that crippling her brings her down.
---
I agree that the prices are inflated but it doesn‚Äôt cost $14 bucks. You can pay $14, nothing, or a wide range between. Since atoms are given for free they don‚Äôt equate 1 to 1 with hard currency.
---
Caps are so easy to get it‚Äôs almost insane! All you need to do is make runs (like west tek) pick up all the weapons and various crap and go sell it with hard bargain on. And if you can only get level 2 or something then take a grape mentats I think, and it will boost your charisma for better prices. 1400 caps a day will soon become a breeze after you do it a few times. Or buy cheap serums out of player vendors 150-300 and go sell those for 500 a piece to the vendor bots. EASY MONEY.
---
Broken too. They should benefit from one depending on grip/stock.
---
Yeah I think either atom shop things should be cheaper or just don‚Äôt give ya atoms
---
Well FO4 actually had a lot of dungeon type interiors too. If I remember right FO4's map was fairly big. Maybe not as big as Skyrim but decent. It was also heavily populated with buildings. FO76 feels empty almost compared to FO4. Not as empty as say FO3 but pretty close.
---
I think and I agree with one of the people on here who said it...that it feels empty like this because of the stupid no human NPCs thing they started out with. Quests and lore delivered on holotape or terminals only...boring and quick way to make your world seem tiny. By adding in human NPCs...I have to hope the world will feel bigger. I just wonder if they'll be all over the map or only in certain places? Will we see roving bands of friendly settlers and enemy raiders?
---
I see them going for 15k pretty regular and that‚Äôs a fair price in my opinion seeing how I‚Äôve done encrypted like 75 times and never got it! I said screw it and bought it.
---
It is weird they have just not added it at this point.
---
couldn't agree more my man
---
If you're asking about whether the numbers are accurate at their core, the answer is yes. Through NW, you get a cleaner view of the core mechanics involved. Once you start adding in factors from Adventureland, like legendary effects, excessive perk cards, multiple damage types, etc, the odds of inaccuracy increase, I assume. As I mentioned, even with the most basic, core elements of the damage indicator system, it's still inaccurate in the sense that while the displayed value is always displaying the damage you SHOULD BE causing, it sometimes fails to deliver any damage at all.
---
With legendary explosive weapons in Adventure, which cause two or three forms of damage, there are at least 2 damage indicators displayed per hit. One is the secondary or tertiary explosive damage that is occurring at the same time and separately from the main hit. The 2 or 3 displayed numbers must be added to account for the total damage per shot.
---
The atmosphere is awesome and I do sometime just hang out and watch the river when a good rainstorm comes in.
---
*Whoosh*
---
That.. sonny... is the sound of my snide sarcasm, passing above you at medium altitude.
---
There was a new bug that appeared after yesterday's maintenance on Xbox. Players have delayed render times, making them outright invisible/inaudible or making them vanish/reappear (seemingly during lag spikes for the latter). I have a funny video of combat and confusion with invisible players.
---
I would have to agree with this! I run the queen 1-3 times a day and I see this same exact thing. Mostly in my case as she hovers people blast her wings which in turn force her to land. In my experiences she always lands with a crippled limb but doesn‚Äôt always land without one. I did one the other day where she probably spent 95% of the time hovering over us in a field, refusing to land. It was frustrating but we killed her while she was floating there like a dingus!
---
1. Get your diseases cured for free at the domed rotunda at the Wightspring Golf Course water fountain.
---
2. Study character builds,  find one you like, and start working towards it early.
---
3. Get the Starched Genes peek and the Class Freak perk. Then get whatever mutations you want. It's more fun with mutations. I carry all the mutations, and I love it. But specifically, you will at least want Marsupial and Healing Factor.
---
All my camps are at nukashine spots. You wake up and find out you crashed at my place. 
---
And I might have raped you, yes. Grab some free food from the vending machine.
---
Dude do you have a PS4?
---
My friend got it on his first encrypted completion like a week ago. He let me buy the plan for 17k. Lucky bastard.
---
Hey m8 do u need some help? I can make u sone good guns that will help a ton. Armor not really.. But i can surely help with stimpacks,ammo,guns.
---
Ign is amquinn1989
---
Edited!
---
Yes peasants enjoy your sour grapes.
---
This is my build.
---
https://youtu.be/HB5Zfj5Q2U4
---
I do anywhere from 6k-30k per hit on average. It's a Bloodied build. Other good builds are Junkie, Instigating, and Anti-Armor.
---
Would be useful for NW as well when a level 2 is shooting like crazy at a bloat fly and giving away your position
---
Maybe I was there... She got stuck high in the sky, never to land. Some people grew a pair and we spent twenty million rounds but we killed her a minute before it was over.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/8q4juc/i_made_a_map_size_comparison/
---
That would be amazing. You on right now?
---
I personally think the game is awesome. Yes, the bugs can be really annoying but you can easily manage to work around them. I bought the game shortly after day 1 without even hesitating.
---
My personal perspective: you shouldn't judge a game based on people's opinions or reviews, it's better to take that with a grain of salt because everyone's ideas and opinions of what makes a game good are always different. I was very sketchy about Fallout 76 at first cause of it being online only, but I love the other fallout games so much i figured hell what do I have to lose so I get the game and try it out, turns out I love it!
---
We're ready for Wastlanders!
---
No send me a fr and ill be on in 1 hour.
---
I said the EXACT SAME THING! LOL
---
Great idea!
---
Here's more microtransactions instead.
---
Vault PA isn‚Äôt XO-1 it‚Äôs ultracite and you can only get the plans from SBQ
---
I think if they were ‚Äúbroken‚Äù it would have been addressed by now, but who knows.  If they made it only one perk, those weapons would instantly become useless
---
my normal areas for military bags are:
---
the mire/cranberry military bases/camps
---
fort defiance has probably the most in 1 location imo
---
and camp mclinlock tends to have a few
---
If you‚Äôre talking about the metal letters they lay on the cutouts nicely
---
I usually farm the military bases and I use a maxed out white knight card which uses less items for fix armor and armor breaks slower. And when I repair my gear I use the fix it good perk card.
---
solar is standard armor
---
Well that post was certainly debunked.
---
Ohh I‚Äôm sorry I read wrong I‚Äôve been having that issue too lol
---
i had it once for one of my arms, bit a relog fortunately cleared it up for me
---
I have built Batman, Joel from TLOU, Ava and Le√≥n from Resident Evil, Jigen from Lupin III, Axel from the Streets of Rage saga, Denzel Washington from Book of Eli and many others. The game Is much more entertaining when the build needs to satisfy certain limitations. Axel can't use firearms!! Le√≥n uses the 10mm, Joel does not wear armor but makes molotovs and mods melee weapons.
---
I hope they return for Halloween-need to add some scary flair on my PA Char
---
I really bums me out to not be able to mod my armor.
---
When ever I see a camp get nuked I'm all like
---
 " oooohhhh girl who did they piss off!?"
---
where? I seen the comments here talking about 4x map size. map doesnt need to increase, the amount of things /mile needs to increase. what I see beth doing is giving us a nukaworld type map with a second location for max level players.
---
Same boat. Stopped playing as not happy with current state of game. Hoping Wastelanders brings meaningful change otherwise might be out for much longer.
---
I would not say useless. But they would stop being this popular. A meat hook would be just another mole gauntlet.
---
Here's the thing, and I know this is going to be super controversial: stop bringing a knife to a gun fight.
---
The SBQ can FLY. She literally has wings, and I think we've all had enough time to ponder that. Come equipped for the fight. Don't expect a flying monster to land because it's easier for you. Don't expect players with ranged weapons to not use them because it doesn't work for your melee build. Don't expect Bethesda to make an emote for you. Don't expect the entire world to conform to your needs.
---
Learn to fly, bring an appropriate weapon, or spend 5 seconds to send a message. Be prepared. It's a dangerous would out there.
---
yeah simply choose the option to add non-Steam games to your library and select the Fallout76.exe
---
A bethesda rep just gave one up top, read before typing please.
---
I remember building my first home with 2 random I met back on Christmas day. We didn't even know where the doors were. So we just a hole in our house for a couple days.
---
probably pretty high id imagine.  they have already brought back past items (blackbord, hotrod, the rider armors, etc) 
---
we just have no idea of when it happens, it is seemingly random on when they decide to bring stuff back
---
Nice.
---
Pets don't use any camp budget. I'm all for them, I think it's really cool to have a Deathclaw stomping around at my camp. All my friends love him. Lol. The worst part about having a pet is when you log in like I did yesterday and he didn't. He's yet to spawn in again, so I guess I have to go and get another one.
---
I got the red rocket one done, you have to stand at or on the sign with the coolant prices for it to count it.
---
That's why I got my instigating deathclaw gauntlet it one shots all the ghouls at the White spring
---
There were so many limited items and only very popular ones have returned so far like the riders skins this week. If you want something specific you gotta really make a fuss about it.
---
The red rocket ones do work you just have to be in very specific spots for it to realize you're at the filling station.
---
The post is a year old and it was predictions of a map that they haven't even seen. The 76 map is large for a single zone, sure but it's easily explorable from end to end in a few hours. The current map is all you get. It's no where near the size of Skyrim and especially ESO in it's entirety. 76 needs to add zones and expand the map further if they're hoping to keep this game alive.
---
Dumb question, but would they be inside or outside the fort?
---
Honesty have to give credit where credit is due:  challenges as of late aren‚Äôt stupidly annoying like they had been for some time.
---
What is the wastelander update? I havent played since like release week lol
---
For a fun challenge, give your character the Empath mutation as soon as possible :)
---
I think it's happening to a lot of people.  It happens to me on several guns.
---
It's extra fun combined with the bug where after you load it the game seems to think you don't have any of the correct ammo for the gun until you unequip it and re-equip it.
---
i'm ready for wastelanders I don't wear power armor
---
Yea I think that was it! I spent thru all my ammo for my main guns! I would of been real salty if she would of lived!!!
---
Of course, how else can we keep the ceilings from burning?
---
I hit the vendor limit everyday by just cooking all the meat I get and selling it back. I have butchers bounty so that helps, but still, 1400 caps a day to remember to cook and sell meat.
---
Good suggestion, haha
---
Or politely ask your damage sponge vanguard friend to get it if you promise to give them free snacks every day until the end of time
---
Yeah just noticed it on another one of my weapons. That's so odd
---
Nothing gets you into a group faster than saying "I have empath and 15 charisma, who wants ironclad 5?"
---
I'm selling about 50 balistic fiber for 3-5 caps each. I also know a good route. Keep in mind the items with balistic fiber are not instanced so if someone collects them you won't be able to on that server
---
did they trigger?
---
I've been doing the three repeatable quests every day (Stings and Things, Operation Tidy, and the daily one for Biv). By doing this, Campfire Tales, and some of the Possum challenges, I have now unlocked all the backpack mods. I'll continue to work on earning badges.
---
Whenever the 'good' events pop up I do them. Also Encryptid, and Scorched Earth. But what I've been doing a lot lately is making runs through Arktos Pharma. I can clear out ALL the enemies in about 10 minutes, solo. I've been averaging about one 3* enemy each run. This also means I do Project Paradise whenever it pops up. Today, somehow, magically, we kept all three animals alive! I defended the Ghoul, in Zone B, all by myself. Ok, the Alpha didn't show up but if it DID I would have taken him out in seconds. My reward was the Stimpak Diffuser Plan.
---
Also, I've been camp vendor hopping for a few things I want.
---
Buy bulk from all the vendors
---
Uh you mean Fallout 5?
---
[](/kemberirritated)But they didn't make hardly any of that space act like a dungeon. Almost every one of the chests that I assume is meant to be an end of dungeon reward can be easily reached in a few moments walk from the nearest fast travel point. That's not removing a loading screen, that's plopping some mobs randomly around a chest in the middle of any completely open ended structure, and calling it the equivalent of a dungeon.
---
Itd be nice if the challenges worked all the time
---
They usually come back
---
WOW GUYS I did not expect so many responses to my "what's 1337" question, haha -- I'm 24 and genuinely didn't know about it. Didn't mean to make you all feel old. :P
---
I disagree with the whole whale thing. I am not saying the pricing is reasonable but its not a big spenders game. 
---
If you spent like 20 bucks a week on the store you would run out of stuff to buy after awhile. I think in 6-10 months i spent 150 dollars on fallout and have just about everything outside of bundled packs in buildables and a few skins. I use to have a spending habit with 2 phone apps and BDO. In those cases i was spending 100 dollars a week until i quit. Here you would run out in a month or 2 on just that sort of spending.  But hell that isn't even a whale that's just someone with bad money management. Infact that didn't put me in the lead range in those games just in a spot to be comfortably competitive. You have card games like magic or hearthstone where people are spending in the 4-5 digits . Mobile market has people spending 30-60k in a year. This is chump change in the whale pool.
---
For me it's the collect Grognak magazines challenge. One of them counted to grey out the list but didn't count for the total so now it's bugged. It says 9/10, but all 10 are marked as collected. I even tried collecting them all again from world spawns so I've done the challenge twice over but it still won't count.
---
It happens on whatever weapon I log out with, which is only 3 because I'm basically hooked on my Unstoppable Monster. My Combat Shotgun, my 10mm, and my lever action all load in empty. I figured it was all guns, but never tested it.
---
You are aware how time works, right? I typed this before they responded.
---
Theres lots of shit not in the game that should be.
---
Something about flux capacitors.
---
I agree with you but survival was broken long before it was taken out and all the try hards left
---
Both Skyrim and Fallout 4 had their fair share of those kinds of locations, as well. And of course, Fallout games have always been less of a focus on dungeons, anyways, opting far more for environmental storytelling than the gameplay loop of dungeon crawls
---
Happens still with the whitespring sentry bots. Super annoying
---
well please consider my access to flux capacitors before typing please.
---
Congrats on bullying players who don‚Äôt have a PvP build...weird flex, but cool man.
---
[](/abcutesmile)There are plenty of better legendaries you can find randomly while playing, and it's not uncommon to find max level quest legendaries for sale in vendors, both player and normal(I don't understand why people still sell legendaries to AI vendors in this post scrip/vending machine world).
---
happens to me on my handmade, every time. im not sure when it started.
---
I‚Äôll give you a chunk of my liver if you get another one
---
happy cake day
---
Its 2019, they're  everywhere now.
---
Mediiiiiiiccccc!
---
Not survival mode, but survival as in game genre.
---
The easiest way to answer this question is with the Awareness perk, because it updates the displayed resistance values to include any armor penetration that's in effect.
---
The short answer: yes, Tank Killer works, but none of the armor penetrating magazines on rifles or pistols do. 
---
To see that Tank Killer works, equip Awareness (but not Tank Killer) and VATS an enemy. Make note of the relevant resistance value (ballistic/energy). Now, equip Tank Killer and VATS the enemy again, and you will see that the resistance has changed.
---
The boarded up houses always struck me as immersion breaking. Wtf can't I take some boards off and try to enter? WHO boarded up the houses? Did someone go around after the bombs dropped and decide: "yup, that one's condemned, better put up some boards that can't possibly ever be removed, even in 200 years!"? 
---
Given the state of some of the buildings we CAN enter, what could possibly prevent us entering the empty houses in Goodsprings, the office buildings in Boston or nearly every house in Harpers Ferry?
---
Okay, but this is a thread about dungeons. Every other fallout had at least a fair amount of traditional dungeons. Fallout 76 has almost none.
---
[removed]
---
It's not doing it to my handmade for some reason.
---
Why not?
---
Oh right misread it, agree regardless. Honesltly its all the snowflakes complaining about ‚Äúgriefing‚Äù its the wasteland ffs
---
I'm behind on the latest modes of asshattery, it seems. Could someone please summarize what's going on here?
---
I'm also seeing this &amp; it also only shows 30 bullets being carried even though i have 2500 &amp; I can't fire the weapon.
---
Have to unequip &amp; reequip to get it working 
---
On xbox
---
Yeah there's other weird stuff too, like I noticed my bloodied combat shotgun shows 2-3K damage per pellet and there's no way that's accurate. Maybe total damage but no way per pellet.
---
The damage system was accurately showing us when Furious was broken though, so there's that.
---
Yup! A rifleman with stealth perks is one of the most economical builds simply due to the damage per shot you get from stealth and criticals.  So i try and run rifleman as much as possible and switch to Commando for places like West Tek (indoors) where you are going to get mobbed by Supermutants in confined hallways and need wipe out a bunch of high level enemies fast as possible.
---
ah the ole Halo lag switching days are back boys
---
I even threw some knives at her. Ran out of everything. You know you are reaching desperation when you jump and throw baseball grenades at the final boss, who Is practically inmune to them.
---
my resistance in my armor in 500 /450   and i have some great legendary effects
---
My buddy does the same thing and he clears it with ease! He‚Äôs always hounding me to do the same. OP deleted his post I guess since the answer was pretty simple I suppose.
---
I did exactly that. Now I just have a bunch of usless legendaries I cant bring myself to get rid of.
---
With armor like that, I would want power armor either. But strangler PA beats all armor currently due to its bugged damage
---
Imagine how much you‚Äôd like playing a different good battle royal
---
My Western Revolver isn't losing any durability atm. I only have it for sbs that won't land anyway  so I'm not too worried about it, but there's definitely something going on with durability atm. I've sent in a ticket, and you may as well do the same if you're too worried about it.
---
I couldn‚Äôt agree more. I see it every now and again. Such a cool skin.
---
[](/kdashscared)Oh yeah, that's a thing. Careful tho, I'm still not sure if it's related, but I did that a while back with my missile launcher, then tried to swap to my 50cal from my favorites wheel, and it dropped it on the ground for some reason.
---
Use it til it stops working
---
Had a lever that broke and continued to fire. Even after fast travel. 
---
Greatest "bug" ever!
---
Honestly, There is no quest gear that is better than gear you'd find in the wasteland outside of quests, unique to the quests is all they are, but not so viable when compared to non quest gear drop from random legendary enemies. I don't suggest starting from scratch unless you personally want quest gear at max level, I'm level 526.
---
Most unique quest legendaries are not worth waiting until level 50 to get. 
---
You'll find plenty more just playing the game.
---
They expect to have a fix in Early 2021.
---
&gt; FO3 is twisty winding subways leading to hidden areas with a wide wasteland dotted with interesting buildings to explore
---
&gt; FONV has twisting canyons and the same smattering of buildings
---
&gt; FO4 has the greater Boston area and plenty of highs and lows to see
---
This. Fallout 76 missed a great opportunity to have a sprawling system of mine shafts.
---
I‚Äôve been doing that one every day for over a week now and haven‚Äôt picked up any badges from it? Is it just a random chance reward?

Umm.... Johnny Cash released ring of fire in 1963.. the beach boys were popular in the 60's as well. They started in '61. How does it not fit? Same genre. IMO any song released around that decade is fair game. Hell, the song I think fits most for this game... is Radioactive by Imagine Dragons and I would be pretty excited to here that playing. Lyrics are perfect.
---
Watch you ammo as well it‚Äôs not just unloaded the ammo that was loaded disappears. I tested this after I noticed I always was logging in with a unloaded gun. 
---
Noted the amount of ammo on me with fully loaded lever action (4523 round in inventory 5 rounds in gun) logged out and back in. Gun is now unloaded and 4518 rounds in inventory. Not a huge deal for me since I carry a ton of ammo at all times and it‚Äôs only loosing 5 on a re log in, but for someone that carries a normal amount of ammo this could be a huge impact.
---
Literally all the legendaries you get from missions are worthless except for what you get in scrip
---
How‚Äôs that Batman build?
---
A recent update added the new functionality to but perk cards in Nuclear Winter. 
---
When you get a duplicate perk card (which we all know happens all the dang time!) You now get an overseer ticket instead, which can be saved up and used to buy the cards you want.
---
Imagine playing nuclear winter when it goes off a minute into the match
---
Not true at all. Tanagra Town, Vault-Tec Agricultural Center, Glass Caverns, Gauley Mine, at least a dozen other mines I can't remember the names of off the top of my head, Arktos Pharma, both mining company HQs and Estates, the 4 schools in the region, Watoga has at least 5 just in the city limits, I could go on. There's tons of traditional dungeons in the game.
---
I feel your pain. If only I could throw that lvl 50 SMG I got at Wally Willards! That burning damage is so unique!
---
I did not notice, but I'm super interested. What am I looking for?
---
I have run into one there three times and each time it just stood in the fenced in area without coming after me as I stood outside the fence and shot it to pieces.  Just jumped up and down and threw quills.
---
It's a bit more than normal, but my 5 just trying to get in is pretty common.
---
Its gonna be hard ..I have thousands of hours in Rust ..survival pvp is no stranger to me .. however pvp in this game? Total let down it sucks and it's pointless
---
Yep, absolutely. I was super lucky and got Frog Legs months ago but my bf had zero luck getting it. He had to buy it. 
---
I'd honestly like to see Frog Legs removed as a perk, it's a necessary pick for every player that wants to have fun in the mode. I'd prefer it be a serum/random mutation.
---
This is how it works when you pick one up you turn it in that day you play before logging off.  Only pick one up as only one counts.  Remember where another was go back get it turn it in.  Its a pain but thats how it works.  The ones you have sell them to a vendor they wont work for other players but they are 1cap each ao you can cash em out.
---
Let me put it this way: Somerset Special Is not worth just 5 scrip, just like my bloodied critical reduced weight lever action rifle Is not worth just 40 scrip.
---
i might make a power armor character one day but i dont see a benefit for doing such, my melee character is better off outside of PA and my heavy weapons character does good without it. what weapon build works well with PA?
---
Sailor "Sorry, You're Not A Planet Anymore" Pluto.
---
Only option is nuclear winter or another game
---
I‚Äôve seen bloodied heavy weapon builds work well against pve in PA
---
This does sound like quite a cool idea! I‚Äôll give it a go!
---
Thanks!

---
A lot of them were copied as smaller pieces and just altered a little. Most of the caves were quite similliar.
---
I would just like a Yakety Sax station where it's on repeat ad infinitum
---
It requires Class Freak 3 to not cripple the convenience of the stimpack hotkey, but if a 12.5% weaker stim is the difference between life and death for your bloody build, look elsewhere to place the blame.
---
Thousands of mines? Have they fixed the "bug" where you can only drop two mines before they go bang?
---
Yeah that would that balance NW a bit if it was a random mutation/ serum.
---
fleshed out raiders. I expect better raider themes than nuka world. also fleshed out raider gameplay, like the sim settlement conqueror mod (slavery, cannibalism, usury, thievery themes)
---
Unfortunately it's just a bug. Would be good if there were actually challenging enemies like humans in Power Armour.
---
The silos really aren't difficult at all. Don't overthink it, just give it a shot. I do them solo no problem. I'm not a full min/max build either, just an all purpose bloodied ranged weapons build.
---
.... it's an AA 44 revolver. Thats garbage. How much would you pay for that garbage?
---
Please do go on, you're going to need about 40 more before we're even close to the worst fallout game. Also let's look at them Tanagra Town I'll give you, it's one of the finest examples of what the game can do, and glassed caverns also fantastic, and I'll contribute lucky hole mine as also being exquisite.  
---
  
---
Vault-Tec Agricultural Center is level locked to a low level removing the replayability that dungeons can provide same can be said for Gauley mine, the burning mine, the top of the world courisel, and both mining company HQs and Estates plus the schools save for Watoga which does have the 5 buildings that I will also give you.  
---
You've reminded me of the other massive issue with this game's dungeons. An embarrassing number of the few they have are level locked nullifying any repeat usage. It's a shame they don't know, or have any connections to that studio that made that elder scrolls MMO that figured out a cool way to make all of the content reusable and rewarding for all levels.
---
Nah, I'm PC
---
Have they changed things? I use to be able to hand in 2 at a time for a slight xp boost - the one that triggered the quest &amp; an old one I already had in my possession. It's the only reason why old ones were of any value.
---
The most bothering thing for me so far (with my small amount of play time) is scoping in to shoot something and having to FINISH the reload before I can put the weapon down and actually see or change weapons.
---
This engine is the clunkiest thing ever...can't wait till they drop it for something new in the future.
---
Would love to see more BoS items...
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
...but I would also love to see a world flags pack - so I could fly the Aussie flag outside my camp
---
Thank you!
---
It's strange but I like it. A couple of days ago at a rail vendor I found about 7 Legendaries for sale. Some were scrip worthy but a couple were good. A BE max level shotgun and a Level 40 VE gatling gun. Praise the lord.
---
Definitely not in a team. I was never hit in melee; I had passive on the entire time.
---
I dont think it's that man. I mean it gets stupid easy late game aside from bosses. You can machete you way through the wasteland.
---
There's an ongoing bug that if you shoot too quickly after enabling vats that no matter the percentage, you always miss a few shots.
---
I found you could get around that issue by waiting a beat after vats comes up before shooting i.e. Vats -&gt; 0.5s pause -&gt; shoot.
---
Np, good luck fellow vault dweller!!
---
I'm excited to see the responses! Thank you for doing this.  
---
* How do you start datamining? (what tools, guides, background knowledge)
---
* How do you go about finding issues with the game? Is it just curiosity and poking around or do you have a method for finding them?
---
* What is the best method for reporting bugs to make it easiest for a developer to correct the issue?
---
* What aspects of this game are determined by the game files (observable) vs server side (bethesda's end)? I know some games might have values for things in the files but ultimately use a different value from the server. 
---
* What is the weirdest thing you have found in the game files?
---
* Do legendary enemies have modified damage output as a base or do they gain more damage output when they regenerate? 
---
* Poison damage from legendary versions of enemies like mirelurk kings, MLQ, cave crickets, ants, and stingwings seems widely variable in how damaging their Damage over Time effect is. Is this related to server lag, legendary status damage changes (refer above question), or something else? I'm just confused why it can be 5 dmg/s  or 150 dmg/s on a poison hit...
---
* Anything added to the game for the spooky event coming up? ;)
---
Dude chill out. I'm a die hard fan, but you're going nuts just because some guy you never met is bored lol. The game will obviously survive and it's not going anywhere anytime soon. Despite what some goobers say lol.
---
Said it before, I‚Äôll say it again: some kind of Try On or Dressing Room option. 
---
I‚Äôve been super disappointed with how some atom shop outfits look on my character...and I wouldn‚Äôt have bought them if I‚Äôd known.
---
Good info to explain my friend's experience.
---
I was never hit in melee and my mutations never went off. I also don't have Plague Walker. 
---
I'm particularly interested in why the they were able to damage me only after the Wanted player hit me. I didn't hit back and was only fired on at range.
---
Is it possible that the workshop nonsense has reverted?
---
You might find this intresting.
---

---
Can't say I've run into more PVP after survival got cancelled, usually play around CET 1900 - 0100
---
Farm caps &amp; just buy it from vendor . Time/effort cost is too high compared to how many you get in the wild.
---
Either there is a brand new exploit or you are missing something.
---
Many of the areas that DO exist have no logical conclusion or payoff. Entering a dungeon in Skyrim would usually spawn a quest, or at least pose a mystery of sorts, and you would piece together the answer as you explored the (largely linear) dungeon. In the last room, there would be a boss fight, and a prize. 
---
In FO76, you can explore a large building, reading every terminal, and come away with nothing but a bunch of junk to scrap. Very few locations have a "boss"; it's usually just wandering swordfodder. If you're lucky, you might happen across a legendary and/or a sad workplace drama. 
---
I think the best classic "dungeon" in 76 is Glassed Cavern; it's linear, tells a compelling story, and ends in an exciting boss fight (depending on your level). I really wish there were more like that.
---
It looks like you're really not into PvP and know the mechanics around how to avoid it, so this is interesting and definitely worth testing to find out.
---
Brand-new exploit is what I'm afraid of; missing something is what I hope we can figure out.
---
It is a lvl 45 vampire‚Äôs with +50% added limb damage and 90% weight reduction
---
I'd say around 2k
---
Also with vampires effect
---
Lol no, more like 8-12k
---
My apologies from a fellow girly :)
---
Idk about the 2nd and 3rd abilities tho
---
I got one of those rider skins too. Dropped that one. It did help a bit, but i still can't move all the way. It still stops frequently. Changing to third person does help a bit, but doesn't completely resolve this issue.
---
And aa not even aae. Not worth probably even 5k
---
Welcome back.
---
Check out the 'Challenges' list(s). 
---
There's the Daily Challenges, the Weekly Challenges, Combat Challenges, Social Challenges, etc.
---
Agreed on the limb damage - it's definitely not sought after, even though it is OP with Vats Head Aims, which fits perfectly with the third perk. This is a fantastic roll for anyone that realize the real power of limb damage.
---
Far from it actually...
---
I‚Äôd love to trade the rifle for the power fist if you‚Äôd be up for it
---
I can feel the solar burn, blackout modifier and no ammo dropping and just hoping a psion cloak drops üòÇ
---
Okay deal
---
To me, i go around helping newbies
---
Gamer tag is; TheMCPug
---
I just got off about thirty minutes ago but I‚Äôll be online tomorrow afternoon around 6. Would that work for you?
---
Why not both if one is 90% reduced weight?
---
"It came from Flatwoods..."
---
Only the gauntlet is reduced weight, the power fist isn‚Äôt. However I‚Äômma trade with a guy soon who‚Äôs giving me a power fist that has reduced weight with some other stats so yeah you‚Äôre right lol
---
I‚Äôm currently on break for this week so i don‚Äôt know if that will work for me, what about Sunday at 5:00-7:00 CDT
---
oh cool. thanks man
---
WHERE IS THE SPAWN LOCATION OF BAKED BEaNS
---
Sure Sunday‚Äôs fine. Lmk either on here or Xbox when you‚Äôre on and ready that day. My gamertag is : uhhLoonycross
---
I‚Äôll add you from the app
---
That video is referring to duplication exploit being fixed. Which was, but it was real duping with items. And Im fairly sure one has been out for few weeks judging from certain trades. (like on PC too much of plasma granade plans and a lot of BE faster reload fixers.
---
While this throwable duping I believe hasn't yet been fixed.
---
Yes there is! Bethesda did not add HRTF sound processing  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-related_transfer_function but you can add it yourself by just dropping the .dll file in your main game folder. I've been using this patch for months and it greatly improved my experience.
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/109
---
Mine counted for the challenge a few days ago. Any idea why?
---
My favourite game in the bunkers is the 'is this supposed to look like a copy-paste of the last one?' game. They seem to just swtich which door is the entrance.
---
When I tested it (on my shotgun) I didn't actually loose any ammo. But wow that sucks.
---
I find most of the events tedious even the first time. I like the camping one and often use the airport one to test out new weapons.
---
Lag switch only works if you're the host.
---
Standing on the gas pumps works too.
---
Let‚Äôs try doing the same with PVPers, maybe they will all go away too...
---
Which mask?
---
I‚Äôm at work right now but if my memory serves correct, I‚Äôve seen them for sale at pleasant valley station
---
I have trouble with the big places in 76. With no internal map I usually get lost, but it never feels interesting. My inventory is usually full and I'm just looking at more junk. There's never anything exciting to find, or if there is another player already took it. The small places I quite like. The little camps and huts. But the stories are fairly limited.
---
'The biggest map ever!' is a great advertising line, but players would almost always rather have a smaller, more detailed, map.
---
It's one of your mods.
---
I'm still getting a ton at fort defiance.
---
Im just grinding to get rare weapons like a legendary sheepsquatch staff but that will take forever
---
I've heard endless claims about legacy weapons and how they work and what makes them special. Can you clear up a few rumors I've been told?
---
Things I've been told about legacy weapons:
---
Legacy explosive energy weapons deal ballistic damage only
---
Legacy explosive energy weapons deal energy damage only
---
Legacy explosive energy weapons do not count as explosive damage at all
---
Legacy explosive energy weapons deal 100% of the base weapon damage in the explosion aoe instead of the normal 30%
---
Legacy explosive energy weapons dealt ballistic damage up until patch 13 when it was fixed by the armor penetration patch and now they deal energy damage again.
---
Are any of these things true?
---
Fasnacht Man Mask i think.  Man with giant long nose.
---
You can be rodeod into a fight inside of an unowned workshop. One shot on you will start a duel.
---
It's all fun and games until you're reloading and BZZTK-K-K-K-K
---
"You have Ghoul AIDS."
---
And 900 rads.
---
Never use VATs, it's completely borked compared to previous titles. 
---
Actually I lie, I use it if I get combat music but I can't see what's trying to attack me, then I just use VATs get point me in the right direction (hopefully).
---
They should give u more then 10 atoms like wtf
---
I think it was to level up.  Either way, I'm confused because above you have it listed as not having the tag.  I know I've done some challenge with the owl head too.
---
But I'm probably missing something.  Doesn't matter, hope they fix it if there is something wrong.
---
I'm planning on giving out Halloween candy in my vendors for free.  I'll have to put up a sign that says 'take 1', and will probably have to restock pretty often, but it should be fun.
---
As for other outfits, there's the tattered mole head, the mr fuzzy mascot, sheepsquatch , imposter sheepsquatch and a bunch of atom shop stuff like the Easter bunny, the bear and I'm sure some others I'm forgetting.  
---
There are plans to make the witch and skeleton stuff if you can find them; they come from random encounter spots.
---
if its the plan to make the laser gun. you can sometimes find it at the weapon plans spawn at grafton steel.
---
I believe the in-canon explanation is that the boarded up houses are the result of the economic crisis and the New Plague that proceeded the war. Though some could also be attempts at making a house better able to withstand a blast. Boarding/painting windows is the recommendation in Protect and Survive.

You sure got him, he‚Äôs pissed üòÇ

Its the build up to the next storyline for sure.  We figured out what the hell happened, what caused it and how to stop it.  We offed the SBQ and at this point in the story, we are picking off the stragglers and soon the people will start returning.
---
Food build?  There's...a FOOD build?  Lol what?
---
What is this? Must be jokes I don't know about.
---
First time I experienced this was in Free Range. Sheepsquatch started to crawl out of the ground glowing green but wasn‚Äôt legendary. Everyone opened up on it and it blinked legendary right before the crawl out animation ended then immediately stopped glowing green and reverted to non-legendary. All this happened in the split second everyone started shooting. Saw this again twice during meat week, one a mirelurk Queen, the other a hermit crab. Then another mirklurk Queen during hear of the swamp. I‚Äôve stopped engaging until the spawn animation finishes, they show as a legendary and being engaging me. Hasn‚Äôt happened since doing that.
---
Tha ks for the info on the plans, hopefully I came happen across them, and that's a great idea on the candy, I forgot I even had that in my stash.
---
Legendary module is used for power armor/armor crafting from the vault 94 raid.
---
I think the scorched should be sectioned off to the bog or mines, seeing that with more humans around and no queen there sitting ducks on the edge of extermination.
---
Now however I gotta ask what factions are dead and what still live on? For now we know that the Responders and the Free states without any remanding members are dead while the Brotherhood, Raiders and the Enclave live.
---
You get them from Grahm but if you‚Äôre on PS4 I have a spare.
---
I started farming a while ago. End up with 200 + 200 excess ballistic fiber.
---
It's crazy how little it spawns.
---
Daily and challenge.
---
Depends, are you a bloodied build? Just hit an enemy and see which damage number pops up. Highest damage is best for your build?
---
Hey, cheers! Glad the guide was able to help you guys out :)
---
I know it‚Äôs the only outfit I really wanted after getting the pink. I feel so much better now I don‚Äôt have to constantly go there.  I can actually play the game.
---
yeah i still log on once a day just to do the daily/weekly atoms and to try to get better legendary weapons/armors.     i don't go all out like i use to.   just started trying the new raids 2 weeks ago and i usually solo them on novice but they are in a really bad state at the moment the input lag in them is so bad it's frustrating and not even fun.     Most of the people i did play with have been gone for months.      I'm excited for wastelander's though and the world revamp should bring some much needed life back into the game.    Really Hoping they start teasing and doing info dumping here soon.   so we got something to look forward to.     i know they have the Halloween event coming soon and that should be fun i hope.   The "Clean up Appalachia" event is nice but the rewards have been kinda lackluster to be honest.    But they really have not done the community any favors on getting us excited for anything either.    The Inside The Vault for Sept 26th was nice on them telling us what was going on with some of QoL updates but that was about it and even then it seems like they are "Next Year" updates. that are quite a bit away out.       I'll still keep on logging on and playing as i do enjoy the game at it's core.   I'm just hoping they get it into gear here soon.    I mean it's already been a year since launch here soon.
---
I think it would be super interesting if the dwellers of vault 76 helped shaped the post war world. Something like taking down the scorchbeasts, explaining why they never return in another title.
---
I've completed my strangler set and encountered around 4-5 blue screens by me or teammates in total. Also had two bugs that prevented us from progressing, both of which were replaced mainframe cores not updating the progress bar.
---
Vault 94 was buggy in the first week. Its stability has long been fixed (I'm talking MONTHS ago). Stop regurgitating what people on Reddit say, stop making excuses for not doing the raids. Getting killed by a mirelurk king or cave cricket does not mean you lagged out. It means your build sucks and you should improve it.
---
The the
---
Guess more peeps getting lucky. I got a 3* Berserkers Double-Barrel Shotgun that gives. Bullets explode for area damage,more damage the lower your damage resistance,+1Perception.             Got from a 3* goul last night.
---
You are absolutely correct, and this is exactly what anyone who has played both Survival and NW knows: the Survival players who thought they were good at PVP are actually HORRIBLE at it, and NW was never the natural progression for Survival when Bethesda removed Survival. The players in Survival who ran around invisible with Tesla Rifles proved only one thing: they could only win as long as they never had to worry about aiming and as long as the enemy couldn't see them.
---
Unfortunately, Nuclear Winter deprived them of the ability to shoot lightning at their own feet and somehow get kills, it deprived them of the VATS aimbot, and it deprived them of abundant pay-to-win Stealth Boys. In short, it deprived them of their "skills." Without weapons that aim themselves, they were forced to walk without crutches. And they can't. It's absolutely embrassing for them to have to play on equal footing. They had only one option: return to Adventureland where they can continue to rely on their gear to win the fight.
---
Yeah. 15k sounds about right. You can't get legendary fixers unless you know the plan. I would imagine if you got legendary fixers with decent prefixes they'd be a money maker too. 
---
I know the plan on one character but It's a level 35 that I only use with a certain friend so I won't be getting any good drops for a while.
---
There‚Äôs gotta be something better we can do. I‚Äôve played MTG a bit and when I was more into it I got into deck building so I was looking for specific cards and there‚Äôs a whole community around that with extensive data on rarity and price histories etc.
---
You a pokemon?
---
You can get it from the Queen of the Hunt daily quest.
---
It is compared to what it could be if automated
---
NW.
---
Or convince Bethesda to remove VATS and Tesla Rifles from pvp. I'd perm survival if that ever happened.
---
When you compare Fallout 76 to ESO It's completely heartbreaking. Comparing 76 to Skyrim is kind of apples and  since Skyrim is a single player game but for crying out loud ESO is a live service and it's world is a thousand times deeper than this little sandbox.
---
WhiteSpring Station seems to be a gathering point for those interested in pvp... Hang there &amp; see what comes
---
Server hop if nothing gets started
---
Seen (&amp; been in) lotsa pvp there
---
Good luck
---
Yeah, I'd do anything to get ahold of one. Trying to find it for my fiancee but it never spawns for me and no matter how much crazy rare stuff I offer no one will trade me one.
---
I'll do my part and send them some buisness from the local workshops.
---
Having pacifism on doesn't prevent another player from killing you. It's still possible to do it. I do it to little pacifist twerps who think it's funny to hog a vendor.
---
It helps to have higher INT for this
---
If you are doing a big scrapping session, you could get some food INT boosts (brain fungus soup, scorched brains, egg head mutation (to be removed later), unyielding armour, etc)
---
Get rid of isotopes and electrically charged. Pointless mutations that do more harm to you in those cases. If you must have them, pop a Rad-X while the griefers are bothering you.
---
No one else is alive. Every location is a dungeon ;)
---
Also, when you walk on carpet it should make a soft swish sound, not a hardwood sound
---
Any update?
---
I think the idea of Fairytale 76 has been pretty well-ridiculed at this point. This game was not advertised as teddy bears and cotton candy. The entire storyline of the game tells a story of various competing human factions who got wiped out by the Scorched plague because the Raiders were basically griefers and prevented the various "good" factions from solving the Scorched problem once and for all. The Scorched problem starts because even after humanity is nearly extinct after a nuclear war, the greed and hate-driven Enclave itches to perform a sort of ethnic cleansing campaign across the world. Everything about this game screams perpetual human conflict and grief. You're looking for a different game, not a different server.

Thank you for the info guess I gotta grind and good luck

Damn guess it's off to grind thanks

---
Hopefully that's fixed with the next patch when the event is officially underway.
---
Yeah, knew that. Pretty sure my pistol build just can't handle the task of bringing ppl down without VATs, esp if they have high energy resistance.
---
Guess it's a good thing my gauntlet already has the extra claw.
---
Bloodied builds make tse guns look like pea shooters now. Only thing worth using power armour for is heavy guns for stabilized perk IMO. Anything else and I'd rather run unyielding for the sneaking/vats/str bonuses
---
Not a fan of having to face people on equal footing? Because the most dangerous threat in Fallout 76 is a human opponent who you can't wipe out with your mad Tesla Boi skillz.
---
Nuclear Winter scares only those who don't have the skill to face others in a fair fight. If you want a true challenge, join a server alone with team fill off.
---
Have wanted it for a while, so when I saw $9, it was either a large Big Mac meal or FO76. Finally gave in haha thanks for the advice. Is the west side where you come out of the vault?
---
Nothing - I glitched my way into there, and the event itself, back in January, somebody asked me about this recently - [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/db6yzy/when\_is\_this\_coming/f1yvf2y?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/db6yzy/when_is_this_coming/f1yvf2y?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
I shot these people A LOT. lol
---
Thanks for that! Is a workshop just like a CAMP that is existing infrastructure? I need to get my head around al this camp business I think haha
---
Traded 10 possum badges for one. 2 armor plated plans.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs cheaper to farm the event but I‚Äôve had no luck getting it to actually start past few days. 2 weeks after this recent big update when they added fixer to purveyor i started a Encrypted event was surprised only one guy showed up. I checked the whole session made sure high levels were in there, seems like people rather pay alot for it than do the event it‚Äôs self.
---
How does it work? I saw thousands of Explosive Bait being spawned in a fountain at a ranger station once, got down to about 0.2fps before the server crashed
---
I‚Äôd love to, but none of my mates (I have like 3 friends) play it, I‚Äôm in Australia so times are all funky and the toilets flush in the wrong direction, and my kid is pretty demanding so I‚Äôd probably drop off mid game a bit. Maybe when I get into the game more, I‚Äôll be able to find some cool people

For a week I sold lots of stuff so I had max caps on 4 accounts, thinking that many caps someone will want to trade but no. The same week I ended up getting the Responder helmet off a daily so I swapped that and 2 backpack mods for it. I‚Äôd off giving all my stuff for it as wanted it so bad. If you go on the trading forum and see what people are really looking for you‚Äôll get it.
---
I used to be in a Discord called the Desert Rangers, that was real roleplay.
---
Sad that I was afk when they switched from NV multiplayer mod to 76.
---
NW gives you lots of choices for builds AND you can use your CAMP!
---
It's not a mod like you have in Warframe, it's a component for the new PAs.
---
Rape jokes aren't funny and it's a very sensitive topic for a lot of people. Please delete your comment out of respect for your fellow human
---
the truth the only weapon that you get from events that is worth anythiing is the all rise, everything else is just trash compared to what you could find in the wild
---
Read your other post and what a shame. Even if the event was boring it feels like wasted content. I really hope they didn't pull it because of the power armor skin.
---
Lol. I've offered the Mr.Fuzzy outfit, Stimpack Diffuser plan, serum Recipes, Legacy Weapons, the Old Man Winter Mask, and all sorts of other stuff. People only want full matching sets of scout armor it seems.
---
Damn guess so thanks for the info man
---
Level-scaled instanced dungeons and infinate radiant quests would *really* make this game more fun.
---
ESOs an alright MMORPG. It's not an Elder Scrolls game. 
---
Fallout 76's issue is different. It's a Fallout game that's failing as an online game.
---
I'd love it if some raid enemies had ridiculous resistances to most damage. Have enemies that take 1/10th damage from everything but explosions, or blunt melee, or fire
---
What...., No one wanted the Mr Fuzzy outfit or Old Man Mask, see I‚Äôm on PS4 and I think the market is quite different. I also find depending on what time of day you post makes a huge difference. Yeah I don‚Äôt get what the big deal is with scout armor.
---
The hard truth is, if you're one of those customers who have to ask them to make things cheaper, you're likely never part of the paying bracket they are interested in catering to. Simple as that. You can argue that "but if it's cheaper more people will buy it!!!". But no it isn't.  There is no guarantee to that at all. The only way for that to be true is if they remove the free atoms entirely. then MAYBE it will work. Even that is a stretch. 
---
demanding customers are often the ones who want to pay the least while maximize their own gains. It's often times not worth it when there's another customer who's worth 10x the whiny one. This is how business works. You don't see people going around demanding Ferrari to lower their car price, do you? Just a hyperbole but you get my point.
---
I mean, I know the real reason is probably to reduce the workload for the designers. Adding thousands of houses onto the map would be a lot of work, so boarding them up makes some sense.   
---
But in game, it is just silly that I, who can blast a Deathclaw so hard with my .50 cal machine gun that it falls apart into writhing bits, can't pull a freaking board off a door and walk in.
---
I once saw nuke and pulse mines there
---
What if I want your caps and your loot? What if I want to profit off of your excessive carelessness? What if I don't like your cocky attitude, thinking you above all others are exempt from the hazards of the Wasteland? What if I want to scare you away from a workshop before someone truly toxic comes along? What if I think attacking you in a workshop is a good way to meet people (surprisingly, it is - you can learn a lot about someone from how they respond to adversity)?
---
Maybe don't take a public resource and think you have exclusive rights to it. You're asking for trouble. Acting like a victim when someone has a problem with your callous attitude is toxic.
---
No. Str increases melee damage and that its. No other special directly effects any other damage
---
Thank you for this! Found it my second try.
---
If Bethesda managed to make Fallout 76 a tenth as immersive as ESO is, they wouldn't have received a bit of the backlash they did. Now that I have quit the game for several months and really had a chance to look at it objectively after also not having played eso for a couple of years I can tell that 76 just has an absolute lack of substance.
---
Trespassing? It's a public workshop. You have no right to it. Claiming it is an act of aggression against the rest of the server, and you should be prepared to address the consequences of such a selfish and provocative action.
---
Ok thank you
---
One of the level up criteria is specifically "wearing a Fasnacht mask", which is why the Fasnacht mask worked as intended. This post is talking about criteria relating to the more general "costume" category, for which the Fasnacht masks won't work because they're not tagged as costumes.
---
Nice
---
&gt; or just don‚Äôt give ya atoms
---
Woah there chief, slow it down there. This game gets new Camp and cosmetic stuff almost every week through the Atom Shop, if you make that paid only you are taking away a huge amount of items from everyone that's not a whale.
---
I agree that the dollar to atom rate is outrageous but at least this way people can farm and get that stuff like the fridges and the scavenger bots (that were going to be free before they released them by the way). 
---
They are going to get most of their money from crazy whales willing to spend huge amounts anyway, that's why they milk them so much with high Atom prices. At least hey added those 1500 Atom + outfit packs, which was a great step foward in my opinion.
---
That's Nuclear Winter. Literally.
---
I like this observation.
---
I was disappointed as to see boarded up buildings in 76... HATED them in Fallout 4, but really thought that is what would set 76 apart. They didn't have to be lots, and they could have jump been empty places (ransacked in the last 25 years), but really expected it. Hell even sunny tops in an exterior building and its big!
---
I am thinking the scorched might be sectioned off to the bog and the bog only, afterall that's where they were originated.
---
The Forest might be divided by The Cult and regular settlers; Toxic Valley and Ash Heap has unknown future; Savage Divide might turn to a raider territory again with Rosy's broadcast recruiting; The Mire might be resettled as well, though I don't think anyone would choose to stay in a grim swamp when life is already hard as fuck if they have a choice.
---
I don't really think anymore Brotherhood would show up, as even the main chapter is still growing at this point, none of the chapters would have the resources for expansion across states, but there might be Enclave reinforcements.
---
I am thinking the Vault 76 dwellers would eventually become of the Enclave chapter of the region as they are all elites from the old days which really fit the Enclave profile. Maybe we might see a "good" Enclave chapter due to the fact that the Overseer is not an extremist like those in Fallout 3.
---
Oh absolutely. It's the classic "low fence blocking your path" issue of game design. 
---
Though, if it's full of New Plague would you really want to blast through the door?
---
I read this back and I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs so long. I just haven‚Äôt had anyone to voice my opinions to.
---
I haven‚Äôt even played much at all, much less since January. When I finally logged off I was level 25. While I know the majority of you have run out of things to do, I was never grabbed by this game. Or rather, I was excited by it at first but the early release bugs turned me off and whenever I tried to get back in since I felt weighed down by the game mechanics. I won‚Äôt lie, I‚Äôm no veteran. I‚Äôve only played Fo4. So while the gunplay feels near identical and the base building is familiar, the repairing of weapons and armor is a foreign concept to me. I enjoyed fallout 4 so much because I could explore and tear my way across the map, stopping at vendors and towns and acquiring new weapons and armor as I travelled. But in 76, I can‚Äôt get past the ever-looming threat of my equipment breaking and that feeling of almost ‚Äòrunning errands‚Äô for upkeep. Now I‚Äôm not complaining or asking anyone to change the game. I just happen to not be a big fan of it. I wish I was. I‚Äôd love if someone could give me tips on getting past that other stuff. Cause like OP, I see posts on here all the time and I just can‚Äôt relate cause I‚Äôve never gotten to the level that I‚Äôm running around in nuke zones or fighting the Sheepsquatch. I‚Äôd love to feel the wonder I had in my first few months of play, but after a while it just started to feel like a grind to me. Another thing that I liked better in 4 than 76 (I know, a sin right? Who even likes 4. NV is where it‚Äôs at huh?) is having NPCs. Part of the ‚Äúerrand‚Äù feeling comes from real life errands. I go places, get what I need and leave. There‚Äôs no conflict or change of motive. Much so in 76. In 4, I may be sent by someone to clear out their basement because there‚Äôs a goul infestation. But then, after exploring and learning the story through ‚Äúenvironmental storytelling‚Äù (which I will admit, was very good in 76 as far as I got), I learn the questgiver‚Äôs motives and can choose to go along with his ruse and get a cut, or take the moral high ground and shut him down for good. That‚Äôs what lacking, I feel, in 76; there‚Äôs no choice (again, as far as I‚Äôve seen). It‚Äôs just go here, kill boss, collect item, repair item, put it back in the machine and keep following the Overseer‚Äôs holotapes. If Wastelanders is gonna be as good as people are hoping, maybe I‚Äôll finally hop back on this crazy train.
---
Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.
---
Why can‚Äôt my essays sound this good?
---
Based on what you guys are saying, since I'm hitting about 1400 with my auto handmade and about 1600 with my lever, tank killer isnt making a difference? And neither does my penetration mag on the handmade? 
---
I run level 1 of commando, expert commando, master commando, rifleman and expert rifleman, with level 3 tank killer. It sounds like I'd be better off swapping to 3 more levels of damage perks instead of tank killer, and swapping my perforated mag for another mag
---
That Deathclaw is scrip - Mutant's prefix adds only 10%, no matter how many mutations you have and limb damage is wasted affix on melee/unarmed, since, even with concentrated fire, you can't target limbs. So, keep the Power Fist and look for an upgrade.
---
Thank you all for your answers. I gather that I am delivering too much damage (&gt;1000~2000) to see the effect. Good to know!
---
I've been playing since beta. Got all my dream gear on my two mains. I used to play daily but the last few weeks I find myself less and less interested. There just isn't enough to do. If it wasn't for my fantastic friends, I would have quit a long time ago. Wastelanders will definitely make or break this game.
---
Check out all the whitespring faction vendors. They carry the normal plans that the faction does but just carry the mods
---
Nah, just don't like battle royales, I think it's a lazy fad genre.
---
Sorry, when you took the workshop, you stole a public resource for yourself. It's an act of aggression, and frankly, a dick move. Every second you stand in that workshop, pretending you're more deserving than everyone else on the server is an affront to civility and cooperation.
---
Hell I haven't seen Whitesprings nuked in about two weeks.  How long and how much resources did it take you?  I've been playing since launch and I'm level 109 but still haven't bothered to try and launch a nuke.  Kept hearing it's too hard, or  you need a dozen people blah blah.  Plus I'm just lazy.
---
While your response completely ignores what I said...
---
I pre-ordered ESO. It was absolute trash that didn't start getting better until some of the DLCs and *especially* the One Tamriel update. One Tamriel came out *over two years* after ESO first launched.
---
Fallout 76 hasn't even been out for a year.
---
NW, where legendary effects aren't applied in PVP.
---
Awesome guide, thanks!
---
No sorry, I haven't played with shader mods, just better world maps and qol items. Have seen a few that make the world look like fallout 4 just haven't got round to trying them.
---
Turn on pacifist mode and shoot him anyway.
---
Exactly one of the reasons why I stopped playing FO76 this past few months. A robot scavenger that should be free and now 2 fridges that cost 700 each! If beth wanna monitize them that's fine but SKINS ONLY please. They've certainly made an oopsie with the Atomic Shop recently.
---
1* bloodied with the right mutations and perks and unyielding armour should show pip boy damage over 1400. Sneak power attacks should do about 6k (that's what mine does at least). 
---
Most important mutations are talons, twisted muscles and adrenal reaction. If I'm a team and use the perk strange in numbers, my pip boy damage goes up to about 1900
---
The deathclaw gauntlet with literally any build can turn into exactly 40 scrip at your nearest train station :p
---
Same. Scout isnt even that good.
---
He'll back when we could actually do events or get serum recipes from the queen or load are mules with infinite weight instead of having three accounts or get legendaries from enemies who said legendary even if it didn't have a star.....depression.....why do I even play anymore the event situation is enough to make me want to puke or smack Bethesda for their lack of foresight.
---
They said they were not on a team, just had a friend on the map.
---
me too, havent login in a few weeks waiting for wastelanders. their is nothing for me to do or that I want. end game player problems.
---
For that matter, what about the marine tactical helmet? Shouldn't that have built-in filtration too?

Right on the money. They wanted Fairytale 76, and assumed everyone else did. They went in a campaign to ruin every aspect of what PvP players enjoyed. Even when PvP players were exiled to completely different servers, they still whined. Finally, their efforts converted even the Survival servers into Fairytale 76, driving PvP players into Adventure, where griefing was much more lucrative.
---
Now they complain that they got what they wanted: everyone is forced to play in Fairytale 76. PvP is watered-down, giving even the weakest whiners a chance to fight. Yet somehow it's still a problem.
---
Maybe we need to just convert Adventure servers into Survival servers, so all of these people can see just how awful it is when someone else tries to dictate how they get to enjoy the game.
---
I hadn't touched F76 in a few months (Classic WoW has been my drug recently, anyway). I logged on yesterday with my main. I completely forgot I had entirely transformed him into an actual old-school mobster, donning the signature hat, suspenders and shirt, and a trusty Tommy Gun with the big round mag. I had also made him fairly chubby for extra authenticity.
---
I started walking around (holding down X) the Resort and shooting up everything that walked or crawled. During those 5 minutes of roleplay I got 3 notifications that players had browsed and bought stuff from my vendors (which I also had forgotten I had set up), netting me about 100 caps or so. But there were only about 6 people on the map, anyway.
---
And that was it. I promptly logged off after that. I'm curious to see how the NPCs will change the game, but I think the best/biggest change for the game yet would be the expansion of the map and adding more players per server.
---
I would love to have a great big city again like Boston or Washington DC where we can actually start building some interesting camps and also be able to do more roleplay in.
---
Never touched warframe
---
I miss mine, got eaten by the game :(  
---
Headwear\_CB02\_Mask "Monster Mask" \[ARMO:001EB731\]   
---
Has the keyword, so will count.
---
Right now you can only a) listen to H/H endlessly b) claim workshops and wait for someone to come (extremely rare) or c) steal workshops owned by high level players, as they are most likely to come for defense and some pvp.... I'm not counting any griefing mechanics, as that is definitely not pvp.
---
And rats.... ignore the radrats
---
That's why I posted, kind of like the Broken Mystery Pick, they were advised multiple times in advance but didn't act until it was too late, trying to be more proactive this time.
---
So people have talked about workshops. Yes if you cap one, even with your pacifist setting on, I can go there and kill you with no real warning. If you do decide to take workshop anyways, just know that the stuff you build does NOT carry over to the next time you play the game. When building at workshops, if a material is listed in green it means it's coming out of the workshops inventory and not yours. White means it's coming from yours and your stash
---
The farther east you go, the harder the enemies get. Stay in the green area at first
---
There are so many assets from FO4 I'd love to buy. What does Bethesda sell instead? Tires... Plushies... Retarded colored wallpapers that look like they came off an assembly line 3 minutes ago, not like a post-apocalyptic wall would look. I'm genuinely confused by choices they're making when selling items in the shop. The only resent purchase I was happy with that felt part of Fallout world was the bungalow but placing items inside was a pain. Everything ends up on the roof so you have to resort to rug trick all over again. Who is making these decisions? Why are they still employed?
---
One of grognak's require you to collect 2 issues with the same number (don't ask me why, it's just that) - check, maybe you'll still need one. And to count it towards the challenge you must collect them in the wild, not bought from other player.
---
Hell yeah! Thanks.
---
This is it. Once I started buying them from vendors instead of farming I never run out and have plenty to sell too.
---
You aren't thinking this through. What if I'm a bloodied build, sacrificing my health for damage output? Take away my armor perks, and now I'm just a dead man walking because somehow it's more balanced for everything that makes my character tick to stop working?
---
What about the people with weight reduction armor? It's balanced for them to have to go into combat overencumbered?
---
What about the Instigating stealth sniper who counts on the damage boost for PVE combat? He's supposed to fight you with a build designed for him to be in control of when and where combat takes place?
---
That would be the best imo
---
This is exactly what I want :sob: I just wish for that beautiful vault tec canopy
---
Turns out the NW map and Adventure map are the same, so use one server for PvP and explore the other st your leisure.

Your not the only one. I‚Äôm sad survival is gone, I‚Äôm hoping we get something introduced in the future that is in addition to nuclear winter.

I‚Äôd love to see a survival seasons mode, a badlands pvp area in adventure, or a new pvp event added to the public events rotation....hell, even put hunter/hunted on there....something
---
I'd love to have a camp that looks like trash, post-apocalyptic trash, children-of-atom type trash with radiation emitting walls, not Whitesprings type hardwood floors and eye-popping acid-spewing-colored wallpaper.  Newspaper-as-wallpaper will fit right in at my camp. I'm from vault 76 and I support this message.
---
Apparently not anymore. 
---
Bethesda announced (on their forums) they implemented something to 'mitigate' the bug and since they did, there have been no further incidents.
---

---
As a German and part time FloridaMan, I highly doubt that :P
---
The ones who complain that they were killed by "toxic" players are always the ones who "accidentally" had Pacifist Mode off and "accidentally" fired a bullet at the one dude in their area... On a map the size of West Virginia.
---
You have no reason to turn pacifist off, ever. If you don't want PVP, there are no accidents. Accept that you wanted PVP and you died. Or you screwed up and you died. Either way, it's on you. Stop whining.

Like I said I have collected every issue from world spawns twice over, once before the bug made itself known and once after (I had hoped that whichever one didn't count properly the first time would register the second time but alas no dice)
---
I didn't buy from players and I'm not missing any. The checklist completed when I picked up the last one I needed but the counter bugged out and stayed at 9/10. I contacted support about it and they says they were forwarding on to the devs but they've since fixed the discover location challenges but not this one.
---
Um have you got an empty milk bottle?
---
Use whatever gives u the most DPS. I use a 1* mutated meat hook that gives that same 10% bonus but it gives me 250 flat dps. Then i also use a 3* ferious shiskabab.
---
Boo was that scary enough
---
I'm curious about how the explosive effect works exactly, are you saying explosive damage has energy and ballistic subtypes? My own basic testing seems to show that demolition expert, fireproof, and dense armor have no effect on legacy weapons so that's why I say they don't appear to be explosive damage at all.
---
I believe it's not high on their priority list ;)
---
So why didn't it do something? My weapons did something to a full Sentinel Assassin even before the nerf. I could one shot them or take them on in prolonged combat. Why couldn't you?
---
The funny thing is, there's a damage limit per shot now, due to people like you. Sentinel Assassin armor is still going to block most of your damage, but you've managed to nerf your own build because you couldn't figure out why you were failing in the first place! Your damage multipliers are meaningless now. This is why complaining instead of contemplating hurts YOU, not them.
---
I can.  I'm on now.  GT Kuriakon
---
You are funny.
---
I already felt like that after 80 hours. I'll replay it after the NPC update
---
Cool I'll join your game now
---
You want to force your preferred play style on everyone else. Flip that around. Let's make Adventure into a wild west Survival, where players are penalized for being kind, and players are rewarded for taking out hippies. If you're too kind, your legendary gear starts dropping when you die, and you get a bounty on your head every time you wave hello to another player.
---
How long until you hate the game? Would you applaud the people who forced a game you love into that nightmare? Not everyone wants what you want. The game was never advertised and Peace, Love, and Harmony 76. The world literally just ended. Get with the times.
---
Right. So if my Hand made was auto it would work better.
---
Great answer, thank you. The handmade exceeds 1000 regularly so that seems to fit.
---
If you are getting attacked LITERALLY every time you do something, doesn't that make it predictable? And if it's predictable, are you an idiot for doing it, or is it someone else's fault that you're not learning from past experiences?
---
U can also milk the brahmin in flatwoods.

The main storyline explains why they never return already. All of the problems related to the Scorched were being solved just before the Vault opened. The plague vaccine was created. Lures and traps were being deployed. Early warning systems for SBs were being deployed. The human factions finally found a way to work together
---
The Enclave self-destructed. The combined military forces of the Brotherhood and the Responders were pushing back against the threat. The Brotherhood located the SB home nest. It was all coming together. Then the Raiders interfered (Rose's quest tells this part of the story), and took a critical piece of the solution out of play. Humanity fell to the Scorched plague... And then Vault 76 opened. That's where we came in. We've figured it out. Now we can pick up where the Free States, Brotherhood, and Responders left off.
---
The damage of two shot isnt horrible if you manage to land both hits by the grace of the Mothman himself. Anti armour is better tho
---
You've got it backwards. PVP was advertised as a key feature from the start. Adventure started off WAY worse than Survival ever became. Over time, people complained about losing enjoyment in the traditional single-player Fallout experience due to pesky other people in a multi-player game. A separate server class was created to appease the squeaky wheels, but those squeakers kept squeakin'! When the griefers all went to Survival, the squeakers became jealous of the special rewards offered by Survival! Squeakers, as you can imagine, love to grind and collect and level up: Survival was a treasure trove for this! So they ventured into the exile of their own creation... Only to find the exiled griefers! Rather than accept that the squeakers had a home in Adventure, the squeakers tried to turn Survival into Adventure! Over time, the very same aspects of Survival that made it appealing to griefers were slowly chipped away by the ever-squeakin' squeakers. Finally, the griefers realized that it wa more economical to return to Adventure, where rewards were higher and victims were easier to find. As the Survival population dwindled, it was removed. Now, we've returned to the state we were in almost a year ago. Adventure has been reopened for griefing, because squeakers don't think about consequences before squeakin'! Nerf it, don't learn from it!

Not just damage, I'm talking about VATS and hipfire accuracy.
---
And by the way you don't have to worry about that while ADS, because the shots are then treated as a single projectile. Not just AA is better, like a good 4 effects are.
---
Why don‚Äôt you do the quest and get one yourself?
---
Are you sure? Because I got one the other day and had no such issue.
---
If you can avoid getting killed, go to Gorge Junkyard and take over the  workshop there. [Or, find another place where there's a black titanium node](https://fo76map.com/) and move your camp there. Otherwise, like others mentioned, some Mole Miners drop 'miner suit scrap' that breaks down into titanium.
---
Can't agree more! Even though the map is much larger it actually feels smaller than the other fallouts or skyrim. 
---
Would love if they added a lot more dungeons and more content! I stopped playing earlier this year when I reached lvl 60 or so as I felt I had explored the entire map and done all the content, and the repeatables felt repetitive and boring. Came back about a month ago and was heavily relieved to see they haven't deleted my foon, and since then so much has changed from Feb /March this year that it's kept me busy.
---
Looking forward to the wastelanders release but more content and quests is really what would be awesome!
---
And what exactly is a food build?
---
You did miss something - a wanted player can initiate PVP when your mutations attack him. Take off your passive aggro mutations, they're worthless. They will literally get you killed.

You understand all of the PVP rules except for one: all bets are off whenever Bethesda does Tuesday maintenance. There's about a 50% chance that their routine maintenance will reintroduce a bug or exploit that may have been fixed 1, 2, or even 3 times in the past. Know what else happens every Tuesday? The people who know those old exploits test them. Congrats, you've been beta tested.
---
I don't know how common the issue is for other players, but literally every queen where someone uses a 50 cal will make all the sounds from the fight start looping until I log out. I'll hear a roaring full volume 50 cal with scorchbeast melee attack sounds mixed in until I alt-f4 the game.
---
Seconded, I was really disappointed when I read that terminal. There‚Äôs cut content and unused voice files that point at his involvement with the investigation of Wes Tek and the FEV as well as textures that are unused for those guide stones which are also mentioned on a terminal in VTU, looks to me like it was all abandoned.
---
I only found this post through another post.
---
How did this go under my radar I don't know.
---
Either way thank you for taking the time to put this together and make it available for the uneducated masses, much appreciated.
---
Still looking for people?
---
I hope this made you feel better I guess
---
KevinBarbarian
---
I‚Äôm annoyed just thinking about that. Woof.
---
A huge generalization here, $3hr of your salary goes to the atom shop.
---
No because most of us here bought the game day 1 and never expected so many bugs, or thought they'd be quickly patched
---
I'm pretty sure the mall vendor has similar stock
---
I wonder if these crashes are platform or video card specific. I did three silos and queens last night with no issues. I am on PC with core i7 and Nvidia 1060.
---
Well there‚Äôs at least two more vaults to open and they have added interiors before like the ones for the brewing quest, imposter sheepamajig and the burrows... and they changed the interior for the capital building so there is limitless possibilities, cause the map is on servers. I think that some of the boarded houses will settle Human NPC or why not ghoul NPC cause fixing the broken ones would just take up too much space on the servers, while the ones that ‚Äúopen‚Äù could be easily switched. And been thinking that with private servers it would be cool if you could ‚Äúbuy‚Äù a house like in fo4 Dimond city.
---
There are things besides this game.
---
Ouch, I've got a feeling you're right on this one
---
Reminder that bottlecap mines used to be in the game and were removed. Wood masks and marine helmets aren't available game even tho they are in the game but they've released how many bullshit raider things in the atomic shop?
---
Since you don't raid they absolutely worthless to you, Think of them as steel or a screw. 
---
They are just crafting components of Vault 94 armor
---
Also you cannot sell them.
---
You're talking about damage drop-off over distance, not airborne vs grounded. The concept is the same. Your weapon is not up to the task of delivering damage over distance. You need a proper ranged weapon to fight a flying creature. Melee, pistol, or shotgun won't do. And arguably, your weapon isn't making a difference in the battle anyway, so having 5-20 people stop hitting the SBQ with hundreds or thousands of damage per second simply so that you can add another 171 damage here and there? Mathematically, it's pointless. Let them keep shooting. Your efforts would be better invested in keeping ground-based secondary enemies off of the heavy hitters, reviving them, etc. That's an equally critical part of the SBQ battle. Get a couple of shots on the SBQ to get loot-eligible and then use your build for a more suitable task. Or bring a build that is more suited to fighting a freaking sky monster from hell.
---
No dude I was literally sitting right the fuck under her, it has nothing to do with distance
---
She literally takes less damage in the air
---
I forgot that taking off mutations isn't always so simple. If you can't afford to get rid of it, use a Rad-X as soon as you see an aggressive wanted player coming at you. That will prevent your passive defenses from triggering PVP. Super annoying, but the griefers will typically go away due to boredom. There's nothing more annoying to a griefer than trying to get a rise out of someone who won't even acknowledge the griefer's existence.
---
I agree man. I only bought the $60 version, and still money buy what I can get from the free atoms I get in game.
---
Because...? It's either she has a different damage threshold in the air, which is factually incorrect and easily verified... Or your weapon isn't delivering the same damage.
---
Didnt change anything. Still not working.
---
Just built it. Im pretty broke so I wouldn't have bad much to spend
---
Im running the game fine with RARELY any crashes or freezes on a i5-7300HQ + 1050 4gb gaming laptop.
---
Psn? My bad. I was thinking i could look it up on 76s social tab.
---
Alright how's about this. Instead of arguing. The next time you do sbq. Turn your on screen damage numbers on. Shoot here in the same spots in the air and on the ground and record your numbers than post it back here.
---
I'm looking at this from the perspective of person that loves to be attacked. Back when I had survival, I tended to greet met people with emotes: hello, pvp, ?? - and if they didn't respond with PvP emote or with violence, I left them by. I sought challenge, I'd prefer to be attacked by a group than to attack somebody chilling. In the even older days, when there were leaderboard map markers, and I've approached a Target and seen they're currently crafting/fixing something, instead of taking easy shot I announced myself with PvP emote and gave them few seconds to compose themselves, as well as saying via VoiP - "leave the camp so I won't break anything while I will be shooting you"
---
Yeah on psn its KevinBarbarian
---
Let's try to at least keep what little lore isn't altered... I don't think it's necessary to see any of those.
---
You...thought Bethesda would have a game without a ton of bugs, and would be quick to patch them?
---
Pc?
---
I payed 18k for mine.
---
This game doesn't feel it has enough content to keep you going like a traditional mmo like ESO, doing the builds and getting the legendaries was fun for a while then you realize its not really a mmo and it has no content that requires a dedicated build and most enemies die regardless of your playstyle without any effort. I hope Wastelanders improve this game i got to the point that i only log to do week challenges and get scrips.
---
I would love this. I done the bloatfly horde down the ash heap the other day. Kept spawning about 20 odd flies as long as I didn't kill the horde boss and it was great fun and actually quite intense.  It would be sooooo much better if that number had a huge increase. Mayhem. The legendary drop I had was poor but I ended up with nearly 120 bloatfly glands so no need to farm them for a while for the Sting and Things daily either. It was bloody great fun and the best horde event fun I've had. Although admittedly I've not done many horde events apart from leader of the pack/wolf horde but that has only about 20 wolves in total and once you get passed a certain level it's not really worth doing apart from the fact you get 3 low level legendarues to scrip.
---
If you're on ps4 I'll sell you as much as you need for 2caps each
---
It‚Äôs all speculation besides there being factions (whatever that really means for us), new main quests, and a dialogue tree system with human NPCs in instanced areas.
---
Check out the BoS antiair installations that surround Cranberry bog. Since I introduced these to my farming routes, I started offloading excess ballistic fiber to my mules.
---
One thing I do like and wonder with 76 is that there so much opportunity for it to feel like a living world and evolve over time. Building camps, playing with other people and vendors, updates. Skyrim made me a little sad because on console I knew I was playing in essentially a dead world that eventually I would explore all of. I love Skyrim, I just see a lot of potiental for this game if they choose to continue developing it. Versus waiting for a new release a decade away.
---
Atom shop usually updates on Tuesdays. There should be an inside the vault today that talks about the Halloween event though!
---
What quest would that be?
---
And please stop making assumptions and saying my build don't work for her. I burn about 180 rounds a fight. I avoid shooting here when she's flying for the most part. So I'd say 120 of those rounds hit her head in vats.  The rest go to the monsters that spawn. I have a crit every third shot. That's 4 normal and 2 crits per cylinder. Crits hit for 342, normal shots about 35. Do the math I'd 40 crits hit, and 80 normal shots (13680 + 2800 = 16480 damage) that's 1/3 of her life if you include the health regeneration . But it varies from fight to fight. If there's a bunch of really strong players she dies alot faster and I don't do as much
---
The whole lying Lowe questline. Have you read the sheepsquatch posters in train stations?
---
maybe on the 15th? the next atomic shop update is due then.
---
Damage numbers are always on for me. I don't fight the SBQ often (no point, she has nothing I need). My damage numbers are consistent with my Bloodied Faster Fire Rate handmade, ground or air.
---
Slaughter mole miners and you will end up with loads of it.
---
Haha whilst I could probably do with a bit of new liver, I am on PC, sorry!
---
It doesn't, however it affects VATS range and accuracy. It also affects the amount of increase you get with Concentrate Fire
---
Make sure you dont have a poison aura due to mutations, it triggers when you are sick.
---
Brahmin dont give milk when taking damage.
---
I'm mostly hiding from griefers at the moment, but thx &amp; back at you :)
---
You need to be on Windows 10, it will not run on Windows 7 and produces this sort of error message.
---
Fallout runs on Windows 7, 8, 8.1, and 10. Need help getting Fallout to run? Please check the [sidebar / drop down menu fix guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/FalloutMods/wiki/fixguide) for a list of fixes that will get the game running.
---
Instead of having frag mines strapped to them ,  how about nuke mines strapped to molerats?
---
What level are you?
---
Your build doesn't matter. There's no reason for Bethesda to develop an emote to tell people to stop fighting in a boss battle.
---
If your solution to a problem is to make everyone else change to suit your desires, you've probably missed a few more practical solutions to the problem, or you're trying to solve the wrong problem. I don't think the problem here is that you don't have the right emotes to beat the SBQ. I think you could solve this problem without any emotes at all.
---
Level 80 but I'm so bad your swear it's a level 10 character
---
Im on Windows 10. I dont believe there are any updates for my Windows either. :(
---
You literally said "arguably your weapon isn't making a difference anyway"
---
Oh I didn't realise that was a reward. I was informed earlier in the year that the fixer plan had to be purchased from a vendor.
---
Nope i dont... guess questing is an option
---
I know carry weight is an issue but pick up all the weapons &amp; armor that drop and scrap them. You can use any worldbench (armor, chemistry, weapon, tinker) to scrap stuff. You'll learn weapon &amp; armor mods from scrapping unused items. Once you learn a mod it's yours forever to mod your gear with.
---
Your armor, like leather, automatically opens new recipes. So at level 10 you can craft a new better armor set, hopefully add a few mods you learned scrapping. You can also learn mods from armor you craft then scrap
---
Early on reducing you stimpacks to diluted stimpacks at a chemistry bench along with First Aid perk (Intelligence) will help a lot until stimpacks are no longer an issue. 
---
Food and crafted drinks spoil and become useless so don't cook too much at once. Collect &amp; cook on the go so your not carrying food that will spoil before you can use it.
---
Morgantown Airport is a good place to find low level weapons.
---
Correct. I did say that.
---
Someone perked out for food. All food related perks, refrigeration backpack, carrying around tons of soups with high spoilage time that they make from their garden.
---
Get a mic. Talking to people isn't as scary as you would think.
---
Yes.
---
I check out the reddit and forum to see if anything is new, especially news on wastelanders, but I haven't played since the beginning of summer.
---
Don't get me wrong, I am not complaining, as I definitely got my monies worth from the game.  But I am playing ESO right now, as I wait for the Outer World to release in a few weeks.  When Wastelanders comes, I will be back for sure.
---
Since the in-game solution has been removed, I'm building 3rd party one. I've recently did a survey on PvP (it's close to the top on my posts list), and I am using the data I've gathered to build something.
---
Right now I'm leaning towards setting this up as a shared calendar that simultaneously gives different levels of permissions and doesn't require accounts to manage (besides the moderators).
---
This will be a tool for PvP interested people to advertise the time-frames that fit them, and events they organise, so that PvPers could find each other.
---
Stop beating the word literally. What did it ever do to you?
---
I try and hold off scriping legendary until I come across a low level player and give to them. Because of stash and weight limit, sometimes I have no choice but 1 and 2*'s most times I will scrip.
---
Amen. Children of the Atom isn‚Äôt my thing, but I completely agree on the trashy, dirty vibe. We need some scuffed up floors, burn damaged wallpaper (hell, just torn and faded would be peachy), walls with boarded up holes, the list goes on. There‚Äôs a place for these shiny floors, but to me they just look ridiculous, especially when the furniture you‚Äôre sticking down on them is largely so worn and crappy. 
---
I want my house to look like somewhere I‚Äôve patched up to a liveable standard, like most of the pre-built houses you explore in the game. Instead, without real time and consideration, anything you build right now sticks out like a sore thumb in FO76‚Äôs environment.
---
Your vending machine is great place to move weapons like you describe. Also many weapons that can out-punch their level rank will sell very quickly.
---
A level 35 bloodied lever-action can be far more powerful than a non-legendary level 45 so it‚Äôs still a sought after weapon.
---
I buy things like that from player vending whenever I can find them. I like to have a few good lower level weapons in my machines for help folks under level 50 power up.
---
I try and help out low lvl players as often as possible with marketing free weapons, armor ammo etc but I fell like the type of weapon i mentioned is a little too generous.
---
i had some hard crashing issues on X1 on monday, a hard reset fixed it right up though. had no issues since, so i don't think its platform related
---
This might sting some but this is all truth - the survival mode was destroyed for us PvPers to accommodate to needs of majority coop focused players.
---
Office pods would be great. Though given the camp system‚Äôs current desire to put anything in a closed area on the roof, I kinda dread laying down some furniture in one.
---
Ok, I still struggle to move them in my vendors, what would you suggest I sell something like the mentioned weapon for?
---
Where did you get the plan for the large display case? I only have the small one with the slanted top.
---
I did , it says it right on the OP
---
The mutation is not patched. If you are not in passive and a wanted player gets it to activate, you will become hostile to them. 
---
Side note;  if they do it near a WS bot you will turn the bots hostile to you, regardless of Pacifist mode settings.
---
It'll be ok.
---
All the display cases were free to everyone. No plans... Try clicking left or right when you're on the display case tab in your builder. You should find it.
---
I hope so, send a few heart emotes and I'll feel a little better
---
Well launching nukes is more for end game players in good size groups or in my case im lvl 104 currently and i use thoes areas to grind exp for fun.
---
I know  and I mean some challenges  do give you a pretty good amount but it should be more
---
No I get it
---
Yes the left side of the map, particularly the forest area where you come out of the vault and the toxic valley north of it are more for newer players. Depending on who you ask they say to either do the main quest right away, or wait until level 50 so the weapon rewards will be higher, it's up to you. 
---
Btw during the summer, Big Macs here were 2 for 5 bucks.. Sad they stopped that lol
---
I partly blame Bethesda for this. 1) they failed to consider the consequences and stay true to the original intent of Survival, 2) they failed to make even the smallest changes to keep Survival economical - the 12 cap limit was accidentally implemented only or month or two after launch, and NEVER corrected, and 3) they assumed that NW would be enough to appease the griefers.
---
Know how many griefers I've seen in Nuclear Winter? 3. Only 1 had moderate success. I couldn't drag them into NW if my life depended on it, because they don't want a fair fight. It's a huge blow to the ego.
---
There are more interior cells than I thought there were. Definitely less than FO4 or at least it feels that way. But you're right. The sense of neverending exploration comes from knowing you have yet to see it all. There could be anything around the corner.
---
Is this for ps4 i would like to get my raid armor
---
Yes, why would I watch a video Im commenting about. And how I could refer to a particular thing in the video, without watching it?
---
I just tried to address the errors in video. Few days ago Bethesda said they fixed a exploit so that's a fact. But duping mines still work, I just tested it. So it was quite likely an actual item duping that was fixed, since it was something they fixed, and there's strong sings of certain fairly new items being duped.(although it seems the number of players knowing how, seems limited)
---
Also, those mines don't explode. They are duped in disarmed state. If they could explode it would more likely crash a client than the server, as the servers seem to be fine with such loads of mines players are duped and left laying around.
---
To some degree it's curious this mine duping hasn't yet been fixed, as it was first published on youtube about two weeks ago, and since then other more prolific youtubers have made a video about it as well.
---
But it does make sense. It's not very serious, it doesn't do anything like allow players to trade Atom shop painted items, or actual item duping of anything that's valuable, which are things Bethesda has made unscheduled fixes for, so they'll likely fix it on next major patch.
---
Yeah I actually don‚Äôt think getting rid of them
---
Maybe about 1250?
---
Yeah just random. Like getting a fixer from the legendary vendor. I see so many people selling/trading them but I‚Äôve never got one. Burned through 4K scrip trying on two characters and not one. Some people just have the luck
---
Wait have the robo scavengers come out already?
---
Same thing happened to me yesterday. It's greyed out (as if you don't have the materials), and when you try and craft it tries to sell you a raider PA bundle.
---
If they add spiders I'll fckin cry. We're getting a wendigo colossus and floaters with wastelanders and hopefully some other non arachnid based terrors!
---
I have not heard clear&amp;sure description on when it happens, but the shooting the other guy referred, or even looking at the freshly spawned creature(as some have fixed spawn points) before it completes it's thing, might cause it.
---
Can't help what other players do, but you can try to avoid doing it yourself.
---
No luck at that price, I'll list things like this for 800 and get no bites.
---
Yes, I'm waiting for Wastelanders
---
The reason I do videos instead of pics is because I don't know how or what you need to use to have it in a coherent list but I'll give it a shot.
---
I made about 10k couple days ago by selling them as scrip items to high level players. I also always buy 3\* items from vendors if they are priced less than 800.
---
Lol, I'll help out too if I can man its np.
---
Thanks for the advice, I find they fail at around 800 but will sell at 550-600 which is an absolute steal
---
It only shows Bethesdas priorities. Can't allow players to bypass paywalls with duping methods, but a duping method that causes server instability is low priority. You can't tell me "it seems fine" that people are encountering mountains of duped mines that the server has to keep track of. 
---
I strongly believe the uptick in server instability since meat week is directly a result of people abusing this "harmless" duping method.
---
Yeah I hit a wall a couple weeks ago. Bad combination of the terrible state the game is in and me having played 1300+ hours... I really love Fallout 76. It has the bones for a perfect game, just never gets any closer to reaching that. I‚Äôm sure Wastelanders will be fun, but I think Fallout 76 would benefit most from brand new map spaces. The best part of this game and the other fallout games was discovering all of the locations. Before any of that happens, they need to make it playable. The only challenge in the whole game is ‚Äúhow do I play through this lag?‚Äù. And they need to fix jet packs! ugh!
---
Would be a great cap sink.
---
This, sadly. Exit and reenter if you have a good hit chance and miss 2.
---
They just need to add like 30 more songs in general. That would make the radio üëåüèº
---
Lvl 36 and ‚ÄúI am Death‚Äù
---
I think that might be the problem.
---
That's VAST...Vault Assisted Scouting Tool :)
---
Its a term for someone built for PVE not PVP or someone who plays for PVE and not PVP 
---
Example: 
---
chameleon armor with ap regeneration 
---
Tesla with assassin's legendary effects
---
Serendipity perk
---
Its basically an insult but not an insult my PA heavy weapon character is a food build but my bloodied stealth commander isnt
---
Fallout 76 saved me from D2.
---
I traded mine for 14500 and It was bought within an hour of me putting it up.
---
The weapon is a drop from the quest. The plan is a drop from the event at the end of the quest.
---
Nobody is completely perked out for food lol
---
Sons of Dane compound, on the back there is makeshift shooting range with a lot of orange canisters, acetone canisters ans so on. In for defiance there are a lot of fuses to collect.
---
Its killing my gameplay. Certain things can set off migraines and I was unlucky enough to find the constant gunfire bug is one.
---
Holy shit you spent a lot. Like seriously that's insane. you justify blowing hundreds on worthless mobile games because "other people spend thousands"? You have a problem dude. 
---
I have 2k hours in game and I have never ever ever bought atoms, I earn them. But I play almost exclusively in first person mode so I don't care much how my character looks, I'm very happy with my current outfit of the cheap atom shop skull mask and skeleton outfit.
---
Yes if you want to listen to the Grafton Mayor
---
That's not true, just because you and your friends arent doesn't mean no one is. I've met many on xbox.
---
I have 3 mules under lv 5 that I roll murmurgh for lv1 armor. You actually get some really nice shit for lv1 weight redux armor, especially wwr.
---
Ah man I had 3 1* doubles that I sold for 1000 each in my vending machines. Feel like I could have got more now :/
---
You can get all the ore you'd ever need from Breach and clear. I usually just dtop my copper ore but it's plentiful at those events. Also as an added bonus you may get lucky and find the elusive Plasma Grenade plan
---
I love the plasma flamethrower. I have an anti armor one. Fantastic. Chews through ammo, but it‚Äôs so worth it.
---
I often say Whitespring for farming needs. 
---
Do a normal run outside, then go into the vending area like you are going to scrap and sell. Hit every vending area and pick up their junk (including the alcove to the left as you enter from the back clubhouse area). Grab phones, magnifying glasses and if you have copper tagged the vases that show up as well (some have copper). 
---
Clipboards are always solid and shopping baskets have plastic ... but that place is also filled with telephones and magnifying glasses. Look at the tables as well in the shopping areas, probably 10 magnifying glasses and over a dozen phones. Dont forget the buttercup, blocks and other kids toys. Run upstairs near the bar and grab the board games too, then head to the enclave bunker. Phones and screws and tape and clipboards.
---
If you do a full run and grab everything, you'll be surprised at the resource concentrations there.
---
Yeah but they are just silly joke telling robots that make a tiny amount of junk, its not some amazing utility piece and the refrigerator is literally worthless so I'd never buy it.
---
If you enjoy fallout and the idea of fallout with friends appeals to you then buy it. Every bethesda game has its bugs, but why do we keep playing them, because they make some of the best open world RPGs out there.
---
There are sooo many emotes that need to be added. It must be a terrible difficult thing to do, otherwise bethesda would‚Äôve added then by now. We‚Äôve been waiting for the ‚ÄúIm sorry‚Äù emote since game launch!
---
What does it do? The fridge I mean does it keep food from spoiling or something and to me a tiny bit a junk would be very helpful
---
Is the community friendly? Like could I make friends easily or do I have to keep my guard up?
---
If you are on W10, have about 220GB free space, disabled the firewall completely (on your PC and the router), and it still don't install, then it's time to open a ticket with beth.
---
 [Bethesda Support](https://help.bethesda.net/app/account/overview)
---
I'd say it's the friendliest of any game community I've been a part of. With that said there are still the bad apples. You cant avoid that, but if you read through this reddit it's full of stories of people helping each other, friend being made etc.
---
Popcorn ceilings are an abomination in any context!
---
But hey it's October so why not.
---
Gat that shit out of here, we're talking about fo76.
---
It slows spoiling for food in your stash by 50%. It doesn't work for food in your inventory. Food in your inventory can last 90% longer with the "good with salt" perk or the backpack mod. The refrigerator is second rate junk.
---
That's good, I am getting closer to being convinced of buying it, I really like it even with it's history
---
Only thing I use is the veil as a mask on one character.
---
I do have the others ... all rise ... etc but dont use. 
---
Well, except the fixer and that was pre legendary availability. Now ... but it is different.
---
Makes sense
---
Bummer.
---
&gt;You can't tell me "it seems fine" that people are encountering mountains of duped mines that the server has to keep track of.
---
It doesn't seem to crash the servers, nor significantly mess up trading as no one was much using or paying for mines anyway. So that's my defination of not too serious.
---
I haven't played in about a week, just started to do my rounds, but this method was somewhat known and out already during meat week. Few times I duped meat cleavers near the meat cook and scrapped them, and left the wood in a container since wood was used on the event. No one seemed to mind and the largest piles I created, before picking them up, seemed to have no effect on server or my game.
---
I would expect most people just to dupe enough to get their 1400 daily caps out. And when you pick those mines up they just become one stack. Last time I played, I didn't see any stacks left by other players, but it's obvious players have more and more become aware of it and done it themselves too. Plus it seems that console you can keep the button downpressed and it will continue to create them at high rate, while on PC where I play, you have to manually click the relevant button each time, and it creates them significantly slower rate. In other words it's much more difficult on PC to create a large pile of them for lols, so players probably do it less.
---
I can't play fo4 anymore after I got 76. That said, I enjoy it very much.
---
I do take a different approach to the game, meaning I RP, explore and don't  really use any meta or builds.
---
The good thing is that you don't need the meta if you don't want to. The game can be enjoyed however you want to experience it.
---
I love fallout and didnt buy it at launch due to the negative publicity.I picked it up on sale a few months ago and I've enjoyed it more than any other fallout game. My whole family plays.
---
Yea that's a good one!
---
I hate the radio requests because it's not going to happen. There will never be another song added due to licensing. Period. Ever. Ring of fire was added because it appears to have been recorded purposefully for the game while advertising Nuclear Winter.
---
The National Isolated Radio array and National Radio Astronomy  Research Center are loaded with Phones.
---
Whitesprings if it hasn't been cleared out, Sugar Grove also has some Phones as well.
---
Same on xbox. For the last couple of patches they flagged this as fixed, but it has never gotten any better.
---
This is good too, but by the title I expected a suggestion to have NPCs pop a stealth boy and unload 60 Tesla rounds into you when you're at a vendor.
---
It's worth looking into r/fo76_pvp I think?
---
I have three characters, and they all periodically start the day with unloaded weapons. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs every single time with my alt and his Gatling gun. 50/50 with my main character and a handmade or hunting rifle.
---
If you log out with a melee weapon equipped, your guns will stay loaded. It‚Äôs so insignificant and familiar to me that I just automatically press reload when logging in.
---
They don't already? That's so half-arsed, but I guess it's like ths floors
---
That's good, I don't know anyone who has a pc so I'd have to make friends on F76, but I am now really looking forward to a time where I can buy it and play it
---
Glad to hear it. You will meet many decent people on PC I'm sure. I'm on ps4 myself. Best of luck friend.
---
Thanks and best of luck to you too

The asylum and any other military area are good spots. If you need a lot, just bounce from one base to the next and you‚Äôll have around 50-60 after clearing out all spots. 
---
Most of the military areas are on the far east side of the map, so put some stealth perks on if your DPS isn‚Äôt very high.
---
Thank you very much for your kind offer and it's a shame i'm on pc.
---
Anyway this and other answer like this make me love this game more and more because, unlike others, has a great community, i hope someday i will be able to interact in some other ways :)
---
Crippling the wings is definitely the best way without a doubt.  I'm referring to her animations getting stuck because of stagger. When she's hovering low to the ground and is staggered repeatedly and not performing new animations, just sitting there looking like she's having a seizure.
---
Open a ticket with Bethesda support, but it sounds like your character data may be corrupted in their database.  No idea how they handle that myself.
---
If you're on ps4 then I might have the witch and skeleton costume plans I could sell you. I believe I have the costume and hat plans for both of them
---
Upvote from me. Because Stand Fast is excellent armor with the right upgrades (mine is BOS) and right perks (stealthy Commando build with Escape Artist) and complementary armor (two pieces of BOS Chameleon). 
---
I had Somerset Special very early in game, so it was low level and good for scrip only. With the right build, a level 50 Somerset Special could be interesting (seems easy to find .44 ammo).
---
That's kinds funny, woulda cracked up seeing someone throw baseball grenades outta desperation
---
Yes, the only exception is against the scrochbeast queen.
---
She gets a "natural" 80% reduction in damage before armor, so her armor of 300 is more like 1500 in practice, meaning it would take raw damage numbers in the 10 000 range to completely negate the effects of her armor, which is much more of a challenge than most enemies.
---
We have a ticket that's been open for a couple days. I put this in my original post.
---
You think it might be that were both caught in limbo? Both of our main characters that were playing together at the same time are experiencing the same exact issue
---
I would like to know the damage difference the SBQ receives in air vs on the ground.
---
Beth will never implement a live dj role for someone to fill because racial slurs exist.
---
Exterior Wall Paint and/or Exterior Wall Painted Faction Emblems not just flags or signage
---
Yes, it‚Äôs still there. Still have to wait before accessing your Pip Boy or it crashes by locking up the screen. 
---
I crouch for stealth when the screen appears, then wait a few seconds before accessing the Pip Boy. Pain in the ass, but reduces lock-ups.
---
Yeah... sometimes.
---
I certainly can‚Äôt say that, but equally you can‚Äôt say that when your average gamer hears ‚ÄòFallout 4 engine‚Äô they think of how it looks with mods rather than how the base game faired. If you were talking about people marvelling at the quality of mods, then I‚Äôm right there with you.  I suspect where we disagree is that I see the endless adaptability and skill of modders triumphing over the Creation engine, rather than being helped to their goals because of it.
---
Hell i see alot of dumb peeps selling legendaries to npc traders. So bought them up cheap then poped them in for script.
---
On PC you can stop getting the prompts for ‚ÄúPick a perk or move a point‚Äù if you have the perk loadout mod installed. I think it also applies to perk pack notifications.
---
2021?! That‚Äôs a whole year away lmao
---
I know it's not an end of the works issue I had just hoped it would get fixed when the other collection style challenges were fixed :)
---
Oh yeah you are right. Humans ruining it for humans again :-(
---
Some of the fan of Bethesda games is starting over and taking a different path. Maybe they should focus on that aspect.
---
Xiccarph may be on to something,but I gotta ask have you 2 done anything to be reported where your accounts may be comprised?and last,did you renew your Xbox live lol
---
All of eso's regular dungeons and trials are already instanced and scaled.. there is one public dungeon on each map that is not instanced.
---
Get it on sale usually 50% off, especially physical copies at retailers.
---
We're on PC (put that in original post as well) and no, we don't do anything that could compromise our accounts. Definitely not the issue
---
[QuakeCon FO76 Wastelanders Discussion](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/458687172?t=00h46m01s)  
---
So I linked the part of the quake con panel where **ALL** our current information about Wastelanders is coming from.
---
I've made some friends by being part of this subreddit, so that's a good start. 
---
Also, if you can find it cheap, it's worth it. I got a "Used-Like New" copy on Amazon for 17 bucks and change. 
---
Moreover, considering that the Wastelanders DLC is coming out in November, you can always start now and take your time going through the main story and side quests. That should give you plenty to do before the DLC releases. Then, you'll already be up to speed when Wastelanders drops.
---
True, I got mine for 17 dollars at the beginning of June and love the game. If I would of been someone who pre ordered the game, or even worse bought the screw me with a cheap bag version, I probably wouldn't be happy with my purchase.
---
I have really good internet. 100 down and 15+ up. Normal ping is under 15ms. Ryzen 5 and 16gb of ddr4 with game on a SSD. The only thing I can assume is that GTX 1050 (not Ti) is simply not powerful enough to run this game on the lowest settings. I can't imagine a multi-million dollar game is the thing to blame.
---
I go on a path to several locations. First go to Vault 76 and head over to Landview Lighthouse. There you will find the models of the lighthouse which give you copper when broken down. Go into the house to get some more from the lamps. Before fast traveling away head in the direction of the picnic area and keep going into the hill area to a vein of copper in the ground and three small ones in the rock face. The next area I head to for more is Hornwright Estate. There is a lot of broken lamps and other junk that have copper there and an added bonus the workout room which has weights which is a lot of lead. This is just two locations I farm but there are more that you can find.
---
My pc can't run it so it will take me a few months to get a new one, and then I need to get a monitor because I have a laptop, so I can't really play it anytime soon except maybe PS4 but I can't aim to save my life on PS4
---
Well those wastelanders who you meet have been surviving out there while we were safely getting fat in the Vault, they should actually shred unprepared dwellers
---
Slight correction. I believe that the NPCs themselves will be instanced, not the areas necessarily as they will still be out in the open world area. If areas are indeed instanced though, we could expect changes happening to the environment based on our choices, kinda unlikely though.
---
... this is still in the fucking game? I give up
---
I‚Äôm sure you have
---
Oh, okay. I just play it on PS4, so it hasn't been an issue for me. But when I see gameplay on PC, it looks a hell of a lot better (obviously). So it might not hurt to wait until you can play it on with an upgraded PC.
---
They said areas will be in pretty sure. Anyway we will see.
---
Is just for fun..
---
Complaining brings light to issues in the game that need fixed.. 
---
Or ya know, we could just have the same mess that dropped almost a year ago and be happy with it .. S/
---
There's a 180 last-picked-up-items list per every character, I think with weekly reset. If you visit same locations and only pick up selected items, it might be possible they're still on the last-picked-up-items for your toon. Go somewhere where shit is abundant and pick up two hundreds of whatever's, then go loot your military ammo bags - they should appear to you next time you visit this location, even if they were empty 20 minutes ago, on the same server, last time you visited it.
---
1. Umm every mmo ever released have bugs its a given.so to think there wouldent be bugs or to think they can be patched out fast is stupid. Every game is made from billions of diffrent codes inter linked and to find thoes bugs takes time.2 every game from 1995 and on to now that is online service has alwase had a in game shop to buy things from. As i keep telling others who think everything should be free. Bethesda cant make content if there bankrupt thanks to players not willing to support / pay into the game. Im a whale so i pay $100.00 + usd per month to buy in game items to help bethesda out. I also spend $100.00 + usd every month on ESO in game perchases to help out ZOS who is the parent company and owns Bethesda.
---
It‚Äôs not only possible that human NPCs will be added. It‚Äôs happening in a month
---
Lol that's true you did say that. Tell your wife to touch the router with one hand and the reach as high as you can with a coat hanger in the other while you try to log in
---
True, Bethesda is notoriously known for fixing the bate minimum and allowing modders to fix the rest.
---
Oh that's good, I would like that
---
Sadly not. Almost all solo-designed dungeons in ESO are public, not just the specifically named public dungeons (bizarre I know). Only a very few main story specific dungeons are instanced, and the group designed dungeons of course. 
---
Which means there are genuinely dungeon quests where some ancient spirit will tell you that you're the first person to step foot in his ancient ruin for a thousand years, while half a dozen other players sprint and jump around behind him nuking the respawning mobs...
---
If devs want dungeons in MMOs to be shared, then they should at least write the dungeon story to support that, and create a respawn system that doesn't have mobs materialise from thin air.
---
anyine know if the Marine Armour Helmet is missing the keyword?
---
Supernatants generally drop some amount of caps when they are killed.
---
Those aren't dungeons, they are simple one-boss delves, like mini dungeons with easy bosses. And no, they aren't instanced because they respawn quickly and they are easy.
---
Fucking Preston kept your ass moving...
---
Well vendor will reset each day...you can also sell some stuff at your own vendor... or kill ghouls, super mutants, etc
---
We need more events inside mines...
---
Inside spaces in general.
---
They dont all need to be raids, but zone and open the vaults.
---
Most folks have given you the key tips already but just know carry weight is a challenge early on and there‚Äôs a free backpack plan available at Morgantown Aiport to give you a 30 lb carry weight boost.
---
Just kill the lower-level Scorched that spawn in and make your way upstairs to the Overseers cache chest. I believe the ID card to get you up the stairs is usually on a dead responder on the lower level.
---
Will make life so much easier! Have fun, and if you‚Äôre on PC come see me. My base/store are above Blackwater mine in the East part of the map. I can craft up some solid weapons and armor for you to help you level and give you some water etc.
---
IGN basically the same as here, Haemar2018+
---
Kind of the end of the game at that point. Can't grind the events you want like you used to, now I just log in to do dailys and check player vendors because you never know what you'll find. Luckily nukes seem to get launched even more with the public event changes, so I've recently begun to stack up improved repair kits. 
---
Seriously though, all my friends quit and are either back on Ark or playing BO3. It's been lonely and boring in apocalypse lately, which ig is how the apocalypse should feel.. Hmm, maybe I'm on to something..
---
Grafton Monsters and Megasloths drop caps as well. 
---
Mothman egg omelets sell great at vendors. 
---
Also the perks Super Dooper and Chemist are amazing together. And using perks that double your harvested ingredients are a very good investment.
---
Gonna add this on the end in case nobody wants to read a book with edits. I made a new character, got it out of vault 76, logged off of it. Logged back in to main, it let me on and I immediately fast traveled to 76, where game force stopped. Restarted game and logged on to main, have been playing for 15 min or so for the first time in 5 days. Still waiting for it to start up again, but if not, hope this helps
---
Ohh look.  A probable duper selling in game items for real money. How special.
---
Possum badges are a lot harder to get now that campfire tales is a random public event. Are their other events that give badges? The badge challenges are tedious, and even after slowly chopping at them for a few months, I have maybe one badge unlocked that way.
---
Agreed! If they reduced the price to 10% of the current atom shop prices, i would buy almost everything. That would make me spend more money than the current nothing i spend on atoms. Automatron cost me ¬£8, for the same ¬£8 i get around 1000 atoms, which doesn't even get me a snazzy PA paint?!
---
Bugger off you scalper.
---
I think all prices should be slashed in half.
---
Lol fucking pathetic.
---
Depends on your definition of dungeon I suppose. By Bethesda game standards, and certainly by TES standards, they are dungeons. And by making them open to all players at once just because "it's an MMO" the experience is watered down and devalued.
---
Mobs have to respawn, which means you can't read notes and lore books safely. Bosses are swarmed by players so there's no engaging battle at the end. Careful stealth play is discouraged because most players sprint through, and again, those damn respawns. Chests aren't end-of-dungeon rewards anymore but first-come-first-served deals. Quests are typically written as though a dungeon is unique to you, so you're tacitly asked to pretend none of the other players exist. It's game design that fights itself. Which is weird, because many of the public dungeons show the dev team CAN write and design dungeon stories and mechanics to work with multiple players present at once. They're just too blinded by archaic MMO design to recognize the times when being a shared world experience is of detriment to the game design.
---
Yes. It takes time to fix those issues. 2021 is reasonable.
---
Agrees with itsmillertime.
---
Xbox
---
It's for fun. The last time this was a daily I didn't even realize it. I just thought everyone at the event was crazy since I was the only one there who wasn't naked.
---
Tbh nothing is more freakier than when scorched and ghouls are frozen, but still move around and attack. Some Exorcist ish right there
---
Harvest assault rifles,laser rifles in Harpers Ferry where vendor is close by.
---
It's a shitty PA anyway.
---
So 10% turns a really shitty deal into what ? 
---
10% off still means you only save about a dollar or 2 per item if that is what you need in order to empty your wallet into BSG's money hole i think you might be the target audience.
---
Even at 50% off it would still be a godawful deal as all this shit they sell in the atom store one game ago was covered by free mods and could be again if they pulled the finger out of the arsehole and go busy on private servers so the community can fix this shit once again.
---
Trying to milk the last dollars out of a dying game rather than allowing those who actually give a damm to help will be what ends fallout 76 as far as i can see.
---
it would be on for only 55 seconds and those seconds would be full of
---
"and heres 56 reasons why the jews started the great war"
---
Read what i wrote properly... i said atom shop items should cost 10% of what they currently cost.
---
I recently bought one from a player vendor. I assumed they added it since i don't read the patch changelogs anymore.
---
Some NPCs will be in instanced areas whole some won't. For instance in the trailer at e3 the settler we first see was outside on a farm near 76
---
If you find a low level two shot explosive assault rifle and you scrip it, you need help. That would go for a lot of caps. Or get you a great trade.
---
[Floaters (FEV Flatworms)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Floater_(Wastelanders)) and [Wendigo Colossus](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/File:FO76WL_wendigo_colossus_concept_art.jpg) are coming in Wastelanders. I wouldn't be surprised if there are more creatures to be revealed closer to launch.
---
You play at least 7 hours every day and you are saying this dude has a problem? 
---
Let people play their games the way they want to play their games
---
Thanks for the advice, think I went through Morgantown airport on the quest line, I‚Äôm fairly sure I picked the plan up, how do I go about crafting it if so?. I‚Äôve built a fairly basic camp so far and I‚Äôm getting there slowly, almost level 10. However most of my weapons and armour are complete trash, is there any good low level weapons and armour around that I should be looking out for?. Also I‚Äôm only on PS4 sorry:(
---
You play the event as always, just upon finishing you remove the clothes, get challenge complete, re-equip the clothes. It's like 20 seconds of your time, come on...
---
I bounce around player vendors looking for deals and then flip then in my vending machines for regular prices. I make most of my caps buying and flipping junk and flux. I also throw crap legendaries in my machines for about 25 caps per scrip and they sell pretty fast, most heavy ones just get scripped though.
---
If you have the scrapper perk, scrap all the guns for steel. I made over 1500 steel yesterday doing this and sold it all for 1cap a piece in my vendor within an hour of putting it in there.
---
My main is a level 340+, Vanguard, Stealth Rifleman, fun to play and rarely dies, but the game ate all my Armor a few months ago, and I'm still trying to rebuild it properly. I recently started a new Bloodied Build Character, and I'm having a lot of fun with it, I just started doing the main quest line after getting to level 50, now at 67, and my SPECIAL &amp; PERK build is nearly complete, just need a few QOL &amp; crafting perks, and I'm still working on my Armor. The best part of this game is the social aspect of it, I've made a lot of new friends, and we help each other out a lot, so everyday is a new adventure with my friends as we conquer the wasteland, or just help build someone a new CAMP.
---
Well high lvls have the savage divide well unless so lost low level enters witch drops the level scale to there level. And the mire is the same. It scales to our lvl except when low lvl's are there. And same with cramberry bog aswell. And this is how bethesda fucked up. Nothing should ever scale down for them. They want on to our turf then they need to learn to stay alive or run there little asses back to the forest or graften.or the ash heap.or toxic valley.
---
Skyrim was boring because 90% of the dungeons were copy paste borfests
---
OK makes sense I guess. I'm only stating what the devs themselves hinted at so far, which is that the instanced tech we've seen in the new raid so far will be also in place for the NPCs in wastelanders. 
---
Both of the things we've speculated ARE possible to be in the dlc, just not confirmed yet. Anyways I dunno how it will turn out so let's wait and see.
---
What I think is ridiculous is praying the event actually pops up. I never saw it yesterday even once..
---
Man, grats for your effort. I also played for some time and farmed the Ash Heap events, but was lucky to buy the plan for 30k recently. Now I need few more rare plans to finish my collection (Sturdy Metal Torso, Heavy Raider (legs, arms, torso), Heavy Metal arms and Plasma Mine).
---
Ah, where do I go to get the correct software installed on my Pip-Boy?
---
Skyrim is a RPG mainly if uwant thatgo playElder scrolls Online.
---
F76 is mainly a survival game.
---
I believe it's not hard for them, but immersion breaking. Doesn't bother me tho, I enjoy running around Appalachia like a madman in my bathrobe and slasher mask.
---
It just seems like a long time as it‚Äôs not the biggest bug yk. I would understand why it‚Äôd take long with the other big bugs and updates though. A year is a lot :)
---
You probably right, but I remember much more "wicked" challenges - like killing squirells with beer hat and drunk or do a photo while naked in the nuked zone.
---
 \*Trombone sound\* eheh i'll just sit in the corner.
---
Interesting.  Thanks.  I was hoping it was some majestic nom nom build where all food and drink is ridiculously beneficial, no disease, no rads, lots of healing... :(. Lol
---
Take a photo while naked in a nuke zone was a real challenge or an example? Lol
---
Dont be mean. It's not his fault he's not a robobrain.
---
Yeah the jew are turning the frogs Gay!!!
---
No it dont beat any armour because for alot of people its unusable in its current state freezing peoples pcs
---
Real challenge - not only to find nuke zone, but also stay alive long enough to friend could make a photo. It was shortly after camera was introduced. Luckily with Rad shield you could stay there for few second, which was enough.
---
maybe thats where we got the strongman frogs from.
---
Would to see/hear more about this in the upcoming dataminers AMA!
---
It happens man! If the 4 horsemen PA sets cost 180 atoms i would buy all, whereas the 1800 they cost is a farce. I felt shitty after spending 500 on raider backpack last week, to then not be able to apply it to characters that only have the small backpack unlocked?!
---
&gt;  Its like there is so much you can do to feel more powerful or tanky but why get to that point? What are you going to use it on?
---
The Scorchbeast Queen, of course. :)
---
I have not seen that quest in a long time.
---
lol I may have exaggerated my playtime. I play this game with my discord buddies, paying extra money is not part of the equation when im out here enjoying the ways to earn atoms because im doing it with my friends. do the dailies. put your freaking wallet away, if it werent for your absurd spending, this business model wouldnt exist. for every whale theres a hundred normal people who have to get bombarded with pricetags that we never wanted and wont pay in a million years.
---
Ive been doing a lot more dailies since they added scrip rewards. I‚Äôve also been doing more events I normally skip, as I quit joining Uranium and 1VN. It‚Äôs been lucrative, too.
---
In the past week I got the casual shielded plan from Queen of the Hunt, hatchet electro plan from Strange Brew and a Leather Coat from Irrational Fear. Also got a DCG plan from a green toolchest in the Ash Heap, but that‚Äôs not related to dailies/events aside from going to the Ash Heap while doing them.
---
I got a direct reply from lady dev Anne which I‚Äôm happy  to provide , to a post I made few weeks back when the SB Quota challenge began 
---
I wrote ‚Äú maybe we are killing all the SB because when wastelanders drops they will be gone like survival mode because how can SB - fissure sights and NPCs all interact without complete chaos ... they will thank us for cleansing the wasteland allowing their return ... 
---
She replied ‚Äú I can guarantee SB will not be taken out of the game when wastelanders comes ‚Äú 
---
I felt allot of pride in just being directly replied too ,  but
---
I've been on the same path. I'm glad you finally found it. Congrats
---
Yeah
---
I buy low-level interesting weapons such as a lv5 BSS shovel or lv10 TSE pipe rifles. Great for alts, great to collect.
---
Lately I've just been farming things for my vending machines. I'm about to abandon selling ammo, it just doesn't move, I think I'll stick to selling dog food, stimpacks and junk.
---
Idea is kind of ok, but 2/3 of the map is much exaggerated - every time I see low level players (below 50) playing 'high' level zones because it's faster that killing countless LVL5 mobs. If most of the map would be that difficult it'll require constant server hops for them to be able to play the region they want. Which is not fun.
---
Wow. What a nice player.
---
I believe that stacks with rad x, and I believe radx stacks a few times or with diluted rad x unless its been changed. I'd have to log on and check for myself now lol.
---
Isn't that the Mothman Event? How is that dangerous to do naked?
---
no its felt more like tyring to get decent gear and constantly getting trash that i can barely offload for scrip while doing the same events over and over only to realise that im too low level and too busy to be able to compete with these lvl500s and also code vein came out so ive just been playing that instead
---
&gt; I‚Äôm really struggling. Is there any way I can get more players interested in PvP?
---
As a lvl 250ish non pvp player I would have to say no for me.
---
 I just don't have one spark of interest in fighting another player for any reason. 
---
 Most pve players are built for PVE and wouldn't do much good in a PVP battle on this game.
---
 This games PVP relies far too much on your gear rather than any skill involved at all.
---
As far as I know it was changed and rad-x surpress mutations, which I wanted to avoid.
---
I took a brake just like everyone else should, but not off gaming I just went and tried something new. Went to gamestop cause I support my local business and bought Brakepoint, after one hour I was already wishing I had bough the division instead. After six hours I was thanking Bethesda since they are my last point of reference on a game for not delivering a game as bleak and sad as breakpoint was. Wow the robots are better animated and voiced than most of the main characters. So it made me wanna play fallout 76 again cause at least in fallout 76 the weapons are different.
---
Very creative!
---
Were you at WS last night about 10.30p?
---
I spawned in to a nuke zone.  
---
I started the circuit with my trusty switchbalde - got as far as the 2 story cottage with the piano.
---
There, the usual number of BGO's appeared, then I was swamped by what appeared to be a respawn of that house, plus respawns of what I'd already killed along the row, plus every glowing one from the laundry building and parking lot.... IDK where they were coming from, but it made the golf clubhouse look like a cakewalk.
---
Ran and jumped on the roof of the fire station, broke out the 50 cal, and started firing. 
---
Then I see a L41 with super sledge running towards me...with 10+ BGOs in hot pursuit and a second group of BGOs behind them.  
---
The 41 tried jumping on the roof with me, but apparently didn't have marsuipal, so he started running in circles around the fire station and through laundry bldg parking lot, and back, still being chased by the giant mob.
---
 I was tossing grenades and firing the 50 cal.
---
Eventually killed them all.  (The L41 survived, BTW)
---
 I stopped counting bodies in the 40's.   
---
Dont know how many more bodies I lost due to the exploding cars and grenades, meatpiles I coudn't find, or bodies that simply poofed. 
---
Lots of mats for stable flux crafting.  5x 3\* legendaries.  Good times :)
---
Is that the kind of horde you mean?
---
Thanks!! &lt;3
---
üëçLmao
---
Diluted rad x says it suppresses mutations, but it doesn't. That's what I use now.
---
Great story, thank you.
---
I wasn't there, but that's basically what should be happening everywhere, not "sometimes, on nuked whitesprings)
---
Ill be on today.  Ill look for you.  Ill send a friend request with reddit in the message
---
Killing mole miners for their scrap and you can claim the workshop at Gorge Junkyard (place a resource extractor on the black titanium deposit) :)
---
How did you make the shelves disappear?
---
I think brahmin you own have a smaller chance of giving milk after the first milking. I believe Bethesda said 25%.
---
Superduper 3 is (up to)  60% chance of getting double.   Fires rather frequently at any type of workbench.
---
Quite nice when it fires when I craft stable  stable flux
---
I just checked, diluted rad x doesn't stack anymore like you said, idk if the 3 stack together though, I don't have a rad shield or regular rad x.
---
And that's after the option to milk reappears.
---
Yikes
---
Especially the stuff they are importing from FO4 and trying to sell for 4$
---
I just accept them, so they won't keep slowing me down, my main, level 340+ is currently sitting on 97 unused level ups, and my understanding of the Prestige perk system is that we will get to choose only One perk for each SPECIAL, there will likely not be other legendary Perks that you can swap out, but you may have the option to change one every 50 levels.
---
Oh jesus
---
That event is overly easy because most enemies target the defense things and not the player.
---
You are absolutely correct - there was some of that, too :)
---
...or do you have a full collection of magazines. Those covers are awesome.
---
Very cool. The video itself was nicely done.
---
Uranium fever event, do it, loot all, sell to vendor bot, repeat next day, 1400 caps a day.
---
Pointing out how stupid posts like this are is going nuts?
---
I don‚Äôt care if the game survives or not currently I‚Äôm having fun.
---
Posts like this are dime a dozen in literally every game forum.
---
Me an the boys can't wait to meet you and give you a big hug....
---
Psst... trust no one!!
---
Somerset Special does a bit of extra damage and comes fully modded. It's like the BOS rifle: a really decent weapon.
---
Yeah i just tried it. Had none in my Inventory, picked up one new one, then picked up 2 Old ones from the Ground that i had in my Inventory and it only turned in the New One.
---
Why was the link just removed?
---
I‚Äôm using literally every trick I know haha. It‚Äôs probably the hardest thing to build I‚Äôve ever done, minus the Brahmn dispenser maybe :)
---
It‚Äôs supported by a floating roof behind the wall and when it breaks, the bureau disappears. You can see the main idea of it in this video 
---
https://youtu.be/6oZNYnAmmKU
---
It‚Äôs looks different but the idea is the same
---
No it didnt
---
Thank you. I have it now
---
I'm on ps4 and could use the witch plans (if op doesn't get them)
---
Thanks! It was a pain to film and edit :)

Can't we just appreciate how cheap this game is.... Couple of weeks ago they were selling this game for $13.00 at my local Redbox.
---
&gt;&gt; pay for full game
---
&gt;&gt; get minimum viable product
---
&gt;&gt; ???
---
?
---
You act like there aren't hundreds of ridiculous outfit mods for the singleplayer titles.
---
I have a ssd and things load basically instantly on all the previous games, it doesn't feel smaller it is smaller
---
I bet it was! But worth it with the way it turned out.
---
I agree, seems like it should be more dynamic or organic
---
I got 6033 damage last night at Nuked Whitespring while in my Power Armor (no stealth) and using  a Junkie's Sheepsquatch Club. So, I would say one-handed can be worth doing.
---
If you have 15 points in Strength it's easy enough to swap out perk cards between Iron Fist, Gladiator, Slugger, Shotgunner, and Heavy Weapons.
---
Ah, that's a shame. Well, not really. It wasn't THAT much of a difference.
---
Still, good to know though. Thanks bud.
---
I‚Äôm at a point now where I don‚Äôt really mess with quests a whole lot. I‚Äôm mostly interested in moonshining. I brew up a bunch of alcohol and the sell it in my vending machines.
---
Diluted doesn't, normal does.
---
Haha, I'll probably be tricked a few times, I really hope I like it cause we won't be getting another Fallout for a while and I really want to love this game
---
Yeah I know. It seems diluted should, since it says it does, probably a big and one I don't mind if they don't fix lol.
---
&gt;20 Grafton monsters spawn outside Charlston Station
---
&gt;Every monster is cool if there's enough of them
---
err...
---
Big Sigh, alright gonna do it the old Way then.
---
If they do bring it back I‚Äôd like them to take out the leaderboard so it didn‚Äôt just feel like a deathmatch game mode, then I‚Äôd for sure come back to the game
---
20 bucks a week? Get real.
---
If you‚Äôre cool with paying 150 on digital assets then okay but I think that‚Äôs wrong in the head.
---
This is why I never buy weapons or trade with other players. If I buy the weapons and armor I want the game would die instantly for me.
---
Hah that'd be spectacular
---
I was about the same with FO76 and went to ESO.  It has been fun.  Still at it..still log into fo76 once in a while.
---
ESO is just like all other typical MMO's such as WOW but much prettier.   If you like mmo you will like ESO.  Whereas fo76 is not really typical mmo 
---
Sort of like comparing apples to oranges honestly
---
I don't want to be that person, but are you in someone else's camp or a workshop?
---
I agree - Giving atoms away as daily and weekly challenges is fine but I work 40 hours a week, like most people and so it‚Äôs a bit unrealistic to expect me to grind out my limited weekly gameplay time collecting photos at bridges or gather 200 wood.
---
Thank you very much
---
Same... The amount of shame is intense. Every time I see the Fallout logo I can't help but think how much of a sucker I was.
---
Thanks man
---
I just turn on Spotify
---
You'll be right mate.
---
76 was the first fallout game I have played and I enjoyed it.
---
I play both. They aren't the same. Fallout is a survival crafting shooter, ESO is a traditional mmo.
---
Same thing happens to me, when I back out and try to server hop it just locks up on the main screen and I have to close the game and restart it. On Xbox as well.
---
I always drop the frames to newbies. It helps
---
Man, I grind that ash heap too but no luck either. Best of luck and praying to the RNG gods for us all to find that thing!!
---
My first one was 4 on the PS4, but I didn't finish it, I then played New Vegas, loved it and played 4 after wards and have over 100 hours on it, I really am excited for 76
---
Fallout Radio Playlist on Spotify
---
Fair point. They should award everyone the atoms missed for bugged challenges. That lost revenue would sufficiently motivate the team to make sure they work.
---
I actively search for low level weapons. I found a lvl 20 TSE pipe pistol. And got a lvl 10 quad FFR Hunting Rifle I would never trade these. Alt leveling weapons are great to have. 
---
I also have given away a few of my other good low level weapons including an lvl 15 Instigating Pick axe with SS. If I find a player who's struggling it's nice to be able to help.
---
When is the DM AMA?
---
I really hope that Beth learned their lesson and won‚Äôt make another multiplayer game in the future, but I‚Äôm probably kidding myself. 
---
Multiplayer fallout/ES should just be a solo game, that you can bring a friend into.  Something like, anyone on your xboxlive party can join or similar.  Not a ‚Äúlet‚Äôs just but everyone in the same game so they can solo anyway, but we have to water everything down 90% so the game doesn‚Äôt buckle‚Äù
---
Oh I love the game and have multiple builds but refuse to spend real money on the stuff that should be free or earned. The fact that they read these subs and know how we feel yet continue to try and bleed us for money on behave of their failed attempts kills me. I understand nobody is making us play or buy micro transactions but it feels like legal theft. Kinda like me selling you a car that don‚Äôt run then selling you parts while you pay me to help me fix it.
---
Yea its very tedious.  Its the first thing i work on.  Someone made a great reddit post bout this you should give it a look up they explain everything you can get the odds etc.  
---
I am on ps4 and have extra science scribe, field scribe, and engineer oh and clean army uniform.  If you have any extra other stuff id happily do a trade.
---
I enjoy eso a lot! It's pretty cheap these days so you have nothing to lose by grabbing it. Although I will say the microtransactions in eso make the atom shop look perfect.
---
yeap thats what I'm thinking. you are under level 50 for what, 30 hours, and rest is above 50 and thus should receive more content.
---
I‚Äôd take it for 1500
---
FO76 went the same way as every other shitty service game. I stopped playing months ago because of it. I've hoped that bethesda could do something else than charging DLC-Price for shitty skins that took 10 minutes to slap together, but apparently not.
---
I obviously can't say whether it's better or worse than the others, but as a open world game it is a good game to play.
---
I only bought stuff on the atom shop when the sales or ‚Äúleaving soon‚Äù tabs are up. And if I don‚Äôt see anything that I‚Äôve wanted I‚Äôll pass until I see it on sale. The only time I‚Äôve spent full price was on a power armor skin. Other than that I really don‚Äôt do atom shop.
---
If ur on PC and I stumble across your camp I'll RP an alcoholic and fabricate a nice story around that.
---
That's what I do after I'm done playing. Kinda like a diary of the wasteland.
---
I went to one of the workshops that has it as a resource. Just had to mine black titanium ore for an hour
---
Telling a Brotherhood soldier to keep fighting... 
---
You know that they also fight with Raiders (lore wise), right? :p
---
Great story man. And you are so right about the community. I met a dude (who became a good friend) and the first day we were hanging out he gave me a BoS jumpsuit. I just hooked up one of our friends with a fixer plan i managed to aquire so we would all have one. This kind of stuff happens almost daily and far outweighs the nonsense. Stay Awesome bro and good luck.
---
Yeah but I have fun, and isn't that what matters?
---
Also radiation decays over time, disperses with the wind and sinks into soil and vegetation. Radiation is only really dangerous in a fallout radius around an impact, and the subsequent wind direction it gets carried away in. Just look at Fukushima and see how you can remove top soil and decontaminate large sections of land through terraforming.
---
It seems to be related to your luck stat. My mule character has one luck and hardly ever milks successfully, while my unyielding characters both have 27 luck and it‚Äôs rare when I don‚Äôt get milk.
---
It could be CHA, but that would make me feel uncomfortable. I want to drink milk, not.....something else.
---
Well I know I have multiples for at least some of them so I can at least sell you some of them if not all of them
---
Idk man, I haven't spent any money on atoms and I currently have 1,200. I do wish the prices would drop down, but you can easily get free atoms.
---
I see damn. The staircase is a tricky stuff. It has to be maintained by the top of it, only with floors then connected way up to a ladder stairs.   
---
And that last ladder should at least be connected to a foundation and/or to some other stairs that are connected to foundations.  
---
But I totally understand the mess it can be. I don't get why Bethesda put so much restrictions :  
---
Avoid flloating camps ? failed , people do it  
---
Avoid glitching camps , failed even more.  
---
Avoid nice built and imaginative structures ? Checked.
---
Tamed pets can be killed by AI mobs. It can't be killed by players unless you're engaged in pvp with them. However, creatures that aren't immune to radiation can presumably be killed by radiation emitting effects from some granades, and radiation emitters teammates may place/activate in your camp. Someone needs to test if they can be killed by flamethrower traps because they can certainly damage camp objects. I've had a nuke dropped on my camp, and while everything was destroyed, my pet survived. But I wasn't present during the blast and idk if the game would handle it differently if I were.
---
They take up seemingly no budget. That 10% thing was patched a while back.
---
Overall not worth it unless you come across a really rare creature.
---
follow the overseers quest.  It will keep you in more or less level appropriate areas.
---
Stay in the Forest (west side, green area) until about L17, then go N to the big alligator (toxic valley).
---
At 25 or so, head to all the way S to the ash heap.
---
At 35ish, start on the middle strip of the map (savage divide)
---
at 45, go anywhere you want.
---
Along the way, walk, dont fast travel.  you will discover more places and stuff.  Loot and scrap anything you aren't using.  Scapping weapons teaches you weapon mods.
---
Do events.  Do quests.  Make sure you fully explore camp mcclintock, riverside manor, and the mining HQ (near the things on the map that look like war of the worlds critters).
---
I too agree that it is Miller Time! ...oh and the thing about FO4 too.
---
Dumb question.
---
Did you use the terminal next to the analyzer? I haven't done this daily in awhile but I think you may have to.
---
Ah yes, the good ol liquid above a diffused solid is a great source of income
---
You spent $100? I spent $175 for the power armour edition
---
This is what I feel burned by the most. The Raider Bundle that includes assets from Nuka World is $2 less than what Nuka World cost. The vault stairs cost just as much as the entire Vault Tec DLC! I mean seriously that‚Äôs an insane price hike for one item! It just sucks to see my favorite series go in this direction and it‚Äôs very apparent they aren‚Äôt going to change this. The only way I can defend the prices is that eventually mods will come and free is always better. After mods they really are going to rely on whales for the longevity of the game.
---
It‚Äôs not Emerson breaking if you‚Äôre an exhibitionist... it‚Äôs liberating!
---
The random spawn is probably spawning at the other spawn point that's right by there. The other random spawn is up on the cliff next to the bus. I'm not sure if the trick or treaters can spawn up there but when I was trying to find them I had the spawn happen on top of the cliff several times
---
No, it's still random encounter place, but more rare, at least from my observations.
---
No, they don't though. They have the prices set that high because there are idiots who are buying them. They're making a profit. That's it.
---
I did a rat horde event in the Ash Heap earlier this week and it was literally swarming with 'em.  It was one of the most challenging things I've done in the game lately.  I had to constantly keep moving and jumping; because I have marsupial the jumps drained my AP, meaning I couldn't use vats as often.  I've done a lot of horde events, but this one was simply amazing due to the sheer number of rats involved.
---
Make and sell 5.56 ammo. That shit doesn't last 5 minutes in my vending machine.
---
Hahaha .. im with you,, but we ain't got a hope with bad Karma surrounding this game..
---
I only got the Tricentennial edition but you must be feeling the burn even worse then. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about. Many of us spend good money for a bad product from the start. I love seeing the game come this far but it should have started off better before it being released.
---
I mean hey if you're going for a camp build with a fridge then it's great, but useless for me.
---
I personally love ESO but it's nothing like the mainline games. If 76 is a Fallout game built for multiplayer, ESO is very much an MMO built for Elder Scrolls. That said, it does still keep the armosphere of an ES game in most zones and even the most random quest has a decent story to it.
---
Content-wise, there's something for almost everyone. Like trading things? The economy is entirely player driven. RP? There are guilds for that. Including some for oddly specific character ideas. Just like building/decorating? I've seen some impressive stuff done with the housing system and transmog/oufits were added a few xpacs ago.
---
Apologies if I'm mildly rant-y. I just really like the game and am too tired to actually sort my thoughts. There's no sub required so you're only out the $20 or if you try it and don't like it. Not even that if you're on Xbox since it's on Gamepass. If you've any questions, I can gladly answer them when I'm more coherent.
---
I Didn‚Äôt even get my damn canvas bag
---
While I do buy the outfit bundles, I earn most of my atoms through play. I get it. 
---
But at the same time we need to be at least somewhat grateful that these whales are willing to support the further development of the game. 
---
Plus, believe it or not, in the free world we are allowed to spend our money the way we want to. If someone wants to drop hundreds of real dollars on a game than that is their money to spend however they want.
---
That's too much of my salary.
---
Man that sounds great, but I‚Äôm on Xbox unfortunately.
---
The only quest worth waiting for is cold case. But even then the reward isn't that awesome.
---
You're better off doing the quests on the way up.
---
I miss survival mode. I'm so bummed it's gone. Having all the pvpers condensed into the same corner of the game was great. I didn't have to sit in a workshop hoping and praying for an attack or sift through a bunch of peaceful players to find a fighter. I really enjoyed the tense and actually dangerous wasteland. And PvP whenever wherever on the map.
---
Open world PvP fit in very well into the fallout universe, for once I understood why all the npcs from previous fallouts were so sketched out by other humans. So paranoid and distrustful. H/h and NW just doesn't give that same atmosphere to the wasteland.
---
Sorry, I've got no solutions to suggest haha.
---
¬£174.99 here...much more then you lot got it for so it was a kick in my balls
---
Radroachs. Let us embrace the bug filled mess this game is by fighting hordes of them!
---
Preeeetty sure this ain't allowed
---
No, they need to release Private Servers and mod tools already. I'd rather have high quality FREE content like Fallout 4 over lazy, thrown-together, overpriced pixels. I haven't played in a few months. I'm waiting on Wastelanders. If it flops, I'll be off again waiting on the next update unless F4:NV, Capital Wasteland Project, Horror Overhaul, etc... release. Then it's bye-bye 76, hello real content for free. ‚ô°
---
Once you hit lvl 50 when you lvl up you get a choice to pick a new card or redistribute a point from 1 special to another
---
After you hit level 50 you can.
---
This needs to be fixed, awesome catch. Hopefully they take notice or planned to change it with the upcoming patch.
---
This game gets too much appreciation already.
---
Buy it. Much less hassle.
---
Once you hit level 50, every level up after that you have the option to move a point from one perk to the other.
---
It happens on PS4 too so it's not system related.
---
I‚Äôm 249 now and still messing with my perks and build.  But I will admit starting an alt character seems more appealing than ever.  Every once in a while PvP can be fun and challenging but most events are not difficult at all including Encryptid and SBQ.
---
Your stats cap at lvl 50 however each level after that you can use your point to swap ability points with one another or get new perk cards.
---
since when was double ammo a legacy? I am pretty sure you can still find it on weapons. it is just a lot rarer
---
Better is relative - theres always something "better" and you will find it.
---
If what you have is working for you.... it likely took you a long time to get to 50, why toss it to start over?
---
  My primary weapon is a 1\* vampire switchblade I picked up about L65.    Found, bough, and tossed lots of stuff between L50 and now.  Kept more than a few.  But for general use, I keep going back to the switchblade.
---
I made L143 last night, with that same switchblade in hand.
---
It's a real kick in the head.
---
I meant pounds I‚Äôm British
---
The last two Encryptid events I‚Äôve done we sleepwalked through it as a group in like 5 minutes.  And these weren‚Äôt all high level players.
---
Damn, that‚Äôs a real kick in the proverbial dick. They should let you pick what ever you want from the Atom shop then.
---
Make sure to equip fortune finder and cap collector.  This allows you to hear when a cap stash is nearby and FF increases the yield of the cap stash.  
---
Super Mutants are an easy kill as well and usually have a few caps.  You can clear Summersville or Grafton Steel pretty quickly.
---
I have an pathetic lvl 35 aae gatling plasma weighs 18 pound and cant barely do enough damage to solo a scorchbeast. Max heavy weapon perks.
---
I can"t even sell it because it's a curse not a blessing.
---
Perfect way to describe FO76, thank you
---
Yep. Getting bored of the game again I took like a 3 month break but I‚Äôm hoping wastelanders won‚Äôt be a huge disappointment
---
Iww Do you need the microtransactions to do well in the game?
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
unforunatly my few groups are on xb1
---
Its the drinking challenges that kill me...grinding out a bunch of booze is so tedious.
---
No not really, I was simply entertaining him
---
I was thinking the same thing.  The only effect I was aware of being removed from energy weapons was explosive.
---
Awesome thanks I will check it out!
---
&lt;gets plan organically the next day&gt;
---
I‚Äôm not saying that satirically, it‚Äôs happened to me time and again when I‚Äôve been grinding for something and then spent a fortune to trade for it.
---
Well I‚Äôm not on PC and we don‚Äôt have that issue üòÜ
---
&gt; the game play needs major work yet they continue to hurry up and cram stuff in the atom shop
---
THE SAME PEOPLE ARE NOT IN CHARGE OF BOTH.
---
I seem to get a black screen at least once a week. It just happened as I was participating in Free Range, luckily I was able to get close enough to the Sheepsquatch to finish it with the folks I was playing with, loot the corpse and restart. I am playing on a PS4, the screen blanking is so random and annoying.
---
Please, I don‚Äôt like having all my rare outfits in my stash, let me flex
---
Just 1*? Worth 2k caps max.
---
I bought atoms once for me birthday. But I got +50% and spent it on a couple of items on discount... now I‚Äôve been grinding like hell to get to 1400 atoms for my third PA skin, but almost there. Tbh I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre going to make the atom shop cheaper, I mean it‚Äôs not like they need space to store the items that are going out of season. So now and then there going to do a discount for items ‚Äúleaving soon‚Äù or ‚Äúlimited time only‚Äù for people to panic and buy them. (like they haven‚Äôt brought almost every item back, some even cheaper then before). But yeah I‚Äôd buy atoms more often if stuff was cheaper in the atomic shop.
---
Buy bethesda bucks to make your experience more fun!
---
It's not a legacy, but it's a good price already.  
---
Energy-explosive weapons has been removed.  
---
Tesla TS drop quite often , you can try selling it for a fair 1500 caps if it has that star alone.
---
/u/ladydevann
---
I can‚Äôt wait for fallout 4 new Vegas I heard it‚Äôs coming to console and I‚Äôm excited
---
I only meant trespassing in the sense that an outsider should be considered hostile if they come into an owned workshop. Like ownership is temporary but while you are there you should consider other players hostile unless for some reason you want to trust them. I think the game should mark players as hostile if they are in an owned workshop. Less mixed signals, less room for trickery.
---
Damn, I only paid ‚Ç¨15 for Fallout 76 just a few months after release
---
Nothing dumb about it. I do this when I'm maxed out on scrip for the day and nearly maxed out on weight on my character and my stash, so I need to get rid of them somehow. It's either this or drop them off in an ice machine at a train station.
---
I will buy any legendary if the price is right whether I need it or not.  More weapons than armor because 40 scrips for a 3 star is easy to cash in to increase your scrip balance. 
---
On the other hand, I will not be paying 10k for your tenderizer or 2 star legendary.   I have almost a dozen top notch weapons so at this point it‚Äôs about looking for specific items.  Ive added 3 nice railway rifles and modified them to auto along with a couple of Fletchettes harpoon weapon.  Already have a number of sweet handmade rifles.  Now looking for a few other items I don‚Äôt have.  Just need to shop around a little more.
---
Speaking of that, I did see someone on EBay selling a fixer combat rifle for 225 dollars.  WTF
---
Yeah I've tried it before, during and after analysis. Only options are Upload Results/Data (which always says it's already been done), the personal log and info on cryptids.
---
Don‚Äôt buy it
---
Yeah you can get em easy but for someone who doesn‚Äôt have a lot of time to grind for atoms it‚Äôs way harder
---
I hear you brother. We were just laughing about it last night. As it turns out, I've just found two new locked Explosives Crates while not looking for them... You watch this thread; I will update it when I find the plan myself, now that I'll only be looking out for it in a sane way üòÇ
---
The right pipe pistol or pipe rifle can fetch a lot of caps.
---
the few groups im involved with are all xb1 users.  one of the guys put his GT in somewhere in the thread as well, mine is sgtmajfoiey.
---
were still working our kinks out on meltdowns expert for this week but we beat standard and novice pretty easily
---
I know it sucks... But you can't blame the game for you not having free time.
---
Same here I got school and when I have time o got homework
---
Be 100x better than Wastelanders. X3
---
Yeah I know
---
No they're definitely not a necessity but theres microtransactions for a lot more stuff including health potions soul gems experience boosters etc. I couldn't imagine the backlash if they did that stuff in 76.
---
You bet
---
Play it on PS4, I hear that the PC mob are very cranky buggers.
---
I sincerely hope you get more free time though. It really sucks to have a lot of responsibilities, and not get to just chill and do whatever you want.
---
I've been trying to explain this exact point to people forever. They won't listen though, so be ready for "just don't buy them" or "no one is making you lay for them" excuses. Any time you call Bethesda out on their bullshit, the apologists come out in droves.
---
I have to repair my max condition weapons before I can mod them half of the time.
---
Yeah ...I mean on the weekends sometimes but I let my brother use the console a lot
---
I scripped a 3 star instigating assault rifle the other day.  Not my weapon of choice.  Handmades are much better in just about every respect
---
Idk, I played Fallout 4 on PS4 and I died many times to something that took me one try to kill on PC, so I'd rather PC
---
Are you waiting for everything to load in? I server hopped for this the other day and was able to get the witch costume. I found that I had to wait a minute or two before the random encounter would load.
---
They changed double to quad and deleted the ammo capicity buffs for heavy guns with large capacitys like the Gatling gun and LMG as far as I could find online. Saw somebody reposting a patch note from a loooong time ago.
---
I'm also experiencing this on pc, if you figure out how to fix it please tell me
---
Their official stance is just that they don't support mods in 76:
---
&gt; "Please note that Fallout 76 does not support the use of any mods, add-ons, or other third-party programs. Please be aware that the use of such applications may result in Fallout 76 not functioning properly."
---
[Source](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44429/kw/mods)
---
As long as you use the Perk Loadout Manager and Save Everything for example, just UI improvements, you're probably never going to get banned. If you use a script to dupe however, or something similar, there definitely is a chance of you getting banned.
---
Thanks for the heads up! It does seem to be gone
---
Damn dude, you got some good buddies! I do hope they someday make the plan a tiny bit easier to find though. (For my sake üòÇ)
---
Yep an easy way to get more is ask the Grafton Mayor
---
Yeah my group has not been able to complete expert on melt down or washout. But we have been able to beat dead in the water on expert with no problems. It would be sweet to see more vault raiders out there
---
Also, would a stimpack diffuser work?
---
That‚Äôs funny you say that I found so many in white springs in a nuke zone last night pretty much every bloated ghoul or w/e dropped some
---
I think he's still mad at me for never burying the soldier's corpse
---
Gotta love double dipping perks
---
Lucky!! I haven't had any luck, they only ever dropped glowing blood/meat!
---
Yeah then they broke it. Bummer
---
Maybe that‚Äôs it. I waited about 45 seconds and then walked off. I will try waiting longer
---
I usually carry max weight and sell every thing at train stations. You can easily make 5k a session
---
I have read all the patch notes, and have never seen that in the notes
---
System?
---
Fallout 4 wasn't a live-service shared world game. 76's equivalents to content like Automatron, stuff like Wild Appalachia and the Nuclear Winter game mode, is added to 76 for free. Overpriced skins is one of the least obnoxious ways they could monetize a game like this and still put out free content expansions.
---
I'll take 18$ kitschy Power Armor skins (that I simply won't buy) over dividing up the player-base with paid content expansions, and if it took a monthly subscription I simply wouldn't be playing this game at all.
---
pc
---
Thats true, I dont need furniture on my roofs. Hopefully they address it soon!
---
yeah i have had no luck aswell.     have gotten maybe 4 to 5 total this last week.    it could be i have not spent a ton of time as of late in their but i feel its been way less then usual.
---
Of course it would be awesome. Literally nobody would think it is a bad idea. I don't see it happening though.
---
Look at how much of the camp budget a single weapon takes up. That's one item. 
---
If the mannequins you want are like the ones in FO4 than it can have up to 1 under armor, 2 arm armor, 2 leg armor, 1 chest, 1 helmet, 1 mask/eye glasses, 1 necklace, and 1 ring. That's 10 items. 
---
You wouldn't even be able to do the basic under armor and 5 pieces of regular limb armor without it crushing your budget.
---
I‚Äôm a welder I don‚Äôt swim in cash and have no debt. I could have saved the money for something but instead I blew it like a night at the casino. It was three games on different periods of time. It‚Äôs an addiction that I squashed. But most of the time it ended after three or four months. Which still comes out to three grand. I could have spent that a million ways. I also find it pathetic people are bashing twenty a week. I spent more then that as a teen who worked nearly full time. I remember spending tons on magic cards as a teen. I still paid for insurance and a car loan. I don‚Äôt have rich parents in fact I grew up lower middle class. So the people putting me out as some disconnected rich guy is nuts. I‚Äôve never been handed anything and I‚Äôve worked in lumber yards for half my life. I don‚Äôt buy new cars I have a loan on a house and I enjoy mowing my lawn every week. Hell I shop at Aldi‚Äôs and have the lowest phone plan with a 2 gig limit. I‚Äôm typing this out on a refurbished iPhone 7. I‚Äôm plenty frugal. But I enjoy gaming and i focus any spending in that direction.

I know tons of people on steam buying a game or three a month and some even buying 4 packs on steam for friends. Not to mention sprees on sales and collectors editions of games. Nobody‚Äôs rich in this group most of them are single though so maybe that plays a part. My point on that is you spend hundreds on that crap but what‚Äôs the difference in playing one over and over and spending the same. Either way in a few years you‚Äôll have a stack of games that collect dust. It‚Äôs not like I was gonna spend it on a dirtbike or fix up a muscle car. 
---
 I agree with the pricing being steep. I think fallout 4‚Äôs 5 dollar building packs are leaps closer to a better pricing. But spending 20 a week on this is cheaper than your bar tab.
---
Why would you say something so bold, yet, so controversial?
---
I guess Fo76 community should do like the Dark Souls community, i mean by that find a nice spot where everyone agree to host fight clubs, like an arena or something !  
---
And this kind of community organized pvp can motivate even the most opposed to pvp players to try it out ! I know that because i was very against pvp in Dark Souls before stumbling into Sulyvhan in DS3 and i spent some long night here afterward !
---
My handmade is never loaded when I loggin.
---
Lots of asbestos there
---
People didn‚Äôt seem to mind it in NV, also collecting them to put in your camp display is enough of a motivation to keep me exploring Appalachia.
---
Lol probably 85% of players can't shoot for shit without vats.
---
That's smart, think I'll have to start doing that.
---
That was my experience anyways. Worth testing out.
---
I love them both and at times I wish each had parts of the other built in.
---
I haven't played since maybe Feb (I logged in to play one round of nuclear winter at some point) and I just get the feeling this game has been dead almost all of 2019. Out of curiosity what keeps you guys playing at this point when there are other games to be played? I have to admit, I love the Fallout universe and really wanted to keep playing this game, but after a while it felt like a job and not a game.
---
that may be but there is literally no double ammo effect, all I have seen is quad
---
The sheepsquatch questline is bigger than automation and it was free...at least the quest part.  I mean, no robot companions but we will likely get that at some point.  We are also getting a big DLC in about a month... also free. These are just different ways to monetize new content. Personally I prefer not having actual quests, etc locked behind a paywall and don‚Äôt care about playing dressup. 
---
Can people stop saying $10? You pay money because you don‚Äôt want to grind for atoms. That‚Äôs fine. But you are paying for speed because you don‚Äôt want to complete challenges. We can discuss whether 1300 atoms is too much for power armor skin (I think it is) but converting to dollars isn‚Äôt productive IMO. I bought the collectron for example. It was 500 atoms. I did not spend $5. It did not cost me $5. I earned those atoms in game. I still have ~2000 sitting in my account... all earned in game.
---
No matter what this is a multiplayer game and they want to make a profit along with paying the bills and keeping the game going. Just because either A. you are a penny pincher or B are  broke jealous joke has little impact and your whine is just rehashed garbage and you should feel bad for your life choices to date.
---
Same exact  thing happened to me on two characters yesterday.  I figured it was a bug and will get corrected next release.  Thanks O.P. for posting this !
---
School?
---
Yup
---
I switched to a .50 cal receiver on my BOS Rifle, and it‚Äôs even better (I have Rifleman perks).
---
Escape Artist makes VATS difficult. Could have been crouch bugged. It Stealth Boy bugged (where they're showing as visible when they shouldn't). Health Regen, spamming Stims in PA is easier than without PA. Exploding Weapon.
---
If you are level 50 and worried about fireflies and level 5 rad toads, I think this game may not be for your fragile mind.
---
How many credits toward the purchase of Automatron did you get for playing Fallout 4?
---
I really feel like the camp displays were cheaply done, and since the camps don't have any real permanance... it's almost like just playing an over inflated Facebook game.
---
Can we appreciate how much appreciation this game gets?
---
This is truth. This whole thread is fallacy.
---
yeah but the bobbleheads alone remove 20 from the stash limit for absolutely nothing. With a permanent effect it would be worth the 20 and it would be a real joy to collect them.
---
No I don‚Äôt justify thousands your making that up. That was about calling this game a whale trap. I also don‚Äôt care how my character looks but I like building. This game is very limited with a huge amount of uniques locked behind a paywall. Something I am not fond of and have quit subsequently over. Shelling out what I have has accumulated to the point I find it offensive. Also bundling it with stuff I am lot interested in so they can get an extra ten out of me is sinister. But I don‚Äôt see a problem with people finding twenty a week fine. It‚Äôs a petty amount of cash that many spend on a Friday night.
---
Havnt spent a single atom. I took a big break from playing and in back now, and I've only clicked on the few free things I've seen in the atom shop. 
---
 
---
Maybe I'll get a few things when the ~3300 atoms I've collected for free but you wont catch me spending money on that.
---
That's an outright win, my man!
---
Give me a Deathclaw horde you cowards! And a Mirelurk Queen horde!
---
Fair enough
---
jfc this game has been out for almost a year and that's seriously not fixed yet?
---
name checks out
---
This ^
---
Also, by removing the danger of PVP from the game you take away some of the fear factor that makes even mundane tasks more exciting. One of my favorite aspects of survival games is not knowing of the person you are approaching is friend or foe (like in a real post apocalyptic scenario.) Other than vending and grouping the current state of the game might as well be single player.
---
Ah snap...
---
Anyone else want to sit in the middle of a huge ass mountain of these mines? Just for fun.
---
You dont have to buy anything though.
---
I know but I want to
---
it's for the collectors only now; go to market subreddit and try to price check or sell one.
---
I kind of wonder if they deliberately avoid spiders in Fallout because they are somewhat iconic to Skyrim.  Surely, with the menagerie of insect-based enemies that already exist, spiders *had* to come up at some point.
---
This isn't just a Bethesda thing either.  The original Fallouts didn't have spiders.  So, maybe it's also a running gag or an in-joke.
---
No, double doesn't drop anymore. Unless they added it back recently in secret. Double weapons are collector items from beta and first month.
---
Spotted a guy's camp who said he was the Doctor of the Wasteland. Wish I could've met him.
---
Ever try westek?
---
I thought the exact opposite when I saw that video. A horde of identical enemies is just too boring and videogame-ish. I like variety.
---
Also: radrats are my least favourite enemy in 76. Those fuckers should not tank several point-blank rifle or shotgun blasts to the face.
---
When it comes to hordes of enemies, I like the idea, but while it would be fun for some builds, for others it would be really tedious.
---
I Was disappointed that there is a trophy after collecting 10 bobbleheads, but not a trophy for collecting the full set of 20. (unlike previous iterations, where there was a trophy for finding all of them.)
---
Truth: there is nothing wrong happening when you meet abundance of opponent in the wasteland and have to select another path literally because there is no chance to survive that. What you specified is desired and needed, not problematic.
---
It would still be in your stash though just like the weapon stands and bobble heads
---
Behehehorde plz
---
Thats what i did. Played to level 60 or so when I first got it. Then I started back for a few weeks. Played through meat week, and now I'm waiting for wastelanders.
---
Yeah i prolly read about the one u mentioned. Im just trying to get the PA Paint Plans. But i wouldnt mind getting another BOS Jumpsuit :)
---
Same. I have plenty of atom shop stuff at my camp, but most was bought on sale. There's nothing I want in this week's sale, and I'm okay with that. I don't want to pay the full price for most of the items they have, anyway. Except for a few pieces  like the fridge and scrap bot- just because of the man-baby rage they caused. I buy $10 a month of Atoms and the rest are freebies.
---
On a side note, I notice that at least 75 percent of the camps I go to have the scrap bot, which has never been on sale. For all the rage tears that caused, I'd be sure that no one would have bought it. Looks like either the Outrage Bois are a small part of the community, or they are really hypocritical.
---
this has been covered more than once, they are not removing scorched or scorchbeasts from the game
---
Yes, but Free Range is part of the Public Event system now, which means that it shows up *significantly* less often and doesn't trigger just by virtue of passing through the area anymore.
---
west tek and sbq are the ones i hear now
---
I used to notice inconsistencies as well when using berry tats. I think it‚Äôs connected to your PER level vs. your opponent‚Äôs AGL and sneak bonuses.
---
So your saying that Bethesda don‚Äôt put stuff in the Atom shop?
---
It's not the resources (minimal) or the actual difficulty (rather low) that keep me from the raids. It's the lag and disconnects. Server hopping for a decent server, then hoping the server stays good and your client doesn't crash, that's been my raiding experience. It's not fun.
---
jfc this has been a glitch since launch, how is it not fixed?
---
If they're all the same, then it's boring. Being able to ignore them doesn't fix that. Go look at that video. Every one is identical.
---
I as well hope it‚Äôs a jump start to game play.
---
Did I say remove?
---
Ahhaha their probably hypocritical. As much as I like playing the game, everything with that game is back asswords. I feel like people are getting driven away from the game just to get sucked back into it.
---
I'll join! I'm not great at it though, my rank is 50 something lol. (I die...a lot. But I try!)
---
Or just don't buy cosmetics
---
Lol much better than my 16 i think msg me or u give ur psn so i msg u
---
Ok sent it
---
PSN is "MuldersSmoulder"
---
how many nukes is left and right?  the queen fight isn't the best way to get the mats from ads, but Whitesprings should have had plenty, also Charleston and The Burrows are good for those.  basically anywhere with a ton of ghouls is the best way to get mats from ads, and Whitesprings is one of the best, not sure why you are having trouble there...  are you only focusing on the clubhouse?  are you not getting hits on things before others kill them?
---
You know if you don't need a bunch of legendarys my services might be helpful I'll take them all of you
---
Im in the same boat, I'm just getting back after my break and i would suggest finishing before wastelanders comes. I'm not sure if current content will be replaced but some locations around the map will change and I came back now to make sure I explore most of it before the changes.
---
How is the end game content in Elder Scrolls compared to FO76?  can you solo the game or are you forced into groups?
---
I'd agree. Except where shit is bugged. I've got stuff that will not complete because of known bugs. I didn't get credit for discovering some places till months after when they fixed stuff in an update. So I waited like 2 or more months for some atoms.
---
I'm not joining up with the Wasteland Nazis. 
---
They wouldn't have characters cannonically joining any faction anyway- much less the villains.
---
1: about 2 nukes dropped everyday, one for SBQ, one for Whitesprings.
---
2: Clubhouse?? 
---
3: Definitely getting clear hits!
---
West Tek, horde events, AWOL Armaments, Uranium Fever (when you can get a tag in), and Leader of the Pack if you're just looking for a little extra scrip are other ways to find legendaries. SBQ fights generally spawn at least a couple (in addition to the queen herself, and the event reward).
---
No I'm saying the people responsible for gameplay adjustments and bug fixes arent the same people creating and releasing atom shop content.
---
They aren't going to lay off part of the studio just because another part sucks at their jobs.
---
Umm there is no 1 named like that
---
A player who thinks that their good gear alone will save them gets dropped so fast. No offense but you say you don't like PVP, never will, I doubt you have enough experience with it to know what you are talking about.
---
Knowing the games pvp mechanics will take you further than gear. And a well geared player can get taken down with good strategy. Not to mention managing the rest of the game while you do it. Saying theres no skill and it's just gear is seriously underestimating your opponent. And honestly kind of rude. I've spent a lot of time practicing and honing my skill that you claim is non existent.
---
Play the game how you want, if it just more fun to play it peacefully then do so. There's no need to look down at people who play aggressively to make the game more fun for you.
---
Yeah I got that too, unfortunately.
---
Sorry frogot the dash, "Mulders-Smoulder", in some usernames I have the dash, some without. I tend to forget üòÖ
---
out of the three components i find high rad fluid is the least common, from my experience
---
No one knows for sure until the DLC drops exactly how it will be setup but I don‚Äôt think the original content will be completely replaced. 
---
Probably best to come back a bit earlier to refresh yourself and maybe level up a bit before it does drop. 
---
That said, the bugs and lack of server stability are still an issue here and I feel that the new content in Nov. will come with a whole new set of bugs.
---
Yea the way magazines work in this version was beyond disappointing.  As soon as I saw they were temporary buffs, I stopped caring if they were in game.
---
The paint plans are difficult to get.  Still trying.  I saw someone with some pa paint looks great.  Cant wait to get that loot.
---
I used to have no problem getting them, now none of the enemies spawn it on their corpses. :(
---
Heya Fackie. I do indeed have a user here, just don't use it much. I cannot express how happy I am for knowing you have that plan, finally! Not because I was sick of your quest process, the "Quest for the Holy Plan", but because nobody deserve to have a plan more than you, I am sure. And also because of the person you seem to be. It did cost me a lot more than 30k - 4\* Assassin Sentinel and 1\* Chameleon Sentinel - that were just sitting on my PvP guy who is now a regular PvE Commando (I really, really suck at PvP). So that was trading stuff well spent.
---
I also cannot explain how your kind words were received by yours truly here. I am not fluent enough in English to explain it, so I won't even try, just hope you know. Now let's keep them plasma grenades flowing and blasting accross Apalachia! 
---
Cheers,

I gotta assume your young and living at home yet. My first job was 8.95 an hour at a grocery store. I spent it on a car,insurance and gas money. I spent the rest on shitty things like tobacco,pot and booze. I‚Äôd argue that was insane but seemed to pretty much be the norm at my public school. In my twenties I worked for 15 an hour and spent Friday nights at a bar with my friends. Usually spending 40 for a burger some beer and tips. I don‚Äôt do any of those things anymore. 
---
If your a perfectly frugal person that treats yourself in no way. Buys only second hand items and does every d.i.y possible then hats off to you. Otherwise yeah twenty a week is barely worse then someone paying an extra 2k for better car options. I‚Äôm sorry I enjoy things sometimes.
---
Any of them?  Bodies are piling up!
---
Okay thanks man
---
I‚Äôll never understand why players spend money on micro transactions on full priced game. I don‚Äôt care how much it is. That‚Äôs just telling companies that it‚Äôs okay to take things away from the core game and add them behind a paywall
---
The people making skins aren‚Äôt the same people that write the code 
---
It‚Äôs not like they can‚Äôt be working on both
---
I wonder if they just let the marine helmet go as a sort of viral experiment, just to see how many spread across the community. They could have cleared it from inventories and stashes with the dupe purge, but they didn‚Äôt.
---
Acquiring one is as easy as visiting a few vending machines or asking a long time player to make one for you.
---
For players with high sneak ability, you have to get close and hit them with a few rounds in free aim before you can lock on. If your PER is low, you might not be able to get a lock at all.
---
Yeah the prices are pretty wack. I'm all for supporting the game further but for how high the prices are none of the stuff really interests me.
---
High radiation fluids drop the least for me when I'm hunting for the holy trinity of stable flux prep. But keep an eye out in people's vending machines. I've picked up quite a few from other folks selling their overages.
---
I have pvp'd more times and games than I can count.  I have plenty of experience I just choose not to partake in it anymore.  PVP does nothing for me.
---
 You'll never convince me that this game is not heavily reliable on gear during PVP.
---
Take two people of the same level and same stats. One with a good legendary weapon with sentinal/assasin gear and the othe has non legendary gear.
---
99 % of the time the geared player will win.
---
 Legendaries and PVP have no place being in the same game mode together.
---
That's why PC players are so cranky, so many bugs ect.
---
Play it on PS4.
---
I have the Elder Paint on my T60 PA, let someone else put it on for me. I was too lazy to get it myself back then but the Thing is as soon as i put on a different one it will dissapear, and i want something else now on my PA. Might aswell just make a new PA but thats additional Weight in the already limited Chest :D
---
I've only seen glowing masses in people's vendors, but hopefully I'll find some!!
---
I hear he's going to call you out next Grafton Day on Twitter.
---
was just gonna say, if i have crap legendaries and out of scrip limit i dump for caps
---
Robco has a good Legendary chance also.
---
Eso is great. It's not like Skyrim though, totally different controls and combat. I really liked the story and quests and there are soooooo many you will never do it all. End game has a lot more content too, including some really tough dungeons and challenges.
---
&gt;‚Äúthe scorched are no more!
---
I was talking about this with my group a few nights ago. Id just run around with the bear costume on playing bear noises through my mic or something stupid like that.
---
Usually find a few if you nuke the burrows
---
2000+ hours here, I‚Äôd say it worth it :)
---
But in the end they work for the same company meaning someone‚Äôs in charge of both. Having their hand out yet ignoring their consumers. Head dick in charge says ‚Äú we need to hold off on the Atom shop content for a while. Let‚Äôs concentrate our efforts more on bugs and adjustments.‚Äù It‚Äôs writing program bud, if you can write it for the atom shop, you can cross train to fix bugs. I write programs myself, it can be done.
---
i would assume its just bad rng, ive always found it to be the hardest to get, but thats also just probably bad rng for me, but i have a ton of glowing mass which is sadly 2lb each, where as the other two are both below 1lb
---
Damn, I don't think I could ever do that haha, unless I meet a group I have a lot of fun with
---
Along with the other suggestions try the Burrows
---
Honestly haven't got glowing masses either! Just glowing meat/blood!
---
Place down a rug, place the item warping space-time to live the ceiling life on the rug. Pick up rug and the item should move with it, place rug and you should be good. You have now bypassed camp logic.
---
I used this to decorate my domes and my camper. Looks really good and lived-in.
---
[](/ajhappy)
---
FO76 is comparably empty.
---
There are parts of the map where you can walk for minutes without encountering anything.  It's probably the intended design, but boy, it sure does fall flat on its face, IMO.
---
There are sooo many great ppl playing! I have a small group chat that plays everyday and there is a discord called ClubFallout that is very active and full of nice ppl :)
---
Depends on your style. Most PvE content is either 4- or 12-man but a properly done build can solo most small group content. PvP can be anywhere from taking resources and scouting alone to large scale warfare or small-group arena games.
---
I think some people around here take those frustrated rage quit posts as gospel and validation that PVP is stacked against them for whatever reason. When really it's just venting.
---
That sounds nice, when I get it I'll check it out
---
This bug has been around since BETA. And they expect to fix it in 2021. Nice
---
Are the classes balanced?
---
I've been playing melee only. Its pretty fun but imagine being in area chat and having someone taunt you to come inside a building playing like JASON music.
---
Np. If you end up playing on PC-NA, I've been looking for a reason to get back into it.
---
What price do you sell it for?
---
Yeah fairly well, our guild had all the currently available at the time classes and no one really felt weaker. The harder content really needs a tank, 2 dps and a healer, so you can get a little typecast in the late game. Tanking, for example, isn't just limited to one class and I have seen great sorcerer tanks as well as more traditional warrior tanks (called dragonknights btw). I believe a new class (necromancer) has been added since I last played, not sure how they compare really.
---
&gt;  the queen fight isn't the best way to get the mats from ads,
---
It is if you do it right.  After the queen fight I go into the rad zones and mess around the fissures until an SB appears.  If the SB appears *outside* (but close to  of the rad zone I run back in until I'm comfortably inside.  Then I farm all the scorched that appear *without* killing the SB (I have enough Rad and Fireproof perk cards so SB's are mostly an annoyance now).  You can easily get 5-10 minutes of scorched spawns per SB with maybe 7ish scorched appearing give or take per SB.  About 20- 30% of those scorched will drop the fluids.  So SBQ quests are great *if* you farm the SBs afterwards.
---
A side note: Everyone wants to do the SBQ quest *outside* of the rad zone.  Especially bloodied builds with no power armor.  But if you *do* drop the nuke so that the fissure is well inside the rad zone (so people can't hang on the peirmeter and draw the SBQ out) then, again, 20 - 30 percent of *all the beasties that spawn at that quest* will now drop HRF and almost *all* of them will drop some sort of flux-making mat.  So if you do drop the nuke that way you'll be up to your ears in HRF.
---
Read some more comments before making one, lmao
---
Incorrect.
---
Yes I know but then they could be visible and shown
---
Of course, but encouraging them to try won‚Äôt make them succeed... üòÅ
---
Except for decom shower :(
---
Best advise I can give is just keep launching nukes and keep killing mobs, rng will eventually give you something
---
They're not writing program for the atom shop, their designing textures/models and slapping it on a pre-programmed template for the vast majority of content being put out.
---
bunch of dataminers are hosting an AMA in the sub, I'm on mobile but if you search the sub you should find the details. Great to find out more about the game as there's so much left unexplained as well as info about cut/future content
---
The Brotherhood didn't live at all. This Chapter got wiped. Maybe there are a few deserters but anyone that could actually be called a member died fighting. It'll be another 150 years before the Brotherhood comes anywhere near WV again. 
---
Similarly, all the Raiders as they were in WV before the scorched plague are also dead. "Raiders" really isn't a faction. It's more like an occupation. The raiders coming in Wastelanders are another gang (or collection of gangs) from another area probably to the north. 
---
And the Enclave in the area are for sure dead. Killed by their own robot too. But of all the factions, they are the ones that actually have the resources and manpower close enough to move back in if they wanted too.
---
I certainly hope so! Thanks!
---
I sell it at 1cap per bullet. Haven't tried selling it any higher. Usually put 1000-2000 in at a time and someone snatches it up right away.
---
Same here - broken 9 days and counting. Even rejecting mission doesn't work for me
---
1. for how long?
---
2. yes, clubhouse, the area with the highest concentration of ghouls, most people only run that, but there are housing units that are also full of ghouls
---
3. the best way to get high radiation fluids, glowing mass, and hardened mass is ads, so anywhere that has a lot of ads is a good place to farm those mats, Whitesprings is on that list
---
just remember that loot is rng, not every run is going to be as good as that one run you had that one time
---
We try for everyday, Some prefer 1 mission over another. The raids reset every 20 hours from the last raid, We'll be able to run the Raid again around 6:30Pm EST, but not all of us will be on.
---
Oh lol that place, never figured out it was a clubhouse.
---
what does other comments have anything to do with you implying there won't be anymore scorched and me correcting the implication?
---
I have a friend who is finished every challenge in the game except craft one plasma grenade haha 
---
He‚Äôs been offering 100k and can‚Äôt get one :)
---
I just want some open world PvP. Fit in well with the wasteland. Don't really care for organized PvP matches.
---
Ok, thank you.
---
ü§°
---
I believe this statement is accurate.
---
How do you think they pay for RND, development, and server hosting?  Through the initial cost of the game?  lol
---
This game has no subscription......you realize how things work in the real world right software world right?
---
If they fail to meet profit margins then the company cuts development and then cuts content then finally the game.
---
Is what it is.  The days of building games just to build a game is long gone.
---
What kind of teammate leaves the match when someone is still playing?
---
We have a good strategy to get into a good server everytime, we all go to the main menu &amp; join the same server all at once as a group, we're generally put into a less populated server which is great for Vault Raids.
---
Very low level stuff is worth a ton! Ppl with a lot of alts are usually looking for carry weight armor and cool weapons :) I buy level 5 stuff a lot! :)
---
they literally replied to a comment in this sub and said they aren't removing scorched or scorchbeasts
---
Haha why's that man
---
You really think that Bethesda will respect Lore and keep Brotherhood out of the game? Also the Enclave are alive. Mobius and his fleet of robots, all members of the Enclave.
---
I think the truck simulator games just use preexisting online radios though.
---
My gamertag is Black Sa1ami
---
Not happening the game can‚Äôt support it right now performance wise.
---
I also think Johnny Cash doesn't fit in the game either. Especially some terrible cover that in there only because he says "Goodnight, West Virginia" at the end. 
---
The game is supposed to have that late 1940s - early 1950s feel, the reason they have so much jazz from the earlier eras; Andrew Sisters, Nat King Cole, Benny Goodman, all mid-century American jazz. Then they have a few random song, like the Beach Boys, that just don't fit with the mood or the musical era whatsoever.
---
Uranium fever has become a joke. Why don‚Äôt they let everyone tag the legendarys?
---
This has been my experience as well. Slower servers perhaps.
---
ghouls drop nuked flora mats way more than scorched do
---
when i server hopped that location it did take awhile to load in everything......for me one of the last things to load in is the pip-boy radio....so once i hear that and i don't see anything pop at the random encounter ill server hop again
---
yeah, I'm the clown, Bethesda literally replied to a comment in this sub and said scorched and scorchbeasts aren't going anywhere...
---
Really, that sounds OK, how did you know, thanks!
---
golf clubhouse
---
Like others have said, high rad fluid is the hardest to come by.  Usually.  Someone nuked Morgantown the other day with overlap on the airport, and train yard.  Most of the scorched dropped hrf's.  I came out with 16 after one circuit.  Nuke zone ended without anyone else coming in to proc a respawn so im not sure if I was just lucky, or Beth changed the drop rate, or scorched are what we need to be killing to get those tasty tasty high rad fluids.
---
If you feel this way, you should probably boycott all video games.  Not excusing the condition Fallout 76 launched in, but this is essentially the norm now for AAA video games.  Ghost Recon just came out and holy shit is it a mess.
---
tell me you‚Äôre kidding...
---
Yeah this was ages failed to post but now lol it posted im actually gonna delete it XD
---
Even when I was working on a forklift I worked overtime. So it‚Äôs like a portion of 1 hour a week of my life that I have to spend working anyway.
---
If you've already done Mayor For a Day, just go to Watoga and farm the robots.
---
Ha!
---
&gt;immersion breaking
---
That is actually the issue, you hit that nails squarely, I immerse myself in the environment of the game which I really think is a work of art, it's all the sillyness that I come across that makes me go..
---
'Damn!' and Alt F4
---
It's me I know but I'm sure there are others who wish for a darker side to Fallout 76.
---
Mm gotta love those sickeningly sweet radiation juice boxes
---
What about the white springs sentrybot?
---
My friend did the ash heap one 261 times before getting the plan. He said the one upside was all the other stuff he got from it.
---
Mayor Zabala! lol
---
Jinping the Pooh
---
Doesn't mean it couldn't be darker and more *apocalyptic* I wonder what the demographic this game was aimed at to be honest.
---
Anyway, I was just having a rant after coming across more silliness and needed to vent.
---
Blizzard lost me after Diablo 3.  I had played enough Team Fortress 2 to see right thru Overwatch.  The last games they released that I thoroughly enjoyed were Warcraft 3 and Diablo 2.
---
That was the downer for me "Hurray! I've build my character! Now I'm  geared up, skilled and ready to,.. uh...  
---
Shit."
---
This would be great because it would add some randomization to the same old area's where you already know how many enemies to prepare for. To get swarmed by an unexpected horde would be fun and exciting.
---
Aside from Whitesprings nuke events visit SBQ events and head into the nuke zone.  You want to get a scorchbeast to attack you and let it keep spawning scorched in the nuke zone and farm them for flux stabilization components.  SBQ nukes usually affect more than one fissure site so you have good chance of being able to do this especially after most of the folks who were there for the queen leave.  You can make a nice profit selling off the excess too. Cheers!
---
The soldier, not the curator?
---
Collect a lot of Acid by capturing the Hemlock Holes workshop (Toxic Valley). Next put on your excavator armor and collect Iron Ore at the Hornwright Testing Site #03. Next collect Lead Ore at the Lucky Hole mine. You can now make about 8k .50 or 5mm ammo, which you can sell on Reddit for 0.5-1 cap a piece. Make sure you equip the Ammosmith and Super Duper perks when crafting everything! There is a very active marketplace subreddit where you can sell the ammo, but I am not allowed to name it here... send me a PM if you want to know which marketplace reddit I'm talking about. 
---
Caps stashes/drops are way too slow. For real profits, make ammooooo
---
i feel like a pimp when it domes to them... i collect them just to resell them at a reasonable higher rate
---
It was in my Challenges list, but hadn't seen it come up on my map and haven't done that one yet anyway.
---
I was hoping the vault raids would double as a horde mode fighting a near endless waves similar to arktos farma competing for a higher wave score and better rewards.
---
I don't really mind, if you're dead there's not much you're gonna provide, plus that dude was kinda annoying imo haha
---
I protest...let me get my sign.
---
Took about 500 rounds of .50, 3 plasma cores, 5   cheap cores. About 20 or so diluted stimpacks and dying a few times. Keep in mind that I didn't really plan out my character all that much so my tsaa 50 cal sniper does about 200 damage base without sneak and low health. I used my explosion shotgun that adds damage per shot, ts 50 cal machine gun, ts gatling plasma modded and my sniper rifle. Im mostly a sniper in the game so a couple of repair kits too.
---
True he was annoying, but a good teammate can help see things, remind to heal, etc.
---
Imo, the DLC for Fallout 4 felt kinda lackluster anyway.  Except for Far Harbor, that one was awesome.
---
Tbh I just buy all mine, usually ppl want 1-4 caps per piece :)
---
I'll be on xbox unfortunately.
---
Nice thanks!  Some of the best Fallout Lore has been the cut/future content.
---
Never used them and filtered the Nexus to not even see most of it when I was looking for mods.
---
Shame i had hoped to see the Free States Bundle return as i missed out first time round...still i'll save my Atoms for next week
---
Your absolutely right, it‚Äôs about profits. Marketing shirts, hats, helmets and atom shops type stuff. You can‚Äôt make everyone happy in this world. Why even try. Just put out what you have without getting it right first and consumers will eat it up. Never mind Quality, customers returning or even pride and craftsmanship. Just get that money and move on. They‚Äôll buy it and we‚Äôll laugh all the way to the bank. That‚Äôs how everything is these days, it‚Äôs a sad world we live in. I myself take pride in what I do and won‚Äôt settle for less. So from now on when we get screwed we‚Äôll just say, it‚Äôs ok that‚Äôs how things work. I won‚Äôt quit playing but I don‚Äôt have to like how it‚Äôs being handled. You can force satisfaction.
---
Every creature has the same chance to drop all 3 mats, provided they are actively inside a nuke zone. The game checks for that before it rolls, if you kill things outside of a nuke zone, then they will not drop stabilizing materials.
---
From what I understand the game is way more unstable on PS4 but has more players than other platforms.  That's where most of the issues I hear are from anyway.
---
Isn't the apocalyptic wasteland bad enough without adding popcorn ceilings?
---
considering the US government is depicted just as badly, maybe they consider it an even trade?
---
This is already a thing?
---
What?
---
I think you may have replied in the wrong thread.
---
Add me, same IGN as here. Been playing awhile but would be happy to help you out with some supplies or help through tough areas to get exp.
---
When you talk about PvP, you describe it as a face to face open field duel. My experience with PVP has not been like that. Because the fight begins long before the gunfire starts. The fight ends when the guns come out. Do you think we just run up to each other weapons drawn? We strategize, try to position ourselves well, try to outsmart the other player before we even start firing. It's not a duel at high noon.
---
But even beyond that? What's so bad about having a space for endgame players to try our different gear combos on each other? It's common in other games that have open PvP spaces and loot and all that. It's always been optional if that's not your cup of tea. 
---
Since you say you avoid PvP in this game I don't know why you are so opinionated about what belongs and what doesn't. You never had to step foot in survival mode or even PVP with a player if you roll with pacifist mode.
---
It would be different if they didn't state this from the beginning.  We all know what cosmetic shops mean at this stage of gaming.
---
Have been to west tek but thanks I'll try these
---
Thanks for the tag! We've passed this along to the Dev's and it's already fixed for Patch 14.
---
Try Morganton, I went to a blast zone there and got more rad-fluids than when I was a whitesprings.
---
[For the curious](https://twitter.com/Grummz/status/1181736075775004672)
---
Did you loot the body? Most spawns like that only spawn for you until you loot it, then you have to wait for your global cooldown (about 20 hours) before that spawn will reappear for you. You can look at the body, and as long as you don't take anything it will continue to refresh with each server hop. If you take anything though, you activate the global cooldown and have to wait. The only way to expedite the global cooldown is to loot 200 other world spawn objects, the list that keeps track of what you looted when is only 200 items long.

---
I'm not saying anything about the danger from being naked during the event, but that it is ridiculous immersion breaking and the antithesis of my idea of an apocalyptic world, that's all.
---
It was a rant and I've calmed down now. Alt F4 on PC is quite cathartic.
---
yep. It's been happening. Very annoying.
---
 After the queen fight I go into the rad zones and mess around the fissures until an SB appears. If the SB appears outside (but close to of the rad zone I run back in until I'm comfortably inside. Then I farm all the scorched that appear without killing the SB right away. I have enough Rad and Fireproof perk cards so SB's are mostly an annoyance now. You can easily get 5-10 minutes of scorched spawns per SB with maybe 7ish scorched appearing give or take per SB. About 20- 30% of those scorched will drop the fluids. So SBQ quests are great if you farm the SBs afterwards.
---
A side note: Everyone wants to do the SBQ quest outside of the rad zone. Especially bloodied builds with no power armor. But if you do drop the nuke so that the fissure is well inside the rad zone (so people can't hang on the perimeter and draw the SBQ out) then, again, 20 - 30 percent of all the beasties that spawn at that quest will now drop HRF and almost all of them will drop some sort of flux-making mat. So if you do drop the nuke that way you'll be up to your ears in HRF. A side benefit of dropping the nuke this way is that youl'l have way less characters in Faschnacht masks, clown outfits and Deathclaw gauntlets jumping around, dying and asking to be revived every 2 minutes.
---
Destroying someones Decom shower is just dirty.
---
Thanks! I'll try that next!
---
It's not a typo he's from 'Da South"
---
3-4 items are/were bugged
---
Double is not two shot. Double is legacy.
---
This would create a player economy of others selling atom shop placements, which would be counter productive to the idea of a cosmetic shop.
---
I know right. Shoot. I might give some stuff about about a hour or a day. Then back to doing my things.
---
Thanks! But unfortunately none of the scorched spawned high radiation fluids, just glowing meat/blood. :(
---
same
---
if you could build stuff you paid for in other people's C.A.M.P.s they wouldn't need to buy it
---
it's not, you can't build atom shop items in someone else's camp
---
I'm not sure you'd call a bunch of assaultrons members. When you join the Enclave, Creepy Face tells you that it and you are the only members. 
---
But again, there are Enclave posts everywhere in the country. They could move back in no problem. 
---
The only way I could see them bringing in the Brotherhood again is if maybe they sent off a small team to DC or somewhere to scope things out before the shit hit the fan. 
---
Either way, the Brotherhood can't really last because they arn't around when the West Coast Chapter comes over.
---
Love how a Bethesda fanboy already downvoted the post. People don't like to think for themselves it would seem.
---
But why not complete the game 'Unarmoured' why naked? That is my question. But I'm guessing the devs were way to drunk or high during their meetings and had not played the earlier games, so don't understand the darker Fallout atmosphere they are ruining by all this absurdity.
---
Thanks for reporting this.  We'll bring it up with the devs!
---
So you want a level 29 to do the encrypted event?
---
&gt; I have 2k hours in game
---
You get the irony here though, right? 2k hours is $14,500 at minimum wage, or you could have easily learned to program or written a book or something in that amount of time. I'm not suggesting there's anything wrong with spending that time playing a game you enjoy, but time and money both being limited resources (and time being arguably more valuable), how can you say he "has a problem" for spending one when you spend tons of the other?

---
 &gt; Thanks for reporting this.  We'll bring it up with the devs!
---
Honestly I can't drop it in a nuke zone because my PA is glitched where is uses the jet pack whenever I jump, and since I'm instantly overencumbered when I jump it, I run out of AP real fast. It's kind of a nuisance to put it on so I try to always keep the Nuke drop out of the way.
---
Also I like to help low levels, and it's best when I do it this way.
---
Yup.  Pretty standard for an mmo.  And like mmos the storyline doesnt usually fit with what you see out in the world
---
Of all the people who have provided a summary of this situation, you went with Mark Kern? You know he's an alt right jackass, right?
---
What makes you think it will work that way? afaik it will be 1 Legendary Perk for each S.P.E.C.I.A.L stat, retroactive and requiring 50 lvls per legendary perk.
---
There is legions that that there is Bald Headed Hood Rats that do go extra hard. I do not. I feel that as a member of The Appalachia Bald  Headed Hood Rat Community I feel like I am mild compared to others.
---
Not sure about that. The game supports weapons stands. Some outfits, have less polygons then some weapons (somehow).
---
Well I think game companies should show a quarterly report of money in and where its allocated and profits.  If FO76 is taking in tons of cash and meeting their profits and the game doesn‚Äôt change for the better THEN we hold them to the flame.
---
I myself buy Atom each paycheck I have some disposable income set aside for games.  I‚Äôve been happy so far with everything and don‚Äôt mind helping a game but I expect them to deliver a good if not great gaming experience.
---
This is why I like sub games I‚Äôve always felt that I get a better gaming experience.
---
I have played WoW and Eve Online since 2004 and they are polished games.  (Braces for hate)
---
I've tried to play ESO three different times and just couldn't get into it. I wanted to hate FO76 because of how it launched and all the other controversies that came with it, but I tried it during the free week and got hooked, it's been my main game since June now.
---
Since when? I had a friend a while back come to my camp and place down the Greenhouse dome and some other things in my Camp and I‚Äôve had them since
---
I have some very low level I'm saving for next character.
---
Last character I leveled I made a 20, 30, 40 and 50 Fixer for :) was glorious
---
But I wouldn't pay much for them, you get to 50 fast enough.
---
The drop rate on the plan is whack lol. My first drop took around 300 quests, second took 20, since then I‚Äôve done around 1000 quests in the ash heap and have not gotten another drop yet
---
there is a challenge that involves healing another player while they are in water, and Bethesda was shocked that instead of doing this during one of the public events near rivers or lakes, people decided to just jump off cliffs into puddles to get critically injured so that people can heal them and complete the challenge.
---
so, yeah. on average i'd say we're pretty helpful.
---
20k for scavenger bot as i paid $7 for it.
---
# Horde-Yeah!
---
Haha, that would be really confusing to just log on and see that
---
I think we should be given the option to change all of them at once every 50 or 100 levels. Redistributing them one by one is a pain in the ass IMO. When I first started I didn't know how different perks were form fallout 4 so I was working on the wrong ones.
---
I think a player Reputation system would be great
---
It could definitely work to have it scale with level too - that way lower levels don‚Äôt get overwhelmed but higher levels can still find a bit of fun (or in some cases a bit of difficulty) in otherwise easy locations
---
Can someone explain to me the legendary system and selling them in the legendary machine? What you get out of it?
---
Probably is more on ps4, but what I have read on here ALOT. PC players are rage quitting do to bug's ect.
---
Ah yes I want to earn it for sure so I dont run into that issue lol
---
Maybe the plasma grenade plan is bethesda's sick little joke synonymous with Willy Wonka's golden ticket
---
I love to fall out 76 to start playing ESO, and I'm much happier with the experience.  I wish they had gone with the same style for fall out or at least borrowed some of the same mechanics, because I feel like fall out 76 is just a cheap way to get more money out of us.
---
I also experience that glitch *and* I am often over-encumbered while going into SBQ events . I have no real issues with AP running out fast because I compensate with a hard lemonade, corn soup, razorgrain flour, etc.   Of course this is all build dependent.
---
That sounds cool.  I‚Äôll endorse that!
---
Thanks for offering a solution rather than a rant.
---
You don‚Äôt have to give away the farm, but some tend to be more useful for low levels then as script. I found someone selling a 1* level 5 pistol, so I bought it, upgraded it a bit, then put it out for sale in my vendor for around the same price I bought it at.
---
But I find a level 40-3*, that shit is getting scripted.
---
I don‚Äôt think they will be good in the end. Right now it‚Äôs more of us vs the mutants. But the bottom line will be making America great again. Our current alliance with them could be in jeopardy when we have to make morality decisions later when humans do show up.
---
Because it is not since launch. It is from much much further back. Could happen in Fallout 3 even (though rarely). And none of these Devs helped build this engine, they had it thrown in their lap and told to make this game in an engine they don't know. So it is quite simple. It is hard for them to fix it, because none of them was part of the team that made it.
---
Yeah it never popped up for me and I doubt it will in the 20 minutes until reset. Kinda of stupid to tie a daily challenge to an event that now randomly pops up. I saw heart of the swamp three times, the event at mama dolces 2 or 3 times, uranium fever twice, and other events that don't matter.
---
Yeeeeeeeees!
---
Well I will message you when I get home and see what we can come up with :)
---
I mentioned something similar awhile ago.  While the daily / weekly challenges are good, there should be a daily login incentive to increase player engagement.
---
Bloodied. I one shot almost every mob on the map.
---
go to the hunter's shack in the mire. it won't always prompt, though. i have 4 characters. when the quest doesn't show up, i'll switch my guy and that one will have it activated (sometimes it's just active in the pip boy &amp; won't have the "quest started" message). once i know the quest is active, i'm pretty sure they'll be active for all of them. it's been working for me this way. there are full days when it won't activate as well.
---
If you're not geared for pvp, dont stand around crafting in an open pvp zone.
---
I'm not a fan of pvp, so I dont bother with workshops.
---
Really depends on what your meaning of ‚Äúend game‚Äù is. There are a lot of quests overall and the world is huge! 
---
Plenty of DLC‚Äôs and the new Elsweyr and dragons are back. 
---
I‚Äôve been playing for a few years now and lvl 400+, I‚Äôm also a casual player so you can get higher in a shorter time for sure. 
---
I say ‚Äúend game‚Äù since in my head it means completing everything the game has for you to do. Fishing for example has you catching different types of fish in different areas in each area of the map... this is like 100% RNG but can literally take forever to get a blue labeled fish!...lol (keep in mind you need bait so you‚Äôll have to hunt that all down). 
---
Main level bosses are similar to SBQ as far as time goes, many times larger ones you‚Äôll get help from other players, 20+ minutes of fighting gets tiresome. 
---
Exploring is amazing as well as the interaction of the game. If you love lore you‚Äôll love ESO. You‚Äôll want to read everything you pick up! 
---
I found later in a quest that everyone you talk to and everything you pick up and read helps you. Lore books is also a challenge so to speak meaning there are X number of them and though you don‚Äôt have to find them all to complete the quest, you do have to find them to get that area cleared completely game wise if you want to complete everything. 
---
It‚Äôs easy to get lost, it‚Äôs a tough call to take on another quest BUT when an NPC is outside of a place you need to go in anyways you‚Äôll find out later IF you don‚Äôt talk to them gt hat you have to go back in that place for them. So basically killing two birds with one stone... there are many like this. 
---
Flip side you‚Äôll get quests that you need multiple things from multiple locations to complete so you just can‚Äôt complete it all in one shot. 
---
I‚Äôm all over the place here and not really giving you a great outline but I‚Äôll say this... it‚Äôs an amazing online game and I‚Äôll be with it for a very long time!
---
Many players seem to be missing the point of this completely, here is my take for what it's worth;
---
* I have over 2200 hours of game play, Paid $40, bought $20 in Atoms
---
   * 2200 hrs @ $0.36/hr (Great Entertainment value if you ask me)
---
* I know players that have nearly every item in the Atom Shop and haven't bought any Atoms.
---
* The money made from Atoms sales funds future updates and extends the life of the game.
---
* By Contrast, the avg Movie Rental cost $6, and last an avg of 1.4 hours
---
   * Movie Rentals cost an average of $2.62/hr
---
   * My Cable TV that I hardly ever watch costs me $148 a month
---
I think I'll buy $50 in Atoms when I get home this evening so I can get those other PA skins I've been Wanting.
---
I'm bloodied melee btw. My Unstoppable Monster DCG is a straight up beast.
---
The workshops are pvp zones dont wanna do pvp they stay away from them it's simple they where designed to be like this
---
Can you post a video or detailed instructions for your run? Would be great to do it now that I've run out of other stuff to do.
---
Sorry dude, as much as I hate Raiders, it's on you for taking a workshop. That has *always* been PvP. It sucks to get annihilated in 4 shots by some dude with an insane explosive radium rifle, but that's the one part of the game where you kinda *have* to accept PvP.
---
Oh geez, I'm dumb.  I found it, thank you!
---
PC?
---
I finished "Queen of the Hunt" earlier this week and now it will never appear again. Bug's been there for months. A+ job
---
I am referring to your comment about wanting to play this game locally on your PC
---
You are wright. It is not a big bug. It should take not so long. On the other hand have you heard anything from Graftons Mayor today.
---
And more switches please! Haha
---
The greenhouse thing and I think the satellite dish are the only ones you can do this with.
---
With all the bulk glass we have you‚Äôd think we could fix windows...lol
---
What perks are necessary for that ?
---
They don't even have to go that far. In survival mode you knew who the  killers were because they had high killstreaks for the week on the leaderboard. But I doubt they'll bring that to adventure mode. I don't think the peaceful players could handle having kills as a category in an adventure mode leaderboard without losing their shit over players killing other players.
---
Why not just max level servers?, 50+ only and the entire map is mob level 50+?
---
No. But they can do the quest to get the weapon.... which is why I said
---
China seems surprisingly ok with the Fallout series, but I am guessing it is because we mostly see America in the game series, and not a flattering America at that. After all China is the only country that has access to Fallout Shelter Online right now, so they even have Fallout exclusives.
---
Aaaand another whiner getting "harassed" and "bullied" in pvp zone. Don't like getting killed? Do go to workshops, they are meant for pvp.
---
That would be great!
---
They shouldn't appear as aggro, and I like the idea of showing the owner.
---
Beyond that, we should be able to put a collar on them, like a prisoner's collar, that has a lighted beacon. If it is too challenging to adjust the creature to show the owner, the collar could be a quick-fix.  Just tweak the prisoner's collar to be green, perhaps, and then when you point at it it'll show you the owner.
---
Hate to burst your bubble, but my understanding is that due to the size of the mod and it using the script extender, it won't be coming to console. I think they're putting a lot of the weapons and armor up for consoles though.
---
Both of the MMOs you mentioned are polished, complete experiences. WoW has arguably too much to do. In Fallout 76 I've run out of non-bugged quests at Level 85 and I can't finish a bunch of the challenges because they're bugged too.
---
just curious: why do you want to know? how is that any fun? and why would anyone tell you? then we‚Äôd all know and trust me, that‚Äôs the one thing the cowardly one-shotters don‚Äôt want.
---
You heard very wrong. The mod requires F4SE and will be well over the 2gb console limit.
---
This makes mamma hen Wickedy happy.
---
Yup! I will!
---
Not bashing here but why take the workshop when you can harvest more materials in 30 minutes to an hour that a workshop produces in the same amount of time all without the hassle... 
---
I‚Äôve had every workshop out there at one point in the game at max production and I wasn‚Äôt impressed by the amounts of materials produced at all... to me especially now with players like you‚Äôve mentioned, it just isn‚Äôt worth it at all.
---
Walk around. You will find tons.
---
The game is call of duty they can go play but aside your rant just avoid workshops common troll grounds you cant talk sense into the unsensable.
---
Yeah I agree. I think something like 10 atoms a day to log in and then a bonus after 7 consecutive days or something. Would give incentive to log in and it would benefit them. Even if you got 10 a day and 50 on the 7th day, that's only 120 atoms a week, not enough to purchase anything without grinding other challenges or buying atoms. 
---
I'd like more than that for a log in bonus, but I doubt they'll even give us 5 a day, we can dream though.
---
I had unstable isotope and electrically charged for the longest time but removed them and reset all of my mutations.  There‚Äôs nothing worse than backing into a PvP and getting blasted inadvertently
---
I find myself taking them, but when someone contests, I don‚Äôt bother going to defend.
---
Most players attacking owned workshops don‚Äôt care about the workshop itself, they just want to PvP.
---
For the most part, if you let them take it and not engage, they will move on to another player‚Äôs shop. Then you can take back yours and they won‚Äôt even bother coming back.
---
That or they just leave the game when there are no shops left to take, and then you get yours back for free!
---
On the road or below on the railroad tracks?
---
I think the idea has potential, but what is to stop griefers from setting themselves on pacifist, joining a server then switching and going on a rampage on a server with no pvp resistance?
---
I've played every fallout game since 1. I've never seen or heard this glitch in any other game besides 76. I'm not saying you're wrong, just saying it's a real problem for this game in particular and possibly a minor problem in other fallout games. IDK man, just feels like they aren't working on solving any issues that made people stop playing and going full force on micro transactions. feels bad man
---
What is fixed can always be unfixed. Nothing in life is certain. The sins of the past do not always stay there. These are the lessons the great Todd seeks to impart.
---
Lol just have to google Bloodied Unharmed Build... there... I "destroyed" the secret...
---
Feel better now?
---
It literally warns you with a giant dialog box that you're basically signing yourself up for PvP when you take a workshop.  What did you expect would happen?  I bet you're the type of person that complains about invaders in Dark Souls too.
---
There are lots of alternatives to workshops if you need the resources that badly.  Stop complaining that PvP players are using one of the only forms of PvP left in this game outside of NW when you're actively signing yourself up for it.
---
Forced PvP is a pain in the ass, but that's what you sign up for when you take a workshop.  
---
Take the workshop, build your collectors/defenses, gtfo.  
---
The second rate survival players will be waiting to pick you off as an easy kill, the genuine PvP players will be using Hunter/Hunted and looking for people who are tooled up for a fun fight.
---
"Master race"
---
I made myself fat. Wish I could blame zoloft.
---
why stop there, at just letting people access your vendors? go full-on Colosseum. Build something like the combat zone from 4. set up signs that say "free 3 star weapons to whoever bests me in combat!", let people bet on fights, become a damn buisness owner.
---
you want people to PvP? give them a reason to LOVE PvP!
---
This doesn‚Äôt change that overpriced is overpriced.
---
I've had a few like lvl 20 instigating hunting rifles, etc.
---
I just sold them for like 1,000-ish. Something I felt a level 20-25 could probably afford. 
---
They moved fast.
---
You did great, thank you!
---
Why so aggressive? 
---
I just want to kill the scorchbeast that‚Äôs attacking my camp all the time without wasting a lot of ammo or changing my camp‚Äôs location.

Would this be that bad of a thing? It would I think be un common. And most atomic store items are just cosmetic. I don‚Äôt know how it would effect sales. Would it increase sales or decrease them. And I guess they could limit the amount per day that you could place in other people‚Äôs camps. It would also take a lot more time and effort to do a transaction.
---
I really like your idea. I do think that Bethesda would have to hand off the game to another studio if that were to be implemented because another studio would have the manpower to create the unique stories and quests that would be involved.
---
I have 20 characters and 7 above 50. It was more of the continuance of broken things having to be repatched, the void when asking customer support for anything, and just the logging in to get scrip and maybe launch a nuke. Though I still play a bit over 90% of my 150+ person discord doesn't play anymore (we had 4 people on fallout yesterday), I saw 5 on BL3, and a good portion on WoW (classic and regular). I think some of the steam is falling off as people either get stuck in a loop of grinding the same stuff or they move on to another title.
---
I‚Äôm on ps4 and times are tough over here, too. I avoid WS resort because I can‚Äôt stand the sentry bot machine gun fire anymore.
---
I'm not the one throwing a fit over it. Did someone drop their binky? Make a stinkey?
---
Everyday üò≠
---
Can no one duplicate the bloody thing like they done with the land mines and jam pack every train station &amp; wherever with them ?
---
Please?
---
Correct.  I updated my post.
---
Just got a friend to get the game so I've been helping them along and collecting items and ammo and what not for them.
---
I don't think anything can stop somebody set on griefing. This will not reduce the harassing to zero. This will, instead, reduce the times where PvPers are bored and their attempts to find an opponent are perceived by CoOp people as harassing.  
---
Right now we play on servers with mostly no PvP resistance. Most of us PvPers aren't actually griefers, and are solely interested in the PvP resistance, and wish this resistance to be of superb quality.
---
a harrowing tale, but a happy ending!
---
I already said why grinding for atoms isn‚Äôt an excuse.  If I wanted to pay for a $10 item then I‚Äôd still be paying $10.  Grinding atoms doesn‚Äôt change the price of the item.  It would still cost X dollars.  The free atoms just justify a higher price.  The free atoms don‚Äôt change the price of the item if I‚Äôm going to pay for it by buying atoms.  It still costs the same amount of atoms that I‚Äôd have to buy.
---
That's **still** a thing?
---
Jeez, that was an issue for the first few weeks of the game too.
---
Tbh, I dont even see the point in taking workshops when everything you need is so easy to farm. The only one I can half understand people taking is the one that produces cores. But cores are super easy to farm too.
---
I have noticed an influx of toxic players since survival went, so I just dont give them a chance to hassle me. And if they wanna stand around wasting ammo why I stand there giving the "follow me" emote, that's fine.
---
Nerd rage in Intelligence and Serendipity in luck are for sure required. I also recommend bloody mess in Luck and Radicool in endurance as well as your perks for the weapon you use. Theres a few in the agility tree that people use as well, I haven't modified my build to that yet though.
---
Also, have you guys looked into the issue regarding the Strangler Hearts power armor acid attack basically locking up everyone's game during the SBQ fight?
---
Being German, I couldn't care less how you classify idiots. 
---
If you have a better link go ahead. It was the first in my queue and didn't feel like digging around.
---
Threads like this bring me closer and closer to turning "raider" every time I see one, and I rarely engage in pvp, and can't stand griefing.  Quit whining. Your hard won and hard defended workshop obviously wasnt defended hard enough.  Afraid of drowning?  Maybe you should stay on dry land.
---
I turned right and ended up in Albuquerque.
---
I've been playing online multiplayer games since they were text form. 
---
 From Gemstone 3 and 4 to Meridian 59 to Everquest and Wow, on and on I've played... There is something about FO76 I really love though that stands apart from all of them.  I don't have a lot of time to play and when I do, it's quite casual and I know I can pick up where I left off and my commitment is low,
---
sli/crossfire is not necessary anymore and on most modern hardware actually has worse performance
---
I still have a lot of success at Whitesprings
---
I don‚Äôt.  I don‚Äôt plan to at all until they start reasonably pricing things.  But there are people who do.  I keep seeing people defend the atom store.  They‚Äôre the reason the atom shop can get away with stupid prices on reskins.  This is a counterpoint to those that defend the atom shop.
---
Ahh mate you beat me to it lmao üçª
---
I agree 100% that the PVP players are spread out too thin when mixed in adventure mode. I'd love to see some sort of matchmaking to condense non pacifist players on the same servers, that's a good idea. No need for a separate game mode to accommodate and as usual it would be completely optional. For me survival was always about the game mechanics of PVP always enabled, not the rewards or extra exp.
---
Along with that, I wish pacifist mode would function a bit differently. Like all pacifist mode on players are tagged as non hostile. Always white dots. No pvp damage taken or received. Non pacifist players flagged as hostile to each other. We are always red dots. No PVP permission system amongst non pacifist players. Because even if we all ended up together on a server  whether we band together and follow each other or the game does it for us we'd still have do the whole I challenge you to a duel system which feels unnatural and takes all the tension and fun out of an encounter.
---
&gt;. Even if legendarys were removed I doubt you would suddenly start pvping since you say you get nothing out of it anyway.
---
 This is where you are completely wrong. I was looking forward to survival until they announced how is going to be played out.  I was looking forward to playing fallout 76 with fear of being shot from other players.
---
They made 3 huge mistakes that killed that mode on arrival.
---
#1 was allowing adventure mode characters to roll over at any time.  That right there took the survival out of survival.
---
#2  Legendary gear. Having an unfair playing field because Bob got a way better drop than Susie did.  That's luck and gear based PVP.
---
#3  The leaderboard.  Since when did fallout become an arcade game?
---
 I can go on and on about the mistakes they made but those were the top 3 that killed it before it was even released.
---
Myself plus countless more would have played on a survival server if it was actually a survival and not a gear/luck free-for-all kill all arcade type server.
---
They paid too much to not use it
---
nope
---
Decent Idea, have an upvote - Not that you'll see this as you've said that you'll block me
---
Look up Captainoob‚Äôs stealth commando build. It‚Äôs pretty OP. Bloodied is the best build if you don‚Äôt mind dying on occasion.
---
I would be happy to see this in place, but this is implementation of a new feature and integrating it with rest of the game systems. Hopefully, it will be part of Wastelanders at some point, but its a much bigger change than what I suggested.  
---
Based on my experience in the IT industry, I believe the changes could be finished within a day of work, and would not influence the game nor any of it's systems directly. Loadbalancers are basically programs that define to which server given connection is routed. What I suggest is more like tweaking some settings than adding new features.
---
If the game is acting wonky in some way, such as bugs you don't normally see, strange drops, damage being off, etc, then relog every time before spending much time in that session.  High radiation fluids seem to be dropping more rarely now for me too, but I got some this way yesterday.
---
Word so it‚Äôll work sort of like SBMM I‚Äôm guessing.
---
The best build for instant kills also happens to be one of the best builds for instantly getting killed. Just throwing that out there. 
---
As already stated, bloodied melee with Unstoppable Monster made just about everything a one shot for me. It was all kinds of fun until I got bored with it. Now I only log that character on to sell stuff to vendors when I run out of daily caps on my others. 
---
To be ready for a prime nuke at any time I made sure to always have glowing, mutton , yao guai and deathclaw or stingwing meats on me plus a good inventory of whiskey. Usually I forgot to use bobbleheads but I have quite a few in my stash.
---
I think that is slated to change in the next patch. Everyone in the event will get to loot the legendarys.
---
play COD
---
I'm done with adventure, I think. I've had little desire to play in quite some time. I was running with a really good queen killing guild, and that was enough to keep me going. But I completed some trades and landed some stuff I'd been after for a long time, and just decided one day that I'd had enough. Resigned from the guild and haven't logged onto adventure at all in a few weeks.
---
However..... I'm really into NW right now. I played it some when it first came out, didn't like the map so I opted to play PUBG and Apex when I had the itch for a BR. When the Morgantown map came out, I tried it again and WOW, I love it. I'm not particularly good at this kind of stuff, my goal is to always make it to the last 10 and I usually try to evade detection rather than shoot it out. I did manage to grab a win last weekend when I solo'd a squad (with the help of the scorchbeast). So I'm still at it a bit every day, I always level at least once and hit my daily (if possible, yesterday was revive 9 players which is kinda difficult when you're solo LOL).
---
There's a pretty fun little PvP experience buried in Fallout 76, and NW uncovered most of it by chunking almost all the dumb magical bullshit. Now I'd really love to see them expand on it, and make other game modes with the NW-style combat but free of the BR restrictions.
---
Dont talk back.
---
def like this, itd help w/ pvp too!
---
I bought the $59 version the night they dropped price to $29 or $39 at Walmart and didn‚Äôt know about the price change. It‚Äôs just one more beef with an otherwise fun but buggy game that I haven‚Äôt played for a couple week. 
---
I just wish I could complete one vault raid on any level.
---
How bad did they hurt ya, son?
---
That doesn‚Äôt change them being overpriced.  They can charge more reasonable prices and still profit to pay the bills as you say but I‚Äôm not going to spend a cent on this not because I‚Äôm some penny pincher or broke but because I don‚Äôt find value in the atom shop‚Äôs item‚Äôs prices.  Not wanting to splurge on overpriced virtual reskins doesn‚Äôt make me a penny pincher.  The prices are ridiculous and what you‚Äôve said doesn‚Äôt change that.
---
I too have been searching for this plan since the pioneer scouts got added
---
I've had more good experiences than bad, some people are assholes but like 90% of the playerbase are cool, on PC at least, I could def see the melee meta being a problem more on console
---
I also play on PS4 and it's alot better now compared to what it was, I'm only referring to what I have read on here.
---
did you really not know about West Tek?
---
My legendary farming route usually goes something like this: 
---
- Charleston Capitol
---
- The Whitespring
---
- West-Tek
---
- Huntersville
---
- Harper's Ferry &amp; The Burrows 
---
- Dyer Chemical
---
I also keep an eye out for all horde events, Uranium Fever, and AWOL Armaments.  You can sometimes find legendaries in other locations that aren't as densely packed with enemies, but I can usually fill my daily scrip quota after a run or two through those locations.
---
Glad it'll be fixed, because one of my characters is RPing a mutated owl.  He wears the Faschnacht Owl mask and a rad stag outfit, wielding a deathclaw gauntlet.  I only hoot at people when using my mic.
---
I put together a loadout specifically for that event, which was fun while I was trading for it and fun the first few times I ran the event but sucks now because that was the last difficult event and I've ruined it for myself. LOL there's no pleasing some people I guess (this guy haha)
---
I will say I've had just a miserable experience with the raids and quit trying. I was failing them, not due to enemy or puzzle difficulty but due to timer issues and completed actions not registering, doors not opening so on. If that's been sorted out then I suppose I could try again. I'd like some strangler PA TBH
---
that would be incredible.  i feel we can achieve these static unique worlds (w/ their own lore/quests/"npcs") if/when we get the private servers.
---
Since last weekend it seems like shops aren‚Äôt as active with PvP
---
I‚Äôve already said this doesn‚Äôt change anything.  The items are still overpriced.  Grinding for atoms doesn‚Äôt change the price.  If I wanted to pay $10 for 1100 atoms and bought a 1100 atom item then it still cost me $10.  Getting a few atoms for free that I have to grind for just justifies a higher price to charge for a single power armor reskin.
---
Other comments in this thread are correct, I along with some friends have tested this thoroughly;
---
If your opponents Agility is above 20, then your perception must also be above 20 for them to work
---
Stealthboys do not seem to play a part in this from what I could tell, but many seem to think it does.
---
My Main character is a Stealth Rifleman build with an Agility of 26-27 depending on the weapon I'm using, my perception is 21 and Berry Mentats always work for me, but seldom work on me, also my friends say I'm nearly impossible to find while sneaking (minimal shimmer effect).
---
sweet melt
---
Why are people still buying 2 gpu's? There is like a hand full of games that support it natively, its literally not worth it.
---
Why don‚Äôt you just collect a ton of caps and server hop until you find the plan in a player vendor?
---
the performance on ps4 has increased; but there are tradeoffs.  i dont get disconnectd nearly as often as b4, but things like cars and enemies will occasionally just pop in right next to me
---
The missile silos sentry bot also has this, at least for me it does
---
This title made me choke on my coffee! I also want a door with a skeleton keyhole that nobody in the universe has the key to anymore. Who knows what‚Äôs behind it?
---
sometimes they are in the medical &amp; science wing. but mostly in the military wing. the desk in the interrogation room sometimes has one, too. it's the room next to the laser grided room in the military wing.
---
But would it really decrease sales? Someone has to buy the items. And in order to place them in your camp you would still need to buy them.  Those who like spending hours building up their camp will still buy from the shop.  Different people like to play the game in different ways and I think that‚Äôs a good thing(except for the grieffers and trolls) some like battle royal pvp, some like the Minecraft building part, some like questing, some like shooting/looting, some like wheeling and dealing. Fallout76 doesn‚Äôt pigeonhole you in to any one style. 
---
Making the shop items placeable in other people‚Äôs camps improves the game experience of two of those groups the wheeling and dealing players and the builders. Currently I think those two groups are the ones who spend the most in the atoms store on camp items. Furthermore I do not think that allowing camp items to be placed in other camps will decrease those people from spending $$ and may increase the amount they spend because those people are going to be the ones wanting to place items in other people‚Äôs camps.  For the builders I think it might even allow them to self justify buying more items. 
---
I think testing is the only way to be sure. Seems like that would be easy enough. Enable it and see the effects on revenue.
---
You know, there's so much Atom Shop content that Bethesda should really just consider adding Atom Shop items in the form of limited-use, rare-drop items that can be gained from safes, tough enemies, and events.
---
They might actually gain some good will back from the community if even the silly skins for existing items were something you could get in a drop, and it would add a little nice variance to the stuff you can buy.
---
I mean, think about it.  Pay atoms to have access to the items all the time for something you really want, that'll always be a thing.  Or, just keep playing and you have a chance to get a drop of stuff that's on the Atom Shop.
---
i would start a new character.  they've redisgned the map levels as well as changes to starting quests (eg camera).
---
as for your queries regarding wastelanders, the answer is ???
---
really cool idea!
---
I'm pretty sure Death hole is where my 1st ex wife is from.
---
It is nice. Prior to this I was hooked on Ark Survival Evolved for about 3 years on and off. That game requires hella commitment. I like Fo76 that I can put it down for a few weeks or even more and come back to the game without feeling behind.
---
The atomic shop is the exact reason I stopped playing. If your going to spend time filling with dumb trash and not fix your game breaking issues then get f'ed. Fallout 76 has basically made me lose all faith in Bethesda.  They were my last company I had hope for that wouldn't fall into the micro transitions trap. I now fear the new Skyrim will just be a online service shit full of micro transactions. Sad what the gaming world is coming to
---
Super mutants are best imo. They have gunpowder, direct caps, and guns that range in price from 30 to 50 caps each. If Ive emptied the vendors caps ill scrap the assualt rifles for steel and the lasers for plastic and sell those in my vendor or use the steel for ammo
---
Do either of the cultist masks work?
---
I need to run them consistently. Sigh.
---
Anyone have groups on PS4?
---
I've not gotten mine either. Support has no eta for me when I email them with just they are working on it.
---
I‚Äôm hearing and reading that the game has a lot of issues like this on PC. I haven‚Äôt encountered similar issues on console as bad as what has been on PC.
---
Me too. 
---
2021 sounds reasonable. LoL
---
I'd personally make it so public events pay out 15-25 Atoms for completion as a way to incentivize doing them. Maybe even atom rewards for killing the scorchbeast queen as a way to motivate more prime site nuking.
---
And if you are me a lot.
---
I'm not reading that whole thing, yes, it would decrease sales measurably.  it's econ 101.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox, play solo pretty much, level 73, decently geared, shotgun/explosives build and my RL friends are too busy playing BL3 and God knows what else. I‚Äôd like to hang out with the cool kids now, so everybody add me! GT: SaiMeatlegs
---
Some of the half-walls with windows would also be much appreciated. ‚ô°
---
So you are what the industry labels a whale btw. Your the type of player they want.
---
I will try to do it, yes. I need to figure out the easiest way to edit my videos to make them easily digestible as it's a lot of locations. I do have the map - just need to do a small edit on that as well, as I had recently added a couple more crates to the run, and they weren't mapped. Will make a new post with it.
---
This. With the hit and miss nature of available challenges, it‚Äôs not always enough motivation for me to log in. If I knew I was going to even get a token amount just for popping in than I don‚Äôt have to worry about shit vault raid or picture of player x wearing y at location z challenges.
---
Last push boys!
---
"Express your artistic side on walls" does this mean paintball gun??????? Please????
---
Go passive buddy
---
yeah, been doing that too. no luck there either...
---
Just imagine if there was somewhere you could go and ask if two GPUs were supported.....
---
and girls!
---
Please don't. It's such a cheap and dirty way to enforce player engagement.
---
Just increase or implement an atom reward for stuff done ingame.
---
ESO is a fantastic game and you'll have a super fun time playing it (if you enjoy these types of games)  personally, ive always liked science-fiction more, so i prefer fallout (and wish and hope with all my dreams, and heart, and spirit, and love, and emotion, and thought, and being, and essence, and soul that fo76 follows more the ESO route) 
---
 as someone described in another comment, eso can and has, successfully found a way to cater to all kinds of different playstyles, but they've also had the tremendous advantage of time to get to this point.  the mtx in the shop are a little egregious and arguably a subscription is necessary (craft bag, ftw!) but still pretty damn good game.
---
It's not even worth doing it, I won't bother with it.  
---
Bethesda fix your game.
---
In another words, part of the problem.
---
I've been running fort defiance for the dresses. It's usually got legendaries (two) one of the bos side and one on the other side and I've already got two green and forest dress and only been server hopping 3 days. It's full of food and ballistic ammo too.
---
I was thinking egging or toilet papering them.  That's the usual deal with Mischief Night.
---
Sure I like free stuff, but I am not sure what benefit Bethesda would get.
---
I‚Äôm sorry, but it most certainly does change things. You don‚Äôt get to disqualify data because it‚Äôs inconvenient to your argument. 
---
Grinding is a choice. I‚Äôve never once made more than a cursory effort to complete Atom challenges and I‚Äôve accumulated and spent thousands. I‚Äôve never purchased Atoms outside of the outfit+50% bonus atoms bundles they offer every few months. 
---
Your argument is that an 1800 Atom item costs $18‚Äì1cent per Atom. That math is wrong, exactly for the reasons stated above. No player is actually paying 1 cent per atom. The fact that you feel that the prices are too high doesn‚Äôt mean you get to ignore concrete mathematical factors. 
---
If you refuse to acquire a single in-game Atom and refuse to buy Atoms at a discount, then sure, the prices would be high. However, the fact that I‚Äôve played this game damn near every day for a year and have only spent an additional $40 on it‚Äîwhile acquiring every cosmetic item I‚Äôve been interested in‚Äîindicates otherwise.
---
Better passthrough counsuita would be nice also.
---
I kinda like that it‚Äôs so rare. End gaming depends on elusive items.
---
In the grand scheme, the plan isn‚Äôt very useful. You can do everything in the game without it, minus completing your chemist badge. It‚Äôs fun that it‚Äôs so rare, though.
---
It‚Äôs more of a personal thing for most. But hey, to each his own.
---
Thanks! There‚Äôs a lot to explain on ESO! With a dozen+ DLC deals and the world being so big it‚Äôs hard to describe! 
---
Biggest tip I can give you though is before you scrap any item in the selection make sure it can‚Äôt be researched! I made this mistake early on. 
---
You can scrap items that belong in sets and even sell them however many items you can research which later on you may need when crafting a certain set you want and learning the traits and builds. 
---
Research depending on what it‚Äôs for and item wise for just one item can be 30 days! Yes, 30 real world days! 
---
Depending on skills in those lines like blacksmith, woodworking you may only be able to research 1 item at a time... later you should be able to do 3. 
---
That‚Äôs a huge time factor so I wanted to mention that! 
---
Daily quests are also important since it gives you inspiration which increases your level in those areas.
---
ill add you later always looking for people to play with
---
Seems interesting. Wonder what exactly will count as a costume? Does the Sheepsquatch mascot suit count? 
---
There is no way we will kill 14 million in 4 days.. :(
---
Yeah but there was a paintball gun people pulled out of the dev room so I was hoping :(
---
Not even close dude..
---
 I love how I spent the first 15 years of my life in Morgantown, yet have no idea what the hell you‚Äôre talking about. Are you from the southern area that‚Äôs more rural and full of poverty?
---
See my comments below.
---
Yes, that's been reported as well.
---
Thanks for the tag! I've reported this to the Dev's.
---
The legendary exchange machines outside of train stations allow you to turn in unwanted legendaries for scrip, which is a special currency used exclusively at the Purveyor.  The Purveyor is a vendor located at the Berkeley Springs train station northwest of Harper's Ferry.  You can go there to spend your scrip on new, random legendary items.
---
+ karma
---
not with that attitude :P

I get that survival mode wasn't the game mode you wanted. I'm glad the parts of the game you love still exist for you, I wish my favorite part still existed. I think we'll just have to agree to disagree here, my experiences in survival mode PVP just don't line up with what you are saying and I'm tired of writing essays.
---
I had fun killing a 50 radstag heard in the toxic Valley, I would love to see more
---
I want the budget cost of conduits cut in half...  they cost way too much when compared to wires and connectors.
---
Thank god. I personally hate the scorched and SB. The only interesting part IMO is when a SB scorches a random enemy and they become part of the hive mind.
---
The bummer is that i have always played on PCs.  I never liked controllers and havent had a game console since Super Nintendo.  Lol.
---
I see that.  But all this would do is create a black market player economy that would only serve to hurt Bethesda in the long run.
---
What if there was a different server type we could opt into. Like when picking between Adventure and NW there would be an option for a PVP focused mode.
---
I say this because I don't believe Bethesda has the ability to implement something like you are proposing. The client doesn't even know if your base is occupied when you pick a server, let alone who's on the server. 
---
I also know that even if you block a player you still end up on their server from time to time. That's because Bethesda do want have the ability to differentiate.
---
In conclusion I like your idea but I think the easiest way to implement something like that would be to give the players the option when they start playing. We could call it Hardcore Mode.
---
Well FO changing the quests from being area triggered to being set off every once in a while have made the game a ghost town for me now...   I've just been trying to get possum badges for a bigger backpack and I feel like I'm clocking in at work.
---
I grew up in Morgantown, so that was my first destination in the beta
---
Oh, was there?  I didn't hear that.  Cool.  That'd be a nice little addition to the game.
---
Anyone have a list of clothing that will count?
---
Lots of games have fishing these days. Warframe and ESO come to mind, but there are several.
---
should have been J3S-7R
---
Man wrote a paragraph on reddit because he got killed by a players in a open PvP zone he claimed  :') The fallout community is baffling sometimes.
---
I feel like it is you who are missing most of the points.
---
also, i accidentally kept using the scouts camera instead of the camera *mode* (from the map menu)
---
I've been clearing out Morgantown Airport (plus the Collision Course event) and Big Bend Tunnel during each session. If you still have any "Kill Scorched with X weapon" Atom challenges, now's the time to do them!
---
Well, let's hope they learned from Fasnacht and the loot tables are better for the rewards.  Seems like they did ok with Meat Week, though the lack of plans for Tenderizer and Red Firework was lame.
---
All the suggestions in the answers are useful, but - yeah - HRF are the rate-limiting ingredient in crafting stable flux for me, too.
---
that patch 14 looks mighty fine!
---
I generally dont like this phrase but, dont hate the player hate the game. Beth took away the pvp game mode and a lot of people think NW sucks, so killing workshop ppl is all they got. 
---
Also you were literally in an open pvp zone with no idea how to pvp so theres that
---
If the eyebot isn't orange..
---
Get another character to 50 and mule the scrip in the icebox at berkly.
---
Thanks for the quick responses
---
14 million kills in the time that's left is a big ask, but ready the snipers, get the heavy gunners to hold the line and throw the melee right into the close quarters. 
---
We'll keep decorating Applachia with the remains of the Sorched!
---
So, would an asbestos backed tin ceiling block radiation from radstorms?
---
&gt;I get that survival mode wasn't the game mode you wanted. 
---
 It obviously wasn't what the majority of players wanted.
---
 If it were it would still be up and running.
---
Whoever was in charge of the survival mode rules  completely dropped the ball and was completely out of touch with the playerbase.
---
It's a bit of an opportunity for some graffiti on your tour of mischief &gt;:)
---
How is more player engagement for a game like this a bad thing? Fo76 only survives and gets improved as long as enough people are playing. I can understand the criticism when it comes to games that rely on micro transactions and loot boxes as the primary business model, but not here.
---
Hm, the only part that's ubsurd to me is that the character models don't actually get naked. As if nudity was somehow worse than ultra violence... wtf puritans?
---
I ran a bloodied swing speed melee build and a bloodied explosive rifle build for a while. Both did high damage but nuke zones were miserable since your life is so low. I‚Äôve recently started a junkies rifle build and I‚Äôm loving it. Still high damage but I get to run full health instead of 20%.

 "because they don't want a fair fight" 
---
u hit the nail on the head there!
---
I tried running melee a few times but by the time i close the gap im already almost dead
---
I‚Äôll have to check this out. Thanks
---
Haha I've been thinking the same thing.
---
The maps are about the same size, both somewhere in the range of 35-40 km^2. Also, both have hundreds of locations. I do agree though that the [world map](https://game-maps.com/Fallout-76/img/Fallout-76-Map-of-Appalachia.jpg) and level design are pretty low on the list of things I would complain about in Fallout 76.
---
Just started doing challenges. Pretty fun, I just wish they all worked. Those glitches are frustrating, along with the impossible plasma grenade plan.
---
I do a bog standard rate per star regardless of weapon/armor which is 250. I then remove 100c for bad rolls (bash damage etc) regardless of level and they always sell. I know what is or isn't popular so stuff I know I can I'll mark up. I've sold level 20 3* rubbish for 750c easy. What is a personal peeve of mine is people just dropping legendaries that they don't want instead of putting them in a suitcase or just giving them to someone. They despawn and it's just such a waste imo someone out there always needs the scrip or even low level players need a stock to get them started or whatever. So yeah I believe there is a market in it regardless of level lol. I also hoard as my little girl plays with us sometimes to build and she's only level 12 so anything in the level 10-20 range that's anyway decent gets snapped up by me usually.
---
I‚Äôm not even buying anything from the damn shop regardless until they fix the game from constantly crashing.
---
For items that are just laying around (world items, not container items. containers are the 20 hour cooldown), they respawn once you've looted 180 other world items. I don't have much time to play during the week, so I just login to hit a few farming spots for acid and try to do some daily challenges. The world items I pickup don't respawn until the weekend when I run around more and loot other locations. If you do something similar, this may be your issue. Hope this helps
---
I leave my radio on when server hopping, spawns fall from the sky the same time the radio loads in.
---
Lmao rip
---
I would much rather strip naked with my fellow vault dwellers than have to take a picture of someone wearing a rare outfit while tuned into the hunter hunted radio and fighting a zetan on top of the white spring resort
---
Hey! Is there any more details on what kind of costumes and masks we can wear for this? Cheers!! ;)
---
Computational needs for camp placement requires 3D border analysis  for up to 23 zones each time another client asks if this is a good server for them - it is extremely nontrivial task.
---
Computational needs for my suggestion is storing a number in the range of 0-24 as one of servers "headers", and looking for another server if this number is greater than 4. This is one "if" operation that compares tiny integers. Each time you shoot a bullet, it strains the server dozen times more.
---
the issue here with your argument is that Beth constantly vaults stuff and this creates a sense of urgency, sure it is a valid commercial tactic I have no arguments really but they are adding items, doesn't matter if you like that said items or not, in a pace so fast that it is simply not possible to get them all if you don't buy atoms. you don't have to get them all, you might not want to get them all, but my point is; you objectively *can't* get them all.
---
again, I am on the fence about atom shop stuff (supporting cosmetic stuff even the Invader, against QoL stuff just because they promised), but saying atoms can be earned ingame is a strawman. to access every single content f76 can offer, you have to pay some extra cash at some point. which is normal I guess as they've been adding many free stuff too.
---
I agree, i got frustrated with the atom rewards, and the challenges were consistently based around things that just weren‚Äôt fun, and i didn‚Äôt want to spend any more money for atoms until at least wastelanders
---
"No one has the right to bitch about this game anymore!" Also op "I'm going to lowkey bitch about this game!"
---
Nice find, sellout
---
Charleston Capitol is a freaking great place to farm 3 stars! Every time I clear those floors, I walk out with at least one legendary.
---
Cool.
---
Was hoping for actual screenshots of new upcoming costumes but that means more surprise for us. I assume it's starting on the 15th?
---
You gotta be in third person and you gotta be really sneaky. You can't run. People's ears are tuned to noise in NW. Its mostly for fun. I know im at the disadvantage. However its really satisfying when people miss with there weapon and are panicking reloading and WHAMMY! :)
---
I have a few hundred kills with it and can honestly say I've used vats for every last one of them. So no i haven't experienced this.
---
I did have that problem in fo4 tho with modded in guns
---
I've been told that there are over 300 items that will count, including Fasnacht masks as the article mentioned, Mistress of Mysteries and other Unstoppables outfits, etc. I'll look into the Sheepsquatch suit, but my initial gut feeling is yes.
---
The hats are all static spawns just like the straight jackets üëçüèΩ
---
You can somewhat create this effect everytime you nuke white springs. Spawn at the golf resort, throw a grenade and run, through the first section of houses, grenade the last House on the next row of houses (where there is usually a glowing one when it's not nuked) jump on the bus outside the carpark and blow the cars. You should have the full of whitesprings, the glowing ones seems extremely perceptive and providing you keep to the ground initially you can get them all on the main road around the carpark. Not as many as the respawn you got but it sure feels like 50 when your doing it. Best done when no one else is running white springs and no sneaking of course.
---
But is it a rare spawn?
---
You can place conduits on the floor then place any wall over top to work as a pass through :)
---
I'd say a disembodied eye paint job would also be acceptable.
---
Wow.  We're really going to have to go HAM to make the last stretch goal in four days.
---
When does this new event take place?
---
Absolutely it's not 100% not even close, but nothing worth rage quitting over imo.
---
I don't think the majority of the playerbase would ever be happy with an open PvP game mode regardless of the details. Every game I've played that has open world PvP has a slew of pve players complaining about it for one reason or another. And most of the complaints are the same (griefing, unfair mechanics, and gear when applicable). It's almost a copypasta at this point.
---
If they want to be clear about it it will be on the questlist on screen when you start the event as an optional objective.
---
Exactly.
---
I recorded myself encountering a horde of rads radstags nothing amazing but my tse minigun had fun.
---
It is in the post. It starts the 29th.
---
It isn‚Äôt Econ 101. It‚Äôs really more like marketing 303. Making the items placeable at other camps will increase the value of the item to the customer. Right now a lot of people gripe that that the value isn‚Äôt worth the cost. Really how many beds do you need. But people love collect stuff. Look at all the worthless bears for sale in vending machines. ‚ÄúOhh that‚Äôs a plan I don‚Äôt know but I have to have it even though I won‚Äôt use it ever‚Äù  these are the people Bethesda is making the money off of. This is the motivation of  a large portion of their buyers. They want to collect stuff and show it off to others. What better way to show off then placing the item in other camps. 
---
Now all this really depends on the ratio of customers Bethesda has. If the look at the sales figures and see patterns that indicate a large portion of sales go to repeat customers vs the occasional customer then this change might increase sales because it would increase the perceived  value. 
---
Neither economics nor marketing is ever simple.
---
Still server lag is the only thing stopping me from farming it. I been through it , the fighting / killing part is fun enough. Waiting 30 seconds for the game to respond.,to each individual door , terminal etc, kills my desire to farm it.
---
Just open and close VATs.  I know its a work around but much better than gun fire
---
Moss town is also where I kill Scorched. It's got a fissure that spawns Scorch Beast an tons of Scorched. For higher lvls but with my bloodied build I clear them all out quickly.
---
No, just the outfits themselves are, the hat colors all spawn the same each time
---
This event is staged at the arguably most nuked location on the map. We can't wear costumes in PA or Hazmat. Technically the event can be completed at 1/2 speed out of costume, so we've got that going for us, which is nice.
---
Nuclear Winter coop vs waves of monsters pls
---
Ok ty
---
Offer a handy to a ghoul?
---
lock and load!
---
Don't forget that until october 3rd people were also occupied with Meat Week, as well as the final 4 days include a weekend. It's going to be tight, but it might be doable :-).
---
Was hoping to stock my Vendors with costumes from now till when the event begins. ;)
---
Time to hit the Purveyor while that 25% sale is going on...
---
I know what I'm focusing on tonight!
---
Yeah... I have my home on the acid farm near top of the world pretty much just to smelt what I get from farming breach and clear. It's alot. Still no grenade plans...
---
It is a different type of world from Skyrim, just like Fallout 4's mostly urban environment is also different. There are still many interiors, some of which are fairly large and complex, but the focus seems to be on more unique structures in the overworld. Also buildings that can be entered without a loading screen, like Grafton Steel.
---
The real reason why people complain about the map is in my opinion the lack of narrative and living NPCs to make the locations memorable, and that the gameplay loop is overly focused on grinding legendaries and XP, rather than quests and story. So, many of the long time players just farm the same few places like West Tek over and over, and forget about how much there really is on the map.
---
Yeah, either that or add more challenges that pay more atoms
---
It should still be possible to wear a costume in the nuke zone and have it count for the event by replacing your Power Armor Helmet with a costume hat.
---
Thank you.
---
(Lack of) radiation storms
---
Just wanted to add that I did the event for the third time last weekend and it worked fine for me (on PC). Quest pops up on the screen, three locations already marked on the map, etc., etc. After the analyzer did its thing, a brief pause and then I got the regular rewards. So, it doesn't appear to be broken across the board (I had read about the same problem before I did it). I know this helps exactly no one, but I'm just adding this info for diagnostic reasons.
---
I heard you still need a plasma grenade plan for yourself. I happen to have one. I love that you went out of your way to help a friend. You can have it. Mr.drama is my ign. I'll send you a request and drop it off free of charge :p.
---
"  Survival. "
---
sit down.
---
People actually logging in, lol.
---
I agree with that.
---
It would make me feel better about logging in for sure. Especially until they fix jet packs. A little compensation for never fixing the game.
---
There's a medical supplies place I've been adding into my run for a legendary sheepsquatch that spawns there quite often.. braxons medical supplies?
---
have not had a glowing mass drop for me in 3 months...lol
---
I have found lots of work arounds, but we should not have to glitch things.  There was a mod for fo4 that had some very nice passthrough options.
---
Only the Sheepsquatch Mascot Head and Outfit count as costumes.
---
The Imposter Sheepsquatch Helmet and Outfit and the Baaaad News Billy Head and Suit do not.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/lt8mKq3](https://imgur.com/a/lt8mKq3)
---
And also agreed to the pvp by accepting the pop up when claiming the workshop. You got it people are very baffling at times
---
Why not start the event earlier? Running it after Halloween just seems meh.
---
I don't think they have genitals lmfao
---
The few nuke zones I‚Äôve run I average 4. With the green thumb perk I gather 74858372626 raw flux and it all goes in the trash
---
Are you taking about the sound loop bug or something else?
---
Sweet I wanted that to be my costume for this time since I got it.
---
Some log cabin walls instead of planks would be nice!
---
Just grab a cheap tesla an tag em all.
---
But what about the people that don't use Power Armour?
---
I tend to value gear at 15 caps per point of scrip, so if I have a lower level 3 star weapon that I think someone else will like I'll put it in my machine for 600. If no one buys it after a couple days or if I run out of stash space I'll scrip it.
---
Seems like a fair system. I either get an easy 600 caps or 40 scrip, and a low level player gets a nice weapon at a price they can afford.
---
Voluntarily paying extra and getting mad about it is kind of nonsensical
---
I died a lot at first using melee. Now I use ranged weapons.
---
Try to complete it while in a team. Had the same problem myself.
---
I spend atomic points because I earn them from challenges. Stopped spending money 2 months ago
---
good god, I kill hundreds every day...
---
I‚Äôm not following your post.   What is the ‚Äúit‚Äù?
---
A script limit prevents me from playing the game longer than 1 hour a day
---
Don't take a workshop. It's THAT simple. "Local Raiders" think  workshops are only meant for pvp. So don't give them a chance, if you don't want to fight. They don't care.  "It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear." And it‚Äôs not even their fault. If Bethesda were smart enough, they wouldn‚Äôt add such overpowered unbalanced weapons from the very beginning. But they added it and players have the right to use it.  Forced PvP sucs, but that's what you sign up for.
---
Yeah but they look neat
---
I was more or less wondering if you had anything in mind
---
Oh I love this. I actually just learned the other day after a bunch attacked my CAMP (I turned subtitles on) that when they attack they're speaking Chinese. Which makes the red star on them make more sense.
---
I just realised this is what fixed it for me today. I didn‚Äôt connect it with opening VATS, so that‚Äôs good to know. It‚Äôs a simple sound loop bug though so it shouldn‚Äôt be around so long after launch.
---
I mean I rarely do but still I‚Äôd like it if it was cheaper
---
I'm with you on hoping F76 starts to follow the ESO path. A friend and I had been hoping for online Fallout for years. And what we got is disheartening. We wanted to play Fallout with our friends, Bethesda thought that meant against them. 
---
The biggest issues I have with Fallout 76 still exist.  It is not designed for group play. You can make a team but the game just sees it as a collection of individuals. No way to share quests. Even grouped, Dailies can send each of you to different destinations or objectives. If one gets dropped from the server and returns, their quest is gone. And while you can help your friends with their objectives, you'll still get nothing. (Yes, this from experience.)  My friends stopped playing ages ago.  I pop in weekly.  I'm hopeful someday we'll have good reason to team up and try it again. In the meantime, ESO is there for us. Still working our way through Elswyr quests.
---
Congratulations! FINALLY!  I've been following all the posts about this damn plan, and it is awesome that you have a great group of friends in game to step up and help you.  I can only hope that the evil ratbastard who gave the orders to set this plans drop rate at what it is, might read these and stop screwing the player base over.
---
The drop rate of items like this, and the fact they haven't fixed the other possum badges, are the major systemic factors in the game getting such a bad rap.
---
 That ghoul/scorched ‚Äúhoard‚Äù at that white springs was quite the nightmare for me at lvl 40. Drained all my ammo. Had a gattling plasma which helped.
---
There should be like one of these things happening somewhere on the map at all times, making the exploration yielding a chance for these golden finds
---
I'm really curious about nuking and wastelanders interactions, hope you guys figured that one out!
---
I use a similar method, but it's a bit less complicated. One star items are immediately chucked in the scripper because I ain't got sash space for that shit, and all the 2 &amp; 3 stars are priced at 15 caps per unit of scrip, so 135 for 2 star armor up to 600 for a 3 star weapon. 
---
This obviously doesn't apply to things that have actual market value, but it's a good way to make money off of crap like nocturnal fall damage extra durable wood legs.
---
One of the loading screen cards tells you they were deployed by the chineese  before the war started
---
The increased enemy spawns and roaming mobs mods for fallout 4 were my absolute favs. Hordes of enemies fighting each other and me in the middle of them. Would love a similar thing for this game. Need more events like Encryptid.
---
Sorry, but if you really loved this game you'd stop spending so much money on it.  It's whales like you that keep them satisfied with "just getting by" in terms of fixes and improvements.  Why bother  fix their game if people spend tons of money on it in its current state?
---
Plus don't forget the propaganda flyers that some of them have.
---
Huh! I haven't seen that one yet. Good to know
---
I think you are missing my point. My point is we should be talking about the cost in atoms, or talking about the practice of vaulting. Complaining about $ is shifting the conversation away from what are actual things to debate. Saying something is a ‚Äú$7 fridge‚Äù is inaccurate. You can pay extra money voluntarily so you can afford to get that fridge now, but it‚Äôs not a $7 fridge. You paid $7 for expediency. 
---
Yes they create urgency... so what? ‚ÄúYou Objectively can‚Äôt get them all‚Äù. Why should you be able to? I don‚Äôt see this as an issue. 
---
You don‚Äôt need to have every thing ever offered in the atomic shop. Would you ever walk into a physical store and say you need to hve every single article of clothing for sale and be mad when they decide to shift their merchandise? You buy what you can afford and what you need in that given situation. 
---
People need to stop treating the atomic shop like it‚Äôs a place to collect rare gear. It‚Äôs basically a way to voluntarily fund future development. Nothing more.
---
Craft some and use it.
---
Any one want to team up and go for a scorch hunt? Ps4 tonight at 8 est
---
It's not unique. It's happened to others including me. The only way to fix it is to completely close out and re-boot the game.
---
Specifically on the witch herself.
---
I think a game mode that lets you build CAMPS without limits would be amazing.
---
....I am sad now I heard it would be available on console
---
Damn
---
yeah i guess that‚Äôs the new reality. that‚Äôs become the de facto ‚Äúsurvival‚Äù portion of the game. 
---
i still don‚Äôt see how sniping someone with a tse is ‚Äúpvp‚Äù..it‚Äôs more like pvawatse. but then i‚Äôve always considered sucker-punching to be shameful and cowardly. same thing. oh well. 
---
thanks for the feedback.
---
Gotcha, thanks. I was sick of wondering what it was like to Woozie in a fallout game.
---
Something where you can import blueprints from the app would be nice.
---
Now THAT would be a great CAMP item: the Ghoul Juicer!
---
Just imagine a giant freaking blender right in your camp with an attached Mr. Handy robot. When you kill a glowing enemy within your camp, the Mr. Handy collects the body, deposits it in the juicer, and voila: freshly pressed high radiation fluids!
---
Yum!
---
And no Presidential Gauss rifle yet
---
I think we should be able to build things that we have in common at most. Say if me and my team mate both have a deathclaw topiary, i should be able to build it for him.
---
Yooooo! Good looking out!
---
Do you really think you will be able to nuke after wastelanders? makes no sence gameplay wise... you will have separate game modes... Year1 adventure mode servers and Year 2 adventure mode server, no nukes... but the "Boss" migth be inside a VAULT where you have to run a "Silo" to open the doors.
---
The problem is that these studios are sub-divisions of the bigger studios and they refuse to give proper funding because they want minimum cost in development (true development) and an influx of profit. The cost of servers are minimal. Development is the big cost in any game. If you're running on your own engine it's cheaper. Licensing is a factor. Imagine how much money they spent in advertising for release.
---
The only thing I hope for is that the money is actually going into developer's pockets instead of head honcho's pocket if the greed outweighs the funding.
---
Let me use a metaphor to better explain my point. 
---
Say I have a car for sale. I tell you if you drive me to work every day for a month, you can have the car for free! If you want the car now and don‚Äôt want to drive me, you can pay me $20,000. 
---
How much does my car cost? The answer is not a simple one and saying it‚Äôs 20k is disingenuous.
---
I know right! You've got to put in the groundwork if you want to get to the fun stuff. Hopefully they didn't buy it first before they tried the milk.
---
We need the concrete walls from Fallout 4.
---
if you take a workshop the you want to pvp
---
Of course!
---
You are doing the Lord's (Johnny Moreno's) work.
---
I have always used ranged, I just have this annoying habit of getting mobbed.  Worst is SQB fights, though now I only run them half bloodied with my Zealots prime Handmade, that has helped a bunch.
---
Upvote for the awesome story and for both of you getting this basically unicorn esque plan lol, and I hear you on the friendships made playing this game, if it wasn't for the people iv'e met during this time in the wasteland I probably wouldn't still be playing. Hell I even found my new green guy because of one of my friends met playing in fallout that lives in the same state I do, that and this is me and my gf's first fallout together, she's spent countless hours in skyrim but this was her first fallout. so for all its bugs, and the wrongs that Bethesda has done to all of us, you guys are what makes me keep playing and im sure alot of you feel the same &lt;3 
---
See you all in the wasteland
---
Alright, thanks I'll start looking there, too.
---
Surface to Air when it is up tends to produce a good amount of scorched.  Nuke Prime Fissure, etc..
---
That's what I've been doing all week, people are buying faster than I can make or get them lol
---
weekend plz :D easy goal :D lets go!

I never got that firework, that was the only thing I was missing from both.runs of meat week
---
Fucking lol
---
Communism must be...ERADICATED !
---
Same reason some car guys spend a lot to eeck out just a little more they really don't need.  Because they can.
---
I sell any legendaries I don't want for 750.  It's too high for some gear and to low for other but it got to tedious to try and come up with a fair price for each piece.  I pull out enough each day to use the full scrip budget typically taking the stuff that's been there several days or that I know is overpriced.
---
When I come across a low level legendary (below level 15) I'll hold onto it in my pipboy and give it to the first low level person I find.
---
Don't care anymore about bethesda's events. I will probably buy all items offered during that time from every vendor available.
---
Once you have it I‚Äôm 150% certain the drop rate increases.
---
Sadly, XBone, but thanks for the offer!
---
So salty. I loooooove it. You know a post like this makes me excited to get on take your caps and loot.
---
Challenge accepted.
---
I found nuke cards at a player vendor so I‚Äôve been farming the queen, and I‚Äôve noticed that most servers have one or two nuke zones around fissure prime, so people are definitely contributing. Between every one of my launches I‚Äôve had to skip a few servers to find one that didn‚Äôt have locked silos, and I‚Äôve even launched within seconds of someone else launching.
---
some hilarious responses in here suggesting i‚Äôm a dumbass. 
---
did you read the post? it‚Äôs not really a complaint about pvp but about the chickenshit way people do it. too nuanced for you?
---
Love it now smash them

I'd love to hear all your thoughts.
---
I‚Äôm down for China and everything but it don‚Äôt really fit with fallout, *THEY NUKED US*
---
Isn't traditional fallout a top-down isometric view with turn based combat?
---
So by that rationale Fallout 3 and New Vegas also don't count as real Fallout games and that there hasn't been a 'real' Fallout in how long now?
---
If you play alone, I‚Äôd suggest an instigating explosive lever action rifle, and for tougher enemies, either a bloodied dragon and then switching to something else to finish it off, also make it a sneak build so you get either 2.5x damage or 3.75x damage, with all that in mind I get roughly 2000 damage on my instigating lever action (non explosive)
---
That is a pipe dream. They still haven't fixed bugs from launch lmao
---
LeT mE pLaY tHe GaMe My WaY

Not for me in NV. For NV, I figured out which ones were permanent buffs (the ones that were also in FO3) and which ones weren't (all the new ones), consumed the permanent ones and sold the non-permanent ones.
---
I'm super hyped about this. Seasonal events are fantastic. Meet you all at the 19th hole on the 29th.
---
I agree, i agree, i agree.
---
i harden my workshops with mad missile turrets and build concrete defenses around me and my workbenches and even the workshop itself but if i go out in the open i get one-shot. a) why don‚Äôt my turrets even look up? and b) don‚Äôt you have to physically contest a workshop (i.e. touch it) to instigate pvp? 
---
that‚Äôs what i thought. hence my frustration at being picked off from afar.
---
If you don't mind me asking, what you selling, and how much for? Only thing I'm lacking is the Witch Hat plan.
---
a little
---
Not.. us...
---
I never once got the impression it was meant to be traditional during all the marketing so i never really understood the complaints.
---
The ClothingTypeCostume keyword is being added to a bunch of things in Patch 14 for this event, so this should change!
---
I noticed most Fallout songs are about companions and relationships.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt it Be Nice and A Good Man Is Hard to Find are some examples.
---
I suppose you're right. 
---
I guess I meant it's not a Bethesda Fallout game. I was introduced to 3 first, so to me that's a traditional Fallout. 
---
I have played the originals each once before just to see how they are and they're great in what they are.
---
Yup. The ratio of flux to HRF sux. It's why I haven't put a prime receiver on my bloodied LMG.
---
Fallout 76 was supposed to be for the Fallout franchise what Elder Scrolls Online was for the Elder Scrolls franchise. The problem was that Fallout 76 was too limited and could be finished in a few months, whereas Elder Scrolls Online requires a few years to finish everything.
---
Exactly my thought! Thank you!
---
Yeah bloodied is easy to die as well, but once you get the hang of it you die less. Most of my deaths happen due to my first hits not registering even tho it shows damage numbers. 
---
Honestly the one shooting doesn't bore me, it evens out with the ease of death and with the new public event system I rarely lose junk.
---
I try to always sell mine so it's not a complete waste
---
I could be wrong. You could always shoot the mod group a message. They are pretty active on social media.
---
Yeah well if that login reward would go straight to the Atomic Shop they wouldn't need to bother. Have logged in daily for a week straight and haven't been able to access the Atomic Shop a single time, it just sits there greyed out with a loading icon next to it.
---
agreed. i don‚Äôt know, i guess because for the last several months workshops were places you could go set up, develop, and serve the community with materials and workbenches while nibbling away at some ingredient deficit. and capturing them instigates defending events that benefit everyone who cares to join in. 
---
i‚Äôm a pacifist when it comes to fellow wastelanders, maybe even an altruist.  we all bring our personalities to the game. i guess that‚Äôs pretty cool.
---
"Skyrim is a gne gne gne, go to gne gne gne". Ahahah, some guys really need to interact with real people
---
40 dmg, roflcopters 114, reg 120, acc, 68.  Second star is 25% faster fire rate.
---
Btw you're going to want to get some good Unyielding gear if you go bloodied as well as the Adrenal Reaction mutation.
---
Or how about not nuking that area during that fuckin week?
---
Anyway, it's been a while since last time I've seen white spring being nuked.
---
put down your TSE and approach me then. otherwise you‚Äôre just another chickenshit hiding behind an overpowered gun. that‚Äôs not a man. not even a cartoon man.
---
But please not with plasma guns. I've been finding spawn locations riddled with plasma goop that prevents respawningfor a long time (or even server reset?). (If I try to server hop, I get usually placed on one of three servers near to me.)
---
You can craft plasma grenades once you read it which are about the best of the grenades IMHO. The only grenade type I don't immediately sell to vendors.
---
Yeah I went to the site a while back and remember seeing it was gunba be available for consolr
---
they openly stated that both scorched and wastelanders storylines will coexist - and nuking is a) part of that story and b) is like the signature event of fo76. there is absolutely no chance they are removing it. things I'm thinking were
---
a) hostile humans in random areas would turn into ghouls  
---
b) since friendly npc encampments will have their own player specific interiors, I'm assuming they'll do something like this; if you don't fast travel directly to that place (for example crashed space station) you'll either see its old form or its sheltered away from harm form. If you do however fast travel to it, you wont experience the nuke maybe? as we know it will create a V94-like effect. 
---
but nah nuking is definitely staying my man
---
agreed but the number of times i‚Äôve been griefed at a workshop has exponentially exploded since survival left. so i‚Äôm here to bitch about it now.
---
Ya Phoenix has it usually.
---
I dont know how you can get by without carrying 15 heavy weapons, 6 rifles, and 30 grenades at all times.
---
Well meathook was the OP unarmed wep that got boosts from unarmed and 1 handed, try remove your 1 handed perks and see if the damage moves. If it doesnt they fixed it.
---
Not this subs too....
---
Well... in the spirit of the 76 Lore... there isn't much, unless...
---
The Corvega Power Armor has its roots in the battle against the commie invasion on our home land.  That is where the initial idea for such a power armor set came into play.  The Military commissioned Corvega to help mobilize their ground troops following a vertibird drop.  And in the mountains (well, rolling hills) of West Virginia, through the Ashe Heap and the Boggs, the standard model foot soldier power armor, while great when it comes to battle, is hindered when the battle is on the move.  The vertibird response is slow and at times cannot land in areas needed.  Enter the Corvega Power Armor... the mobile unit for the power armor fighter.  Its experimental, and as such, was not released beyond R&amp;D.  It's only a rumor... 
---
..but if true, the BOS could really advance through the harsh terrain of WV and help in their fight against the Scorched.  An all terrain power armor could save soldier lives if they needed to bug out of a battle to regroup and re-engage.  With mods it would allow for quick and stealthy recon of scorched locations.  And heavy builds would bring more artillery to the fight against the scorched.
---
But the Corvega plant is riddled with Scorched and the infamous Scorched King (new enemy).  Maybe you have what it takes to gather this power armor upgrade and help in the fight against the Scorched...
---
1. Find evidence of the Corvega Power Armor.
---
2. Find the secret R&amp;D Corvega facility somewhere in the WV Hills.
---
3. Battle your way into the compound through Commie droids set to keep people out while their droid troops take over the facility.
---
4. Fight through the interior of the compound making your way to the nerve center of the facility where the plans can be obtained.
---
5. Fight the Scorched King to gain access to the area (for whatever reason, he has the passkey to the terminal that keeps the plans)
---
6. Download the plans to your pipboy and grab a power armor frame and a couple of pieces to instantly assemble a low grade set of "hot wheels".
---
7. Return to Fort Defience and upload the plans into the mainframe.
---
8. Start building some custom Corvega power armor sets.
---
Sounds like a short side mission, but it can be a little more elaborate.
---
I should write for Bethesda... and apparently WWE, but that is a completely different Redit page.
---
You might be facing higher-level opponents, sometimes I forget that check that
---
Yeah since survival gone you cant get workshops without expecting pvp
---
Let me include that my friends meathooks are working correctly. And the dmg numbers displayed when I look at it in my inventory are also displaying like normal. Could it just be a display number bug?
---
Check your stash
---
I know its staying, just not in Y2 server
---
All of my dmg comparing is against the SBQ
---
I love the shit out of the fallout series and have loved every minute playing this game (yes including the frustrating release), but this is the key difference between my love for fallout 76 and Borderlands 3. In the end, I‚Äôd rather pay for major dlc expansions (smaller dlc like raids and events will still be free in B3) then to have the dlc for free and have to pay for all this little stuff. It‚Äôs just sad that a single skin purchase can be the same as an entire dlc. (It‚Äôs not even some cool glowing destiny shit)
---
Kinda reminds me of rocket league. Game is $20 but I know people who have spent over $500 on chest keys. You can earn them for free but the grind takes awhile to just get one.
---
It would effect Bethesda sales definitely. 1 person could do his mates a favour or 10 people put $1 each and get an item 1 person pays $10 for.
---
I thought that but I am playing with other players using meathooks and theirs are working fine.
---
geez. again, it‚Äôs not PvP i‚Äôm bitching about. It‚Äôs the STYLE. how is one-shotting someone fun? i guess i‚Äôll never understand it.
---
Positive, I was quite angry after spending 5880 caps.
---
why do you still play then?
---
Glad to hear you got the plan. I'm currently grinding for it because the chemist badge is the only one left to do and it is annoying me. I haven't been doing it half as long as you did, yet. I'm hoping luck will soon be on my side.
---
 Approach you any weapon is overpowered one time I ran out of ammo on my BE handmade so I brought out my bloodied pipe rifle and was still getting kills maybe you just dont have a good build
---
Do you know if the Veil of Secrets will count as a costume on its own, or do we need to have the whole thing?
---
I always clean up after myself (take all loot from corpses) to help with that.
---
if 50 caps, an oil can and some spoiled vegetables excites you that much, reevaluate your life.
---
Also everyone don't forget that there are atom challenge goals associated with using certain weapons to kill scorched. That's what I've been doing to make it a bit more rewarding as I do it.

Well as a troubleshoot. Turn off then turn on. Unequip perks, equip perks. Same with armour wep etc
---
[Sorry buddy](http://f4nv.com/faq.html)
---
Big Bend Tunnel is the only way I travel west to east lately just for more scorched kills. And I'm not doing Collision Course very often right now because every time I do, I get empty boxes falling from the sky right behind me or sometimes directly on me every few minutes until I log off. Really difficult to sneak up on anything that way.
---
Try removing all perks cards, server hop and reapply them. I've noticed a few times that some perks were not working and this has helped me
---
Someone sounds jealous?
---
What do you not understand?  I‚Äôm helping your game experience by purchasing micro transactions.  If the game doesn‚Äôt make money how shitty do you think this game will get?  Much shittier than it is now.
---
If your local grocery store doesn‚Äôt sell groceries how long will it stay open?  This is where mummy buys your TENDIES in case you‚Äôre confused.
---
They made a change to the way PA works a few months back.  All your PA peices are in your stash, but the chassiss are empty.  They announced this when it happened.
---
You must have been gone for a few months if you missed this update.
---
Same thing happened to me.  I thought I lost my Ultracite.  But all the peices were still there in my stash, I just had to put them back on the chassiss.
---
*confused growl*
---
Cheers! great story!  Inspired me to write me own. 
---
"...twas around the 5th paragraph, hence that it became evident that the words were mere ramblings, marginalizing the seminal subject by means of cascading non sequiturs betwixt the margins. What could have been spoken in a single breathe was to be strung out in the guise of an interesting story, no doubt a symbolic reference to the authors own plight.  Alas, searching for the TLDR proved as elusive as the Plasma Grenade Plan itself.  One will have to endure the grind of the fisherman's tale to acquire its secrets. Who could have foreseen, Oh Atom, that the OP would provide no insight to locating the plan, but instead would parade their victory as the whining wheel that receives the oil while simultaneously patronizing the young'uns and shoehorning in some self-glorifying story about a Danish blacksmith.   Here my story ends...  the saga of the saga."
---
special thanks to dictionary.com and a slow day at work.
---
I pulled this plan a month ago, and actually came across another copy of it a few days later and threw it in my vendor for  150 caps not knowing it was rare. somebody hit me up later in the day and let me know how rare it was and by the time I got back to my machine it was sold.
---
Haha.....oh man.  Think I‚Äôll go buy another 40 bucks worth.
---
There's got to be some other variable at play. Just eliminate one, you didn't happen to pick up a duplicate and sell the wrong one to a vendor huh
---
I tried weapon swap, armor swap, perk card swap. Tried several different servers throughout 3 separate days. Only things I have not reset is mutations...
---
It sounds to me like life was better when survival mode was still around.
---
Has happened to me several times on ps4. 
---
Had to quit the app to correct it
---
I don't think they need two different game modes, nuking in wastelanders will be fine, but lets say for example your on the settlers side not the raiders, and you nuke a settler camp, they already said there will be some sort of karma based system between the two factions so if you nuke your own faction you get a heavy chunk of karma taken out. boom, balanced and we can still  nuke the queen!
---
Do Lazer guns do this too? I never used them because I have the grounded mutation, but I started using a laser pistol yesterday to get the atoms for killing 76 scorched with an energy weapon and the challenges that follow. I've been looting everything for the piles to scrap and what not, but just curious.
---
Bloatfly Syringer.  Shoot an enemy with it.  When the enemy dies it will usually spawn a bloatfly.  Use the syringer on the resulting bloatfly and repeat.  Result is infinite enemies with a chance to spawn High Rad Fluid.  Our group used this method last night.  It takes time and does get boring, but it works.  Bonus, each bloatfly has a chance to be legendary....we got two last night.
---
Everyone in my group has a hard time finding enough high rad fluid.  It does spawn less than the other two for some reason.
---
I'm almost certain it's *supposed* to be random.  As in, glowing masses, hardened masses and HRF should all drop at the same rate.
---
I started playing the game the day the free period started in June, and for me, except for a brief period where I was getting equal amounts, HRF has always dropped at a rate of about 33 percent as often as the other two.
---
I'm always, ALWAYS, winding up with a surplus of the other two that need to be sold.  If it's not intentional, I wish it was a bug that they would fix.
---
My theory is that it doesn't affect all players, but that there's some issue with the algorithm they are using to randomly generate which nuke components should appear and that for some players (maybe because the seed value they use is tied to a players id number or name or something) continually generates fewer HRF for certain players.
---
I've asked about it on the text chat mod for the PC version and plenty of people swear they get equal amounts of all three.
---
I thought that too. Tried resetting everything but mutations. Have you heard of a particular weapon getting bugged? I haven‚Äôt tried having a buddy use it that might be the next step.
---
I understand as an individual you don't feel the pricing is in-line with your valuations.  You also have to remember that this game, to stay alive, requires dollars for developers, dollars for design/art, dollars for community managers, dollars for project lead(s), dollars for infrastructure (cpu/mem/network), dollars for infrastructure support, dollars for testing (sometimes a few more here would be nice), dollars for 3rd party relationships like sony/MS, dollars for those in the pipeline that I'm missing and lastly (most importantly) dollars for shareholders.  If you don't have all this, you have no game.  They have to walk a fine line between exorbitant and giveaway costs on these items. They have to find that critical mass that meets sales targets at target volumes to sustain their product.  You may not like it and want to run your "don't buy their overpriced xxx for xxx", but in the end if those targets don't get met... well you won't have to worry about the atomic shop anymore.
---
seems to work well for every other part of the game. but duly noted.
---
No but I have seen when I tried to have my trouble shooter meathook on my favorite wheel they would exchange positions on the wheel. Maybe I‚Äôll try storing the other meathook. That‚Äôs a good idea thanks.
---
Bethesda employee: it‚Äôll only be a few more minutes for your update we are still waiting for it to be ported.
---
And it absolutely will not stop until you are DEAD!
---
was the owner in bounds of the workshop? passive does not disable workshop pvp
---
Trapper armor?  It‚Äôs a recent bug.
---
They said you will be working side by side with people doing original questline. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a new server. Nobody knows for sure though
---
Ah, okay, thank you
---
Ya.  I tried last night and it shows a DR increase on the paper doll. Now I‚Äôm not sure how to test it out though...
---
https://imgur.com/a/8sJTbGY
---
Yeah I've had to just dismiss caring about anything in there as I'm not doing chores nor paying money to get cosmetics in a video game. Borderlands 3 blows every competitor out of the water on that front though, so continuing the microtransaction format seems to be AAA publishers just saying "yeah, just go back to Borderlands after a bit."
---
Not useful for console users, but there's a PC [mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/398) that fixes the issue, at least as far as sentry bots are concerned.
---
Granted this is what the daily challenges are for, and some a stupid easy and worth 10-20
---
Bethesda, there is one major problem with this event that needs to be seriously addressed... my social life will be non existent for that week. I‚Äôm just kidding, I don‚Äôt have friends... sniff sniff
---
Many apps on my phone do the same thing.  Get a small ingame coin bonus as a daily reward.  I dont have an issue with the idea.
---
they have to be in the area of the workshop
---
Thanks for trying to help :)
---
And the red star pin they drop.
---
yeah I brought this up about a month ago:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d3awtv/got\_queen\_of\_the\_hunt\_back\_the\_bugged\_it\_wont/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d3awtv/got_queen_of_the_hunt_back_the_bugged_it_wont/)
---
got downvoted (naturally).  There are several folks I know that have this bugged. I have it bugged on a few of my alternate accounts. My main was able to unlock it by running away on foot fast enough for it to skip the computer narrative of "analyzing sample"  etc.  Fast travel doesn't as I'm sure you already know.
---
White Springs.. I feel like this event will spend a good amount of time in a nuke zone..
---
I found Scrooge
---
Says the guy complainin about F76 not being like skyrim ü§£
---
I got 2 fireworks the whole week, they were so rare I haven't used them, figure they'll sell or trade well down the road.
---
This is a great idea!
---
The Veil of Secrets currently counts as a costume on its own.
---
wait, does this include the "rare" (more like unobtainable) Fasnacht masks? winters, jester, goblin and skull?
---
Hum... Id rather see diferent servers... I mean whats the deal with people doing the Y1 quest in a map full of humans...
---
Rev up those dicks!
---
I picked one up in a vendor before just to have it, but I've yet to get it as a random drop.
---
Nah. Fuck China. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I visited Hong Kong in 2015. I absolutely loved it there. The people were so friendly and welcoming and I had an absolutely blast. I hate to see this treatment from the government.
---
Just rest your soul knowing that you made someone else either really happy, or really "rich" - or both, I guess... üòÇ
---
I really don't even know how to work the favorites wheel, but I'm always selling stuff at the vendor so I make sure I list it as a favorite so I don't accidentally sell the wrong one. If you do it'll prompt you "are you sure"
---
I haven‚Äôt played since December, I just follow the subreddit because it‚Äôs entertaining to see people complain every single day about how shit the game still is, and how garbage if a company Bethesda is
---
Vault tec flamer skin- wow this is worthless
---
Yeah thats probably my issue is charging headfirst into a firefight lol
---
I‚Äôll harness my inner Banksy
---
And Vertibirds, and Apache attack helicopters, and m98 main battle tanks.....
---
I'm not saying its an issue my man. 
---
All I'm saying is, if you have not paid real world money for atoms at any point in this game, you have 0% chance to buy everything atom store offers. "again, you don't have to get them all, you might not want to get them all, but my point is; you objectively *can't* get them all." this is not an issue, its a business decision.
---
Thus, if you want to, for any reason, buy everything Bethesda Austin released for this game, you need to pay more than what you payed for the game. Again, not an issue.
---
Atoms are sold in a fashion that core deal grants you 100 x usd. this is done to create an idea that further advantageous deals offer a bang for your buck since if lets say 10 usd is 1000 atoms and 15 usd is 1700 atoms, that creates a positive vibe in the comsumer's mind and this is because we believe that we are getting more than our moneys worth. And our moneys worth, as laid out by the core deal, is 1 USD = 100 atoms. so it could be argued that these items have usd values to them. 
---
These are again just facts, nothing wrong about it. Not a single issue. not an opinion or a manifesto. 
---
now opinion/speculation part: I also believe that beth has some data about actual worth of atoms. like, I have something like 5000 now and I haven't bought any yet, so my atoms worth 0 usd to them. A whale might have bought 20 usd worth of atoms, lets say 2500, and earned 500 ingame, so its 20 usd = 3000 atoms he can spend. using these types of data with other stats like how many people buy PAs, masks, gun skins etc they can literally pinpoint how much an item is actually going to earn and price items accordingly to meet investor demands. 
---
fresh example with made up data: 
---
around 25000 whales buy gun skins weekly if the price is around 400-700 atoms  
---
every week whales pay around 20 usd and get 2400 atoms: 1 usd = 120 atoms  
---
gun skins usually cost 500  
---
thus a gun skin is 4 USD, 100.000 USD net income per gun per week  
---
similar data applies to other stuff like PA skins, decoration items etc and they can have a reliable way to provide info to all possible investors &amp; plan stuff
---
The new content is not replacing the old content.  Everything from before will still be present.  All of the new quests with npcs will be able to be done without completing the original main quest.
---
I don't think it will happen
---
Yeah It‚Äôs not a swap out I only have one bloodied meathook and a trouble shooter but they were swapping spots in the favorite wheel so I unfavorited the trouble shooter but it‚Äôs still in my inventory. I‚Äôll try stashing it maybe it‚Äôs bugging and equipping the wrong one. The dmg would make sense.
---
Awhile? I see it multiple times a day, although since the public event system went into effect I've notice more ppl nuking the Queen than before.
---
It's not a costume, it's armor :(
---
Same problem here on PC with more than one character.
---
What do you think Joe's opinion on the graffiti will be?
---
Medium range recon scope. Should easily work like the binoculars and pearly peepers. 
---
Same range as a medium scope but toggling them swaps the range from long, short, back to medium. Functions the same way as recon scopes. 
---
Easy to code and whatnot. Should take no less than a few hours.
---
I agree that nuking the event area is counterproductive, and should be avoided if one were community-minded. However, not all players are as altruistic as we might prefer. Additionally, in my experience, this area is nuked more frequently than any other location, other than "Fissure Prime." Personally, I had no idea PA-without-helmet offered the same rad-resistant properties as a full suit of PA. Definitely gonna try it out tonight.
---
‚ÄúI was PvPed while standing in a PvP Zone! How!?‚Äù
---
Congratulations! You played yourself!
---
[deleted]
---
so about the plasma mine plan...
---
I love NW.  I am on PC.  However, Betheada is little wither on the vine as hackers are becoming more blantant in their behavior and nothing is being done about it.
---
No it just isn't possible
---
I believe sales become active for different things during different days of the week.
---
If it was so easy, every game out there would support it, the reality is different. The consent is that SLI for gaming is stupid.
---
Just a short google search will tell you that.
---
SLI is perfectly fine for workstation tasks, but thats about it.
---
Thanks :)
---
This is exactly the kind of information what I was looking for. Thank you!
---
It needs to dissapear more like. This is fucking Fallout - Does that not count for anything anymore?!
---
Since there are more Atom Shop apologists on this subreddit than not, I'm fully aware my response will likely be down voted into oblivion, but expect the following replies (and my response to those replies) every time you say something even the slightest bit negative towards the Atom Shop:
---
&gt;You could just grind for atoms in game. 
---
Because that's what I bought the game for was to grind and not to go explore, have fun, and maybe occasionally get the pleasant surprise of a few free Atoms.
---
&gt;You're a penny pincher. 
---
How dare I not be rolling in money, be responsible with what money I do have, and put my bills higher on the priority list than the Atom Shop?! 
---
&gt;You're just complaining because you're poor.
---
And you're announcing to the world that you're apparently rich as fuck. Someone has to dig the six foot holes nearly all of us eventually get buried in. Sorry the ditch diggers don't get paid as well.
---
&gt;You don't have to buy it. 
---
I don't, true, but only if I have enough time to grind for atoms or I don't want to hear you all complaining that "if you want the game to be more stable, you need to pony up some cash in the Atom Shop." 
---
Which leads me to the next excuse I hear a lot and used to use myself when I was also an Atom Shop apologist. 
---
&gt;The Atom Shop provides the money the devs need to make the game more stable.
---
And yet I kept buying Atom packs and then loading up the game and disconnecting five times in five minutes. I spent a decent chunk of change on that Atom Shop and have yet to see a decent chunk of improvement in the game itself. When they do manage to fix one bug in one place, they create five more elsewhere. 
---
See, I will admit I used to be an Atom Shop apologist just like so many others on this subreddit. 
---
Now I'd like a refund on my purchases.
---
Yea and obtainable through a quest so it cant be owned immideatly like they did with the backpack.
---
LIBERTY PRIME ONLINE, DESTROY ALL RED CHINESE COMMUNIST
---
Thanks btw I now have frog legs thanks to you and this post. I can say the fun factor literally jumped about about 50 % hehe :D
---
I‚Äôll see you on the 9th green at 9. Oh and Banshee... dress nice eh.
---
If you have two of the same weapon type on the favorites wheel it might give you the wrong one when using the wheel to select it. Been a bug forever now with multiple of the same weapon types. Yeah store one and check them each separately I guess.
---
Remember that Ms. nanny looking for people we a recon scope for her research? Yeah make her the one to give the new scope.
---
This is correct, for the sales tab at the end, each day a new one of those is the sail, in my experience its in order too.
---
This is a survival game not a arcade game
---
Now I name stuff "sell" and you can have more than one thing with the same name
---
Oh my god, my grandparents had this in their basement. Haven't thought about that in probably 20 years.
---
This game was rushed into existence to provide Bethesda with an internet revenue stream to fund the next gen games they are working on. It's not fully developed. It's not made cell by cell with loving craft like earlier titles. It's definitely not anywher near the detail of Skyrim. But there has never been a fallout game that came close to it either. The number of quests on fallout 4 was seriously smaller than Skyrim. The legendary rolling system replaced individual legendary items that  artists and concept designers toiled over to make. I hated the system on fallout 4 and this game has made it worse. So, all being said Bethesda have conned fans with a false premise and geared everything on this game to profit from the atom store (recycled fallout 4 items) to fund Starfield and Elder scrolls development. That's why the dungeons suck mate.
---
Most of the DLC was only worth it for what it added to the settlement building. Also I ended up giving the guy who ran the experiments in the vault dlc a better job elsewhere.
---
I think I spend 8 or 12K caps on the BOS combat armor plans at a player vendor literally the day after Bethesda put them at the Grafton Vendor for under 200...
---
They drop a red star pin?
---
You don‚Äôt know anything about PvP apparently. I have played since Day 1 and logged more hours than I care to share and I have done one Hunter/Hunted with my friends. That‚Äôs it. No one plays hunter/hunted. I used to queue up for it all the time. Now, I only do when I see someone else does and I have never gotten 4 people. On PS4.
---
I visited there for new years in 2008 and had a great time. I just exchanged $100 USD, got off at Admiralty Station, and just wandered around until I was too tipsy/sleepy to function.
---
Really?  Lol okay that's hillarious.  If raids ever really become a thing you're going to have groups of Hardcores requiring people to have tattered mole heads for the hardest modes.  If only it made squeaky noises while they ran or something ü§£
---
Well dang, I found the plans the other day in the room at the northern part of the broken bridge south of Flatwoods.  I remembered hearing something about them but had no idea they were in such demand so I just read them like any other.  I would've gladly traded them for disco ball plans.  ‚òπÔ∏è
---
Yea thats a good idea.
---
Yes. Sound loop bug.
---
Why should everyone cater to your play style?  I don't PvP except in NW but if I did, I imagine I'd play like I do with mobs - trying to snipe dead before they reach me.
---
I take workshops and I don't stick around much.  I lock my stuff and only go back to collect.  If someone wants to steal it, I let them and sometime steal it back.  Because I don't care for PvP.
---
But expecting everything to walk up to you and say hey let's fight is so ridiculous and unrealistic.
---
Go craft in your house.
---
Sale is activated one by one on each item everyday, starting from the left item in the sales section. They're there alltogether just for you to see the whole order of the ongoing sales and to maybe save up atoms for the thing you want
---
&gt; see if i want to pvp (hint: i don‚Äôt) 
---
Pro tip: don't go in pvp zone then.
---
Got one from prevayor after about 7 tries. Best bet is to get to that 1000 scrip and help out with getting to that 50% off. Or pay a lot on a marketplace.
---
That‚Äôd be a nice play on words if Beth did that.
---
Scorched are also always crawling around Poseidon in Charleston.  Clear them from the outsides and rooftop, then go into the cooling towers and the plant itself.  Once they're wiped out, travel over to the AVR Medical Center and wipe out all the bastards there as well.   Fast travel to Helvetia to wipe some more out and maybe hit Bolton Greens while you're in the area. After that, head to Morgantown Airport and Big Bend (per OP's suggestion) and you'll have a pretty decent Scorched run.
---
Yeah, the scrip machine.
---
&gt; This is a survival game 
---
Lol. No it's not.
---
Yeah, PvP and PvE are drastically different. You can literally get to level 50, equip non legendary crafted gear, use any perks you want, and still be fine in PvE. This is not true in PvP.  
---
Go hide in your bunker, Enclave wuss! Raiders have taken back the Wasteland and there isn‚Äôt crap you can do about it!

&gt; You also have to remember that this game, to stay alive, requires dollars for developers, dollars for design/art, dollars for community managers, dollars for project lead(s), dollars for infrastructure (cpu/mem/network), dollars for infrastructure support, dollars for testing (sometimes a few more here would be nice), dollars for 3rd party relationships like sony/MS, dollars for those in the pipeline that I'm missing and lastly (most importantly) dollars for shareholders.
---
None of this changes the items being overpriced.  They could be priced more fair and I would actually want to buy something.  As it stands, I don't value a power armor skin as $12.
---
Sometimes I feel like I'm being trolled by the number of goo or ash piles I'll find, but then I remember that the servers might run for 12 hours or more without being restarted and that it only takes a single energy weapon kill on a body that doesn't get completely looted to generate a permanent goo or ash pile that prevents that enemy from respawning for any players in the future.
---
I think a great number of people who use energy weapons don't even know about the bug.  Is it possible Bethesda still doesn't know?  I wish they would remove the piles altogether as a stop gap measure.
---
I don't think it will get done especially with a lot of people not playing rn because of the screw up of the event system and there really isn't much left to do
---
Let me use an example to better explain my point.
---
Say I buy $10 worth of atoms and get 1100.  Then I redeem an item for 1100 atoms.  I just spent $10 on it.  Getting 30 atoms from daily challenges doesn't change the fact I spent $10 on atoms and bought 1 overpriced item for $10 worth of atoms.
---
It's not paying extra.  It's paying the exact price.  Just because I get 30 atoms from daily challenges doesn't change the fact the item costs $10 worth of atoms and I just spent $10 on it.  It's overpriced.
---
Much as I don't mind someone buying something cheap from my vendor to sell for more caps elsewhere, I have a vendor full of stuff priced five to twenty-five caps specifically meant to help low levels and I probably don't want to know how many times that high level person who just bought a bunch from that machine is now planning on selling it for multiple times as much at their vendor.
---
Not that I suspect that's exactly what happened yesterday with the twenty-five cap BOS suit plan. Since I sell all plans at half value or more anyway, that plan would have been no more than twenty-five caps regardless of what vendor I put it in.
---
It‚Äôs in the junk category if I remember right. High level bots seem to have it and Chinese Officer sword plans. Including mods
---
Why don't more people do the daily challenges? I had to beg people to take my photo in Whitesprings yesterday and I couldn't find anyone in formal wear to return the favor.
---
It's insane to be the only person at whitesprings and get a full respawn.  Pretty much the most fun you can have in the game if your character is ready for it.
---
Bonus if you are playing on a server that restarted recently and the area isn't riddled with goo or ash piles that lower the enemy count.
---
Yeah I get that you don't value them as such. Just saying to be prepared that whatever price they land on for things long term will be in-line with  what price "enough" or "most" people will pay. It may not fall into your appetite or budget.
---
Google gobble, one of us
---
Have you investigated Mama Dolce‚Äôs yet?
---
Cool. That would make sense I will try that and let y‚Äôall know if it solves the issue. Thanks for the help.
---
Party Boy never gave addiction immunity in this game. That effect was moved to an overcosted Endurance card, Professional Drinker.
---
I am so glad you finally learned it!!!
---
I think I've finally given up trying to find mine - my search echoes your search so much I feel the pain. it is my last piece for my last badge and I have almost lost desire to play the game at the point and that's honestly one of the reasons. the events don't spawn like they used to and it has almost killed any chance of every seeing it (same goes with other rare dropping outfits and plans like shielded raider underarmor...)
---
We're lucky we're even getting an event. It's still summer for bethesda and they still work on autumn roadmap. Fingers crossed for December
---
Are you on PS4? Between work and the rest of my life I usually make just enough time to do a few daily quests. I‚Äôd be happy to help earn Atoms when it‚Äôs feasible
---
I'll wear my green jacket....seems appropes
---
Good for you? You can read posts here and see a LOT of people have crashing issues.
---
&gt; Your argument is that an 1800 Atom item costs $18‚Äì1cent per Atom.
---
I just said $10 gets you 1100 atoms.  If I bought an 1100 atom item then it cost me $10 because that's how much I spent for it.  I am not wrong.  The power armor skins I've been talking about are 1400 atoms yet I've been generous in giving them an estimate of $12.  That's still too much money for one power armor skin.  Take the free atoms out of the equation.  The item costs about $12 in atoms.  That's too much.
---
I am not arguing for it.
---
Good. And i will have a script to autoload the game get the daily reward and kill the game. Passive profit. Love the idea
---
My ninja does not use the monster because it Is toooooo overpowered.
---
This.  the +15str  you will get from a full set of unyeilding is almost necessary for bloodied melee.
---
Adrenal reaction basically gives everything you own the "bloodied" effect, and since it stacks, this is also a must  have.
---
What? They litterally already pushed everything that isnt Wastelanders to next year.
---
In game protest for Hong Kong needs to happen
---
I probably should have elaborated, New Vegas spoiled me in terms of dlc.  Really Fallout in general.
---
wastelanders is still not 100% to be ready this year though
---
Yeh I noticed how instead of having a translation, the subtitles just say *‚Äùspeaks in chinese‚Äù* lol
---
it shouldn't fall into anyone's budget.  I don't get why people are okay with these prices.  They're too much.  A power armor skin is not worth more than the price of an actual DLC with much more content no matter which way you put it or how many atoms you get for free.
---
Yes it is.
---
This bug is real. And the new popularity of the Gatling Plasma is...rough... I was on a server for over 6 hours and the same goo and ash piles were everywhere.
---
I wonder how canon all this murder of the scorched is going to be.  Are we wiping out the scorched so that Wastelander content will replace them once it drops?  Are we actually cutting down their numbers or is it all for fluff?
---
Source?
---
It seems to be from people with subpar internet or on PC with a system below spec. So it‚Äôs on the user side of things.
---
I would also like a choice, because it's weird to force both timelines in the same space, and the opposite (removing Y1 content) would be counter-productive. Sounds like they went with option one regardless.
---
I wish that the scorched and SBs were pushed to the corners of the map. Sick of em.
---
I only buy junk to flip for the most part. If I find ballistic fiber, screws, antiseptic cheap I buy it to flip it. I sell all my plans at 10% face value to move them and all ammo for one cap still. Unless it's a Grahm plan really cheap I do this buy plans to flip, they weigh too much and sit for too long.
---
REEEEEEEE
---
Was doing a random side quest in Charlestown (like find the letter in \_\_ house or something). Come around the corner, See a Behemoth poking it's head into the intersection... 
---
Ok, I'm a level 270, no big deal, just a ... wait... how many? 8 or 9 behemoths are spawning in that narrow street in Charlestown. Some are hiding behind the building. Run over to Gun range to hop on roof for clearer field of fire. Kill 7 of the them... start to loot "STOMP STOMP STOMP ROAAAAAAR"... oh, missed a couple...

Downvote me all you want, fasnacht was utter shit. I mean, the parade was pretty fun but the rewards were trash because people participated in the event like hundreds of times and a few months later dupers got all the masks anyway. So why bother for the rewards anyway? Wastelanders will introduce a new way of duping for sure.
---
It HAS to fall into enough peoples budget or the game dies. They can't operate on shoestring budget.
---
I would really like to have a spray can that i can paint a red skull on any walls after this update  something to let everyone know i was there or something or make someone run off the cliff
---
It's in the millions mate not thousands.
---
No... the exact price is in atoms.there are more challenges then just dailies. And I agree, PA skins are overpriced, which is why I don‚Äôt buy them. I also don‚Äôt buy atoms. I could afford the skin, I have around 2k atoms currently, but it‚Äôs not worth it. Those 2000 atoms cost me $0. Unless there is a way to convert my 2000 atoms into $, 2000 atoms does not equal $20
---
So strange, I swear in had it equipped, I've been drinking like a sailor in the game and nothing until recently. now I dont even see the perk card at all.
---
You dont need to remove! Just seperate and allow me to pick wich I want to play... Much like picking survival or Adventure...
---
If you need another character to do something, maybe that thing is suboptimal...
---
dude, you clearly don't understand economics
---
It's also mentioned in the enclave storyline. It's pretty funny!
---
It's for fun. Plus when has a Fallout game ever taken itself completely seriously? You get abducted by aliens in the DLC for at least one of them, for goodness sake. The reason I skip it is because, having been sexually assaulted in real life, I'm a bit uncomfortable stripping naked in game. Even if the characters in Fallout don't really get fully naked to begin with. Still I'm not about to demand they get rid of the challenge or get upset at others who play naked builds.
---
Your character might but do YOU actually care?
---
Roughly 13.5 million left to kill
---
I mean... I do events to have fun personally. Rewards are secondary. I don‚Äôt really care if everyone has the same rewards. Did I hve fun? If the answer is yes then I‚Äôm good.
---
The problem is you have to kill the enemies in the nuke zone to get the fluids. When folks fight the queen outside of the zone, no fluids. And once she is dead, you rarely find enemies in the zone. Just my opinion though.
---
I just want to be able to use a gun‚Äôs scope even if it‚Äôs broken and I can‚Äôt fire it.
---
Pacifist mode does not prevent PvP when within the boundaries of a workshop. My understanding is that the player‚Äôs presence within the boundaries allows for the player to take damage, even when in pacifist mode.
---
I am death is supposed to be one of the last story‚Äôs to complete. You would of been really disappointed if you made it to the queen and seen how hard it would of been lol. If you guys are on Xbox I farm queens daily and love showing new players my favorite part of the game.
---
No, I‚Äôm from Morgantown, too, where only the wealthiest could afford to adorn their walls with the Sunday funnies. You must‚Äôve been even more poverty stricken and never knew it.
---
Nah, I just had a great grandma, Connie, who lived on a small (and exceedingly modest) farm in a cramped cabin; I would visit it only a few times as a child, between the ages of 4 through 7 (this was in the 80s). Can‚Äôt recall exactly where the farm was; and I don‚Äôt know if she even owned the property‚Äîbut I won‚Äôt forget the newspaper on the walls of her ‚ÄúFlorida room.‚Äù It was a curious addition to the cabin, with a single great big window facing the field.
---
No running water (aside from a pump), no electricity, and no heating. Just a wood stove, a metal tub for bathing, and a sigogglin floor.
---
Yes that's what I was saying. There are three ways and they chose the first, despite the fact that it's not the most logical thing:
---
- Y1 and Y2 coexist (weird).  
---
- Y1 disappears and Y2 replaces it (why would you remove content from your own game?).  
---
- Y1 or Y2 can be picked.
---
lol dude. Bethesda games have had the same crashing issues on consoles for literally decades. Blame the users if you want, but if a company has the exact same shit happen no matter the hardware, it's probably at least partly the company's fault.
---
Lol. You are completely missing the point. And why do you keep talking about dailies? There are like 3000 atoms available from other challenges. Show some self restraint if you think an item in the shop is overpriced.
---
https://youtu.be/QVibtTjReu4

Main character level 261 and two alts both over level 100+, mainly just play when there's event or if there's some trading to be done which has dried up quite a bit too it seems, All im gonna say is that i'll still probably play 76 going forward but with a bunch of new games coming out other than logging in for like events and such my days of grinding hours on end for this game are most likely over.....
---
BGS please make that change with wastelanders!

Like tags here is some examples 
---
Player was here

Join the BOS

Join the fun

Yeah I agree. A combat knife would probably be best
---
I agree, we will hve to wait and see
---
They have stated FALL 2019 Multiple times through E3 Gamescon an their fourms an Reddit post have all point to it. I'm not digging for it it prove it to you. You can easily find the info online.
---
I see  Hunter/Hunted going off all the time.  you must play at odd hours.
---
What the above said. If you're seizing the workshop and then attempting to go to their camp etc to gank them unawares, then you're just an asshole. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
This game can be funky sometimes. Keep trying things and hopefully something works
---
The problem is it splits the player base a bit. I agree in an ideal world I would want this as well
---
Nothin‚Äô ‚Äòhind that door but more asbestos, son. Go an‚Äô get the trowel, we got ceilin‚Äô to scrape.
---
eh doesnt bug me none ive finally got what i wanted from the purveyor
---
Wtf? I haven't played for like 3 months and this still going on. This is outrageous
---
Then why isn't any spawning in Whitesprings? I know how the game works, I know you have to kill them in the Nuke zone. :/
---
My bad. Fixed it
---
Fixed
---
my advice, if these people really get to you that much, then put a dense mod on your chest armor and pick up the END perk Fireproof.
---
This is the easiest way to combat the evil TSE crew (which isnt really a thing since the nerf to TSE 6 months ago)
---
If you get one shot with a TSE anything then you are not built right.  TSE is shit, unless you are lucky enough to have a legacy plasma TSE.
---
Nothing stopping you from going to find your own OP weapons either.  Scores of player vendors out there have a surplus of explosive guns of every modifier, start vendor hopping and you will very soon have your own set of broken overpowered gear.   And you will love it.
---
üëçHappy hunting
---
I believe you need to contest(takeover) the workshop to initiate pvp. Then you and the original workshop owner have pvp opened (even with pacifist on) if within the workshop boundaries. I could be wrong, but that is how I understand it.
---
Well said
---
You have no idea
---
Might just block the radio station, if anything
---

---
Knowing bethesda it will probably come on December 31st since it's a Tuesday and it's still 2019. Anyway, there are plenty of awesome games coming soon. Outter Worlds this month and RDR2 on PC next month so wastelanders has to be REALLY good to compete with that.
---
No, the fridge is $7 worth of atoms.  Say I get the $10 choice for 1100 atoms.  The fridge is 700 atoms.  That's about $6.36 in atoms.  They can obfuscate the price that way and incentivize you into buying more.  That's still $6.36 for a fucking fridge.  That's too much.  The free atoms doesn't change that the fridge is worth 700 atoms and I just paid the equivalent of $6.36 in atoms for it.  That's too fucking much for a fridge.  It's not about expediency and just grinding for free atoms.  That's what the price is for what they're selling.  They are charging that much for atoms and that's how much it costs in atoms.  It costs the equivalent of 6-7 dollars.  Free atoms do not change that.
---
Remember when Hong Kong was under British control until the 90s?
---
It‚Äôs the only reason they have civil rights or anything resembling democracy.  I think it was grandfathered in for 50 years.
---
Fast forward to 2019.......
---
*Are you ready to get spoopy?!*
---
Only for those people who wash their carpets.
---
recent as in for several weeks now...  
---
guess it's low priority.
---
Yep.
---
Fireproof and dense.
---
Problem solved.
---
Sounds more like a case of jealousy that you havent put the time in to find an explosive gun of your own.
---
damn.
---
Switch armors. They dont really care or have resources to fix it at the moment. I've made reddit post with over 500 upvotes forum post an reported the bug daily. As well as my friends reported it. Used to be the Raider armor an this patch it's the trappers. It was my best armor I had but I got rid of it because this bug. Luckily my friend got a reasonable chest for me to replace mine.
---
I like my my meat hook and my power fist. Both are medium speed and pack a wallop if all perk cards are equipped.
---
That sounds pretty expensive what do you price each possum badge at?
---
My thoughts exactly. I see so many great suggestions that end up leaving low level or high level players in the dust. This one's a great idea, but need some kind of check and balance so some dweller fresh from the vault isn't attacked by fifty Liberators at once.
---
I understand the purpose of the shop, and understand it is how they make money. My whole point is our conversation should be centered around how much atoms something costs, not $. That‚Äôs a completely different conversation. 
---
If we think 100 atoms is not enough for $1, that‚Äôs a completely different conversation from whether or not 500 atoms is appropriate for a collectron (I think it is given how it doesn‚Äôt take long to collect 500 atoms in game). 
---
Conflating these two conversations is not effective. The true value of 100 atoms is not $1 because of optionality. $1 is an option, it‚Äôs not the only way to get 100 atoms and when doing valuation, that optionality matters. It‚Äôs the same as valuing a derivative.
---
I see it more from regular scorch and mutants.  The glowies drop more mass in my experience.
---
&gt; 2000 atoms does not equal $20
---
No, I can buy 2400 atoms for $20.  But then say I spend 2400 atoms on a power armor skin, a refrigerator and a new haircut.  I just spent $20 and that's what I got.  That's not good value.  That's not worth $20.
---
if we don't hit the mark for the 50%.. B would be fools not to give it to us anyway.. without even taking into consideration they screwed us on the mystery picks they owe us that much
---
It was confirmed the scorch and Scorchbeasts will still exist in Wastelanders. And the main quest will still be there in parallel do you can still nuke for the SBQ. 
---
I don‚Äôt know about displacement though.
---
I bought about 15 recall cards before I got it but some of my buddy‚Äôs got it as I was farming for mine so I think that‚Äôs better then buying it. Plus if you get imposter costumes you can get your money back üò¨. It‚Äôs a fun event.
---
The company hasn‚Äôt even been in business 2 decades, so ‚Äúliterally‚Äù it has not. 
---
And again... I have modern equipment and internet and zero issues.
---
Buy the maps from a [U-Mine-It! vending machine](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/U-Mine-It!_vending_machine) and use the maps.  It'll give you metal scrap as a reward.  You can get a ton of black titanium.  You can only do 3 maps a day though.
---
How many times do I have to say atoms from challenges don't affect the price of the item.  If I spent $10 on atoms and got an item worth $10 in atoms then I just spent $10 on it.  The fridge costs 700 atoms.  $10 gets you 1100 atoms.  That equates to the fridge costing $6.36 in atoms.  If I bought 1100 atoms and spent 700 on the fridge then I just paid $6.36 for it.  For a fridge.  That's not worth it.
---
I think you are missing the point.
---
If your on Xbox I farm it every server I join I can help you out.
---
Aw
---
They might have over-estimated the goals somewhat, perhaps because there has been an apparent decrease of the player count in the last couple weeks, or at least I see the game at 42nd place on the Xbox US most played games chart, which I think is the lowest since launch. To be honest, I am considering replaying Fallout 4 myself in survival mode at the moment.
---
I do actually.  I visited back in 2008, and found it to be one of the most open and welcoming cities I've ever been to.  The people there deserve better than the government they're stuck living under, which is heavily influenced by the mainland.
---
So we're gonna nuke them back
---
If on Xbox I can help you too.
---
Amen
---
I switched to PS4 because of the NW cheaters. I use a controller on PC anyway, so it was no big deal. The framerates are garbage compared to PC, but that's a tradeoff I'll take.
---
I agree, Bethesda is really garbage at stopping cheaters, and I'm not really surprised. Hell, here we are almost a year from launch, and you still can't even kill things with a laser, plasma, or tesla without the chance you'll lose items from the ash pile bug.
---
Yo where's my dog
---
We already did. I think, I was in a vault when it was all happening.
---
The optimal option would to have 5 characters over 50 so you can maximize your mumbles pulls...
---
Then they should lower the prices so they're actually fair and I might actually buy something.  As it stands, I'm not going to get nickel and dimed on a game I already paid full price for.
---
Lol.... take some time to read what I wrote. It doesn‚Äôt matter what you voluntarily paid to get premium currency faster lol. The fact that there is a free option that takes longer affects the value.
---
The Quakecon panel presentation (in summer) said Fall 2019, the more recent Inside the Vault (a week or three ago) said it will now be 2020.
---
Have you tried building "blueprint" buildings at Workshops? The materials come from "Workshop" supplies first. It's not truly unlimited, but gives you some play time. I like Wade Airport for this, or Tyler County race track, both have nice open areas.
---
See that I can get behind. It's when people buy stuff meant for lowbies and flip them at their own vendor for some ridiculous price that I have a problem with. Of course I can't stop them, but still.
---
I have seen several for sale in player vending machines so they are getting out there now.  There is a decent chance of a 50% off sale for the Purveyor soon, save up your scrip and hit that hard when the time comes.
---
Fact is its expensive because you can rack in Atoms for Free while playing. Its still however scumbag robbery. Its 2019, you can buy some triple AAA titles for 20 bucks. I'm not going to buy something that takes little effort to make (talking about reskins / color palette changes). 
---
The Atom shop needs to be exclusively 100-500 Atoms per item. No exceptions. The 500 Atom items being the actual remodels of power armor that took time to create. Any skin over 250 is still whack to me. 
---
Its already a slap in the face to see Emotes/Profile Emblems going for upwards of 2$. Like you've got to be kidding me. 
---
Bethesda's Atom Store shows how scumbag a company can be. It doesn't end. Propaganda speeches from Tom Howard about the games graphics. Little to no effort to fix major duping exploits for months. Little to no effort to fix major game issues in general when the community has said it was broken since day 1 (looking at you energy weapon armor penetration). Honestly Fallout 76 is almost as bad as No Man Sky but difference is No Man Sky made a huge turn around.. cant say the same for Fallout 76. 
---
The only reason i still play Fallout 76 is because of the community and friends ive made. Without them i would never even consider playing this game. 
---
.
---
Here‚Äôs an upvote.
---
Ay caramba... read what I actually write. So you are telling me if I have 2400 atoms I can cash those in for $20? That is what you are telling me with your response.
---
Yea, in 1984 the PRC agreed to let HK keep their capitalist system for 50 years following the transfer which took place in 1997.
---
Oh, I definitely agree. Compared to older Fallout games' DLC, FO4 was pretty weak over all.
---
I just bought a Level 25 Vampire Cultist Dagger \* from a player vendor. My character just made level 28. The dagger's speed is fast and takes a few hits to kill a strong scorched or super mutant. The weaker ones go down with one hit. You get the most out of the vampire effect with a lot of fast hits. My tiny girl can kill a mob in a whirlwind of slashing, stabbing violence and her health bar hardly goes down.
---
So yeah, get a knife with the vampire effect if you can.
---
Go back and read. Slow down. You clearly hve not read what I wrote, or not understood it. If you need me to simplify I can. Take a deep breath. Now exhale.
---
Its a shame people are switching platforms because Bethesda wont police their own servers.
---
No, it does not affect the value.  They charge $10 for 1100 atoms.  That is how much it costs.  If I bought 1100 atoms and got an item for 1100 atoms then it just cost me $10 in atoms.  It's not a matter of paying to get it faster.  This is what the atoms cost.
---
Oh so it's not just me then. Was leveling an alt, and did one of the Enclave orbital bombardment events in Welch. I swear, there were WAY more Mole Miners than usual. I was getting mobbed there were so many of those grunting, mumbling freaks.
---
Maybe something glitched with the servers that increased enemy spawn rates dramatically?
---
Or maybe fix the mystery pick and bring it back during the 25% off sale so instead of 60 it would be 45 scrip for totally random 3* anything. That way they don't have to give us a pity f for not meeting the goal and we could still get something unique for the sale.
---
I just hit 56 today. Just bought some serums today and tried marsupial for the first time. I‚Äôm at about 160 hours I think. Feel like I‚Äôve deff gotten my money‚Äôs worth and there‚Äôs so much I still want to do. I know at some point I‚Äôll run out of things but not for a long while. I still have a ton of events I haven‚Äôt yet tried. A lot of my leveling came from meat week.
---
Atoms also cost $0....  I hve bought 0 atoms and somehow hve spent over 4000 atoms with another 2 left in my account..... you paid $ to get those atoms immediately versus earning them....
---
Always that guy trying to be nice to the savages and expecting them to listen or care!
---
Whether you like it or not, Workshops are a PvP area so you will always run the risk of dying if you hang out in yours. My suggestion is to get in and out as fast as possible, only dropping by to collect resources and be crouched when you so that so they don't know you are there
---
 Kbro
---
Yeah I've stopped playing except to log in for caps and scrip then go play battlefield 4
---
I‚Äôve seen a person or two join but I have literally never seen 4 people queue up on my server or the game isn‚Äôt notifying me properly. It could be either really. I play usually from 6pm-Midnight Eastern time.
---
If you are in pvp zones you're playing pvp whether you want or not and deserve to get shot. If you don't want to play pvp don't put yourself in a PVP situation. Junk is super easy to get other ways, i easily get 100's of screws, gears and other parts simply picking up things everyday.
---
OMG I will regret it! :/ 
---
Bruh
---
"Fair" is subjective. I already get the sense that prices are coming down on certain items over time. They'll get the feel for what the market will bear at the volumes of sales they want. They have to always be wary of being too close to players being able to buy everything with free atoms. Price things too low and everyone just uses their free atoms and spends no real money.
---
I want your caps and blood. Not whatever the workshop produces. I'm not a raider. I'm a serial killer. Why, you ask? Because this is a fucking RPG.
---
No, you're going somewhere else with this.  The fact of the matter is I can spend $20 and get 2400 atoms.  That's how much 2400 atoms cost.  If I got a power armor skin worth 1400 with that then that's the equivalent of $11.67 of the $20 I just spent.  Free atoms don't factor in.  I spent $20 on 2400 atoms.  I got an item worth 1400 atoms.  That item cost $11.67.  That's too much for a single power armor skin.
---
I‚Äôm sorry you get upset by facts... upgrade your equipment or internet for a better experience. I‚Äôm sorry you are having problems, truly
---
So, you admit to trolling. 
---
Did you not read the rules?

Also, and not that this is truly practical, but... Nuclear Winter gives you an unlimited camp budget. (No turrets though). Uncheck the "fill team" box, find a nice quiet corner away from the fire, build away... (and maybe get shot in the head or nuked). FUN
---
I am not trolling
---
they are working on it and will have it out sometime next year since they are trying to fix a few things
---
It‚Äôs a shame though what is going on......and the you have people here in America that have no idea how good they have it and Hong Kong is flying our flag.
---
It's pretty essential for Nuke Zones, like it or not.
---
Their complete radio silence on the issue told me all I needed to know - nothing will be done. Right, u/Valseek ?
---
Roger that thank you so much :)
---
Good question. I haven‚Äôt been in a nukes WS in a long time.  I do know they were more rare than the others. I buy from other player vendors anytime I find it for this reason.
---
I am not going somewhere else with this. You are saying atoms and $ are interchangeable. They are not. 
---
Yes You can spend $20 on 2400... keyword ‚Äúcan‚Äù. That is what we call an option. You also ‚Äúcan‚Äù spend zero and still get the skin. When valuing a currency you need to account for all options lol. I know you are probably just a child and I‚Äôm wasting my time here but I‚Äôm trying to impart some finance knowledge on you.
---
no problemo and yea trying to find stuff like this is a pain
---
Great stuff! 
---
The community is pretty cool ... even for introverts ;-)
---
*plays Commie Whacker*
---
But then why not have a 150 caps limit at vendors and a 150 lb stash too while we're at it? What I'm trying to convey is that the daily scrip limit is too low, regardless of your (effective) workarounds.
---
&gt;The yagui bears def need a nerf
---
Careful who you say that around. Someone was insistent they needed a buff a few days ago. Any time someone says something needs a buff, I think they should have to post their level, gear, and perk load out, so we can tell whether the enemy they want buffed is genuinely weak or if they're just playing a character who's set up to one shot that enemy easily.
---
If the hit box is bigger because of the giant noggen it may offset the DR!
---
I have tried this, but I'm only around lvl37 atm and it seems like I get through one npc defense and then a lvl150+ will show up and one shot me to claim it for themselves. Lol
---
Edit - community doesn't mean shit to me, I'm a selfish prick.
---
There, fixed it for ya.
---
lol atoms do not cost 0 I wrote an essay for that ahahahah just up there, you literally can't earn your way up to every item
---
Indeed, a lot if information sites have given up reporting on this game other then the negative stuff.
---
If only we had a sandbox area where we could do this in the game, without having to worry about getting shot while we're building.
---
How have I earned 6000 atoms and I paid $0?
---
Yup. You can't wear it and you only get gold from scrapping it but it does show up in a display case... if you look really close since it's tiny.
---
I didn't know they were not that common... I guess I shouldn't have been scrapping the extras.
---
 The Combat Knife is the best melee weapon in the game. Now I have been using them for quite a while and have 3 +40% Speed ones. An Executioner,  a Furious and a Nocturnal.
---
 My Executioner and Furious go out at about 150 and escalate rapidly with Adrenaline to the 200 range. My Nocturnal goes out around 200 and does the same. You need to keep in mind a fast +40% speed weapon, is hitting around 3 times a second, to appreciate what's happening. ;)
---
Good to know. Thanks.
---
&gt; You are saying atoms and $ are interchangeable.
---
No I am not.  I am saying I can spend $20 to get 2400 atoms.  If I bought the skin after that then I just spent $11.67 of the $20 I just spent on atoms.  It's that simple.  Yes I could spend nothing and just grind atoms but I can also buy atoms.  That is how much it would cost if I bought the atoms.  That is too much.  Prove to me the value in a power armor skin for $11.67.  That is how much it would cost if I bought it.  Free atoms don't affect that.
---
&gt;I know you are probably just a child and I‚Äôm wasting my time here but I‚Äôm trying to impart some finance knowledge on you.
---
Also, nice.  You can't address my argument so you resort to attacking me.  Classy.
---
Can confirm that it does not apply to perk packs.
---
They pushed pretty much everything that isnt Wastelanders to next year.
---
&gt; Price things too low and everyone just uses their free atoms and spends no real money.
---
Or just give more atoms for real money.
---
I earned around the same and paid the same, but if I tried to buy everything I couldn't. This is because atomic shops prices and shop itself is based around real world money, not our "incentive creating free atoms"
---
No, $5 gets you 500 atoms.  $10 gets you 1100 atoms.  $20 gets you 2400 atoms.  You can earn atoms in game but that doesn't change the prices they're selling the atoms for.
---
If losing 50 caps an oil can and spoiled vegetables really ruins your entire day so much you need to throw a baby tantrum online, then you need to reevaluate why you're such a miserable person. It's just a game. Remember that.
---
My sister's best friend is an exchange student from China. She's genuinely the sweetest girl I've ever met.
---
Dont take workshops then. It's that simple.
---
Agreed... it's nuked about 5% of what it used to be, as far as my particular gameplay goes.
---
I've been trying to get the witch plan for the last week, and more often than not, the random encounter is nothing at all. I did luck up and get the plans for the skeleton costume &amp; skull cap. Plus, several copies of the Trapper armor plans which always are in one of the tents where the Scorched are the random encounter clustered inside one of the tents.
---
You new to Fallout or something? üòÇ
---
Not a terrible idea actually. Especially with all these low effort recolor items in the shop lately.
---
Go back and read. Slow down. You clearly hve not read what I wrote, or not understood it. If you need me to simplify I can. Take a deep breath. Now exhale. Think you can you handle all that, little boy?
---
Same here. It happened to me yesterday. Almost made a post about how the "PowerArmors" are becoming sentient and taking over the workshops now.
---
they really need 4 kinds of challenges
---
Activity challenges - login once a day for 5 days - play for 5 hours a week - play for a hour a day - do 5 events in a week
---
Combat Challenges - fight monsters ect
---
Crafting - Build armor / learn a plan / make some stims ect
---
Exploration - Go to and take a photo - use all the audio guides in a area - go take photos at 
---
These 4 would then give people reasons to build things be online fight and explore - I mean think of all the cool places they could send people to explore alone to learn more about the game lore.
---
Please reread everything I wrote before. The fact that there is another method to obtain atoms affects their value. If you had to put a $ figure it would be somewhere between $0 and $1 for 100 atoms because of this optionality. I‚Äôm sorry this is going over your head and is too complicated for you. I agree 1200 atoms is too much for a power armor skin (which I assume is your point). 
---
If I bought a power armor skin right now it would be $0. Since you hve no atoms you would need to spend some money or time grinding. Therefore the VALUE is somewhere between 0-11.67 (I‚Äôm trusting your math here). 
---
This may be too complicated a concept for you to understand and too complicated for most people. This is why i have said we should focus our conversation on the amount of atoms things are priced at, as that is the most accurate since it ignora the various methods to obtain atoms.
---
I did not. Thanks for the Info.
---
F U C K

---
Please read what I write before responding.
---
so? no one said fuck chinese?
---
Lol. I‚Äôm probably twice our age. Thanks for your maturity.
---
Technically you are if you're over lvl 50 to hold your own. You gain no extra power after lvl 50. Find yourself some decent gear an fine tune your build an you can easily battle with high lvls. Lvls really have nothing to do with it as you can wear an use anything past lvl 50. I'm aware you said you dont care for pvp though. I'm the same way. But if I dont have any junk on me I'll mess around a bit.
---
Just a reminder that Morgantown Airport and the Watoga Civic Center are two locations with a high density of Scorched.  Please feel free to comment with any other locations I have overlooked. Let‚Äôs get that 50% discount!
---
No, none of what you are saying affects $20 getting you 2400 atoms and 1400 atoms getting you a power armor skin.  Spending $20 on atoms then getting the power armor skin would mean $11.67 of that 20 just went to buying a power armor skin.  It's not hard, it's simple.
---
oh no how dare i say that im fine with not getting a discount
---
&gt;Thanks for your maturity.
---
No, no.  Thank you.
---
Either get over it, or don't make your bed in a PvP area,
---
The community could'nt be better.  I've been here since launch and once people hit end game and started running out of stuff to do, helping the newbies was the only logical next step.  Fallout players are you best.  I mean, after surviving 4 solo missions (5 if you count tactics) we're all more than happy to help out those of us that are new to the wastes.  We've been there and we remember.
---
Would you be willing to trade one of them?
---
It does, every load in, right by my camp. I think it's a glitch like when the robots kept duplicating at the whisperings. I enjoy the radstag meat and it's very immersive.
---
 It's a herd. I dig the idea of real hoards, but ... what about snakes, spiders, and 800lb raccoons. 
---
**clown ghouls! ** - make this happen bathesda. you've got 3 weeks until Halloween.
---
Clearly this is going over your head, or you aren‚Äôt taking the time to read and maybe learn a thing or two about how to properly value currency. 
---
Anyway, I have to get back to work. I hope you go back and read what I wrote and learn something new. Knowledge is power.
---
Dont think I've ever got any addiction ever in this game in 700 hours except once when a challenge was to drink 10 alchohol.
---
Then your character Romana is a idiot
---
I really wish they would add stuff ingame to stride for in unison with cash shop stuff and yea its overpriced as hell.
---
Raiders aren‚Äôt just bullies though? They‚Äôre murdering assholes. I mean I‚Äôm not one, if I‚Äôm going to take a workshop I send the pvp emote so they can leave or get ready to defend (unless there‚Äôs like a team of three or more there then it‚Äôs fair game because if you outnumber me and I still win that‚Äôs sad) but raiders aren‚Äôt courteous or bullies they‚Äôre raiders
---
Big bend tunnel, server hop, rinse, repeat.
---
I'm betting I can net 10K shotgun shells from dead scorched by the 14th from doing this.
---
most of what i get my info from is people who are not well known but are able to provide the source with the source being well know just not easy to access because its getting pushed to the side.
---
A wheel that awards small amounts of scrip and a chance of legendaries 1 spin per day? Something like that with be fun but a little childish and then they would probably sell spins for atoms but I'd enjoy it.
---
Utilizing other characters your daily scrip rate goes from 150 to 750... the system is designed to promote this behavior intentionally
---
I agree
---
One killing spree I do is Bolton Greens -&gt; Morgantown HS -&gt; Morgantown Airport.
---
Without the correct punctuation "bane imicical to human life" sounds very silly, but hey you're the pro writer and editor; me just the idiot ignorant. Keep the replies coming little guy
---
:D
---
Combat Knife.  Fastest effective weapon in the game. (mr handy and ripper are faster, but they suck)
---
Username checks out
---
Not with that attitude.
---
Question: If I walk into a scorched infested area, like say Watoga Municipal Center, and that bug happens, where they all instantly die; does that count?
---
source: Cop a squatter: Remove squatters from Watoga Municipal Center. "I'm here!" "Aaagh!" Event Completed. "That was easy".
---
This....actually makes a ton of sense! Weird how we on reddit keep thinking of game system improvements that the developers should‚Äôve thought through months before release, but alas...
---
No. You have to turn it off. Learned this when I tried to get a workshop back. (Wish the setting had multiple options. Like only PVP in workshops and only when attacked you can hurt that person or can hurt people with a bounty. I am not into PVP but it would be nice not to have to worry about fighting enemies while still being able to defend yourself.)
---
I've got a instigating powder rifle, a lever action, and a 10mm. I make my way from camp to camp and I scavenge what I need, almost like it's a survival game!
---
many including myself have learned that assholes like to pvp against those that don't so when building at certain ones a lot things site right on the border and while not being active standing right outside. I know at sunshine there is 3 spots that are outside the green wall but will stop the countdown and with pacifist on will not allow pvp.   
---
If it wasn't for 1 shot pvp weapons I would pvp but since to many clowns gotta flex their tiny ego I make sure to try my best to screw with people trying to take over a workshop from me.
---
Go kill scorched!
---
Bring survival back. PvP players are leaving
---
I got a drop for the dense combat torso plan from a regular scorchbeast kill. Has issue where combat and Marine dense plan were both labeled as combat been fixed yet? I haven't learned it because the character I want to use it on will depend on which one it actually is.
---
Except they lied about it only being cosmetics anyway.
---
There is 1 up the ramp that can change from yellow dirty or brown.
---
No, there will be no more replies, because I don't need to waste anymore time on a pedantic loser like you. I'm soooo effing sorry you can't accept that a living language has more than one correct way in which to structure a sentence, but that's totally and entirely your problem and not mine. Enjoy having a stupid, overly rigid, uninspiring lexicon all you want, but you'll be doing so from the other side of a block henceforth. Bugger off.
---
Free Hong Kong.
---
What a bizarre thought.
---
Again, you are trying to remove the free Atoms from the discussion because they are inconvenient to your argument. Players get thousands of Atoms for free. Thousands. With little to no effort. Tens of thousands if they grind. You cannot have a logical discussion about Atom Shop prices and ignore that. 
---
There is probably a discussion to be had here, but that can‚Äôt happen if you (and everyone else who makes this argument) continue to refuse to do so with all the data in mind.
---
Free Hong Kong. Don't be a bootlicking scrub.
---
What's the point? People are gonna log on either way if they want to play. I log on for the daily cap and scrip caps, for example.
---
All this would do is be a small bonus for regular players and clog up the login servers with randos logging for the free daily caps and then logging off.
---
The best melee weapon in the game is a Bloodied Swing Speed Meat Hook. These can hit for 14,000+ damage.
---
Y I K E S
---
Edit: guys he comments on The_Donald on a regular basis don‚Äôt listen to anything he says
---
We already established you're a selfish prick, yes, there's no need to keep saying so.
---
People need to launch more nukes on the SE side of the map for SBQ event.  Lots of scorched will spawn there.
---
oof
---
omg I can't even browse reddit anymore. everywhere is nothing but HK now. I totally agree FreeHK but I just wish I could have 5 seconds on reddit now where i can be without it.
---
I have a friend who is an English teacher in Shanghai, and she feels the same way about her students and the people she meets, but she's also aware that the government is trash.  I think when it comes to autocratic governments, you have to separate the national of the country from the government of the country.
---
Oh wow an actual T_D poster, that‚Äôs insane
---
Guess you have a really big problem!!
---
Now that you know that Raiders aren't the only one's that want to murder you...ü§î
---
Anyone on xbox has the fixer plan?
---
Well that answers my question, thanks.
---
They're hardly the first or the worst was my point.  That's no reason to be hostile to other users on reddit.
---
Hong Kong has been free since 1997
---
Yes, weapons with the +250 resist modifier bug out. There might be something similar on your meat hook, though I haven‚Äôt heard anyone else mention it.
---
How would it kill the game?  
---
Its difference between someone eho doesnt log in v someone who only logs in to get some atoms then logs off again, atoms are non tradeable, the items are non tradable and if your making a script to simply log in to collect the daily atoms you wont be causing any more problems for the servers
---
I eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast.
---
15 cap value.
---
Well, you might be right but then judging by the Overseer's character there should be at least one good splinter group from Vault 76, i.e. they won't be universally considered bad. 
---
They may not be able to unite the people or even all the dwellers but it's unlikely they will become the villain as a whole.
---
Good question that I don‚Äôt know the answer to.  I‚Äôve had that happen to me several times, too. Since it does give an ‚Äúevent completed‚Äù message, the game is somehow recognizing that the enemies have died.  So I hope it means those easy kills count.
---
Yeah, I very rarely see it being nuked. My store is there.
---
Ignore the message? Or turn off your hud.
---
did i say f*** the community? no i didnt said it doesnt bother me none cause i already got what i wanted from the purveyor huge difference between not caring about the community and not caring about getting a discount
---
But i was just rewatching the destroy all humans remake trailor again now im conflicted in who to kill
---
Napalm Core?
---
Vocabulary is different from grammar and punctuation though. You can have the widest lexicon in the world, but if your grammar and punctuation is wrong or confusing then who cares? There's more to writing and editing than vocabulary alone, young grasshopper.
---
Bloodied stealth sniper, Instigating Stealth Sniper, or melee.
---
üòÜ 
---
i‚Äôm having a great day! thanks.
---
I flip my vote.
---
You are also messed up in the head.  
---
Killing people who don‚Äôt want to fight means you are in need of serious counseling.
---
If I'm busy doing something I rarely even notice them. Having the option to turn them off would be okay, but I wouldn't use it. There are so many things more important to fix. ü§î
---
Look, I'm being a bit of an ass here, but you're missing the point. You saying it doesn't bug you leaves implied, whether you mean it to or not, the idea that it doesn't bug you that others won't have the opportunity to become as satisfied as you are at a discounted price. That's fairly dickish. If that isn't what you mean, then, well, phrasing.
---
Rofl. Bootlicker. Or just incredibly ignorant of the present.
---
I bet the people in Hongkong wish they didn't have to deal with all that easier
---
I'm not. I am however getting plenty of shit from people on here for calling Bethesda put on their bullshit.
---
At least it's a weekend so hopefully if enough people play we might have a chance.
---
It's not that hard to keep up with the LMG ammo use if you're only using it for sbq fights that are outside the nuke zone (so you're only using up 500rds per fight instead of 2000). Mine is at about 300 damage per shot after I primed it, ends up showing damage number of about 250 per shot for sneak crit headshots on the queen.
---
I think I only use about 12 fluorescent flux a week to keep up with it, buying most of that flux from player vendors for about 50-100 caps each. You get 172 rounds per craft, so it's better than regular .308.
---
 I also just primed my bloodied .50 MG but that only seems to show damage numbers of 90 per shot, so it's not as ammo conserving because the fight ends up being longer. That uses violet flux though, which seems harder to come by and rarely for less than 100 caps, but at least it crafts 360 rounds per.
---
I'm doing my part too.
---
Well, that's unfortunate. Usually the workshop griefers only focus on Power Plants, and often don't finish capping workshops from you. Stash your junk first thing, run or respawn elsewhere. You might find out you still own it when they leave.
---
‚ÄúThe free atoms just justify a higher price‚Äù
---
Correct. They absolutely justify a higher price. 
---
‚ÄúThe free atoms don‚Äôt change the price of the item if I‚Äôm going to pay for it by buying Atoms.‚Äù
---
Yes, they do. You have the same access to free Atoms as everyone else. Pricing is not based on what one Reddit user who spends their free Atoms quickly thinks is fair, it‚Äôs based on the overall average of real money vs free Atoms across the player base. 
---
If a few players lack the self control (or have the expendable income to burn) to refrain from buying everything they see in the shop, and go ahead and spend more real money than the average player, that‚Äôs up to them.
---
most people are afraid &amp; don't care enough to instigate change and that is perfectly normal. 
---
chinese army and cops tho, oh boy oh jeez don't get me started
---
Honestly I don‚Äôt know why people play FO76 for PvP.   The mechanics and controls suck compared to Rainbow Six Siege and other (intentionality) PvP games.  
---
I suppose I don‚Äôt blame people for attacking others, I blame the game design(ers) for making that an option.
---
At about L22, I was give an L20 Vampire machete by a high level player.  I used that as primary until I retired it at L45 when I looted a L45 cultist dagger.
---
Kept that until L65, when I looted a L50  1\* vampire switchblade.
---
Now L143, and that switchblade is still my goto for most things ground based.   Took out a grounded L50 SB with it last week.  Have also take out a few deathclaws, and a good number of Col Gutsys.
---
Backup is a non-legendary L45 sword called The Gutter.  (Assaultron blade with vampire and electrical charge).
---
Flying things (L65+ SBs, cargobots, and mothmen), 3\* yogis, and 3\* SSQs get a ballistic weapon.
---
Steath bladed combat knife is pretty good, but I like the vampire effect.  Combine that wih healiing factor...
---
If you are not in PA, then a deathclaw gauntlet with extra claw mod.
---
Not the fastest, but does a huge amount of damage per hit.

Yep
---
Imagine if we nuked China and they nuked us back over Hong Kong. We could play Fallout 76 in real life. How sweet would that be? Just imagine the graphics and not having to worry about crashes or the machine gun looping sound bug!!!!
---
You have two options . 1 kill command to the pid (unique task id) 2. Use keyboard or mouse or both to navigate out of the game . for example : from the in game Esc-z-down(9 times)-enter-down(once)-enter and you out of the game. There are library's to communicate with programs in programming jest for that
---
Mirv and nukas are good as well. Shrug.
---
I was still using a lvl 40 two-shot railway rifle until they nerfed two-shot. Just never found anything better. There's sort of a sweet spot.. In general, if I'm over level 40 I'm probably just going to wait until I hit 50. Something like a level 1-35 though, sell it cheap and help someone out.
---
It took us what 10 days to get to 21 million and we need kill another 12 or so within 4 days with a declining player base
---
i liked survival mode. i liked having a place to go and be cautious of everything that moved. i expected to die and did so quite frequently. i liked the higher stakes.
---
Oh no I‚Äôm spewing facts oh dear .... get a life
---
Ok, but that will only kill it on your pc, you doing that isnt going to effect anyone elses game and has nothing to do with a daily login bonus
---
While a small bit of atoms would be easiest to implement, I actually think ESO has an interesting incentive structure where unique cosmetic items are rewarded after x number of log-in days during the given period (ex. logging in 28 days out of 31 that month to unlock a costume or mount). Something like that could be cool too if they don't want to mess with the atom economy.
---
Well technically I was referring to anyone's past in general like garbage and not in the more derogatory sense, more like it's in the past and it's been discarded. T_D is a circlejerk, but you won't see me shitting on Conservative seeing as I'm a Conservatarian ( a Libertarian that still believes in some value of a central government)
---
Yup!  He said so himself.
---
Drinking alcohol will give you that particular alcohol's buff and also remove the addiction debuff for the duration of the alcohol. Same applies for chems like Psycho.
---
Sweetwater is my favorite alcohol since it lasts 45 minutes.
---
Addictions don't go away after awhile - they used to disappear on death but that was fixed a long time ago. You have to use Addictol or a Radscorpion Egg Omelette to get rid of addictions.
---
Actually, the current situation is that at least one Vault 76 Dweller has canonly joined the Enclave, attained the rank General, and ran things in the Appalachia chapter or the nuke wouldn't be possible.
---
The problem is will they leave a mark in history as a part of Enclave, or will they just be dwellers, or if history will not remember them. Speaking of characters joining the factions officially, we had have that in Fallout 3, and NV, and Fallout 4

I can confirm this though i just cought the end of a conversation some friends were having

Don't look then damn.

Not a bad suggestion but what if I want all that other good stuff in my hud?

It isn't griefing

Did I hurt the conservative‚Äôs feelings? :/

It‚Äôs okay, you can go back to your safe space over at T_D

Just for this post I‚Äôm buying another 40 bucks worth when I get off work.

What do you think is the most important fix needed?

lol

Man y‚Äôall are fun.

Woulda been more worth it if they did Super Muties instead of scorched.

.556 ammo and run guns in harpers ferry to cap out on venders very fast

Oh god you‚Äôre actually taking this seriously

And again, discarded?!??? ITS LESS THEN A MONTH AGO lol

Dude pick a side. Even the Libertarian subreddit shits on r/conservative and T_D

Its possible with a weekend being in there and a Monday holiday. Not easy but possible.

Someone like me will pay for it because i'm not having any luck getting the plans from the event.

It should still be it. Look at effects, you should see the +100 carry weight with all pieces equipped.

Rename the power armor frame? Just like how you rename weapons and armor pieces. Go to the inventory, inspect, rename.

Edit: I‚Äôm sorry but the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Patriot...and I play video games‚Äù is so fucking funny please keep replying
---
I beat queen three times but they never dropped loot for me, I‚Äôve been playing since launch but I‚Äôm having trouble leveling up
---
The revolutionary sword with the electrified and serrated mod is ok. Good legendary effects make a good back up. Got an executioner‚Äôs crippling with power attack a long time ago and has remained my back up.
---
Sutton, helvetica, line in the Sand, and group to share kills, higher scorch count.
---
Shhhhhh
---
I don‚Äôt know about you, but I‚Äôve seen WAY more SBQ nuke zones in the last week. Like, almost every sever has a fissure prime nuke on it. I think people on Xbox are actually pretty dang motivated right now.
---
I think the whole point of the story (at least what i took from it) was that each group had its own way of fighting back against the scorched plague, but because they couldnt work together they wwre killed off 1 by 1, this is echod by the overseer who in 1 of her logs specifically states "we have to work together"  which i think under pins the whole theme of this being multiplayer in an otherwise single player franchise
---
There is a ton of bugs that still crash the game like using aid items from your pip boy. Strangler power armor freezing everyone in the area. Also events  / stash / camps should be QOL updated again. An more but my brain is fried today I can't think.
---
they don't ban people nearly enough in this game...
---
I kind of agree, it's also really superficial player engagement, as I'm able to easily log into guild wars 2, elder scrolls online, and warframe without ever playing them if I want to for login rewards.
---
Or caps, lol
---
"Blast her with lasers. The scorch marks will make it easier to identify her later if she escapes."
---
That's where you're wrong. The more uproar something causes, the sooner will politicians have to listen and the more careful they have to be. Imagine maybe 50 years prior.. These brave people would've just been shot to shit. That's not going to work out today. Thanks to people spreading the word and knowledge. You don't wanna hear anything? Fine. Then don't but don't give people shit that take sides. Ever imagined that these people would go to hk if they could? Your ignorance baffles me bro 4 real.
---
Hahaha
---
No it isn‚Äôt a hazmat suit works just as well.
---
Every thing i do will have only the effect on me. The daily bonus is the same a exiting the game. You start it , go thrue the hoops to get to the point of getting the daily bonus and im out.
---
If there is no running or any movement involved it can be done under 3 minutes (depends on the pc involved)
---
Vicarious relief, here. I have every recipe. I'm still grinding away on the harder-to-find plans (mainly BoS paint schemes and the damn plasma grenade) and seeing someone finally succeed in locating one of these, even if not "in the wild"... Oof, I'm envious, man. :)
---
you‚Äôre right. wrong choice of word.
---
That's cause they PS4/Xbox1 proc's are both made by AMD.
---
I was going to go into a long post about tribalism and picking "sides", but this is r/fo76 and not the place for it. I've already taken it too far.
---
I‚Äôve burned through 4K scrip and not one fixer. I feel your pain.
---
I can get behind all of that - The stash limit is a ball ache without doubt.
---
So why did you even mention it? Want a pat on the back?
---
That's kinda my point, I shouldnt have pushed it in the first place.
---
Thank you. I have 5 luck and they just seem to hate me. I just want something that removes a small amount of rads while on the go.
---
It's a bit of a rough machine translation, but the characters under the red star read "Drunk Dragon Needles." It seems fairly fitting, but because they were direct translations, it's definitely open to interpretation. Anything that sounds cool works, Drunk Emperor Needles was another one that kinda works a bit better.
---
Whoops... I mean, what an awful place! The only thing I walk out of there with is rad worms!
---
Yea they need to stop the acid animation from reapplying over and over in a short amount of time. That‚Äôs the problem. Also, how do you know people are wearing armor in protest of survival being removed?
---
You know what you do in that situation right? You don‚Äôt even respond. Just drop it and move on, it‚Äôs not hard
---
Edit: proud of ya bud
---
A flat 1000 would be sufficient. I'm aware it's a survival game an gear management is part of the genera. But I'm a collector an dont want to toss my items that can only be earned once or have like a .02% chance of getting them.
---
On Xbox we should get a whole server and do this
---
The big reason I never used to engage players verbally in survival or role play a highwayman ect is because usually you're just giving them the opportunity to shoot you 1st.
---
It‚Äôs not by the style in which you call something real. It‚Äôs in the name by which you credit it as real. 
---
In the sense it‚Äôs is a fallout game. It may not have the isometric view our the npcs, or the comical sense of the others. But it is still a part the franchise. Enjoy it for what it has to offer.
---
I'm down!
---
Then cause an uproar where it matters. actually contact the politicians and bitch. Thats actually productive. Don't come to reddit and bitch thats not productive. 
---
Like I said if people cared, they would use outlets that actually get shit done.
---
I collect all nuked Flora materials for my "team". After nuke runs I load in my trader and everyone drops everything on me. Between 4 and 10 characters worth each time. In my experience, hrf is like less then 1/4 the possible 3 drops. Hardened mass seems to be most  common by a noticeable amount.
---
&gt;‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Patriot...and I play video games‚Äù
---
r/BrandNewSentence
---
My stash is too full to overprice things lol I need everything gone.
---
With the right setup Plasma Flamers are EVIL... so yes.
---
They sell for 12k an up. I paid 12k for mine on PC. Try the trade sub you'll have much better luck there.
---
 Yeah but I can go in the Golf Club and summon the entire thing, all 18 odd of em', and drop em' at my feet. That costs about 30% Health. 
---
 Bloodied is for babies.
---
Voice.
---
 You have nothing I want, but no. ;)
---
I thought Joe had ligma
---
i would suspect it was a plasmaflamer that thing has crazy dps but i assume you would have recognized the weapon in that case
---
Heavy, I‚Äôve heard.
---
This one is important and too many people don‚Äôt know it.
---
Having to try 3 or 4 times just to fast travel and disappearing legendary body's are my 2 hates
---
"Hey guys, why is this American history class focusing on all the terrible things that happened to America and its legacy during the Trump years, that's just dirty."
---
I like his style.
---
I secretly wish he was my partner in crime.
---
Come on that‚Äôs not proof enough to post on Reddit. I use mine at events too because I worked hard to get it. What you‚Äôre talking about is a small minority if anyone since you don‚Äôt have proof.
---
I drink 15 to 30 alcohol a day, I play every day, my addiction goes away after a while. I have a Addictol that I saved since the beta, that I've never had to use. I'm not currently addicted.
---
I think imma trade with the one who offered his power fist, if that doesn‚Äôt happen for whatever reason I‚Äôll hyu :)
---
Pulling out the HDMI and reinserting it also works on XB1
---
Or caps. I'd definitely play more often
---
Didnt know either until a friend demonstrated it to me
---
Junkies?
---
Lol kk
---
Vanguard armor is good for full health builds, executioners weapons (do 50% more damage when your opponent is below 40% health, great for PVP against bloodied builds), maybe vampire weapons? Anti armor is great, too. Just a few to name!
---
Defaulting pacifist to "ON" for new players sounds like a reasonable compromise to me. Once they reach level 5, display instructions on disabling pacifist if they want to try PvP.
---
&gt;plumon_alexy -3 points an hour ago  
---
&gt;Good. And i will have a script to autoload the game get the daily reward and kill the game. Passive profit. Love the idea
---
I think this may have been misconstrued then, It looks like you were saying your script and the daily log in would kill FO76 entirely, as in, Bethesda would stop because of that script, I think thats why you have downvotes, thats why I was trying to clear it up because thats how I read it initially too
---
Good riddance.
---
Based on your followup posts below I feel bad agreeing with you but yeah, it was kinda sad that nobody really had any will to try to stop HK from going back to China, since this kind of thing was on the cards from day one.
---
That's not what I meant and you know it. Teaching history is different than rummaging through someone's online comments (a complete stranger and non public figure). But whatever makes you feel good to justify your cancel culture-esque mentality. I'm out, peace‚úåÔ∏è
---
Vanguards armor junkie or vampires builds seems to be popular. Idk what type of weapon your going for but probably heavy guns or rifles.
---
I had a lot of fun with my Instigating Gauss sneak sniper chameleon build though too. I'm playing Bloodied rifles now though they are just too good.
---
How else you gunna prove it? Screenshots of text chat? Oh wait...
---
I‚Äôve been getting some good weapons too but not good enough for to want to keep. I either trade or scrip. Lmao yesterday I got an explosive anti armor pipe pistol. I thought that was hilarious
---
junkies is comparable
---
Yall are ruthless just enjoy the storyline and dont bitch manüòÇüòÇ soft ass children in this post thought we all went potty on the big boy onesüòÇüíÄüíØ
---
You said people as if it‚Äôs more than an isolated incident. That needs proof if you‚Äôre trying to spark outrage on Reddit. Spreading unproven rumors is dangerous.
---
This use to happen a lot if you fast traveled in 3rd person. I still sometimes to go into first person before I fast travel, because I adapted to it. ü§î
---
You forget that weekends have much higher rates than week days
---
Not if you expect to take a hit and survive.
---
I'm not a big PA fan either, but for Nuke Zones, it's your only choice IMO.
---
Cool. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
All my characters can do that, and take zero damage.
---
You just saved me alot of frustration OP. Thank you lol. I know what NOT to aim for in getting the backpack.
---
Where do you get the fixer plans???
---
Could explain why people don‚Äôt like limb damage? I feel like that‚Äôs a good stat but I always hear people say it‚Äôs not worth it, just curios at this point
---
I dunno. I've had 5 addictions (including alcohol) for 2 months now and I've never had to readdict myself.
---
I guess you've found an unknown way to cure addictions.
---
I‚Äôve found that one of the hardest things to get right in the game is inventory management.  I‚Äôve had to make tough choices on what I keep in my stash.
---
Why? Not like I‚Äôm talking about trolling and griefing people?
---
I just like to play differently than you. I liked survival but don‚Äôt really like adventure now
---
Yea i think I'll need to be more clear on my intentions. I'm currently waiting for more content.
---
Wait until you're on a server that is dropping good loot. Then go spend all your scrip.
---
Fuck yeah!
---
Hey what do you think of this for Yusuke Urameshi? Still have 3 points left.

I really like my vampire faster swing speed combat knife.
---
Maybe you should just stop talking bro. Really... You are embarrassing yourself. There are people fighting in the streets, I'm pretty sure they talked to the politicians and still do. You have no idea how the dynamics work there. Is all
---
They were starting to work together. The Free States started working with the people who previously hated them in Harper's Ferry. The Brotherhood came across the Free States and saw what they were doing with the Scorchbeasts. A member of the Brotherhood joined the Responders. They each had a piece of the puzzle, and were starting to out the puzzle together.
---
Lmao, nice!
---
Too bad my  Mistress of Mysteries garb disappeared off my character last night when I tried to take it out of my stash.
---
I'm running an antiarmor stealth build that is specced for melee, and vanguard, better sneak, ap regen armor. So far I've not found anything I don't do ridiculous amounts of damage to.
---
Ex-Liberal here what up
---
Yeah I‚Äôm a bloodied build with iron fist, gladiator, tenderizer, and mutations like talons, twisted muscles, and the adrenal one.
---
I'm an adult with a full time job, playing a video game for 2k hours and only spending $60 is a very good deal.
---
No, those are literally true statements. Super close.
---
Y'all know that Liberty Prime is a parody of McCarthyism, that ends killing his creators, and that actual china is one of the most important capitalist economies rn?
---
I'm pretty sure letters written to loved ones by soldiers during the American Civil War were never intended by the soldiers to be seen by schoolchildren across the country a hundred years later. Anything you say online might be in a Document Based Question on an AP US History exam in 2119.
---
Why would you need more switches?
---
Hk had to go back to China, it was leased from them by us for 99 years. Theres was nothing to be done to stop it and we all knew what shit it would cause.
---
If you change the sort to "value" or "weight", magazines will come to the top. Plans / Recipes  do this too.
---
We were talking Hong Kong but you got all triggered and starting talking Trump.....TDS is real folks.
---
Which perks do you use? I wanna use more strength perks but I‚Äôm really stuck using strong back as I‚Äôm always carrying a lot. I need to figure out how to lighten the load lmao
---
Sup, I'm done here. Not really the place to talk politics. My bad for engaging in the first place.
---
If I'm being completely honest - it used to seem to me that Limb Damage was as relevant as FFR here on the Reddit Market.... but after Beth and their Limb Damage drop glitch - even Ranged Weapons felt the scalding burn people felt with it. There's people that still understand it's power (like myself) but unfortunately they take some finding right now as a ton of people became jaded against limb damage.
---
I mainly have unyielding armor but not a full set
---
Liberty prime never talks about capitalism, only Democracy and communism (which china claims to be)  
---
Also he is specifically targeted at the Chinese  
---
Also, nothing can get you more pumped than [this classic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=298Cw3_qGwE)

Lol that‚Äôs awesome.
---
Did you check the roof? I had this happen once an it ended up on the roof. Try storing an replacing the generator maybe too?
---
Literally just experienced this bug today. Infinite loading screen wasted all that time and bullets for nothing.
---
That is awesome!
---
Good luck boating out of WVa
---
 Nerd Rage, Adrenal Reaction, Radicool, etc?
---
I can walk and chew gum at the same time.
---
If the previous comment doesn't help.... you'll need to move your camp to get it back unfortunately.
---
$100 per month in the atom shop... Jesus dude you have no perspective if you think that's trivial.
---
What do you mean 'while they are joining?'
---
For leveling up faster, doing the various events as they pop up will of course earn you the exp for event completion as well as whatever you earned for killing baddies during the event.
---
As far as inventory management, it's difficult to answer specifically, but in general you should ask yourself what you're using to repair the gear you use most often, and focus more on that. Also, you gotta be willing to say 'screw it' and sell some stuff you would otherwise keep in a game with no stash maximum.
---
I was just agreeing with the OP and the TDS kids came in screeching and slinging poo because I post on T_D lol.
---
It was a good time.
---
Huh, that‚Äôs unfortunate
---
There's at least a one minute lag where your base is loaded in for everyone else but you haven't loaded in yet
---
How about removing useless building restrictions and debugging the code first?
---
Until they fix this, if you go into first person before you fast travel, it should stop it from happening.
---
Yeah - Place Anywhere.
---
I hate to break it to you, but level does not equal skill. You can get to level 100 by afking naked in an outhouse and never looting or killing anything.
---
You have a hard time differentiating between real life and games. I'm nice to people in the game.
---
Doubt it. I have several red hats.
---
Didnt see these two mentioned
---
Monster Mash at watoga high school.  Pvp may happen though.
---
Event: One violent night is also super lucrative if you can keep people from spawning the boss too soon.  Get the bar most of the way across and just stop playing instruments and repairing the jukebox till you have like a minute and a half left then finish and spawn the boss.  On a good run you will walk away with 5 or 6 legos.
---
Yes, it isn't on a roof or under a floor. I'm replacing the generator right now
---
Edit: It's back!
---
The C.A.M.P. was actually glitched into the generator. Thanks for your help.
---
I see, So you have to happen to be in the very spot their base is...
---
Strong back is no good imo. My strength perks are traveling pharmacy 3, lighter armour 2, lighter ballistic ammo 2. That's it. The damage all comes from low health perks and str bonus from unyielding
---
Gamers‚Ñ¢ don't understand subtext, all they see is "cool robot wow!"
---
I have adrenal reaction and use radical, I‚Äôll try to move some points around to get nerd rage, which category is that in?
---
Hmm.....guess ill save my pennies for the 50% off sale. Then i can be royally pissed when i dont get one after blowing 1000 script at once, lol
---
He is a giant robot that nukes whoever he has been ordered to, without distinguishing them with the pretext that they are an enemy of the USA, meanwhile he screams that democracy is non-negotiable.
---
 If you can't get the irony there, I'm pretty sure you don't get how the Fallout universe is a criticism of Capitalism, Corporations and McCarthyism, and you are missing out one of the biggest points of the franchise.
---
Nah it is a perfectly sensible way to see how honest someone is or how educated they might be.  For example if I see someone claiming that Sanders has the best grasp of economics of any candidate and then I see they post in fullcommunism or CTH I don‚Äôt bother attempting a discussion with them as they likely aren‚Äôt that well informed.  If someone claims to be wealthy and then has a post history about defaulting on loans then I know they are full of shit.  Post histories can tell you quite a bit.
---
That being said I think OP forgot that China was democratic before it became Communist.  HK‚Äôs democratic roots might be in the UK but it is a stretch to claim it is the only reason that HK has any rights or democracy given at onne point their largest neighbor was democratic.
---
**COMMUNISM, IS THE VERY DEFINITION OF FAILURE.**
---
Ur on xbox? Im just curious
---
Oh wow, if you have time, which low health perks do you use ?
---
I guess that‚Äôs really vague haha! Fallout 4 had seven million different power and control options for building, getting even 3 new ones in this game would allow me to build countless new and cool contraptions :)
---
Could have maybe moved under the foundations as well. If not idk. You might have to move CAMP an rebuild sadly if you really need the repair all.
---
I'm working on my car atm but I'll be happy to do that when I get on later!
---
Intelligence.  You need that one for sure.
---
lol awesome
---
Alright bet , thanks bud
---
That‚Äôs no problem, thanks man, I appreciate it !
---
No. The game gets designed to make everything a huge grind so that the atom shop looks more attractive to the whales. The entire game design process is tainted by whales that are willing to dish out the cash for everything because they won't put up with the ridiculous grind to get the free atoms. Bethesda knows that because they designed it that way.
---
The whales are not your friends. They don't pay the bills, they make the rest of the game a huge grind because it's only purpose is to direct people back into the atomic shop to keep spending.
---
Replacing the generator fixed it. The C.A.M.P. was actually glitched into the generator.
---
Greetings Members .... BbbbbbOT STOP
---
Man some of my favorite events good to know on the Atoms though.
---
\*slaps roof of car\* This bad boy can fit so much radiation in it.
---
They said the old stuff would remain the same, and if you start a new character you can go directly to the new stuff or the old stuff. I would think you should probably do the flatwoods stuff in any case tho. I don't remember where I heard it. I'm thinking it was in the Quakecon video.
---
Ah yeah figured as much. Glad it worked out for you.
---
The enclave and brotherhood agree on one thing.

#DEATH TO ALL COMMUNISTS

Ah that made more sense, i never played any other fallout game so i figured that the amount of power condiuits where planty üòú
---
"This time on Roadkill, it's the Boost Caboose!"
---
First of all Fuck China, Free Hong Kong.
---
Second, it's funny because the communist bots in this game were released by an American government official to drum up anti-communist propaganda and patriotism.
---
Edit: which is exactly what we're doing here in this thread, haha!
---
My friend was having that trouble for a while too. You have to do a certain % of dmg to it to register. Good places to level up are whitsprings, west tek, harpers ferry, and events. Make sure to get the well rested bonus and intelligence boosting food and chems will give you more xp. If you also see high players in high lv areas farming just shadow them and get in your hits. I have some low players do that with me sometimes I don‚Äôt mind. Big bend tunnel in the ash heap is a good place also. Watoga too.
---
I lost mine a month ago it‚Äôs highly annoying that we can‚Äôt recall it and place it without moving camp.
---
You can walk around in build mode and it will highlight things in yellow if they get destroyed ... if that is your worry.
---
Only issue is you can‚Äôt top off things ... you can only repair if destroyed.
---
Whatever
---
I'm afraid to do the raid because of the people who have lost their inventories to the raid related bugs.
---
It's subtype is that of the parent damage effect   
---
&gt;demolition expert, fireproof, and dense armor have no effect on legacy  weapons so that's why I say they don't appear to be explosive damage at  all. 
---
Unless something major changed in the last couple weeks I'd say there was something wrong with your testing methods.  
---
With repeated tests, using controlled conditions (Same stats, armor, weapon, range, repeated multiple times and averaged, then done with control weapons, etc)  Dense, Fireproof and the rest 100% have an effect, it just appears to be scaled differently than pure physical damage.  
---
Energy damage resistance is calculated a bit different than physical damage, and that alone could explain the oddity that is Legacy Explosive weapons.  
---
**As a side note:**
---
It's important to do the tests with non-bloodied weapons, preferably a Legacy that does not modify damage, or resistances, to get more "pure" results.
---
Plenty of people think spending 2,000 hours of your life on a video game is a massive waste, but you're both adults who can make your own decisions about how you spend your resources.
---
Still trying huh? Hope you get there soon bro

I make a lot of random food, and die a lot üòÇ I'll have to pay more attention.

The key to beating griefers is to be competent enough to outwit a 12 year old kid. Anyone complaining about PVP being unfair has failed to do that.

My amount of playtime doesn't negatively effect his experience. His ungodly spending means the game I like gets more and more grindy to hope I'll spend like he does. Fuck that noise. Shut your wallet and stop feeding horrible industry tactics.

Right on man. FO76 game is dead to me, playing something else, I think I will reinstall BF4. Thanks for that idea.

WR SP 2H weapons with Martial Artist 3 ftw.

Mine was actually glitched into the repaired generator. Maybe your is also glitched into another camp item?
---
it runs on radiation =)

Lol.  I knew this was coming.  Tried to head it off at the pass.  But i am serious and i listed level to prevent the trolling and 'they are just better than you' b.s..
---
Step outside of the workshop boundaries, let them initiate a takeover, and then YOU choose when hostilities commence. They can't hurt you until you re-enter the boundary. Use the game mechanics to your advantage, play smart, and have situational awareness at all times. It's the end of the world.
---
I had no idea you could name stuff
---
I think it‚Äôs glitched into the side of the bridge I built under I have removed panels and flooring but gave up.
---
Glad you found yours though.

Well, if you say so. You're lucky I have a thing for asian girls

19% HP bloodied is 3.24x your damage. Covert Operative Mister Sandman sneak attacks are 3.75x your damage. So probably that one. Daytime damage will only be 2.5x your damage though. Mix in critical hits for damage which ignores any damage mitigation and deal even more damage. Toss on Concentrated Fire for head shots and potentially double all of that. It even doubles your critical hits too. 
---
Free aim bloodied doesnt stand a chance against a proper stealth vats build for solo play. If you care about large events like SBQ, bloodied is likely better.
---
This one thinks maybe your paws should be bigger
---
Realistically bethesda is gonna give it either way, that‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt even update the jill tracker till days later, all games do this, it‚Äôs just for some sort of imaginary incentive
---
How do you get the brotherhood tag?
---
For PvP or PvE?
---
At least they fixed the whole game hang when you exited your PA that was driving me insane.
---
I think most all game issues are lag and rendering related.

Got 6 HRF in the Blast Zone yesterday.  Didn't join the Queen Hunt just went through the grove harvesting flourescent flux and on the way out got stormed by Super Mutants and Scorched who both had HRF.
---
In case you don‚Äôt already know, go into settings and turn on pacifist mode. That‚Äôll keep you from being hurt by other players unless you claim a workshop. :)
---
I‚Äôd be shocked if it doesn‚Äôt at least reduce their numbers, since raiders are returning as a faction they‚Äôll no doubt take control of a number of previously Scorched-held areas, or at least abandoned Raider encampments. At least that‚Äôs my assumption.
---
I‚Äôve seen this before but had no idea the camp was vulnerable during this moment. Kinda scary.
---
Hmmmm I'll go test again. I've never seen my damage go up with demolition expert when I use my BE Laser Rifle.
---
&gt;it's a subtype of the parent damage type.
---
What damage type would a nuke mine be?
---
I've been saving up on resources for the past couple of weeks since it seems I've reached a point where I don't have much to do in regards to normal quests.  All I really get are the daily quests.  I'm really just kind of building up my camp and helping my brother out to level up before we do anything.
---
Thanks, pretty sure we pestered you via PM as well, grateful for the fast turn around.

It's definitely satire meant to poke at America's flaws. If we'd all been a little less extreme and saw our fellow humans‚Äîregardless of politics‚Äîas people, we might not have blown the whole damn world to hell.

well, I was just matching your tone.  Since your originial post was full of snark and vitriol, I figured I would speak to you the same way.

very very established issue..

We have a couple theories as to the root cause, but lack the ability to make and test changes :(

I feel like it was miss opportunity for having all missile silos are the same.

Confirmed it should be resolved in Patch 14.0 :)
---
Yeah, I'm on Xbox one.  Those constant crashes were really testing my rage when I was doing Power Up X-Powerplants.  I'll probably get to a silo mission soon, I'm really just kind of building up my camp and helping my brother out to level up before we do anything.

No, was on the fence if those are supposed to be "Costumes" or not, as they are linked to an in game religion
---
He‚Äôs 12, dont think economics is offered that early. 
---
But to OP clearly yes it would cost them money. 1 person buys a the fridge in the atom store and you being cheap don‚Äôt want to spend real money but wants your ‚Äúcake‚Äù gives the buyer 1000 caps instead. There would be no reason for people to actually buy something from the atom store if you can use fake in game currency to obtain it
---
lol random food is best food. Props to you for walking around with 15-30 alcohol though. I wish their effects lasted just a bit longer.
---
If you have extra gear you can‚Äôt even use (presumably too high level) I would at least make sure you are not hoarding more than one piece of each piece of armor (chest, leg, arm). 
---
To level up fast rest to get that xp boost and do path to enlightenment even when it pops. Then at your level you should just loop through whitespring clubhouse and cabins and over to west tek. Clearing those should give you a level or so. If someone launched a nuke... even better, more xp in those zones.
---
Edit: sounds like you are about to launch a nuke. Go for the queen.
---
Sniper-Barrel. He was a rifleman build. I'd understand cammando builds getting past the 75% chance to avoid most if not all damage. Though it felt as if the sniper-barrel plasma rifle was bypassing it 100% of the time.
---
Same here
---
Sniper-Barrel. That's why I'm confused. I'd 100% get if it was a flamer roasting me.
---
You were on vacation for almost 3 months? It was available more than a single week
---
Both! :D
---
I recently obtained a two shot FFR plasma. I modded it into an automatic vats pistol. It seems critical hits fix the two shot accuracy issue. Considering it takes half a second to update vats accuracy changes, every critical hit allows me to land about 6 head shots reliably in a row.
---
Last week a guy with full sentinel/assassins told me he could only die to staggers. I told him my vats pistol would melt him. He asked for a friendly demonstration and I killed him within a second. Those critical hits ignore sentinel armor.
---
The plasma is vats expensive, but the damage more than makes up for it. Also, the fact that it set targets on fire likely means he was using the critical hit receiver attachment. It gives around 34% more critical damage in addition to fire damage.
---
the plasmaflamer is considered a rifle as it benefits from rifleman perks even though it seems like it should be commando :D
---
but i get you well my best bet is that it was just a bloodied or anti armor one with faster fire rate they are quite powerfull even more since the armor penetration fix
---
Ah, nice. I still keep my bloodied character though!
---
I've got a Furios Swing Speed Combat Knife with 90% weight reduction that does pretty well
---
Yeah I love PVP. Dont worry I'm not  taking vent posts seriously haha. All the "remove PvP" posts seems more like venting but idk I guess it hypes up people who just hate PVP.
---
I play on xbox and don't experience 90% of the bugs I see reported here
---
THIS PLEASE, WHY ARE THE POPULATIONS NOT RAMPANTLY INFESTED, RAAAGE, CUTMYLIFEINTOPIECES!
---
Level up, sleep before heading out form your camp, eat cranberry cobbler, have the perk card for extra exp if in a group, kill all the things, cook all the things, build all the things.  
---
Sell your cap limit to a vendor every day to limit inventory, also I sometimes just leave surprises at train stations for someone else.
---
I kinda doubt it is the video card bottlenecking anything.  I've found that tighter ram timings (not just ram clock speed) help those minimums.  That not overclockable cpu is also a likely candidate over a second gpu.
---
SLI and RAID both go the other way, they are faster, but with more latency. Your problem is not, not having a high enough high speed fps, your problem is the bottom end. You need to remove latency for an improvement, not increase it.
---
Does anti-armour or armour pen by pass those two legendary effects?
---
Bethesda has wares, if you have caps!
---
üëç
---
I will look into this.  Thanks.
---
IMO Vanguard powered with anti armor/executioner/vampire
---
Maybe I'll try that, never thought to hang around at the border like that. I just prefered the straight forwardness of survival mode shoot on sight, going to have to readjust to adventure life lol.
---
not sure i guess not but as far as i know if you are staggered the sentinel effect doesnt work and i could imagine that the weapon has a stagger change maybe due to its fire damage
---
This ones hands may be small but they still work and allow for more intricate work.
---
Could he of reliably had critical hits with the AP cost of a sniper barrel on top of just the general high cost of Plasma weapons? It wouldn't shock me, though I'm more or less impressed by its sheer damage and bypassing of those effects. I know now, or have known for a while since the nerf to sentinel/assassin that fire-rate weapons (Heavy guns/Commando/Guerilla perk weapons) would shred it. It's just kind of god seeing a rifleman perk card weapon doing it. It was so, so fast.
---
Khajiit has all the shinies and plenty of missles for sale.
---
Please, just no horde of charred feral gouls. I don't know if they are glitched for me but just two can kill me in seconds at level 60. Nothing else is much bother, but those things... my nightmares.
---
and robobrains
---
I‚Äôve got a full vanguard sentinel set. Sounds sweet! I like heavy and rifles better though.
---
Gotta go for that!
---
Sweet! I want to go for either LMG or something like handmade/fixers.
---
what‚Äôs joe?
---
Nice!
---
Im kind of hoping they make the Fasnacht Masks drop for this event. I mean, if theyre being accepted as a costume you can wear for the event, they should make them drop from the event as well. Mostly just hoping, doubt itll happen. I really want that sweet Skull Mask that never dropped. Lol
---
I‚Äôve got no junkies weapons, better get to trading!
---
A horde of scorch beasts
---
A hoard of Grafton monsters
---
A hoard of sheepquatch
---
A hoard of deathclaw
---
A hoard of super mutant suiciders
---
It's the new gen 76's mate.
---
It's like 
---
Excuse me sir, 
---
Excuse me...
---
Is it ok if I shoot you in the face.
---
This is exactly how I'm set up and it's great. AA FFR vats handmade with full Vanguard sentinel armour with a vampire ss dcg for melee. Can highly recommend
---
If you know anyone that‚Äôs got a Junkie‚Äôs/Vampire‚Äôs FFR+FR LMG. Hit me up!
---
This one thinks that smaller hands don't do other things as well
---
Sweet!
---
You continue to unlock perk cards that you don't yet have after level 50. So it is entirely possible that you are still gaining extra power after level 50. In fact I think some don't unlock until you are level 50.
---
Yes
---
Khajiit has no limitations because of her small size.  She thinks you talk like a spriggan lover.

I cant remember the website I was on but it gives the full codes for each silo  for the week each week

Welcome back from the dark side brother. I run a full set of Vanguard BOS combat armor and BOS underarmor for almost 600 DR and 600 ER. My Instigating non-explosive Lever rifle does 2000+ head shots all day. You do not need more than that and no longer will wet yourself when something gets too close to you...
---
And my axe!
---
In dozens upon dozens of runs of Meat Week, I got exactly 1 of the fireworks.  It's so rare for me I didn't want to use it.
---
With Critical Savy and 15 luck or so, it feels like it takes me a single shot to get a critical hit back. For me, it is likely the insane fire rate and extra projectile that allows me to critical hit spam so quickly.
---
Really awesome to see this was already in the works :)
---
Get over yourself trying to ‚Äúout‚Äù someone as using T_D. Big whoop. So what does that have to do with this sub?
---
Dude, they WANT to murder you. They don't need your workshop. They have entire separate storage characters for all of the loot they've liberated from their peace-loving victims. Do you think they need 3000 MORE screws?
---
You're asking a lion to go vegan. Don't waste your time.
---
We need some Power Armor helmet "costumes" :)  
---
The suggestion has been made and it would be exceptional to have for example the "Bunny Head" (I'm a raider so biased) be a "model Swap" like the rest of the Power Armor skins are.
---
It was designed to fit you in that space =)
---
Well considering the post has to do with HK it‚Äôs already quite political so I‚Äôd say literally everything
---
I sure hope so... that skull mask is amazing... I need it...
---
ugh god this virtue signalling is on every fucking subreddit.
---
Haha, sounds amazingly sweet!
---
&gt;Nah. Fuck China.
---
congrats you single handedly liberated china by saying this on reddit.
---
No.
---
this needs to end.  it was near impossible to duplicate pre patch 13, and there is not a single instance post patch 13 and the fix.  
---
there is no reason to be afraid of them, there hasn't been since launch.  and i wish people would stop spreading this a common thing.
---
This one has never been so insulted. There is nothing spriggan about this one or his paws.
---
You can get unlimited scorched spawns by standing next to a fissure site. Nothing like that for muties.
---
...eh, what?   You‚Äôre contradicting yourself.
---
it's perfect for halloween, too. don't know if it's going to be a reward, though. more hype for next fasnacht event.
---
The people in hong kong don't give a shit if some westerner reddit soyboy writes "FUCK CHINA" on reddit. You're not doing anything.

Someone ate a couple basket of sour grapes.
---
Alt+F9 if you have NVidia to record video. Then put it on Youtube. It helps a lot when you make a report.
---
Btw, some cheaters don't use aimbot, but they use radar. They see box over your character, and they always know where you are. If they stupid - they shoot in the bush or in the water in the middle of the lake, where you hiding.  But if they are clever - they just prepared for your coming, because they know where exactly you are and when you coming. Its hard to detect in video.

That is not a peaceful protest that is straight-up terrorism. Sure I'm all for democracy but doing it at the cost of innocent bystanders life? That's bullshit and those guys are just as bad as raiders and gunners in Fallout.

Power Armor and the Hazmat suits have a hidden "Spell Effect" that is what mitigates the radiation, Rad Resist in a Nuke zone without one of those 2 items equipped is effectively worthless.
---
Thats what i was thinking. Im not getting my hopes up. Itd just be nice. I mean, if you really think about it, the masks are counting as a costume for the event. They should be possible loot too.

Stop using a BE for testing, skews the data horrifically because the UI and interface won't always report the modified damage properly

I usually avoid scorched. Too easy and loot tends to suck. Hardly ever a legendary scorched either.
---
nukacrypt.com
---
This reminds me of the months I spent scouring Uldum for the one tiny item that would get me to the camel hoarder boss and mount in World of Warcraft.
---
Except that you eventually got what you were looking for.
---
Fairly sure the Nukamine is physical and radiation damage, so the default explosion would likely be Physical Damage
---
Hey, this post was five months ago and I re-read my semi-rant. I was pretty disappointed when I wrote it and can confirm it has only happened once to me. I do have this other bug causing me to not respawn,  with the camera circling my body. This glitch is fixable, just wait until the game let's you respawn. It may take 5-15 minutes, but it does work.
---
Another thing since I am an Unyielding build is that it removes my spawn points sometimes and either have Vault 76 as my spawn or not even that. That bug is way worse because you have to leave the game or invite random people to team spawn.
---
I also got with a good group (2 people) and we can kill the SBQ in 5 minutes and the Nuker can beat silos in 15. We farmed the Queen probably 70 times in a few weeks.
---
Not discounting your bug experience with the loading screen, Bethesda needs to fix this and the other bugs last year.
---
Ill deffo go in harder than I have, I want that 50%
---
However, isnt 35m way over the top, like wtf???
---
welp we are fucked either way if we dont get up a higher rate of killing scorched's
---
I get it often. Did it last week.
---
Yes but not very frequently. I remember seeing it yesterday for sure. Honestly it feels like 0 events are happening.
---
They've announced a ton of headgear and clothing will be tweaked for patch 14.0, so might be worth waiting until then to export a list.
---
Oh, that is weird then.
---
I believe you are what the PvP players would call a ‚Äúfood build.‚Äù
---
bruh im not a dataminer, I only have one legacy weapon to test with. that's why im asking you whats up and I appreciate the responses.
---
This one never said that his paws were not small also. This one thinks maybe you should not assume so much.
---
Liberty prime wants to know your location
---
Maybe this one is looking for another Khajiti with similar paws.
---
Just do what I do.
---
I assume everyone that beats me is a cheater.
---
There shooting lasers at you? And there from mainland factories
---
Actual /r/averageredditor
---
Fighting Scorchbeasts around Fissure Sites Alpha and Prime is also a good tactic, they'll keep summoning Scorched for us to kill.
---
Funny, you‚Äôve literally repeated the same insult. How original. How *below average.*
---
Playing blizzard games doesn't make you a supporter of the oppression in hong kong.
---
Blizzard doesn't support the oppression either.

Cry all you want but my money is still going to blizzard games :) They're infinitely better than this pile of shit that you keep playing.
---
Really enjoyed the episode guys, thanks for posting this! It's got a laid back hang out and chat vibe, so I liked that you had clear cut segments to give each topic more focus. 
---
For length, I thought an hour was great. Can't wait for next week!
---
If you dont mind a smaller build the brick walls can be manipulated so that interior walls only show the white but you have to place dual walls ...my entire house has double interior walls so that they are as clean as possible.... place 2 doorways in the same spot then edit them to whatever wall/ doorway you need ...it eats a ton of build space but i still have a 2 story house with 3 rooms bottom floor and a bedroom and bathroom top floor ....
---
Find someone over level 50 to run around with.  Let them enter a zone first so enemies spawn at a higher level.  You'll be leveling up every 20-30 minutes with the right partner.

They give pleny of ways in game to make atoms.  You only have to pay money if you are impatient and have everything NOW.

I‚Äôm pretty sure from the encrypted event but not 100%. I bought it from someone‚Äôs vendor

that's a great tip, thanks!

Then why do they bend over backward for China?

INSIDE THE VAULT - NEW LAG FILLED, UNDERWHELMING EVENT
---
It's part of the cycling world quests so I feel as if the RNG is just kicking you while you're down. 
---
Like how Opposum badges are at a 25% drop rate, so it's all too possible to get 10 events and no drop.
---
I saw it pop up earlier this week, but it seemed bugged. The heart never opened and there weren't any enemies around. It's a public event now, so at least it provided a free fast-travel point in the mire, which I used a few times.
---
And anyone who identifies as neither!
---
yeah, i was halfway thru eating the fourth page when i realized: "hey, this dosen't taste like grilled radstag"
---
Glad you enjoyed it! Was a lot of fun, next week we're talking Camps and quests!
---
I just meant ballistic and energy resist, not radiation resist. Though I appreciate that. üòÜ

lmao you must be new here.

Everything with this game comes out unfinished anyway.

*distant sound of spooky scary skeletons playing on an old radio*

Because you're outraged and overreacting about everything. And playing blizzard games doesn't mean you support it.
---
Does it make you angry that I'm still paying money for world of warcraft and bought the new call of duty?
---
***And I'm not cancelling either***
---
You want to steal this ones shinies!  Or turn her into a rug!
---
I don't price them individually. I just decide if the trade is worth it or not. Backpack plans go for 10-15k each so take that as you will. I had 16 possum badges I stocked up and found something to trade with them lol.
---
They're telling you stuff is on sale you ungrateful git.
---
Bruh you're projecting rn.
---
Affirmative!  Go Go Go! Request order! Request order! Request order! Go Go Go! Thanks!
---
At this point I strongly believe this is just excuse Bethesda's actions. We get that stuff comes back. We can check the store every Tuesday to see. If they bury free stuff, that is their design choice.
---
I'm sorry, but at this point, I really do believe that people are literally bargaining with the absurd prices Bethesda charges.
---
The atoms challenges each week and dailies are not even remotely near worth the time invested to acquire these items.
---
It's pretty fuckin high, for sure. They probably took an average of how many scorched are killed in the time period normally, and doubled it or something. 14m in four days. We've gotta go at it like an army of Brotherhood of Steel Paladins
---
M'iaq would do no such thing! This one is just looking for new friends, ones who have fur that go well with his floors.
---
Projecting what???
---
These threads always have the most boring, shitty reddit tier responses. I'm just waiting for you to call me an incel or something. All you do is post generic, easy comebacks that have no substance.
---
You **are** aware that your blizzard boycott will do nothing, right?
---
Not going to worry about your average Raiders' view of others' intelligence.
---
Maybe they took Sean Murray's advice and decided to keep quiet, nose to grindstone?
---
Yes, drop a nuke on it.
---
They only drop on lower levels bots. Go around vault 76 and you'll have plenty
---
Yeah, good shout. Even fighting one SB summons a bunch of scorched to fight
---
Apparently you also take fucking *flairs* on reddit seriously too.
---
Jesus fucking christ.
---
Afaik they know about the bug plasma goo piles but it is very unlikely they'd patch it before the community challenge ends.
---
https://i.imgur.com/1ZvM59l_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium
---
Upvoted, because this warrants constant visibility and attention.  
---
Maybe devs are waiting for another scathing Kotaku article or Laymen video, until things get done.
---
I just completed three of the challenges: Kill 76 Scorched with a Crossbow, a Plasma Weapon, and a Black Powder Weapon. For the plasma weapon, I didn't leave that many goo piles and the ones I did leave I picked up. My 76th of 76 Scorched kills with a Black Powder Weapon was done with the assistance of none-other than Grahm himself. Good times.
---
So, today I killed about 200 Scorched which works out to about 0.0015% of the remaining goal :-)
---
Do you recall them doing these advertisements near launch, or even during Wild Appalachia? They were seldom at most.  
---
I'm not ungrateful, I'm frustrated that Bethesda thinks that this qualifies as content. They know people are checking this hoping for updates to the game and other information, and are exploiting that viewership to peddle atom shop items that are on "sale" despite being severely overpriced.
---
Last game, my friend and i both had chameleon mutations and were hiding on roof tops to avoid a conflict.  Both of us were not moving and were waiting for a group running from the fire in Morgantown to pass us.  At this time, another group to the east were coming down the cliff to avoid the fire chasing them.  Leaving us in the middle.   Lets say, when a particular player started to shoot at the other group, 3 bullets hit my partner in the head and then switched to my location on another building and hit me in the head.  THEN, he was able to shoot at the new group.  Aim boting shoots at the nearest threat, so we knew what was going on.  Both of us were WTF.  So we watched the guy who killed us and he wiped out the other team singlehandly.  He was over level 150.  Now we know why.
---
How about a backpack mod that holds maybe 1000 and offsets the weight of the weapon and fuel making both essentially weightless at the cost maybe -30 DR/ER.
---
You should not be concerned. This one would never harm another one's fur. It ruins the look of the rug.
---
Liar.
---
This.  Rename your equipped frames so you dont accidentally destroy the frame.
---
I'm unaware of Sean Murray and NMS selling low effort cosmetic micro transactions during that period through official news feeds.  
---
I do not hate the 76. I'm frustrated because I want them to do better than this.
---
I think your power armor can hold up to accidental scrapes.
---
Sean Murray recommended they keep quiet and work on their game,  not to worry about updates. I'm not comparing games, that was his advice to them.
---
Should they instead put up an update that says we have no updates?
---
You *actually* thought I was taking your flair *seriously*.
---
Now who's the moron (it's you).
---
Check this out.  This is an actual first hand account that just happened.  The player does not even try to hide it.  Nobody on his team cares because they get a free win.
---
&gt;Now who's the moron (it's you).
---
Yeah no
---
You also don't need to type like an average reddit soyboy pretending you're in a tv show.
---
You're only mad because you are angry.
---
Another way for players who get bugged to fix it on their own is to swap weapons, though usually the player that has the bug can't hear it.
---
But if you are on discord or in area chat with another player who has the glitch ask them to swap weapons real fast and it will make the loop stop.
---
That's fair. I mildly misread. Apologies.
---
Well, Beth east(ATX) is probably trying to make sure we don't lose too much interest while Beth west is hard at work on Wastelanders and the prestige system. Also, if you use this sub for tips, you can usually earn 30-40 atoms a day in about 10 minutes of play. Not saying it's a perfect or ideal system, but personally, I have been able to save and get most of the stuff I really wanted relatively easily just by waiting on sales.
---
Mad? Angry?
---
Literally how lmao.
---
REQUEST AMMO
---
Yep, nice!
---
There are 2 pa spawn points in watoga that usually have t60 parts on them. One is on the roof of a building with a crashed vertibot and the other is right below it, near a crashed one as well.
---
This sounds so much like japanese f2p games, lol
---
Might just be it.
---
You also get a SB every 5 minutes.
---
Do any of the PA paints count as "costume"?  Like the Nuka Cola, Slocum's Joe, or Atomic Shop ones maybe?  I'm pretty heavily reliant on PA so it would kinda suck if nothing worked.
---
right on, my group has a bunch of 94 pa's and a couple people have full sets of the normal armors.  I don't get why people are so averse to running the missions: it's a pain in the ass to find a good server sometimes but once you find one with little or no lag it's actually pretty fun.  
---
That said the missions start to get a bit old after a while and I'd welcome another couple vaults opening up so we can face some new challenges :)
---
Turn off the notification. Go to your Daily Challenges, highlight it, and toggle notifications off.

Ah

Do shared kills count as two? As in, if two players tag and kill one scorched does it count as two kills? It's got to, right, otherwise we'd be way behind

Or you could worry about real world problems like Hong Kong or Trump literally turning his back on our allies...but FO76 is important too

If you are on ps4, I can give you a pair with calibrated shocks for free.

Your best bet for info is to watch the summer Bethesda QuakeCon presentation. It was discussed a bit there, but not much info other than '2020'.

Sorry I'm on pc but thx tho
---
No worries
---
Thanks!i will do sometime between revision :)
---
I haven't touched 76 in months because there is literally nothing drawing me in that is worth it. This one small change would at least make it feel like I'm making some progress without having to wear a clown hat while with 2 friend in power armor at a certain location to get a photo worth 5 points.
---
Thx
---
Congrats on getting a copy! Hope I'm as lucky some day.
---
Just to add, before someone tries your same route and effort, plasma grenade plans *only* drop from ash heap events. There was a misunderstanding and confusion between some individuals of plasma grenade vs pulse grenade. Plasma grenade plans *cannot* spawn in containers. Only events. Pulse grenade plans are not rare and can spawn in containers.

So excited aaaahh üéÉ

Already feeling ghoulish and mischievous

Overpriced for you is not necessarily overpriced for me.

you are not geared enough yet, sorry. you should be clearing it in 20 minutes, for the crafting designs which are the best in the game currently.
---
Thanks for the offer. I'm in no real hurry to launch even though I've gotten the codes a few times before assuming I would lol
---
Nice! Thank you.
---
The game is obviously making you miserable. Practice some self control and quit playing.
---
Bocar stands for HK.
---
Sooo...if i have a plasma grenade plan, what would it be worth in my ending machine?
---
Fuck CCP!
---
&gt;if we all stop giving our money to blizzard/activision then our "boycott" will in fact do something.
---
Key words **IF WE ALL**.
---
Barely even 1% of their userbase will do this. Are you seriously that naive?
---
XD
---
TOO LATE. ALREADY *DOING* IT!
---
They don't exist other than the ones you've mentioned. We can datamine some legendary effects for the 4th and 5th stars and Incendiary is one of them, but 5 star legendaries haven't been added yet and they may be different when they are.
---
&gt;alt-right
---
The fuck???
---
Haha! I finally came up with an ok idea for the counter, got excited, and we both know how it ended :) still even one new thing, including the counter would make all the difference
---
Fully modded people's weapons would be a great buisness idea
---
"Credit" means we both get xp and the ability to root around in its guts for semi-useful junk, but is it only one kill towards the Clean Appalachia target?
---
If you have workbenches and a tent blueprinted so you could put it up when you meet someone that would be cool. 
---
5.56 ammo, plasma cores, ballistic fiber, and screws.
---
Yeah i got one threw it to see what would happen and it all i got was a normal explosion
---
Or Japanese games in general maybe. Monster Hunter World isn't f2p and it has incentive to log in every day with a bonus at the end.
---
Taiwanese tournament winner: (paraphrasing) Free Hong Kong!
---
Blizzard: fires 2 announcers who were literally just on the same screen when this was said, and bans tournament winner without giving him his prize money
---
Blizzard: Apologizes profusely to China.
---
You: BLIZZARD DOESNT SUPPORT THE OPPRESSION FROM THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT!
---
I don't even need to say read between the lines. It's right there in front of you in black and white. If you're too brainwashed to see it, then that's on you.
---
there are actually 5 in watoga. 1 is inside the civic center and one is hidden behind a lvl 3 locked door
---
Whatever Dear Leader allows for, I assume.
---
Probably Hunny. I hear he's very fond of Hunny.
---
Well, let's hope they bow to Big Red and let the discussion last as long as we can.
---
That's a lot of scorched to split between &lt;100 people
---
Oh ok. Thanks
---
I was playing with some friends the other day and they got into a tussle with some folks at his camp and got slaughtered then went along their way. I ended up going shopping and found myself at the aggressors shop with a few other unsavory fellows. Needless to say, I high tailed it out of there. So yes, you can become locked into pvp from a cross the map if your teammates become hostile to another player.
---
And my bow.
---
How was I to know if it was fixed or not?
---
I got you man, what's your GT? Il be on tonight after work. I don't have a mic, but il message you everything to help you out after you show me your stash/inventory.
---
I've looked and they are jo were to be seen, i just don't understand
---
Also the workshop doesn't have to be owned to become a pvp zone, it could be unowned and if you find yourself there with another player claiming, you will be hostile to them.
---
&gt; If you're too brainwashed to see it, then that's on you.
---
No, they don't support the oppression from the chinese government and you acting like the fucking corporate entity doing something means all their developers also support it makes you a fucking idiot.
---
Seriously how stupid do you have to be to think this was some emotional or opinionated decision from blizzard corporate? It's literally just following their own rules about no political speech.
---
Stay mad. My world of warcraft subscription isn't being cancelled. Your boycott won't impact anything.
---
Now I'm wondering if I should charge mats or 200 caps for a full modded weapon of your choice?
---
I have tons of 556 on all my characters and I'm in the thousands with screws so I'm already halfway there!
---
Well, then what's your category of dysfunction? Some subset of troll.
---
Lead, acid, steel, gunpowder .556, .308, shotgun, screws,  gears, ballistic fiber etc
---
OK thanks for the info
---
I got 1 firework put together from both events and sold it for 2k it wasn't anything too special cause it's so limited
---
*cue video from Starship Troopers
---
I sold my 1 for 2 k based on what I saw people selling them at

---
I swap out the charisma perks if I'm on a team. Strange in numbers really bumps up the damage for unarmed melee weapons. I'll put on dodgy and demo expert for pvp. I put on cover operative for sbq
---
All the damage for the power fist is coming from unyielding giving 15 str. Radicool giving 5 str. Nerd rage 10%. Bloody mess 15%. Sneak and power attack is a huge multiplier. Adrenal reaction, talons and twisted muscle mutation give a ton of damage. Bloody weapon effect gives a ton of damage
---
They said that they are looking into integrating more pvp into the core game
---
Oh right you spend all your time on reddit arguing about politics in shitty subreddits and getting angry about DRUMPF.
---
Looks like I was bang on the mark in my first comment.
---
My guy resists

Yeah, I love the gun too much to conserve ammo though. Any deathclaw, sheepsquatch, scorch beast. I usually use my prime bloody plasma Gatling on the queen.
---
I‚Äôm on it
---
Charging caps would probably bring in the most customers but would require you to farm the mats yourself but only charging mats means you don't get any caps. So it really depends on how much work you want to do
---
i recently got quite lucky and got a AA 33%vats hit chance fixer  :) just keep trying!
---
And my sword.
---
Now they are in adventure mode messing with us. Ive been tricked once or twice into a PvP with a bloodied explosive Lazer rifle..
---
Stay mad lol
---
Living the dream right there, got one hell of a bonus for it too
---
Must suck being too obtuse to understand the connection.
---
Ok?
---
Oh the irony. All your posts are yelling at benign posts. Breathe, child.
---
Good luck on your GCSE's( my bad don't know what that's for lol) and agreed this community has far outweighed the game itself's reasons to keep playing lol
---
I would like that or buildings we could build on top of . In fallout 4 I always lived up high
---
you are SEETHING
---
You're used to deluding yourself, why stop now?
---
EA: Kinda greedy.
---
Blizzard: Side with a country that literally violates human rights.
---
Totally comparable
---
Reddit has turned into the 1 like = 1 saved African child meme...

I'll keep scrapping it.

Can't Macs boot into windows using BootCamp?

[Switch between Windows and Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208123)

Then it would depend on the specs as to whether this mac is up to it anyway.
---
1 like on this comment = one saved Hong Hong citizen! Let's do it guys XD
---
Lmfao get fucking real.
---
Outrage for EA was actually worse than this LOL
---
Nothing is going to fucking happen. The majority don't care and won't boycott anything.
---
&gt;you are looking into it too much
---
You barely passed literature classes, huh?
---
China has no dignity. The government is run by cowards. President Xi is a dictator. The Chinese people deserve better, but they‚Äôll never get it unless they over throw and revolt against the regime.
---
I'll make sure to bring it up in next weeks episode! We're probably going to make next episode a bit shorter, we spent a good 2 hours recording plus at least 3 getting ready to record lol.
---
Didn't you just complain about responses with no real substance? how the turntables.

 I'm on ps4.  I'd love to get those.
---
My main has had this stuck for weeks.  Even abandoning the quest doesn't work.
---
I've tried the running away thing and it hasn't worked for me. I can't get my head around why that should work, Bethesda reasons I'm sure.
---
Meanwhile my alt characters the quest works as normal.
---
You have been banned from Hearthstone.
---
You're supporting it implicitly by deciding it isnt a dealbreaker.
---
So you want to call a gov that has lifted more people out of poverty than any country combined in the last 50 yrs trash 
---
Ok
---
Some melee weapons also have the incendiary/flaming effect.
---
Honestly making this was a lot of fun! Only difference between this and us normally playing is that we actually recorded it lol
---
The RNG for it gets a significant boost when it's added to your character. The same way when you are looking for a specific car in GTA and search for hours, maybe days. Then as soon as you find one and start driving, every other car is that car you were looking for.
---
I just wish my favourite cave wasn't in such a remote location (far NE corner). Living there majorly kills customer traffic. My second favourite is so close to a fissure that I had to make a super ugly foundation bunker over the entrance to keep my shop safe from screech attacks. So yes. More caves, bigger and better locations.
---
Still looking, don't really care about the badge, I just like the hunt.
---
What the fuck are you on about?
---
Ironically your response has no real substance.
---
I meant average redditor replies. Generic, low effort shit like writing FUCK CHINA or calling someone an incel.
---
Bottom of the barrel type shit. 
---
Me saying your boycott won't do anything isn't generic low effort shit. Your boycott literally won't do anything.
---
No, I'm not.
---
No please. It would only be acceptable if it wouldn't replace a adventure mode challenge. I don't like to be forced to play NW for my daily/weekly atoms.
---
We didn't. We had solved everything. The Chinese bombed us. Do you even lore?
---
Idk who the biggest losers are- this company or the community. Fucking losers. I just watched three 200+ lvl fat fuck no life losers make a 10 yo cry cause they kept destroying all his stuff and took his workshop. This after I spent an hour helping him build it all and teaching him about the game. Fuck Bethesda, fuck this community and fuck this stupid ass game. This happens ALL THE TIME. I uninstalled and will not come back. I hope this company bankrupts and the players develop mutations that eventually kill them.
---
Increase your Int to 15.
---
Let's get it bois
---
Its bloodied right?
---
Is there really? I'm going to have to swim over and kill me some deathclaws to see for myself!
---
have more information on that one? that sounds like a possible avenue :)
---
Me too.
---
Part of why people focus on goals and objectives that are pretty worthless is an escape from those things. 
---
For example, I‚Äôm browsing Reddit from a hospital emergency room so I don‚Äôt need to focus on being surrounded by people in wheelchairs with hacking coughs.
---
If it is bloodied it might be because of your health increasing but I'm not sure.
---
The health regen - damage is capped at 110 vs players and there's a ton of ways to outright mitigate it further.  Dodgy, lone wanderer, fireproof, chems etc.  
---
 A lever action rifle has low ROF so while you can probably hit the 110 max even then a super stimpack can possibly outheal your dps.  
---
Others have commented on VATS.  
---
This is a great demonstration of why people who are serious about pvp use automatic weapons.
---
The atom shop prices are fine if you're only using free atoms. It's the real money value of atoms that's off the scale and way too high.
---
Nobody plays games on Apple.... nobodayyy
---
I've been told there's a couple on deathclaw island, but it's the completely opposite side of the map, so...
---
&gt;Can I get some citations on that number????
---
Perhaps look at **literally every game developer 'boycott' of the past few years.** The fact that you seem to think the majority will boycott them is the most naive/stupid/absurd shit I've ever heard. You can't possibly believe that right?
---
&gt;Also I've seem to hit a nerve.
---
you can still buy the recall keycard doohicky from npc vendors to spawn encryptid at will.
---
You don't need revenant or modern Renegade at all. Give those to luck.
---
Thanks for the info, wounder why they did this :/
---
Also done  "Event: Uranium Fever" at least 20 times since patch 13, no mask drop.
---
Ended up buying both mask on my main for 2x10k caps, but i have another character that also needs them, hope they fixes this.
---
Alas, another downfall for us console plebs! 
---
I loved building in 4, but I've noticed a lot of differences in what I can and can't "do". You have a lot more freedom in 4 compared to 76. 
---
What I'm looking for is something to play around with while I'm at work. Or on the toilet.
---
I laughed! I cried! I shot people in the face!
---
Good times, indeed! üòÇ
---
ok!
---
They were built in a Chinese spy lab under one of the factories.(I think Mama Dolce's) They have a ton of terminal entries about developing and deploying the little bastards.
---
Yes it‚Äôs bloodied but I pay close attention to my health. Also when I switch to my DCG the damage is fine.
---
And knowing Beth, it would 100% replace a adventure mode challenge.
---
All I can think of is that Fortnite burger meme lmao
---
"The look on Todd's face will be priceless!"
---
Today I have found the World's first mind reader!  He knows your intent so dont even try to hide!

Sarcasm aside, you're kind of a douche here.  Hypocrite to boot.
---
Psn Y3_R, I'll be soon
---
Run either bloodied commando (bloodied explosive laser rifle preferably) or bloodied melee unarmed ( bloodied deathclaw gauntlet swing sped and 1 strength preferably)
---
Would no surprise me if they did that as a Goodwill gesture.
---
I know this would sucker me in because some nights I think "Oh I'll just login to sell some stuff, make my caps" then 2 hours later I'm at some event and it's midnight.
---
&gt;you're kind of a douche here.
---
soy infused insult
---
You could get a lot of business from selling hard to find plans
---
The real treasure are the friends you made along the way.
---
Dude, people were nice to you because you do not speak Mandarin and you do not look like a person from mainland. You will feel the evil side of the human nature if you are a mainlander and only speak Mandarin.
---
Are you running full class freak and starched genes
---
Lol I'm a console pleb. You can get mods on xb1 bro. And yeah I would like some type of mobile version to play around with
---
Lolz if you ever do, hit me up and ill give u max caps and then some additional items XD.
---
What type of plans do you have in mind?
---
Time to break out my spooky suit.
---
Ok you're going to far with that its not communist they have so many socialists policies and all socialism with an authoritarian leader is communist and just because the people are free to make money doesnt mean the government isnt able to take all that they make when ever they make it
---
I assume since this"credit" extends to daily and weekly challenges that it will also apply to clean Appalachia challenge. Will it though? Who knows, last week no scorched enemies counted toward the "kill 3 diff. Type of scorched except 2( scorched and scorchbeast?),no way to complete. So share your kills and cross your fingers!
---
Well I'm sorry but I have no clue
---
Explain how in a literal second I die then. If I have zero time to respond or even draw my weapon that is still to quick to die. 325 health dead in a literal second.
---
Lol it‚Äôs all good. Thanks for trying!
---
Would be more excited if they talked about it more.  Wondering if we'll get no info until AFTER the Halloween event.
---
 [https://support.apple.com/de-de/HT201468](https://support.apple.com/de-de/HT201468)

Lol. Sure, little buddy.
---
Is the November release confirmed or speculation?
---
Idek what to expect cause idk the releases date I feel like there‚Äôs no info about it on the roadmap or anywhere really
---
Npc interaction. I wish I could make my idea reality that when the vaults open, its an actual event. Imagine every player gathering outside the vaults and waiting until at the top of the hour, everything goes quiet. Then out of nowhere, Take Me Home Country Roads starts playing and the vault door unseals, and the first dwellers come walking out cautiously.
---
You on Xbox let me get some screws lol
---
They‚Äôll probably let that one die on the vine.
---
I would also like npc interactions and I hope that there aren't just a few npc's and there are many including outposts and random encounters
---
lol ur a squishy again but jokes aside i am seeing this popping up more and more rather it be me friends or  random people.
---
Don't want to sound rude but what you said makes no sense at all, but I don't disagree that poor people in china is fucked up, just like in every capitalist country. The diference is that China is more authoritarian and freedom of speech is almost 0.
---
My loading screen lists me as lvl 1 usually, but sometimes as lvl 27(I'm lvl 126)
---
Nah, I'm actually still level 179. The number is just off. 
---
I just was surprised by this bug. Never saw it before. :)
---
I already have a job.
---
oh look the crafting glitch is back. this was in the game before so yay they brought it back
---
You just described the life of poor people in every communist country in history.  The middle class was invented by capitalism, before America all people lived under feudalism.
---
I‚Äôm on during the day Uk and am interested. Never run any of them though so no experience. Looprevil64 is my ign.
---
Damn, look at all these cucks supporting ‚ÄúFree Hong Kong‚Äù and downvoting those who speak the truth about these domestic terrorists, whom fly the flag of other nations upon their home country. Sad and pathetic. But, keep typing keyboard warriors if that helps you get through the day.
---
The level 1 loading screen thing is probably the game displaying the picture you took after creating your character.
---
ik lol just couldnt resist calling you a squishy
---
my loading screen always has me as a level 1 doesnt bug me none just find it funny
---
It says it at the bottom right for me, where the regular level goes. As with everything, I'm sure it's just the wild lag catching up.
---
History has shown time and time again that the government put in place by a revolution is most often worse than the one it overthrew.
---
Well keep up the good work! It was actually really refreshing
---
I had this happen too.  I noticed it mostly after a fast travel and then using VATS
---
Yes one of my friends on ps4 has the same problem. Ultracite ammo and serums. Sometimes he can craft and sometimes he can't whatever he tries and I do it for him.
---
+karma
---
Sheeeeet.
---
It was really enjoyable to record the whole thing. At one point Stacks was starving and I was *really* hoping he'd just die on camera and we'd keep rolling like nothing had happened lol
---
Oh, right now I know what you mean, while fast traveling etc. the level is at 1. Yeah, saw that one. First time that happened I had a mild heart attack.
---
I‚Äôd love that! Almost like the proving grounds or slaughter house in borderlands 3!
---
This sub has devs, data miners, and people who are familiar with the code; thought someone might know. But, it also poses a more philosophical, Schrodinger's type question. Of there's scorched in an interior cell, are they alive or dead? And, if you walk into the cell, and they all instantly die, were they truly alive to begin with? What is meat cook with no meat? Think about it.
---
I dont think it worked for either of us lol.
---
Dual boot works very well (or used to anyway, it's been a few years since I've done it).
---
You'd have to partition the drive and have a way to install windows, but after that it all just depends on the specs of the device.
---
&gt; before America all people lived under feudalism.
---
Oh god I'm going to shoot myself in the kneecaps rn
---
yep like originally it was modding stuff but later it become crafting certain items then they fixed it and now its back so yea good luck
---
I was gonna say fuck China without all that extra bullshit, thanks for beating me too it
---
That would be fun.
---
Which countries had prosperous peasants before America?   Please educate me.
---
Edit: no answer, just a downvote.  That's what I thought.
---
Great Chinese Famine, they just starved them out of poverty.
---
Bethesda said they were aiming for November, but they never gave us a concrete date beyond that.
---
Distant thunder (event) is a good way to get scorched. About 30ish per event, plus more depending where it‚Äôs at.
---
An idea I had before. "Moon cycle". After every X in game days, you have a dark moon. Basically, on that particular in game night, it is pitch black dark but mobs spawn 3x with high chance of legendaries spawning all over. Mobs also spawn in giant hordes. Only your camp is the safe zone. 
---
Wave survival can also work. You turn siren into an event trigger for your camp. The hordes get bigger and bigger until you lose.
---
Sounds like problems with .ini files. Those files exist in two locations. The one you mentioned above and one like This: C:\\Users\\YOUR USER NAME\\Documents\\My Games\\Fallout 76\\
---
You can add credentials in the second location by adding something like this (with no spaces between lines) at the bottom of the .ini file:
---
\[Login\]
---
s76UserName=YOUR USER NAME
---
s76Password=YOUR PASSWORD
---
Thanks man I would absolutely take that over survival
---
That would be very cool and I feel like that would be something that players would be interested in and it would have decent replayability
---
I hope that I can kill and eat them.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ddduie/i_have_come_to_the_conclusion_that_crafting/
---
Might fix the issue.
---
Thanks I think so toüòó
---
haha whatever be the blind fucking sheep you are then. Majority of people had no idea this was even a thing until it involved something they cared about. And in a few weeks everyone will forget about HK again because thats just how this shit works these days with tragedies. Look at every mass shooting that happens and then theres massive outcry for a week and then you never hear a damn thing again. This will work THE EXACT SAME WAY.
---
Wait what if they add pickpocket?
---
Ctrl-C'd the wiki:
---
"After the Great War, the Enclave seized control of the facility, eliminated the holdouts, and secured the technology.¬†President Thomas Eckhart later deliberately unleashed them on Appalachia, in an attempt to trick the DEFCON system into raising the alert status.¬†By¬†2102, many Liberators continued to function across¬†Appalachia. They were also used as a means to spread¬†Chinese propaganda, which can be looted from their inventories."
---
Yeah I think it would change the game for the better
---
Lol, that's fine. I have a team mate who is Bloodied and really it's his own dam fault. I'm fucking Vanguard. ;)
---
(Seriously, Bloodied and Vanguard in a team works great.)
---
Yes both very good ideas üëç
---
No i totally get what is being said. Its you fucks that refuse to listen to any opinion except your own. Thats just how the world works these days. All this shit will blow over in a few weeks, nothing will happen and nobody will care anymore. Thats how this shit seems to work in this fucking country. The attention span of children who move from 1 hot topic to another and nothing ever gets fixed. Its a constant cycle of cry, forget and repeat.
---
Good quests with human NPCs, new balance!
---
I think he's talking about Hong Kong, not China. Hong Kong was independent for the longest time, and China just recently decided it wanted it back.
---
i dont really do team stuff anymore only time im around others is events otherwise im alone all my friends gave up on 76

Well, you can add me if you're on PC, but the friends list is bugged for me, so I hope I can accept. 
---
Gearing up for Wastelanders by killing scorched! lol
---
Yeah it does tend to freak someone out when you're at a vending machine and a Yao Guai strolls in your direction but that's the tell, since when do Yao Guais stroll at you they're always charging, I did not shoot :)
---
BTW it was a nice &amp; interesting camp.

Actually the world went to war over limited resources, because an explosion in technology led to world wide shortages. Sound familiar?
---
I don't like those either. I'm only saying that NW challenges shouldn't replace adventure challenges. It would only be fair if Bethesda raises the total amount of daily/weekly challenges or replaces the perk pack challenge with them.
---
In second that motion. He is indeed a Cuntimus Maximus.
---
The great Chinese famine Happened. What‚Äôs your point?
---
You can't resist it, yes...
---
Hong Kong was ruled by the British then China. They were never free
---
They wouldn't have to replace them. They could have Adventure rewards and NW rewards.
---
No, if I spend $10 on 1100 atoms and buy an item for 1100 atoms then that item just cost me $10.  The free atoms do not change the price of atoms in dollars.  Just because I get some atoms for free doesn't change $10 gets me 1100 atoms.
---
Yeah, that would work. The exact time does‚Äôt really matter. Could be 10 sec or could be a minute for all I care haha
---
on ps4 since my pc got melted thanks to my cat
---
Since you are bringing this up, there are few things I want to say as a Chinese from China Mainland. The whole thing began with a HKer killed his girlfriend in Taiwan and HK government wants to send this murder to the Mainland so they are adding a regulation to accommodate this action. Apparently, some HKers think HKers should only be judged in HK so they against this regulation. However, after a some time, for some reason, protests started to doing violent actions like throwing Molotovs to police and off-duty police, robbing stores, and burning down banks. Many people include university students, indicate that they can get money by doing those things.
---
At least in series of events, Beijing and ordinary Chinese do against protests' violent actions but have no comment on anything related to freedom. Many Chinese are actually surprised or even angry that this time no movement from Beijing. HK protests hide their violent actions and say they are fighting for freedom.
---
When did you decide China was capitalist? That's news to everyone in the room. The government controls all the means of production and the products, that makes them... I'll wait for it, it's fine.
---
I'm a PvE player and I haven't noticed any "harassment".
---
Do people not realise workshops are PVP?
---
No, they're not inconvenient to my argument, they're irrelevant.  If I spend $20 and get 2400 atoms then use 1400 of those atoms on one power armor skin then that power armor skin just cost me $11.67 of the $20 I spent.  Getting free atoms doesn't change the pricing of atoms in dollars.  $20 still gets me 2400 atoms and that gets jack shit.  Paying $11.67 for power armor is absurd.
---
My Int is 12
---
Technically no, but up until recently they have been allowed to operate independently, on everything.
---
Lmao when you throw a hissy fit online becuase your wrong
---
 If Bethesda doesn't want to piss off their player base further, things should still proceed, regardless of what's left to kill.
---
Bethesda needs to add this as a feature. Some people's Levels ARE TOO DAMN HIGH!

You learn a thing or two about currency.  What am I saying that you aren't getting?  Spending $20 gets 2400 atoms.  If I use some of those atoms, 1400, to buy a power armor skin then I just used $11.67 of the $20 I spent to get it.  Is spending $11.67 on power armor worth it to you?  Yes or no?  It doesn't matter you can get it for free by grinding atoms.  The fact of the matter is that if you bought the atoms from the store then it would cost you $11.67 for a single power armor skin.  That's absurd.  Yes you can get it for free.  But that's not what I'm talking about here.  Just because you can grind to get it for free doesn't change that the alternative is spending a ridiculous $11.67.
---
Camden Park is good for a dozen and you can do your daily challenge for tokens. If you want higher level scorched, head over to Mosstown and the area around Harper's Ferry and the purveyor.
---
Same. And then I just drop whatever I don't actually have use for.
---
I'd go for the newspaper-wallpaper IF there were also a matching newspaper suit you can wear, then stand up against the wall &amp; take a pic :)
---
LMG has lower per shot damage but much higher fire rate, maybe it's because you'd need more shots from an LMG than a .50 cal so you feel like the .50cal kills faster. I think the LMG has worse recoil so maybe you missed some shots as well.
---
Imo I'd just pick the .50 cal because it has way better ammo efficiency. I am personally using b25 .50cal tho, just to save some perk points.
---
$11.67 for a single power armor skin is overpriced for anyone.  What you're saying is you'd still buy it anyway.
---
Also don't forget Valley Galleria and inside the Top of the World, there's a bunch in those and lots of good junk to scrap.
---
It‚Äôs a game not rl you weirdo
---
What is this now, Star Citizen??
---
or you could find a random person minding their own business and walk into their house and shit on their living room carpet... which is essentially what you're doing to us right now by bringing politics into this sub.
---
I can't escape this shit. Do something if you actually stand with them. This does fucking nothing. 
---
Thoughts and prayers
---
Woah wait what??  There's readable magazines/books????
---
Splitting servers between pacifist and non pacifist will allow non-pacifist to take workshops without having to worry about being contested. It will split already thin numbers even thinner IMO. The only way PVP continues to work is to teach these players who fear it HOW it works, why they are doing no damage or have weak defense, etc.
---
I"m just pointing out that a very large portion of the community doesn't actually give a flying fuck around here and its all karma farming because its the popular opinion.
---
I'm not throwing a hissy fit I'm just saying what the reality of our world is. Just you watch. Nobody will care by the end of the year.
---
These are fun too. The death tambo makes a satisfying jingle when you kill them and you get free atoms!
---
I feel like I shouldn't laugh at that, but the way you said it is hilarious.
---
Anyway, just use Area Chat. You'd be amazed at how fast you make friends. Even if you're not that sociable. Just say: "Hi, I don't like to talk that much but I have a mic for when the need arises." It changes the dynamics of the game for good. :)
---
Why are you saying "Nah" if you're agreeing with OP?
---
Dabney Homestead in the Mire. It's a workshop with 3 copper extractors.
---
Even just paint would help. It gets so annoying seeing all the CAMPs being red, brick or concrete. Why can't I use a bucket of yellow paint and make a yellow wall?
---
I know many people here are just playing memes but this time really there is nothing to do with freedom. The regulation is already abolished.
---
lol yea it is funny and tragic rip computer 
---
i myself havent really been on lately most of the time now when i get on area chat its been people being rude as hell and constant yelling so i just do my business then hop back on to fallout 4 let it die or bloodborne lol
---
Ah I see that makes sense then.
---
There's no need. The way it is allows people to wear whatever they want as headwear, or no headwear at all.
---
Fixer, backpack mods, fasnacht, plasma nade and stimpack diffuser are some of the most sought after. Then some other popular ones would be meat week(maybe not now but in a few weeks when time has passed), free range mod plans, PA calibrated shocks, BOS PA paints and im sure theres a few im missing but thats a start
---
One minute? I seem to load in before my base on PC. Is this a console thing?
---
I see no implication between "putting PvP people with PvP people" making "workshops taken over by PvP people free from being contested"
---
agree with this very much and letting us change the color of it would be amaze balls
---
Were that the case, they'd definitely raise atom store prices. Prices are that high for a reason. To make you feel uncomfortable enough to pay for atoms.
---
That's what makes it a joke I think.
---
Yes, like Line In The Sand but much more harder.
---
I can think of a few themes:
---
1. Mass Scorched Resurgence
---
2. Appalachia Legends Parade
---
3. Ghoul Wild Hunt
---
4. AWOL Army Robot Platoon
---
5. Super Mutant Conquest
---
6. Deathclaw Nesting
---
You don't see how this would allow PvE players to take workshops uncontested, being separated with other PvE players? The player base needs to be mixed.
---
.50 over LMG, always.
---
the 50 is just a superior weapon.   Its higher per shot damage (which means less shots) and the ammo is way more efficient to make.   Its just a bit harder to aim.
---
Don't take it the wrong way, but there's always people like you who say that at the start of every change. I'm going to keep upvoting every symbol in hopes that they will have to censor their own money makers (overwatch and the "free Mei" to the paddles) in hopes a Winnie the Pooh situation happens. 
---
Maybe you don't understand and that's fine, but not understanding and trying to get people to stop under the pretense "nobody will care soon" is so ass backwards and a massive slap to the people living there. I couldn't even imagine how you would react if the government arrested you for anything you say or do online that they don't like.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure all the Atomic Shop stuff is already made, they‚Äôre just implementing it over time. The Scavenger Bot was supposed to be included in the base game at launch
---
You're absolutely right, though, the yield on crafting 308 Ultracite ammo is great.
---
WHAT?
---
it the Union Uniform a costume?
---
If  you ask most people who shop at Walmart... yes.
---
It's not like anyone who shops there is unaware of what they're supporting.
---
Wrong sub
---
I'd actually like to see competing hordes; a group of super mutants vs ghouls, or epic fights between larger creatures like a pack of  deathclaws vs a few Mirelurk queens. I recall in earlier FO games, having even seen deathclaws fighting amongst themselves. Every now and then I see monsters fighting among themselves in NW, but it's generally just one-on-one.
---
You clearly don't know how this works.
---
Hard reset your XBox (long press on the center controler button, select reset xbox).  
---
Sometimes the game data doesnt purge from the cache when you just leave the game and shut down.  This doesnt happen if you power down console, it doesnt reset the cache.
---
If you hard reset, it causes the cache to clear and you end up being much more stable the next time you log in.
---
If we look at Bethesda's previous DLCs, we get a pretty good idea of how much content they can whip up in a year. In terms of the amount of new quests and NPCs, I'm expecting about as many as were added with Dawnguard, or if we're being optimistic Shivering Isles (minus the landmass of course). That would be a main questline about as long as the one in the game right now, plus a handful of side-quests and events for the major factions. 
---
And since they're not adding an all new worldspace, the level designers have a lot of time to refurbish existing locations; I imagine a lot of locations currently occupied by Scorched or other critters are going to be replaced with human NPCs, with several locations being converted into major faction hubs like the Crashed Space Station for raiders, Point Pleasant for the Mothman Cult, and so on. 
---
Bethesda's figured out by now that new weapons need to have legendary variants, and their DLCs in the past have tended to power-creep weapons, so I'm not worried about the weapons they teased at Quakecon being underpowered. They also talked about a comprehensive balance pass for the existing weapons, which in the very least should bring certain weapons out of obscurity. My Wasteland Don Quixote will love the recurve bow they revealed, and my energy weapons user will love the line of Gauss weapons.
---
I'm not really expecting the story to knock my socks off, but the fact that they revealed NPC dialog with a stat check and emphasized "choices &amp; consequences" in the trailer tells me they know what players want. They mentioned a reputation system, too, which I'm thinking will be closer to Skyrim's crime system than the reputation in New Vegas; but either way it'll add a bit more permanency to our choices even if the current system of server hopping remains the same. I'm not really sure what to expect from companions, since we know they won't travel everywhere with us...
---
Oh, seems that you wrote non-pacifist where you should write pacifist (will allow pacifist).   
---
The playerbase will mix itself anyway, because besides joining via loadbalancer, you also join to friends. This wouldn't completely separate the playerbase, it would just make PvPers meet statistically more PvPers, and PvErs meet statistically less PvPers
---
Really, we just need more "everything".
---
Might sound a bit pretentious, but join a European server. Find a friend in Europe and join them. You will hear way less chatter and way more actual conversation. 
---
Might be hard to find a European friend at first, but if you just hang around Reddit for a while you'll probably find someone to talk to on PS4. :)
---
Is this really a good strategy tho.  Does the number of scorched scale with how many players show up?
---
Poor blind sheep, I'm done
---
Sorry bro I'm doing wow content.
---
You know that thing fo76 lacks?
---
Sorry pal, I'm not the one with the wool over my eyes here. 
---
Your done becuase you don't have a legitimate argument for me or any of the other people here telling you your wrong :p 
---
Bye now, nobody will remember you in a year
---
Could someone tag the SBQ without taking any risk then?
---
If not, I'm usually on almost every night. I've been playing alittle destiny 2 to catch up on the story, but mainly fo76
---
im not really worried about it pretty much done with the game anyways and got almost all the stuff i wanted so its been boring
---
It did. Thanks!
---
Now there's actually something I want from the atom store. Bethesda, there's money in this.
---
Did the archive have any juicy lore in it, like references to other vaults?
---
Also, go up the stairs of the building closest to Watoga Train Station.
---
And Camp Venture. 
---
If you're on PC I can craft one for you.
---
Normally, I place a half-wall of the corrugated-steel w/windows, run the wire through the windows to attach to the desired object/conduit,  then replace that half-wall with a solid version without windows that matches the rest of my walls. The wire appears to pass right through the solid wall. The only drawback is that if you need to move the wire you have to backtrack the method.
---
Thia post is about killing Scorched for the hellgrind goal Bethesda put in place in lieu of any real content. My suggestion would help with that.
---
I mean you‚Äôd start taking damage as soon as you attack something, so I don‚Äôt think this would be much of an issue.  Maybe you could get a free shot off, but considering her massive health pool, I‚Äôd say it wouldn‚Äôt make a difference.
---
I found one thanks tho
---
Oh fuck yeah
---
Pa vs regular armor.
---
Cool. Just need a BOS paintjob and you're good to go! üòâ
---
What‚Äôs up with this Hong Kong stuff?
---
That was my reasoning as well, until I experienced what it's like to have fun in a team. I suddenly got to experience those early quests again because of a lower level player who joined me and a buddy. I heard about great quests to do from my higher level team mate. We exchange junk like crazy.
---
I think you've not yet fully experienced the game as was intended. :)
---
Me and the Liberators support the Red Chinese.
---
This, a thousands times this.
---
been playing since almost launch and did 5 characters and countless replays with friends now im just a crazy dps monster that shows up kills things in a minute or two then leave
---
And those PvE players who whined to get rid of PvP in Adventure went into Survival. Bethesda had to make it worthwhile to draw PvP players into another server, but the greedy PvE players got too tempted by all of the bonuses. Then they whined about PvP IN THE PvP SERVERS until PvP in Survival became so broken that the PvP players were forced into Adventure for PvP.
---
These idiots ruined everything for themselves and everyone else in the game. They need to grow up and deal with their own problems, instead of demanding that everyone else conform.
---
You are like asking for more free money you know?
---
If you don't like to do some of the adventure mode challenges, just don't, those are freebies and Beth have no responsibility to ensure you get your freebie.They just have to be reasonable. And having some easy adventure mode challenges while some harder ones is reasonable.
---
It's not punishment to NW players because it's not like you'd get them just by playing regularly, you have to perform specific tasks which makes it so everyone has the same cost doing them.
---
Moreover if you are a NW player then you don't need as much atoms so getting less is also fine, no?
---
Seems like the CAMP boxes cause less trouble if you choose their original placement spot wisely and then let them be.
---
Pretty sure that Bethesda's going to push through the event, no matter the actual results, so as to avoid pissing off the player base. After all, many people play Nuclear Winter, for example, and there's no killing of any scorched in that mode. However, we are still playing the game in general, and I think that's more important to Bethesda than whether or not anything is actually being "unlocked".
---
Lol, you know. Got your money's worth, I see. :P
---
You don't. You're exaggerating because someone upset you. Again, math. Post a video to prove your case, otherwise I'm going to have to defer to the very strong argument coming from the number crunchers.
---
Right back at ya. Keep believe you actuslly matter
---
It's fucked you had to do this. This kind of grind should not be in anything that professes to be a game.
---
Ohhhh he's so worked up he can't spell ! Auto correct be damned !
---
i sure as hell did lol then again thats how i am with all games i play
---
I did one yesterday, but yes, it's gotten rarer since it's been *promoted* to a public event. I don't know if that's just anecdotal, but the event has also become more chaotic and dangerous: whereas it often had waves of just one mirelurk or two to four ghouls, I now regularly get *swamped* (pun ~~not~~ intended, lol) by dozens of both enemy types. But that's fine with me, challenge and XP gladly accepted. ;-)
---
Of the Mire ~~events~~ quests, I get best-nanny-evah-Cloe's Play Time way more often, usually several times in a row per session ('Talk to Cloe' often being bugged on the server I've just completed the quest on, but working fine after changing servers).
---
And on a related note, 'It's a Trap!' is bugged for me most of the time now, with the scorchbeast spawning outside of the event area, and me killing it not counting towards completion, thus failing the event.
---
*alerted groan*
---
I've still got a zealots one!
---
Like others have said, that mod only attaches to regular armour. But an additional heads up, from what I can tell the brawling mod is glitched and doesn't actually do anything. Same with stabilized I think.
---
I wouldn't say an explosion in technology, but yes world-wide shortages  was one of the Mainstays.
---
Anticheat exists, Bethesda just don't use it.
---
Meanwhile you lads are stuck at 24fps with no mods forever.
---
Hker here. Take my upvote!
---
The explosive effect of the 50 cal is going to counteract any recoil or inaccuracy, while also causing splash damage to nearby secondary targets. The BFR LMG is going to require much more precision on your part.
---
Unless you are playing Oregon Trail or Picadilly Squares.  
---
But if you are still on a 2e, then you need to upgrade
---
I am so confused by all this. China tried to pass a law. They didn't want it/freaked our over the possibilities and marched, HK gov threw out the bill and now they are rioting and HK has no military or enough police to stop the ones rioting so China is involved and that pissed protestors off even more? Seems like we are in a trade war with China and it would be great for our officials if the general public was suddenly anti China right now. So what treatment is being done to HK that HK didn't kinda bring down on themselves. Ya know it's almost as if HK got stirred up about this issue before it became an issue at all, like the threat was a fabrication and many non HK participants have shown up, latched onto that, and are using it to attack China...
---
This is why we lowly console players aren't keen on cross-play with PC.  Which is a huge shame because otherwise it would be awesome to be able to play with the whole community all together.
---
 Really? A medium speed weapon can deal with the horde, I'd need to see that. I'm sure you can one shot anything but 10 at once?
---
Cool thanks.
---
Definitely not if it's exclusive to the atom shop.
---
It's probably because the .50 has a high damage per shot, so it has a better chance against enemies damage resistance.
---
If you were shooting against purely unarmoured enemies, the lmg would be great. So the. 50cal is better in this case. The lmg is pretty cool though.
---
That'd be a *really* hard job (to fuck all of them) - you might need a little help.
---
Well I actually like the neat UI we have now, it would be great to have in game customizable UI though.
---
This game's setting and customisation is so lacking, not just UI, in PC we should be given more graphic settings, like controlling texture of different things instead of all things at once, especially when the game is poorly optimized.
---
Aside from shadows/water texture, which also have independent settings in this game, many online games seperate the rest of the texture settings into character textures, environmental textures and object textures.
---
I‚Äôm just spit balling for atom shop ideas, I‚Äôm sure you know the frustration of needing a couple extra components
---
Well, play another game for now and come back in November. Go kill some nazis, that's fun for days.
---
Since you cant use atom shop purchases in NW, this is a pointless ask.
---
Atom challenges are in Adv mode because Adv mode is where you can actually use the things you purchase.
---
currently doing a survival horror run of fallout 4 lol
---
Does the Union Uniform count
---
Would be nice for scorched earth, sick of respawning in the middle of the fucking blast zone without any power armour.
---
Calling it now.
---
"You have been banned for violating our terms. Please see a complete list of terms at www.bethesda.com/hailchina"
---
Maybe some of the clothes/fashion shops inside Whitespring? Go full cat walk, photos, explosions, the lot.
---
And the flamer
---
If you don't understand Fallout as a satire of McCarthyism and the rest of the jingoistic Cold War American mentality... you haven't spent any time thinking about Fallout. It's the entire thing. Fallout 76 is even rife with criticisms of modern capitalism.
---
I‚Äôd just use one of my many guns that destroys them.  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Maybe, people from mainland China *aren't welcome*?  (Maybe they should not go to Hong Kong) 
---
Can you think of why that might be?  I sure can think of good reasons.
---
Outfits, headwear, face paints, emotes, camp items, PA and weapon skins can be used in NW.
---
Turned on FO76 and joined a server last night like normal.  The lag is so bad that, by the time I spawned in, a SB had already destroyed all 6 of my muscle turrets and half my front yard stuff.  PS4. Annoying af.
---
That isn‚Äôt on the fly. You have to stop aiming and adjust the scope zoom by hand.
---
Once you know where to find them, it's easy to sell on excess. ;)
---
How about just sell them in the atoms shop,
---
like 1 atom for 5 of them.
---
That is a valid point.
---
In Flatwoods Church on the ledge your right when facing the vendor.
---
hah, nice
---
i also have one of those protest signs stashed in my box
---
I have that. It's awesome. :)
---
Considering they gave it to us when we completed the stretch goal for SB kills this is hot take.
---
Do you know about Amnesia? Best horror game I've ever experienced. You basically get a light, that's it.
---
Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1nY_5-UrY4
---
I had joined a game if Nuclear Winter where a teammate (on a mic) was kind of freaking out, and mentioned that he was actually only level 2 but somehow he was registering as a level 98, with gear his character did not own, perk cards he didn't earn, etc.
---
So yes, there are some serious glitches out there.
---
Yes please! Just waves and waves until you die. The longer you last, higher the rewards. Enemy level has no cap, just keeps increasing until you die.
---
Once you die, event over for you. Kind of like a vault raid, but challenging and not tedious.
---
They're aware of it. I made a post pretty much the same day the plan was released expressing my own dissapointment, Bethesda people responded, saying they would sort it. Still not sorted.
---
It's a reference
---
It's a refrence to fallout 4
---
yes beaten it along with many many many others..... god i need a life or gf
---
nice sid meiers civ reference
---
I was unaware of this, as I had only played NW the first week it launched.   
---
So if this is true, then let those of us who do Adv mode only have an option to get NW exclusive skins, clothing, paints, emotes, ect.
---
It works both ways.  You want Adv mode goodies in NW, then we get NW goodies in Adv mode.
---
Also, according to lore established in FO4, we actually fired the first missiles, because PAM saw us as a "variable"
---
it looks pretty freaking cool! which bobblehead did you get with it?
---
I know, I was trying to continue the bit lol
---
thees
---
The LMG is notoriously difficult to aim. The 50 cal is my choice all the way. LMGs are okay for large targets where accuracy isn't really an issue.
---
This display card is a little bit weak, with the 3GB only display memory I don't think it'd even run fallout 76 very smoothly. 
---
The chipset is good but nowadays games eat up a ton of display memory.
---
Lol, yeah you do. Or a Netflix account. Preferably all of the above.
---
It's not like fluxes are super expensive, just prime it and try it out.
---
got netflix hulu and amazon prime....
---
i‚Äôd opt for the shell/case it‚Äôs only $199. that way i can add existing graphics, memory, etc.
---
So that gives you a chance to work on the "chill" part :P
---
I've been to Shanghai, Beijing, X'ian and other places in China and have been treated very well by the mainland folks. I empathize with the non-party members of China. As an American, my government acts diametrically opposite of the way I want it to (especially now) and I can only do so much to affect change. The Chinese people are not the Chinese government. 
---
[I was in high school when this happened](https://pics.loveforquotes.com/tiananmen-square-aftermath-61711834.png) It's not like it's ancient history. Sure, the CCP might have scrubbed it from the official history books, but people *know* what will happen if they speak up even en masse.
---
Hong Kong was nuked 25 years ago.
---
Junkie's
---
lol just gotta get a girl
---
It makes it more powerful, big time. If you can deal with crafting the Ultracite ammo then definitely mod that mother lover! I can do it for ya if you haven't learnt the plan. ;)
---
-
---
The Ultracite aspect doesn't give it more damage against scorched, you just get less damage compared to normal Lasers, but faster fire rate.
---
You realize many of the French Revolutions were to establish capitalism right?
---
Carry a sniper and a pistol. Instigating revolvers are pretty nice.
---
I'd pay atoms for this feature!
---
I don't think you have any idea what you are talking about. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Don't focus on that too much, just be yourself and it will happen. Just talk to people. It's a fucking real life quest mate. :P
---
lol all good till you get ghosted or the girl you get with steals your credit card and flees
---
Today was my first time experiencing it. It was a little different. I died and hit respawn. Then selected the drop site near SBQ. it entered the loading screen with my picture and the vault symbol just kept loading for about 20 minutes but the game never loaded. Ended up having to force restart the game. Definitely sucked, but not the end of the world. Kind of feels like there have been a lot of new bugs the last few weeks.
---
It didn't work on my regular armor.  I got rid of literally everything I had including the mod, but I asked about it in another comment when I still had everything.
---
You'll gain everything on your way, scrap all weapons to unlock mods for them. Keep the ones you like, but every five levels you'll want to replace them.
---
Maybe avoid the main Quest when your pointed to Savage Divide / Top of the World until later, L50, so rewards scale up. Explore the Forest as much as you can, live there... get to know it.
---
Then head North to Toxic Valley, then South to Ash Heap around L25, gain the Excavator armor. You'll be ready after that, guns blazing. ;)
---
I know what the alternative is. I understand what you are writing. What I am telling you is you are missing the point...The fact that there are alternative ways to pay for the suit affects the way you value something. It can‚Äôt be both caused at zero $ and $11.67. I‚Äôve already explained this. By calling it a $11-12 skin you are missing the issue which is the amount of atoms these things cost. 
---
My entire point is we shouldn‚Äôt be focussing on $ but rather if 1300 is too much for a power armor skin, which I agree it is I‚Äôm done repeating myself. If you still don‚Äôt understand what I am saying, go back and reread. I know this is confusing for you. I really hve tried to simplify this concept since clearly it‚Äôs new to you.
---
Come on Bethesda, this target for this last stretch reward is excessive
---
I was told that and tried it, but it didn't work on those either. Talked about it to my early reply.   I already ditched the mod and the regular armor too, so it's already too late for me.
---
That was after America.  And the point was what happened afterwards.
---
What sells well to vendors? I‚Äôve been doing this a little bit it‚Äôs like 200 to 300 caps. What are you selling that‚Äôs adding up to 1400?
---
Keep a smile on your face and keep your big mouth shut!! üòÜ
---
The communists are also made fun of in equal measure. It's the idea that humanity is just overall just a bunch of shitheels bashing each other to death with rocks, bullets, and nuclear armaments. Whichever is more convenient at the time.
---
is it ash?
---
For fun. I know it's not as refined as some other games. But it's purely for fun and roleplaying the darker side of fallout.
---
If it doesn't affect you, don't worry about it. And I, like any other person on this subreddit, has the right to offer suggestions, so again, don't worry about it.
---
The hopeful release date is November so yeah we'll probably have to wait until then. Hopefully a new trailer.
---
it's been there for awhile. or at least parts of toxic valley, unless i am tripping on jet.
---
Fallout 4 and 76 are absurdist it doesn't matter who launched the nukes. All I do know is that America was WINNING the war in china stomping them infact.
---
Irrecoverable. Fucking hell.
---
Just... make friends, don't agree to contracs.
---
It's not snow. It's toxic soot.
---
Lvl 31 pc player also looking for people to play with. Add "alpharaz".

lol i disabled the card before she can use it and what are friends? all of mine left and dont care anymore
---
Blizzard banned somebody from a comp game and took his prize money because they‚Äôre owned by China and the guy said some pro-HK stuff in an interview. And the NBA also got taken off their TVs because a coach said he supports Hong Kong. And South Park is also banned there because of one of their recent episodes, ‚ÄúBand in China,‚Äù and their latest episode has a character saying ‚ÄúFuck the Chinese government‚Äù or something.
---
Are you daft? A handmade fires off 7.5 rounds a second if each round does 110 damage that is  825 damage in that 1 second. Hell even if they hit me for 50 per round I would still be dead in less than 1 second. That is the math and without legendary modifiers, this is common to happen so no it is not just a one off, it is people that suck at life and pay cash to ebay to get a god rolled gun to harass. And yes that is an assumption of those that only harass workshop owners, but the math that is right there.
---
Hell yes, level 75 over here is salivating
---
So I had this on one of my characters that ive been playing since launch and I can no longer craft them or some other items
---
Oooooooooh look at this guy calling out a typo I made on my phone and can't even put his exclamation marks in the right spot. Get a life and don't be a grammar nazi.
---
Explore as much as you can. Hold off on main story until level 30-35 if you ask me. I used to say at least level 50 but honestly the game is so easy at that point. Explore, do side quests, do events, read terminals and listen to holotapes. Stay on the west side of the map for awhile.
---
I am not worrying anything, I am saying you are ridiculous :)
---
I don‚Äôt know what to say to that
---
Don't eat it!
---
Yea that's the bug that does not fix without closing the game. I feel for you.
---
A non auto weapon will not be able to hit fast enough to overcome healing factor/stim spam from someone built for PVP.
---
They were probably dodging every other shot, especially if they were rocking dodgy and serendipity.
---
Coming from someone who has _obviously_ little to no experience in the mode, I feel that I should  enlighten you that _YES_ you can carry some Atom Shop purchases, such as clothing, skins, emotes, etc over to NW.
---
Really good brief advice
---
Sounds suspiciously *communist*... üë∫
---
Honestly I think it's fair that there's NW exclusive rewards, not like adventure doesn't have it's share of exclusive toys. Plus I think it's cool to be wearing something that I've earned in arguably the most challenging part of the game.
---
Seems like the developers could eventually add more to game and make the boarded up buildings accessible. I just finished the "Wasted on Nukashine" quest then read it was part of the March update. Probably hard to tell if the buildings in the quest line were boarded up as well.
---
Hmm didn't you see the opening for fallout 2?
---
At least somebody here actually has some common sense
---
Lmaooo
---
I've actually never played 2.
---
I liked survival, I just wish they made it so you needed to start a new character. 
---
Or made the mode not allow legendaries to make it actually difficult
---
&gt;Elder Scrolls Online requires a few years to finish everything.
---
Took ESO a few years to be worth playing though. One Tamriel is what made that game good, before that it was a linear grindfest.
---
I just hope that 76 eventually gets a similar groundbreaking patch.
---
Not sure, that's a lot of SB.
---
I'd bet Bethesda gives us the discount regardless, even if we don't hit 35M.
---
The Wasteland needs to be respected, it takes no prisoners! ;)
---
Check out the opening scene ü§î
---
Well we have Nuclear Winter
---
Well, go join your friends in those other games. We will still be here when you get back. ;)
---
You can also carry some of the NW stuff over to Adv mode, so why would it be so bad to open those up to Adv players since you want us to give you our special stuff.
---
For example, Pink PA paint.
---
Yeah... every time I see that legendary purveyor, she robs me of my scrip
---
The modern ideal of "middle class" was a result of the industrial revolution, and an increase in affordable consumer goods bought by service workers with disposable income. America did not INVENT the middle class. It would be more accurate to say that the merchantile class in ancient societies would be close to what we'd consider middle class today.
---
I am excited to see how much complaining goes on here. /s
---
Honestly I‚Äôm going to take a break from reddit and just try and enjoy it when it launches.
---
Im all for this so dont get me wrong. I see alot of people saying they stand with China and down with communist but what if we were to go to war because you know we are Americans.. Would you truely go and fight?
---
I'd run with ya just to help out...it's about all I do now anyways. Just got off though and diving into a pile of chemistry homework. If ya see me on later or another day hit me up. I can share some perk cards and help you out a bit. There's so many folks that play that will help ya.
---
But there would never have been an industrial revolution in a system that allowed the lower class to be used as slaves.  Can you name a non capitalist society that created a middle class anywhere near that time frame?   Of course not.
---
I think we should be able to spend caps, and caps only on things like disease resistance boosters. Xp boosters, maybe weapon/armor durability boosters. Would help the economy with a cap sink. NOT ATOM SHOP BATHESDA.
---
got no one last time was able to talk to someone was because he was just telling everyone bye since he was selling his gaming stuff irl friends are nonexistent since they dont care anymore
---
do things like events or repeatable quests. there good ways to get xp. but if your bored of doing them you could always farm a area.
---
whitesprings resort is well known to all players by know but there are certain areas where you can stand and not get hit by ghouls. like at the window of the golf resort or on the patch of grass beside the wall of the pool area. i farmed that area for awhile until i moved on to other areas.
---
the place i have been farming the past few days is West tek, but that's a high level area.
---
other that that you could just do the main quests or go around the map and have fun. you could learn some of the lore on the way, and if you feel up to it you could play nuclear winter, you can earn caps and xp in the game mode for your adventure mode character.
---
areas that you could farm right now is summersville, its full of the super mutants witch is also a good way to get caps. here's a link to the wiki if you haven't discovered it yet seeing as 76 is the biggest fallout game "map wise" to date. [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Summersville](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Summersville) 
---
also if your looking for a particular junk item look at the workshops there a good " but slow " way of getting them, but beware and prepared to defend them against ai and possible asshole players.
---
also personally from experience i would stay away from cranberry bog. when i was a lower level i went there and got destroyed by a glowing Wendigo. the robots there are also a high level.
---
but other than all that i would say the most import thing to do is have fun and don't feel like you need to rush yourself.
---
I would say focus on the main quest but also explore as much as you can on the way.
---
And don't really worry about character building now, as long as your specials is not ridiculously misplaced (like 15 end or cha) you will be fine. After level 50 every level you can either gain a perk or respec 1 point of your specials, and it's not that hard to level up.
---
I don't know, I mean yeah, more atoms (and 5 is a fair amount) is always good but idk if the Atomic shop isn't 'fair' I play pretty casually (2-4 hours every 2-3 days) and I've earned over 1500 atoms in a little over a month. I really love the daily/weekly challenges and think being able to make almost 600 atoms a week (from just daily/weekly challenges.) is pretty fair.
---
I agree, this sounds like a good idea! Or even have some cosmetics in the atom shop cost caps instead of Atom.
---
I will add tho- the vault raid challenges SUCK and I hate them lol
---
so thats why its taking them so long to release wastelanders lol
---
Just popped on ps4 about one hour ago.
---
Shit imagine having these and twisted muscles, my character would look worse than a super mutant, or maybe we are all super super mutants.
---
looks like Big bad john will be in the update.
---
Love it üòç
---
English language quirk I guess. It‚Äôs my second language.
---
I'm on pc and it can take up to 2.5 minutes to load in. There's posts and reasons, my friends list is only 40ish people and it can take that long. Yes I have bitchin internet/pc, it's the game.
---
Edit: if you mean you see yourself standing there and watch the pieces load in, that's just for you. For everyone else your base has been there for a while already
---
Lol that would actually be a sick idea
---
I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs ash
---
Actually the issue was America extended it's "supremacy" through the advent of microfusion technology. Which the chinese lacked, and even requested from the americans. Of course america refused, and as a result the chinese desperate to maintain their very civilization (all other countries had either nuked each other or fallen into despotic anarchy IE the UK) occupied anchorage. Of course the americans wanted this to happen to an extent so that there would be an excuse to seize as much of the world's supply of uranium as possible (despite having enough to last them centuries). Amercia then developed power armor, annexed canada (we see footage of how well that went in the fallout 1 intro where a man in t-51 gives some poor sod an impromtu lobotomy) then in an exorbitantly bloody conflict against the zealous chinese we eventually reclaimed Anchorage. Secureing what was left of the world's fossile fuel supply dooming China to a slow decline into anarchy. Of course that wasn't enough so we planted our foot in their ass a couple more inches which lead to a nuclear war.
---
If they ever bring in the Test Servers we should get atom rewards for paticipating in testing
---
Yes with alot of enemy variety and new enemy's every week or month
---
Whoever downvoted can't take a joke üòÇ
---
How much we talking here?
---
Well claiming america did it first is my qualm. I'd say it's closer to say Brits pulled it off sooner.
---
just one of the reasons i dont bother with workshops anymore
---
You're not alone, I stopped bothering with workshops for exactly that reason.
---
Hopefully we hear something soon.
---
You're the one who's ridiculous, because you're  claiming that you're not worrying over anything, and yet the proof of such is demonstrated by your taking the time to write such a lengthy response to my post. If you hadn't been worried then you would have done the sane thing and just ignored it and moved on, kind of like I'm doing with you now.
---
Yeah I mean might be nice but as long as they aren‚Äôt identical enemies and they change it every now and then/ random for each run I‚Äôd be cool with it.
---
Same
---
They have five demands.  That is only one of them
---
Where did you find the case?
---
Pvp isn't the same
---
Ive got a level 25 junkies ffr combat rifle ill sell
---
Soy infused?  Isn't that the insult /r/Sino throws at Westerners?
---
It basically boils down to workshops = target for PVP.
---
Since you cant turn off PVP in workshops (pacifist only prevents you from dealing damage), its best to stay away.
---
Or get in, set up resouces, and get out.  Building defenses is too much time wasted, just get your extractors set up and jet.
---
You don‚Äôt have to pvp if you don‚Äôt want to and it‚Äôs only unbalanced because you‚Äôre not built for it .
---
i have a lvl 40, 3 star troubleshooters death tambo that i love. it's got faster swing speed and plus 1 agility and it's still holding its own at lvl 90. it's not my primary, but it makes a great secondary option and weighs next to nothing to carry around. i tend to use it when I'm in lower level areas to save bullets i don't need to spend on sub-lvl 35 enemies.
---
Haha you said you were done, stop no life replying becuase you can't stand to not have the last word lmao
---
You have no logic at all, I don't have to worry over anything to write anything, I do what I want, and I want to show you you are ridiculous, that's it.
---
And if you are ignoring me you don't have to type all these, see how your logic backfires?
---
Huh. I just don't remember seeing it before.
---
Well, at least it isn't yellow :-P
---
At level 60 my build was slamming level 200s, its very easy to have a very capable build at lower levels
---
Oh ho, what's this I see... you said the word "also"? So, then you _are_ acknowledging that &gt;Atom Shop&lt; items can be used in Nuclear Winter? I'm not quite sure, since you didn't _actually_ admit that you were incorrect.
---
I know, it's just they are similar is a way.
---
Imagine Sierra Madre without losing all your shit, it would be ezpz.
---
I think in the end they should just give us it since the random 3 star sale was put off
---
There has been several times I've asked other players for help, they usually help and in my case refused pay.
---
There adding the underminer to the game? Awesome!
---
Lol none of us "raiders" are rocking tse
---
Dont want to be mean but this is why you dont build around whitesprings, at least in the area that is commonly nuked.
---
You must have a tough life if a couple of PVP players is enough to make you quit. Let's kick out all the PVPers so you can have your safe space. How dare they PVP you in the small 10% of the map dedicated to them.
---
If you want to build, build your CAMP. That is your safe space. Sell things at a vendor or do events for friendly interaction.
---
