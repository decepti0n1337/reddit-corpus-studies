I don't think so. Maybe I should try.
---
---
---
Is it a biv reward or is there another place to farm the recipe
---
Also give the armor a grey skin with white stripes on the arms and the BOS logo on the chest.
---
Pretty much what I'm doing, minus the PA glitch. I get 20/sec as it is.
---
Make Government cheese an exclusive drop in these aid drops. The cheese effect  increases the chance of finding and quantity of old world money you find. It will also increase carry capacity by 25 lbs.
---
Can we have a server hop button?
---
You got something better to do making the same proposal that 2,000 people have already made?  Learn to read before posting, moron. 
---
I haven't found any legendary gear yet, but that is a pretty good idea. I'll probably find one just after I get cured.
---
Ah, so maybe the chameleon snuck in there?
---
I'd be interested in the toilet plans, let me know how much.
---
Now that‚Äôs cheating. You just reused Bethesda‚Äôs pun!
---
Its the best. How much depends on the piece you mod. 
---
Nice, I was thinking of heading over to there anyway. Thanks!
---
I haven't got a legendary deathclaw in a few months there. They are always high level for me though.
---
I have that, but it never seems to appear. I'll check the recipe list. Thanks!
---
I think this would be a fantastic addition. All the flowers would be great for crafting recipes, but also for actually landscaping around your builds. A like, galvanized water trough you can plant a couple snap tails/tar berries in, etc. 
---
Lmfaoo. So rude. Youre the moron.

Ultracite armor only has 1 paint job. the prototype paint in the atom shop

There has been good games that people play 7600 over like 15 years. This game will be long shut down in four years. 
---
Same here, I am a fallout fan who did NOT but 76 exclusively due to the shitty business practices Bethesda has employed. I am also an Elder Scrolls fan, but due to what Bethesda has become and that they are now perfectly fine with lying their asses off about pay to win I will not be buying ES6 either.
---

---
So entirely because of fo76 they have lost me as a customer. My only disappointment is that I feel like I'm one of a very few minority, and I can completely see the gaming community having short term memory loss and eating ES6 up the moment it is announced, pay to win transactions and all.
---
Just came here to say the song OP mentions is The Last DJ by Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers, not Bob Dylan. :p 
---
I'll pay you 50 if you can hold it for me, I'll be on in 3-4 hrs.
---
wow you got downvoted for calling out the Obvious? Sorry Mate .. I gave ya an upvote For speaking the truth. Let me add to it by Saying .. Golly , Can't wait till I find a 3\* Legendary one of these and it drops a 1\* junkies Pool cue
---
They‚Äôre kind of both. A lot of the cryptids we see in-game are the result of radiation/FEV. For example, the snallygaster is an FEV experiment gone wrong.
---
Love this concept. Im in if its cool. 
---
The dupers are rubbing their hands in anticipation. Vanguard and Bloodied PA sets will soon flood the wasteland.
---
Thank you
---
LOVE THIS
---
Which is dumb as it's still classified as heavy
---
I hope they don't do this. Free to play games, with \_very\_ few stand outs, aren't worth playing in my book.   
---
I paid $60 for this game. Make a $60 game, and stop trying to sell me fucking aid items. 
---
My gt is mowwee 
---
Yeah, magazines don't really count. Way too rare and RNG.
---
Cool, I'll look you up when I get on, thanks.
---
I think people forget pvp means you CAN attack people at will, not that you always should.
---
lmfao lame 
---
Players response to that: "Oh.....ok. Well when can I pre order your next game?"
---
Do you know how long? I was only planning on being on for a little while longer
---
If you‚Äôre in pacifist mode then there is zero slap damage. It‚Äôs literally impossible for you to get one shot unless you‚Äôre flagged for PvP. 
---
&gt; Savoring Anus.
---
that gets some downright strange googles.
---
Huh, okay. I'll keep my eye out in those areas then maybe lol
---
PSA: if your on XBox you can go under the friends tab and there is a recent players feature. 
---
Sorry I must have replied elsewhere, I can't get on for 3-4 hrs. I'll pay you 50 for holding them, could meet up tomorrow too if that's better.
---
Depends on who you're asking
---
I know where it comes from, but I just forgot that it was a quest item when I sold it, and the quest gives you a leveled version of it, so I don't know how the level 4 got a max level version is all
---
Tomorrow will work. I usually pop in between 6-8ish eastern time 
---
^ That.
---
With the last update you now need to make your builds on nukesdragons.com and copy the link to the config file
---
So if you already nukesdragons for builds it's all great. The only downside is currently, if you change your load out, perk levels, or special stats, you need to copy/paste the old link from your config and make changes. But the plugin doesnt need to be reloaded so it's not too bad.
---
I‚Äôm down to help take the bitch down, if anyone has got one going.
---
SpacialGiant 
---
Genuinely didn‚Äôt realize. Don‚Äôt I feel sheepish.
---
This game is so weird. The enemy list is the longest of any fallout but like, anything but scorched and super mutants is ultra rare. But it‚Äôs not really like they save ants or frogs or anything for memorable special encounters, they just spawn rarely.
---
Ugh, that's such a pain in the butt reason. I've gotta scroll through all my duplicates and can't tell how much of any I have just to make duping slower ü§¶ it's not gonna stop them, just possibly slow them down
---
http://dulfy.net/2018/12/02/fallout-76-treasure-maps-guide/
---
It's rather simple thankfully, since it only requires said rework on Nukes then simply pasting into the config file. Hell, it even has separate loadouts for each toon on your account (assuming you set that part up).
---
I'm hoping that they have upcoming content where you will slowly start seeing groups of people from different regions, familiar and unfamiliar, trickling into Appalachia. 
---
1) Im not one to say. I never cared for immersion.
---
2)if you mean guilds like MMOs no. You can make groups on discord and just play with them but thats it. You can talk to others though in Voice Chat. You can meet some nice players that way.
---
3)Can take a bit to get used to.
---
4)played since BETA and I personally never had the issues everyone claims to have.
---
5) Yes. You can customize your armor. Whether it is paint OR you use outfits to hide your armor.
---
This game is like the textbook definition of bad PR.
---
I've said it many times, bit why no camo skins? There was just the one as far as I know, and I missed it.
---
What's this u speak of?
---
I'm interested lol
---
It's quite arrogant of Bethesda to think that this game will be around for 4 years+.
---
It's actually poop, like the waste system terminal strongly implies that the spy stations waste is pumped into the production above.
---
Cool I can make that work, thanks again.
---
you guys dont have the problem of having too many heavy weapons? I dont know what you guys are doing but I can loot one from the ground and another off their body, free of charge.
---
Especially in survival mode. That would be awesome 
---
That's a deathclaw remesh isn't it...
---
Wait, a death squad? Lol.
---
  
---
I thought you were protectors!
---
Thanks! Do you think it's the same for FO4?
---
did you or teamates by chance own a workshop ?
---
You did something to open yourself up to full pvp.
---
Yup no problem. Send me a friend request whenever you get on so I can message you when I get one tomorrow 
---
all good points. no rewards for claiming would be the easy answer. the resources, the reason for claiming it in the first place, should be sufficient reward.
---
unless of course you're looking for some PvP action in Adventure mode..
---
Fort Defiance has a bunch of them, clean, dirty, and weathered. Maybe also check the pharmacy.
---
Congrats this took me a long time too
---
I'm glad you agree
---
Rose almost made me want to refund my game
---
One of you triggered pvp somehow. Maybe a workshop, maybe a mine.
---
0 Damage done to him because he was standing still while you were shooting at him by any chance? 
---
I've been wanting this from the start. I'm tired of finding clothing or gear I need then realizing its completely useless because the character I found it with isn't the one who needs it.
---
Good advice! So it‚Äôs harder with a group? Is it because the enemy level scales to the highest person? I thought it may be easier since many events I have done there were already people ‚Äúworking on it‚Äù and I just jumped in and joined. Or is the final silo mission all solo with no one else around? I have been stock piling stimpacks but don‚Äôt really want to blow through them just figuring stuff out the first time. 
---
Could I buy lead off you?
---
I like to know what damage I am putting out, without having to constantly guess or do math in my head to figure out the multipliers with/without damage perks, buffs, crits, sneak attack etc. Too many variables to think about.
---
That's fair
---
We did, that's how it all started. We try to claim it back and once he had it and none of its turrets or he suffer from any damage. We manage to find his base/ camp and nothing, 0 damage to it. We did this for a good 25 minutes 
---
I‚Äôve ran into hordes of glowing ones in ws before when it wasn‚Äôt a nuke zone thought it was weird definitely but I didn‚Äôt pay it too much mind
---
This!!! I‚Äôll have my quick swap set and then when I need it in battle instead of switching to a gun I throw up unarmed. WHY? 
---
I build in the deep south, east of Watoga. Up near a ranger tower on the side of the cliffs, it's far enough away from everything that I never see anyone, but only like 10/15 caps away from Watoga and Top of the world. There's alot of high level enemies, but very spread out as well.
---
It's free from the questline and expensive to mod so most people avoid it from what I've seen 
---
I would love having a basement without having to build on a ledge.
---
100% sure he started it
---
You're doing Gods work. :P
---
I found its easier to just watch YouTube videos 9n these. Some of the mounds are disguised pretty well. Jmo

Come over to the Xbox side.
---
We‚Äôve got purified water and sweet rolls.
---
*magical finger flutter*
---
Aha! They had us in the first half, not going to lie. 
---
The plot thickens! I wonder what happened. 
---
I can't confirm, but talking with others I hear that it spawns more enemies with more people. As for scaling I don't know if itMs highest or group average - I'm new to this whole nuking thing after all. I was happy to use my stimpacks and I blew through my stockpile mostly. Will start farming again tonight. As for now i'm dipping into my Nuka Cherry supply lol!
---
Don't need ants for it, it's just the name. Like how Old Possum Beer doesn't involve any old possums
---
funny you mention that because i ALSO have an xbox ü§ß i just play more on ps4 and i‚Äôm hella low level on xbox 
---
Yeah it would be very nice if they had like different bunker options you could add to your camp.

This is a requirement for the games future.

I have the same but I recently ran into some PVP players using the lobbing or shotgun barrels? Idk which 
---
It‚Äôs a highly elite group that hunts down raiders haha. It sounds bad 
---
Ok cool 
---
If they added in bright red text while deciding to claim a workshop "BY CLAIMING THIS WORKSHOP YOU ARE FULLY ACCEPTING PVP AND CAN BE BALL STOMPED FROM THIS MOMENT FORWARD" there might be fewer of the "cheaters killed me posts" 
---
Always Calibrated Shocks. Always.
---
Never too late to start. All the cool kids are over here, plenty of room for more.
---
after pip boy, if you‚Äôre sitting you should get a 3rd person view of yourself eating and drinking (definitely drinking) 
---
then you can see yourself drink a beer and then go back to shooting things. 
---
Why though? I use my Excavator for mining runs, etc. My melee weapons only weight 1.2 to 4lbs as well.
---
Sure. What‚Äôs you gt 
---
This right here. I was actually surprised starting a new character in survival. As a low lvl nobody really messed with me. Just waved and went on their way. Once I was in first place and 5 guys came to my camp and k9nd of got into a Mexican standoff. It was awkward, tense, confusing and bloody. It was a genuinely great gaming experience I wont be quick to forget. 
---
Or Grahm!
---
Good luck. Working on mine too (PS4)
---
Yeah, mid range. I can get around 75% of my shots on target. Long range can be an issue, I just take my time when I'm trying to long range with my Gat. Draw them into the Kill zone, then unleash Hell. 
---
This happened with Destiny 2 also. There was lots of negative attention over how it had even fewer features than the first Destiny, and then massive uproar when the first expansion for Destiny 2 locked previously available content. But the game is still going strong.
---
Good luck to you also 
---
It was a joke man:/
---
It's definitely better than launch, but still has a little ways to go. My opinion may be slightly biased as I play on ps4. 
---
Eagle eyes costs -4 STR, same with bird bones. Egg head causes -3 to both STR and END. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
with class freak that is -2.75 for all 3 of those, but twisted muscles can help negate the melee damage penalty of it (and marsupial can help with the carry weight)
---
Sleep in bed for 30 seconds for an XP boost. Hit up public events and head north. Farm the space station and areas up there. Discover new locations and explore.
---
The shotgun barre with TSE is very powerful, especially if you‚Äôre shooting at people‚Äôs feet. The main problem with it is that you have to be a decent distance away from people or you‚Äôll end up killing yourself with it, which I have done multiple times by accident
---
So that's good. Had it been you, the level 200 player after giving you a polite warning would have spent the rest of his day making your life miserable, and everyone would have agreed that he colnducted himself in a fair way, as you did. 
---
shooting/getting attacked doesn't break stealth. Dunno about meleeing, but you can certainly shoot and be shot without it breaking when using a stealth boy / chamelon armor. 
---
I know. But that was not the case. He followed us after all the workshop thing for like a good 25 minutes. Suffering 0 damage from fatmans, rockets, powerfists for a good while its plain imposible unless something going on
---
Trust me it happens. Even the small percentage of damage they are able to do to you is often more health than a low level player has
---
Not really, only two cultures have it being fully human and both of them have it being a giant.

The recipe for rad ant lager definitely include ants. It's a pain in the ass to gather the meat.

That looks metal as fuck. Kinda looks like a Demon Hunter album cover actually lmao

Immersion is really friggin good if you ask me.

lol @ people who still play this 
---
Much thanks! 
---
I'm not the least bit offended. I just think the OP seems a bit fragile. If a level 200 player warning you to stay away from his friends bothers you, whether they're kids or not, then you're the one with the problem. After all, it's a cruel world out there. 
---
None of the cryptids in the game are explained as just being real mythical beings. Flatwoods are aliens, grafton and snallygaster are escaped fev experiments, mothmen are mutant moths and wendigo are essentially cannibal ghouls. 
---
So excited to blast it with my plasma pistol then Chop and poke it with my sickle. 
---
Yeah but it would be nice
---
Mine's been perfectly fine up near west-tec. Wierdly, my friend's highly visable camp just across the road from whitesprings hasn't been attacked once, either &gt;&lt; 
---
Just my personal feelings on it.
---
As you said, it's a quality of life thing, which imo, beats out the AP regen. I'm constantly towing the line between unencumbered and over encumbered, even with 345 lbs of carry weight just from carrying food, water, stims and guns or armor I pick up to scrap or store. Ammo weight is actually not that bad in comparison. I'd rather be able to keep sprinting around than have the AP regen and not be able to sprint.
---
Metaphorically speaking its like a light switch and its simple just whether or not the company wants to do it üòÄ
---
This was a "give a man a fish you feed him for a day...teach him how to fish, you feed him for life" Moment. Haha. Seriously, set up the camp. Turn the game on in the morning right when you wake up getting ready for school or work. Let run while you get ready. You are pretty much safe in your camp. Check it every 15 mins or so and collect the lead. It maxes at 14 lead scrap so you need to take it out and let it start generating again. I collect about 56 lead every morning before going to work, alone. It works my friend.  
---
You do you my dude!
---
idk, that out of combat HP re-gen is nice. Really helps for farming mutations. Just need a Decontamination shower and you automatically re-gen your HP saves Stims and other Heals while Farming Mutations. Also really good for small combat, fight and heal after. But long drawn out combat is a pain as Stim are reduced in effect by a lot without ClassFreak and you ca re-gen as you're combat locked. But I recently got a perk that allows to crouch and it makes enemy's have to "Search" similar to the Skyrim Sneak Skill Tree crouch and you briefly go invis and enemy have to search and the Chameleon mutation makes me invisible taking me out of combat if you wait a little while, then your out of combat re-gen kicks in and you save your stims. 
---
I'd embrace a system like this. I think it'ed be "fair" to have a given amount of loss, say between 1-10%, given the improvement in carry weight this system would bring to the table. 
---
I get killed in 1 to 3 hits frequently, or atleast I used to when I was between level 10-25 or so. Maybe even into 30. I got destroyed by so many people levels 100+ it was crazy. It‚Äôs not bullshit, and it happens to everyone who has recently been a low level. 
---
It would 
---
It's a joke.  Maybe that's a difficult idea for you.
---
Glad I'm not the only one. Initially i thought that Sheepsquatches was the name of a player so i just assumed a player took over my workshop but I guess not lol
---
Blocker not needed. Get rid of grimreapers sprint and crit savy, you just need four leaf clover and better critical.  Put the 3 you had in blocker into life saver or what ever the auto stim one is. That's my two cents on making you good build into a great build.
---
Where did I go now?
---
Not playing it and still following the community it's kind of worse dont you think?
---
I leave my TSE handmade at home for PVP and bring my AAE handmade instead. the AntiArmor rates 21 damage less yet I'm certain in practice it kills quicker without danger of one shot....
---
just my opinion based on what Ive seen, no hard data to support my thinking....but a lot of dead players in my wake over the last few days would say I'm doing it right
---
Which is, like, the whole fucking point?
---
In addition to during their "bonus" week Well Rested got a -1 hour nerf instead of a +1 hour buff.
---
Weird, I definitely picked up a few legendary items, but maybe it wasn't a legendary deathclaw?
---
Oh I gotcha - I was just curious because the way you replied made it sound like there was something I was missing LOL. Got me excited.
---
Oh jeeze, yeah with what I bring + my mutations.. I basically just eat the meat I find off of enemies uncooked, and water is a non issue. I bring diluted stims, and just my few weapons. I sit at like 60lbs AT MOST - with my typical setup. I can shrink that to about 42Lbs or so though.
---
Still
---
You think 7600 atoms is a big reward?
---
They honestly need to give a alert when your server will shut down kinda like when all the servers go down for updates
---
The story kind of takes you into harder territory for some reason. If you cant hack it in the divide then head up to grafton. Easier leveled baddies and a bit of terrain the main story doesnt take you in
---
This right here's the real answer. A meh weapon with a great legendary is better than a great weapon with a shit legendary. 
---
There's already a mod for this (for PC folks, at least), so I'm much more concerned about the variety of other issues which can't be addressed by mods.

---
I pretty much just do events or whatever else I‚Äôm in the mood to do at the time
---
Only play on weekends though
---
It always used to be a legendary.  But a few months back they nerfed whitesprings and since then I haven't seen one there. Used to be a nifty little farming spot.
---
Thanks man. It was frustrating that the sloath in fasnacht glitched out at about an 80% and gave me nothing. I was just expressing that frustration. Love the game. Hope this one has a drop everytime
---
...what?  
---
40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, 2080 hours a year, 3.65 years.
---
Point your toon against a wall, put a brick on the "forwards" button, go take a reeeeeal long shit.
---
Had to chase a legendary super mutant like 5 blocks outside the General's Steakhouse. He just started booking it up the road. Lucky I heard him and chased him down. Watoga Emergency has them hiding in the stairwell to the roof usually a cowering wendigo.
---
What really shocks me is I play on a satellite connection part of the time, and on cable part of the time, depending on where I'm working from.   
---
I've been at a location with "real" internet, at the same time as someone on the satellite connection is in game, and the satellite connection sometimes loads FASTER than the cable connection does.   
---
That's how badly optimized this game is.   
---
I'd love for Bethesda to take some inspiration from Rust honestly. Camps separate from the one we have in adventure mode, stronger walls and traps to make them harder to raid, a buildable camp structure to alert you of intruders on th pip-boy, etc.
---
The only big thing is, how would they make camps worth attacking? A capture system like workshops that gives bonus caps and random loot out of the stash? Making players' stashes lootable with no restriction seems too unbalanced. Camp raiding is definitely something I want in survival though. 
---
Oh yeah that broken weapon bug is the worst, sad to see no one talking about it. These bugs really screw up the flow in combat and yet they have been in the game for a while without being even acknowledged as far as I remember.
---
I've seen the flatwoods monster near the overseers camp twice now. Both times it was too high leveled for me so I just avoided it. I should've engaged it while I had the chance.
---
The OP really isn't bothered because it was kids. He's bothered because a higher level player implicitly threatened him. 
---
Had it been some teens who didn't want to be bothered, it would have played out exactly the same way and he'd be whining about how bad it is to have teens here. He's the problem. He didn't like someone telling him to shove off, so he decided to some here for some emotional support. 
---
Congrats on providing him some comfort.
---
But thank goodness they celebrated Fasnatch with 1 in 10,000 drop rates for some fugly masks!
---
This as well as increased lag and more frequent disconnects has been an issue since that patch/DLC. Oh and funky enemy spawns.
---
I need this in my FO76 life!
---
I agree with you that it depends on the child. I also think that it‚Äôs absurd to have parents chastising people for daring to play near their child or kill them in PvP. If they‚Äôre mature enough for an online game of this nature, then they‚Äôre mature enough to handle player interactions. Obviously harassment and whatnot is not acceptable but that‚Äôs true regardless of the player‚Äôs age. 
---
no
---
I only play during the weekends, just drop in whenever you feel like it
---
Legendary Death claws run away all the time for me. The White Springs spawn point by the fountain has death claws there regularly and the legendaries will run and hide by the fire station or service buildings or even hide behind trees (which is comically obvious).
---
Ty, appreciate the confirmation on Fireproof. I‚Äôll have to shave a point somewhere since you can‚Äôt have zero strength(I assume). Some of the luck perks are present because I‚Äôm assuming survival eventually has more PvE incentives, like this 2x XP weekend, and so hybrid builds are good. I actually like Crit Savvy over Four Leaf most times because the crits are consistent(every third shot with 15 luck), and it‚Äôs easier to get in a rhythm with it, but for pure PvP I think your suggestion is best.
---
I know it's a Shakespeare reference, but I always assumed the Milk of Human Kindness he was referring to is FEV.
---
I have a defensive wall around enough plants to make 40 adhesive...turrets work round the clock to keep sneakers away the scorchbeasts take care of the armor users...i snipe the survivors into oblivion (TES¬Æ verson)
---
Sometimes it bugs out. Sometimes you come in just after the nuke zone has cleared, but there‚Äôs at least a spawn cycle or two to go and all the plants still looked nuked.
---
Biv reward. I got it the day after I bought it for 4k lol. 
---
Looks like a chort off of witcher
---
So being up at level 180- something: this is no country for old men.
---
It's not just the scorched. Not half an hour ago, I was shot at by a super mutant with a minigun. I could see and hear him carrying it,  and it hit me from afar. I killed him and what did he have on him?
---
A sledgehammer. I was beyond words. But I have seen what you describe OP, Scorched seemingly carrying one weapon, then dropping something totally different upon death.
---
Baffling.
---
Then perish
---
Savage, cool
---
Another spawn point is Lady Janet's soft serve. Clear the 4-6 low levels and run down to the overturned bus.
---
They're still better than the orange and straw colored shoes that come with the Blue Dress.
---
So. Ugly.
---
The more something is suggested the better chance it has of being seen, its simple to understand bud
---
It could also have been somone in PA with a targeting HUD, pretty much the exact same bug. 
---
Dodgy is worth it. It can be the difference between a one hit kill and staying alive. As long as you don't rely heavily on VATs or travel encumbered. Pair it up with action boy/girl to get more use out of it.
---
For evasive, if you're going to perk up DR take them all. Evasive, Ironclad, and Bodyguards with a full team is 119 DR, basicly a second chest piece. Don't worry about refractor since I don't see many energy weapons.
---
Adamantium Skeleton only prevents damage to each limb's own HP bar, not damage done to the player.
---
If you stack Nocternal Fortitude with Lifegiver you gain 85HP at night. That's almost a 1/3 increase in HP.
---
It's going to be more your gear and tactics that save you. Dodgy, Fireproof, and Blocker are the main perks that'll help prevent the 1 shots.
---
They can do zero dmg now with pacifist.

I'm positive I heard the fallback cry from a gutsy at Sugar Grove. Not sure if it was because of the coward effect or something else completely. Never heard a retreat call from a gutsy before so it stood out.
---
Yay! I was hoping to see a new butthurt post complaining about what some youtuber said.
---
I play a melee PA character, but since they screwed us on found fusion cores I go without the PA a lot. Then I wear the Union Soldier outfit and hat and carry a black powder rifle. I'm constantly finding the gun unloaded and my molotovs unequipped when I try to use them. 
---
Ya I die 1 outta 2 fights I'm in. Some players can jus waste you faster than most would think. Even with perks it's not easy. I live survival tho omg

Remember, they need love to guys. It's not their fault.

Metal camp walls should require explosives to break down. Automatics and TSE/E weapons shouldn't count towards camp damage. Metal anything is useless as it doesnt keep ppl out. Up the damage threshold on all structures to make us actually safe inside our camps for a few minutes

Can I for the love of Todd, have in game arcade machines? I just wanna make an in game tavern/game room/man cave.

Bumper is for grenades and dpad is for emoting, I don‚Äôt know how you could accidentally do that

I read this and my brain went straight to an old Sims character. She was a geologist, and the first thing she bought other than food was the excavator. She was super stoked to use it, only she never used it on her own property - she'd go to her neighbor's house and drill giant holes all over their yard in the middle of the night.
---
GRRRRNEEEEEEEYYYYYTT! *angry neighbor Sim shouts in protest, then falls over from exhaustion because it's 4am. Sim shrugs.* GRRNNNEEEEEEYYYYYYTT!
---
Ah, good times.
---
If you are going to put fledglings on the harpoon thank keep it because of the quad
---
Yyeesssssss omg this!!!!
---
Also, you only need to make the lowest level of the gun and then scrap it.
---
For heavy weapons i would say the harpoon gun but harpoons are rare and i don't remember what it takes to craft them but TSE Minigun if you can find one would be optimal
---
Yeah regardless of how nefarious or benign this is, the silence is a bad sign.
---
Callout 76. Thanks for the heads up
---
Thank you very much for that. Il be sure to give this a go. I had no idea about the random spawn. 
---
I've never been killed or never had my camp destroyed despite me claiming workshops all the time.
---
I can part with my screws for free if yourbon Xbox

I think I'm only level 20 but I'm down to play. I'm usually a lone wanderer but no issues roaming the wasteland with some good folk. Riggyriggs28.

This. Especially since there is now No Slap Damage. I love doing that and then just ignoring the person trying to get me "To Go". Its awesome.

I just hope its fun content. I was really looking forward to player vending, so I hope this makes up for it. 
---
So the TSE minigun is better than the quad?  I was going to run flechettes on the quad if I got it.
---
:)
---
Just started a Pistols Build and would love this!
---
Sounds like a you problem. 
---
Just a few more days
---
TSE minigun is better DPS wise if you have the 5mm to sustain it (cheaply made round tbh) but for raw damage output the harpoon gun is the way to go but i prefer dps incase i miss the first shot
---
WV lumber way up north. Tons of low level super mutants (level 5- 10) and crowned super mutants (level 12 - 20). Tons of weapons to scrap and there and all the crafting stations are there. Great place for mats and easy experience. 
---
While I've been cap farming in survival I'd say this is fair and prob a great idea
---
The SBQ needs looking at anyway. It really is no fun going through the whole process then knowing only 2-3 people are interested. Doomed from the start. It is not fun. 
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jh1E2K2xuRY

TSE minigun, 5mm rounds are so easy to find/buy

What do You think of the house and

We are going to repaint the front door

Yeah I guess that's the default message

ya, i'm impartial to whichever answer. Just curious to know more about it. 
---

---
Good luck with the guns, I'd stay but I'm currently transporting all of my first aid and junk to sell, and I hightailed it to adventure safety
---
HOLY SHIT
---
For this, but player vending is a whole month at least.
---
I read that this quest line is only a bit longer then the biv one. So I wont hold my breath. 
---
In north America they're fast agile hunters that you cannot see looking headlong at them and have an impenetrable skin that only fire can burn and it's a spirit that takes over those that cannibalize 
---
Right. But the snallygaster isn‚Äôt an actual West Virginia cryptid afaik? 
---
I dont think I've seen a 10mm pistol legendary in my 130ish levels.
---
Are you trying to frame this as criticism? The challenge is obviously a joke, kinda like sweetrolls.
---
Depends on the tribe but in most cases yeah. Those that do get a look at the spirit are said to see a beast with horns, the actual details are vague likely intentionally so. 
---
Well I guess that answers that.  Thank you!
---
Well, I‚Äôll try for the minigun then, thank you :)
---
lol I remember when I saw this. Its insane. Sadly the only way we can track how long we have played for. 
---
Hi i am on Xbox my username is ItsMajoraMask see you then 
---
Ya, they mentioned it but then never released it. I was pretty excited for it too
---
How many mutations are there? I have 13 of them at level 30. 
---
Jeez world full already lol. 
---
Not actually something you see in Fallout 76 but there are a lot of games where you can do this with actual benefits. In Fallout 76 the only benefit is the "hours played" challenge and maybe other stuff like resource extractors because they get you materiales by themselves.
---
For example in PvP games you might see a guy un your team doing nothing, or in PvE farming. If there is no AFK timer or something like it, he will get rewards by doing nothing, just leaving the game turned on while he is doing other stuff.
---
There is usually a timer to stop this players, but that timer can usually be tricked and bypassed by leaving your controller in such a way that the stick or even the trigger is hold, so they just walk against a wall and stuff like that.
---
Xbox 
---
Nothing else puts out the chance of 25% bonus damage regardless of circumstance. Threat area is an advantage.
---
I jus have a witch hat, will strapping it give player the plan? If so you can have it
---
It‚Äôs more of a Maryland myth, but it is a real cryptid.
---
No scrapping it doesn't give the plan but I'll still take the hat
---
Survival mode!!!!!

I have never posted a negative comment on FO76 ever.  I have never been "bothered" by the issues before. I am bothered now and posting against this addition to the AS now. I log on and look for cool additions to to the Camp items and skins. There is so much i want for this game. But I never thought about what I dont want. I am now. Bethesda, you know the difference between an addition that helps in game and one that doesnt. We all know you do. Add OC Decorator type items and I am buying Atoms for days. What you are doing Breaks Trust and breaks games. Please do not do this. 
---
Thank you very much! 
---
Prototype Ultracite gangüí™
---
Scrapping gives you the chance of a mod. You can find all the mods on the wiki if that helps
---
Ah, you're playing the waiting game, I see.
---
Pistols are woefully underpowered, and Bethesda hasn't said anything about giving them buffs like they did for energy weapons and heavy weapons.
---
Well fuck everything about that thing. Death Claws look mean and everything, but this fucker is down right scary looking.
---
I'll join. I'm a remnant of 2 groups my self. What is your psn?
---
Kidkarboug
---
The clean pastel ones drop from events also. 
---
I gotcha. I wasn‚Äôt sure. Is the Mothman irradiated/FEV in the game or is he just how he is? What about with the Grafton Monster? 
---
Go to blackwater mine and do the uranium fever event a bunch. Collect the gaunty off the molemen and scrap em up!! Theres even a handy work bench near by. They drop the gauntlet plans regularly too! Presto!üëçüëç
---
I never joke..
---
Same here I will dm you my username
---
You can benchmark on scorchbeasts. Take several weapons and find out how long it takes to kill one after it lands and let that be an indicator as to how that weapon performs. 
---
Vacation and paid holidays. 
---
I'll tell you about my day then when you don't respond and ignore me it'll be just like when I'm home with the woman. üòÅ
---
Explosive in my experience decreases accuracy pretty noticeably.  Its cool on some heavy guns but on ones with already meh accuracy it can actually be a pretty noticeable  drop in functionality. Also explosive can kill you as well. Its great in hoards, and pvp, but it has pretty decent drawbacks for some general gameplay on many weapons. 
---
Two shot is good. Not amazing. Its a flat marginal damage increase. Furious and bloody outclassed it in many builds. Furious is very good on heavy guns. 
---
Also I don't remember seeing the 90% weight reduction ability its pretty useful 
---
 on rifles and heavy guns. It can easily save 3 perk slots for utility. 
---
Supressor is my personal favorite for heavy gunners for general gameplay, i have a 3 star supressors gatling gun, 90% reduced weight helps a ton. It greatly reduces enemies damage. 
---
Vampire is handy for one handed melee. I have a vampires walking cane and I can farm everything but super mutants with it and never drop below 90% hp.
---
You are really overhyping two shot and explosive though. Explosive is strong yes but also easily countered in pvp and can be a liability for anyone with a medium to short range weapon like shotguns or certain heavy guns. 
---
I have a two shot explosive gatling plasma and a supressors gatling plasma. I prefer the supressors for general gameplay. The TSE is strong but like I said its got major drawbacks on a good segment of weapons.

Where did u find him? 
---
  Do not listen to gaming reviews, it can be some really toxic and biased stuff. 
---
  Never had major problems with bugs that made it where I couldn't play the game or I wanted to stop playing the game. I've played since the Beta as well and I have noticed the game running better. I also found the game pretty fun to play and get immersed into even though literally anyone on YouTube will say otherwise even if they haven't played the game.
---
They did a unquestionably shitty job of quest routing for this game. Go grind in the ash heap some, do events in that area. Also all along the western side of the map, really. The lumber yard, the little towns. 
---
What happened 
---
I got about 50 spare. gt Nesbitt121
---
You might want to consider a less obvious bait name dude.
---
pretty sure the drop off is above a few random encounter points had one drop ontop of the lemonade stand
---
I‚Äôm not sure I agree with you on that.  Because they are slow to come by and some of the prices are rather high, I would say that caps hold a decent value in the game.
---
Wandered into Savage Divide at 20, never left. 
---
Agreed!
---
They do. I've unlocked them all just from Uranium Fever events. Just scrap them at the work bench before you leave.
---
Ooooooooooooooh nooooooo 
---
Most likely it was nuked within the past 2-3 hours. There's a point where there is no more blast zone/radiation, but all the plants are still irradiated as are enemies. It's actually kind of nice. Lol.
---
Server hoping in one of those random event spots.
---
I too am playing the waiting game. 3 god-rolled pistols in my stash are waiting to get buffed lol Well, this game keeps changing in better ways. Let's hope for a good one.
---
Hey grams, he was all cool, made wait forever, was suppose to trade a ass-cav set for a AAE laser rifle. And he tried to persue me to put my stuff for free then gun and all this other nonsense. Then continued to say hes rich asf and he already has 5 copys and whatnot. He was using some fake gamertag transfering shit from another account. I watched it all crouched in a bush. 
---
Personally, I carry a suit of excavator armor with calibrated shocks for carry weight...it's 10 lbs that will let me carry another 200.  Then you can use whatever mods float your boat for the rest.   
---
Optimized servos+ Kinetic servos is a great combo, IMO. 
---
Also they only have a single mod: third blade. 
---
Location: *National Radio Astronomy Research Center*
---
Exactly!  Place a couple items in, maybe add some caps and BAAMM!  Sales!!
---
Oh ok cool
---
Maybe he was just trying to tell you about the toilet paper stuck to your foot? 
---
Don't you feel silly now.
---
I'm sitting 300+, but i'm on PC.
---
Which one?
---
As someone who loves anything even remotely Satanic or demonic looking, I want one, as a pet, and his name will be Cuddles and he will share a room with my Brahmin named Sir Loin.
---
Look to trade on r/Market76
---
Whenever you scrap a weapon, there is a chance to learn a random mod for that particular weapon. Honestly, the chance part is what I have read but in my experience it happens every time until you learn them all.
---
Anyway, you find/buy the plan for the gun you want, and start crafting them. It makes no difference what level gun you create, so make the lowest level possible to conserve crafting materials. Every gun you craft, turn around and immediately scrap it and you will learn a mod. 
---
Keep doing that until the scrapping process no longer results in learning a new mod. Voila, you now have all the mods as options when crafting that gun.
---
It's a repost from the Bethesda forums.
---
Randomly busting up camps is a *large* part of the game? It's there as an option (and I can't wait until you can opt out) but a *large* part?
---
Agreed, it is very odd to have damage numbers on weapons but not see enemy health numbers or damage numbers. Especially since certain buffs like Zealot's aren't visible in the guns base stats. Had the same issue with Skyrim and Fallout 4, I can see my weapon damages but not the enemy health pool, very odd combination. 
---
Looks like a reskinned deathclaw and I bet anyone past lvl 50 will kill it in 4 shots or less. 
---
Depends on what you can get it for.   
---
"immersion" is such a fucking personal concept, I don't know what to tell you. It's not a good RPG, falling into charicter isn't a natural thing, unless you're RPing a scavenger (which I kinda do, so that helps).   
---
Community/guilds/etc don't really exist in any serious form. There are some few "groups" but it's decidedly not the norm.   
---
the building system is a thousand times better in 4, especially with PC mods.   
---
Game stability is a fucking joke. I've crashed or dropped servers three times today, while trying to play for a single hour.   
---
We have \_one\_ raid, as MMO terminology would go. the SBQ.  It's rewarding when it works. It doesn't usually work.   
---
Personally, if you can get it for $20, it's worth that. It's a fucking \_joke\_ that they think this game is worth $60.   
---
Fastest way to get xp is to hit white springs after it is nuked. Bring a bunch of grenades and a 10mm and allot of ammo. 
---
You will need power armor and a bunch of radaway. Be best if you can team up and share rad sponge perk.
---
Your goal here is to get a bullet on everything.  As they get dropped you get xp for the kill. You won't be expected to drop the glowing targets but buy getting a bullet on them you cash in. Also, when you see a squad up of glowing enemies use a nade for the splash damage. Once they get dropped you will get a ton of xp.
---
Mats? I missed this. Explain?
---
Ok, I'll ask the obvious, are you doing a map recon to see if any high level players are/were there?  The meanies there are often player level or higher, but I can usually get into top of the world.  Avoid the adjacent vendor building
---
. 
---
  I started the Rose quests lvl 19 or 20.  Stopped at level 25 as they took me farther east. 
---
Rumbly
---
I keep getting ' Zoinks you seem to of made a wrong turn' when I hit imgur links - what's with that?
---
This has not been my experience with Explosive Weapons at all, even if they're less accurate, they're still got an area function that is an asset that other Major effects can't really match. Something that needs to be specifically countered (Like having to have Fireproof) makes it a meta-defining optimal choice.
---
I can agree with that, the resources are sufficient reward. I'm not a pvp person so I'm always hesitant to claim grafton steel or the munitions factory even though i want the lead and gun powder. 
---
Hey where is this spot exactly can u post a few screenshots for me? This sounds like a great location
---
Maybe a screenshot of your camp
---
Location on the map 
---
Thanks (I keep wasting hours trying to find a good spot then building one up then not being satisfied with the location or there's freaking scorch beasts attacking it)
---
Wait, there was the one weird terminal with technical stuff I just didn't understand.
---
Now I don't ever want to read it again lol.
---
Why does that shit have to give an exp boost? Have I been feeding my character and other people with actual shit? How many people were fed shit by the communist before the bombs? I know it's just fictional but god damn it, those sick motherfuckers.
---
I mean... cool... but that's like every nuke zone in adventure mode
---
I haven‚Äôt explored the cryptid mythology in-game much, but I feel like it‚Äôs a safe assumption that all cryptids aside from the Flatwoods Monster are some sort of mutant. That would explain why they are so common after the bombs fell.
---
Why? Legitimate question. What do you get out of ruining other people's experience?
---
I admit I‚Äôm a bit let down that it seems to just be a re-skin of a certain pre-existing enemy. Hopefully it‚Äôs got some weird new abilities thrown in, like the other cryptids have.
---
Reminds me of the dude who posted about someone destroying his special needs daughters base. 
---
Hm. But there‚Äôs pictures of the Mothman and grafton monster on magazines and they look exactly the same as their in-game counterparts. 
---
Level up 76 times in a week? Damn... Haven't managed that in 4 months
---
Not so. Empath and Herd really suck for solo players. And if you try to radaway them, you'll lose 4-6 good ones before you remove the one you don't want.
---
You can find serums for less than 200c in the markets. You can have all the mutations you want for 1200-2000 without the random chance.
---
Yeah, it's almost like when spending money people think they are entitled to get something in return without being lied to. But yeah, some people.....
---
I had one once but I got rid of it. Can't remember why, I think the damage was just abysmal. It had explosive bullets, not sure about the other effects.
---
This is how we leveled Sneak in Oblivion. 
---
Dude you have been wrong all day. It's not because someone threatened me. It's because I feel like I shouldn't have to walk on eggshells around fcking kids in a m rated game.
---
If these weiny hut jr ass kids are so scared, then they should be playing games their own age.
---
That's the point of this post. I can give to shits if a level 200 threaten me. I really don't care. But I shouldn't have to change my play style for kids in a game that's not their genre. 
---
The past two runs I've done in the silo had been super laggy. Having to wait for the game to catch up with everything we had already done (fixed all the pipes, but it took 2 minutes for it to recognize that the task was completed; same with replacing mainframe cores).
---
Grafton Monster is FEV, I dunno about Mothman though, information seems scarce
---
Mats = Materials. I had to ask that a while back lol. Also agree with Take8083 that's a good place to farm XP early lvl but for me the ultimate place is Whitesprings but that's crazy level XP and enemies when you are low level yourself :)
---
I saw that message, immediately fast traveled back there to find molerats. Kind of disappointing.
---
Thanks fam.
---
They are great for pvp because pvp is all about zoning the enemy and getting first shot. 
---
But like I said with splash damage its a liability in general PvE gameplay in many situations. 
---
What type of explosive weapons do you use? On already accurate ones its not a big deal but if you have an already low accuracy gun it can be a detriment for continual fire at medium to long distance. For pvp not as bad because you just keep a constant spray to try and murder the enemy from a distance or you're close enough and got the jump on them and they are dead. 
---
It not viable to just shoot at super low accuracy long range on regular enemies on many of the higher ammo consumption guns. Explosive handmades and other rifles don't have big drawbacks as its not a huge penalty to them. But weapons with compromised accuracy already with bad recoil can be effected pretty notably in my experience. 
---
Just as ugly and lazy as everybody builds.
---
thank you!

Found a lemonade vendor selling well lemonade 
---
I will send a friend request always looking for people to team with. It can be lonely in the wasteland. I'm more than happy to roam around visiting locations etc
---
I keep hard crashing during the One Of Us story. As soon as I enter the satellite upload building, it hard crashes.
---
Have you been farming still and noticed an increase of anything? I just got two more sheilded linings today. No idea what is going on. 
---
Press one button and repair everything. Faster than complaining about it.
---
Maybe it will unlock a bug free version of the game. 
---
35 dollars, tops.  
---
Hmm maybe my shotgun is just glitched or something
---
Didn‚Äôt mean to offend all 10 people still playing the game
---
I was on your sever I was the one inviting you to a team

North east corner at the top of map close to the fissure site.  Keep heading up you'll see a crashed vertti bird in water.

I work shift work but have days off during the week and every other weekend.  LVL 37 trying a commando build.  Just put Reddit if you send me a friend request. 
---
Are you trying to get a hat or just learn the plans for completion sake? If you just want the hat, there's a Mad Hatter party directly north of Anchor Farm (West of vault 76) that had a guaranteed spawn. It's on what look like cliff ridges on the world map.
---
Sorry, saw wanted and left team
---
Because some players just plant their asses in good locations keeping enemies from properly spawning.  And when they spawn theyre immediately killed by countless turrets and rockets.. 
---
So I did the wasteland of these parasites.  So youre welcome
---
No.  That‚Äôs too good.
---
I want to take his motherboard to an acid pit.
---
You didn't mention that you take out turret bases that mess things up, which is an entirely different thing than what this thread is about.
---
Started a new character in survival, and I'm now level 27. Someone attacked my camp once while I was in it, and I logged out before serious damage was done. It doesn't seem to be a big deal, just play smart and don't get too attached or mad when things don't go your way.
---
AFK for 4 years? By the time you get your reward, the game will likely be irrelevant.
---
I like the lobbing/shotgun barrel.  I don't like enemies getting all up in my face.
---
No, you want to do that to his data storage device and voice unit.   We can repurpose the rest of him as a DJ for Appilatchia Radio.
---
Bethesda sent him the PA helmet. He didn't buy it
---
Serious? Where are the serums?
---
You must have missed when they said, no pay to win will be in this
---
Equally annoying

Exactly how I feel
---
That ok and thank you

Think I'll take a miss on those lamb chops tomorrow night :D
---
I should have been clear. But those idiots

---
Ghouls are better exp than other mobs? I thought super mutants and robotrons and such were best? I understand the trade hub thing, but like  doesnt seem that hot imo, but I solo play alot?
---
Ew. Fucking awesome hope that loot drop is gooooooood thooooo
---
It works sometimes.. but it seems to "forget" on a disconnect or a log out then back in the next day.. 
---
Thats why i said earlier in a disconnect or log in situation
---
First thing i do:
---
Load weapon.
---
Second:
---
Equip back up weapon and load it..
---
Third:
---
Eat and drink because i have magically lost half a bar.
---
Fourth:
---
Go about my business..
---
Yeah i am pretty sure anyone thats played this game more than a week knows change weapon back and forth. But we are talking about how they seem to "forget" we have ever had a secondary weapon equipped.
---
They can easily sell that instead of p2w repair kits. 
---
This is my Power Armour Heavy Weapons Build I used to use: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f344db6&amp;d=sq2s22s32sr2s01sb0p02ee2c72ic4ip2ih2a72a42a04ls2lt2s11&amp;w=&amp;n=Heavy%20Power%20Gunner&amp;m=

Im lvl 202 id say with the right build any weapon type can be good
---
I mean Mama Dolce's in it's entirety is a front for the Communists.

So chances are any major production facility had a spy hub, which probably also had a sewage "additive" function.

So, probably A LOT.

Have you played since they fixed spawn camping?
---
Same goes for plans and recipes. Not sure what you do to a 1/4 book or manual that makes it disappear, weigh nothing, and can't loan it to a friend after you've read it.
---
I like you went higher but I so wanted to include the junk extractor. There is a very specific spot to put he camp beacon and get both.  Then 30 minutes of attempts to get the first floor set, if it is off 3/4 inch the rest of base will not work. 
---
 
---
There's no other solution, client side copies would be open to manipulation and it would actually simply increase loading screen time, as your client would need to negotiate with server and do a comparative differential with the server side copy of the base to ensure nothing had changed. The way it works is the best way until they make bases persist, which they've discussed. 
---
I want the plan 
---
For sure. Wasted maybe like 160 caps relocating haha
---
Just point a laser at the tv screen :). Center it up and tape it down
---
I guess I wouldnt care if someone took the time and effort to do that for some atoms. I never would but I wouldnt be like personally offended if some other person felt the need.
---
Are you talking about the part of the crashed space station that looks like it's embedded in the earth in the Northmost part of the area?
---
I can't help, as I play on xbox. Would recommend not rushing to 50 though as there isn't much for endgame.
---
It‚Äôs also lighter than the polymer. 
---
Got a quad single action revolver that would be fun to play with but dear lord this thing is a pea shooter and super limited mods. I also have a ** .44  but with  no bull barrel and it's weak performance it's waiting for the legendary vendor to buy/exchange. 
---
Yes, they gave him a fix. Thats fantastic! Weapon Artisan is also a great help at extending weapon life, no? Yes, just yes üòÇ‚ôøÔ∏è
---
I've heard this request waaaay more than repair kits.....
---
Ewe 
---
Everyone else agrees. Except BEthesda.  Or in a few months Bethesda will release the option as part of the Atom shop and argue its not p2w because everyone can change perks anyway!

I noticed today there's a power armor station in the Whitesprings fire station. Imo, I see no other explanation other than that the in-univese firefighters, or at least the loaded &amp; private firefighter squad in Whitesprings, use them.
---
The game has changed. Pacifist mode allows you to take zero damage unless you‚Äôve opened up to PVP. 
---
That's awesome!  Ah, Winfield...our old rivals in high school. (I graduated from Hurricane High School!) 
---
Good news! It's a suppository! 
---
This would be cool but adding a whole town suddenly is a tall order.  From what we've seen so far new quests open up inside buildings that just looked boarded up before.  Also if I had to reckon it on the map Shepherdstown would be somewhere near yellow sandy still?  That is a very rough guesstimate but either way not really anything there to build this off of.
---
Thanks 
---
I did this for a few of the Fasnacht events after I got tired of the 100+ run with no rare masks.
---
Unclear. So you somehow had more fun on the pvp server doing the exact same thing you do on the non-pvp server, except on the pvp server some dbag almost ruined it?
---
Yea, kinda forgot about that.
---
it does
---
That'll teach me for not checking before I get back into my power armor lol
---
No 
---
I had my opportunity and I missed it haha

Last day of double xp in survival. Find a area that spawns alot of scorched kill server hop and kill. The tunnel bottom middle of your map is great. It's the one to the left of watoga. Kill scorched on both ends and in tunnel. Two trips through is a lvl with double survival xp event happening now. With well rested buff it's about 2 to 3 lvls an hour. If you start now you will be lvl 50 well before the event ends.
---
Scarcity of Single Action Revolver mods is truly a big problem. Doesn't even have a hardened reciever, can't even be a good contender to .44 Pistol. Western Revolver is just always the best. SAR has a cool looking and firing sound, though
---
The Gatling Gun ironsights really just show me how little they put into this game QA wise. And the fact that it's still here 6+ months later is just a kick in the nuts.
---
It would be difficult because the outfits replace the player's body. Most outfits would end up looking like horrific Frankenstein creations without proper tweaking. That's a lot of assets to change for something so small, unfortunately.
---
It's the amount of XP you can rack up in a short time. There's a lot of ghouls there. Squishy squishy legendary dropping ghouls.

I imagine they work like real life board games. I wanna say I think they have their own version of operation. 
---
My guess is this was an alternate character that he uses to move items around.  As you said it is doubtful he could get a lvl 45 black diamond at his level.
---
I use them. Automatic critical builds were secretly god tier,  but recent nerfs and adjustments took care of that. 
---
For a single shot build, you want the obvious covert operative, better criticals, and concentrated fire perks. Covert operative multiplies your damage by 2.5x, concentrated fire for weak point targeting multiplies damage by 2x, and all of the critical damage you can get in the game puts you around 2.35x critical damage. You will want a silenced 10mm or .38 as a kind of battery and a black powder pistol (BPP) for massive sneak attack weak point critical hits. My BPP can deal a little more than 1,800 damage. Good for PVE, bad for PVP due to one shot protection.
---
For a full auto build, it is about the same as above, except you only use the 10mm or .38. I think my Damage per Second is around 1,900. Low vats costs lets you kill most trash mobs with great speed. It is also leagues better for PVP. You do need to play smart though. Wait for the perfect moment to strike and retreat if the enemy lives. You do not want to get into a man fight with TSE. You want to burst them down and force them to chase you.
---
It could be like an Irish coffee with a little radiation.... or the green stuff those big lunks keep going on about 
---
Start a new character your fucked on perks. Can't do rifles with melee with out being horrible at everything.  Shot gun and melee share some special trees, can even make a melee heavy weapon hybrid. By splitting your specials between rifle and melee you have made that toon useless, sorry.

Isn't there a Rocket mod for the Al Rise Version?

Can I just do a rifle build then? What perks should I add or get rid of?

25 caps per drinks is a good price , anything above that is kinda steep 
---
The flux you get at nuke sites is raw. At a chemistry bench you can turn it into stable flux (with high radiation fluid,  glowing mass, and hardened mass).
---
Once it's stable you can use it to craft certain items like some power armor mods, special ammo,  and grenades.

Honestly, while not damming evidence that it can't produce any, I'm rather surprised it didn't. After all it IS a facility with a clandestine secondary role (or perhaps its primary role is purely a coverup, but either way...) which one would expect such an item would be found at.
---
Go for it, but remember you don't have to actually pay for the game.  GameStop is/was doing a deal where you buy the PS controller and they would give you FO76 for free.  You can return the controller and they'll refuse to take back the game.   They rather have the tax wright off versus having to deal with the game. 
---
Had fun with the chainsaw for awhile
---
I've heard that Grahm  only spawns when you claim a workshop. Haven't tested it out yet.
---
Honestly it would be easier to just start over. You want like one point in strength for a rifle build that does not even include all the other cards you would need to get. It would take like 25 or 30 lvls to fix that build all while being gimpy. 
---
You get a few different items(high radiation fluids, hardened masses, glowing masses) from enemies in the nuke zone,  you can turn them plus unstable flux into stable flux and its used for higher end crafting (underarmor, power armor mods, serums)

 I've heard that Grahm only spawns when you claim a workshop. Haven't tested it out yet.

There's a few different places around the map where it can spawn, but Charleston station is the easiest. Here's a guide.

https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a94qxe/how_to_find_the_vendor_bot_responder/
---
A few months ago I spent a few days constantly server hopping trying to get it and never could. The vendor doesn't spawn very often, then when it does there's no guarantee it will have the coat. I gave up but still hit it once in a while when I'm in the area and got lucky this time.
---
2 days
---
Yeah it can take a while. Farm nuked Whitespring to level up quick or West Tek.
---
Can‚Äôt take dmg from other players. Can‚Äôt hurt other players. 
---
Depending on the buffs and stackability, that could be hilariously broken in PVE situations.
---
Get a full team of four and have everyone chug milk for a Scorchbeast Queen fight or Vault raid. 
---
Really the moral of the story was that he got lucky with servermates, the exception. And the rule finally showed up.
---
What this fella said. I wouldn‚Äôt rush it because there really isn‚Äôt much for you to do yet endgame wise. 
---
Grafton is still hard op so don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be a walk in the park I‚Äôve seen a wendigo here and there before and deathclaws
---
The business-minded people at Bethesda don't care how much people complain. If player engagement stays at least relatively flat and they make money off it, it's a win. They will use the data from this item on sale to look at how it's impacting their ARPPU/ARPEH/other key metrics and make a choice based on that.
---
Complaining about this on Reddit/Twitter/forums will do little to change anything. If gamers want to make a statement, they need to stop playing ***any*** games from companies that do things they do not like. No free games, no games you already own. Stop following them on social media, stop giving them likes and views. You need to remove any form of engagement that you have to make a mark, and you need to get millions of like-minded people to do the same. As long as we jump through their hoops nothing will change. In my experience, one of the worst thing that can happen to a game studio is for interest in their products to go away. As long as people keep playing they will keep seeing what they can get away with.
---
I've never been that lucky in my entire life haha, I got 3 rare jumpsuits without even realizing it

The toxic valley is still the next logical step after the forest, shouldnt be as hard as the divide.

Well from what I glean browsing the market, each are worth around 6k. Which are you willing to buy?

Its perfectly viable to split your perks between two damage trees, but you have to remember its a compromise. The first level of the damage perks are more potent. For melee its pretty easy to get incisor 3 and 3 damage perks for 6 strength and be pretty viable in PvE with a good weapon. 
---
Ada skeleton isn't good. Its way too easy to heal limbs just pop a single stim. 
---
You should get class freak if you have starched genes. Class freaks lets you pick up many mutations that are subpar on their own but give some nice direct stats. Scaly skin, bird bones, marsupial, eagle eye. Scaly akin and bird bones together give you a nice ap boost, 50 dr/er for the cost of 1 str. 
---
Suppressor is really only good for heavy gunners. The charisma is better off elsewhere. 
---
Splitting ypur build means compromises and you have a lot of utility perks.  
---
Oh boy. This isn‚Äôt going to go well. üò£
---
Chem station.
---
Nothing a modded chainsaw/power drill or fat man dont fix it rather remove
---
Perfect there is hope then,  1 point in strength,pick all the rifle perks in perception including vats 15 points,  lone wonder in charisma 4 points. 6 points endurance, 5 int max, rest of points split into agility and luck.   A rifle build will look very close to that special point wize.
---
Just went through that post. Thanks for letting me know on the other spawn locations. Definitely something I didn‚Äôt know and will need to check to see if it‚Äôs a better area!
---
I was afraid of that...lol. Thanks for the reply
---
That's a different bug as far as I know and I mostly experience that when I have two of the same weapon (IE: anti-armor deathclaw gauntlet and an instigating DCG).
---
TL;DR Make fallout p2w by adding a memebership.

Fucking genius

Ooh didn‚Äôt know that was the current market price. Was hoping to buy either one for 3k but not trying to lowball you

You dont know what pay to win means.   This isnt pay to win at all.

Pay to win is:  For $x you get +50% attack dmg for 2 hours.

It would be nice if they gave more mods for them
---
What if you a fucking minor

GT evansmj
---
Tell me about it! Every single time I take a workshop it crashes shortly after the first attack. It's so frustrating, I too ignore workshops now which is disappointing as they were quite handy.
---
Another form of death claw. Sooo,,,what's the big deal ? I just hope my camp is not now going to be fighting off these things. If so I'll have to delete some stuff to remake kill zones. Right now iv got more of a castle setup lol. 
---
Why?  Some of us have full time jobs and things like this save us time.
---
Older gamers have more money than time.   Making something happen faster isnt pay to win.  The end game is still the same no matter what.
---
maybe, until the game becomes solely pay to win.
---
well that one is bugged so if you get one you get them all 
---
- Access your Stash from Anywhere (not in combat). how is that not P2W? tell me. you get see a player wanted. stash all your junk and meds so you don't lose them BEFORE you get in combat. 
---
Won't affect the Adventure player base. 
---
You can do that anyway.. port to your home, stash your stuff, go fight player.
---
I'm fairly confident this is a bait/troll post. 
---
But if it isn't. Why are you reserving comments in your own thread? Do you sort comments by oldest first?
---
you DO know adventure still has PVP right? just because you can't be forced into it anymore doesn't mean it won't affect adventure. also you're another fine example of selfish gamers not caring about anything that doesn't directly affect themselves.
---
Still, "hardly any" over 7600 hours adds up. It's close to a year of nonstop running time if you ignore any power outages, disconnects, server maintenance, etc. 
---
You can, but what if your playing survival and you get attacked?  you can pull out 50 stimpaks out of no-where and use them. 
---
This is a serious post.  And yes, I do sort by oldest first.
---
That could be nice! But i think we'll only get P2W repair kits
---
This sounds like a good way to kill time. Nice idea.
---
Absolutely not, if I had to pay for stash I would stop playing. I already paid the entry ticket price, it should be free, it is a joke at this point and no way I would pay a monthly subscription to get what we should already have
---
If you are in survival and get attacked, then you are in combat and cannot open your stash.  I am not the end all be all but I am sure they can tweak the rules on survival some.
---
I'd use the camp venture as it would give a defense-able location outside the newb zone and make sense why waves of scorch were attacking with good weapons instead of lvl 10s 
---
Lol guy you don't know me. Nor what I stand for. Making this game pay to win simply put won't happen. Just bc I'm not worried about something doesn't make me selfish. And if it WAS pay to win it wouldn't last very long bc the community wouldn't stand for it. Just bc I don't get all bitchy about the same things you do doesn't make me selfish. 
---
CoD WW2 was horrible with that. They decided to have DAILY special orders to finish anywhere between 30 and 150 matches to get limited time bribes for weapon variants or uniforms. Infected was unplayable on PC because 80-100% of the other players would just be AFKing with a macro. The funny thing is this was near the end of the game's life cycle, so all of the people just ended up killing off the game even faster for skins they never even ended up using. Kind of sad, but what can you do. People aren't always logical creatures
---
best you can do is set up a terminal inside and use the holotape games, really wish they could just be loaded in permanently after you find them to avoid having to keep them on you at all times. 
---
You can split melee and rifles, the toon isn't "useless" its certainly subpar to either specialized build but you can make it work easily for PvE and PvP. If you go bloodied that helps a good bit. But melee is pretty cheap to get into if you have a decently powerful melee weapon. You can spend 6 points in str perks and have a capable melee, for PvE encounters. Good equipment can make many builds viable with minimal perk investment, not optimal but viable.
---
And you are allowed to disagree, which is fine.  I happen to be on the other side of the spectrum as you on this topic, I want this game to do well and games do well by making money.
---
I wouldnt mind spending 10 bucks here and there for PLUS instead of on cosmetic items, personally.
---
I dont think it is a bug. I think it is made to be a free aim where you get better accuracy if you have the feeling for it, which the op apperantly does not have. And to be honest, how would you use a sight on them? You fire them from your hip, not aiming it infront of your face.
---
How dare you
---
Yes. But thats the challenge. I have a melee build at lvl 45 that is strong enough to handle lvl 80 SB solo. This should be fun. Haha. 
---
Man I wish. 
---
300% more stash size.... you know how many mini nukes or meds you can carry with that? 
---
How do you "aim down the sights" on a weapon you fire from your hip? Its not like you are holding the minigun infront of your face and looking down the barrels.
---
I don't agree with this, the game is still broken. Just last night I was struggling to attach wires and I was looking like Mario bouncing all the place. This is just one simple thing appeared of the last patch. Sorry was kinda drifting a little. My point is, you can't ask for a monthly sub with a busted half assed game that was giving to us. Now maybe in a couple years when the game runs perfect then it would be cool. But for now, let bethesda fix this game. I truly want this game to succeed.
---
jimnvalerie, play on and off during the day, usually farming junk and caps, wife and i explore in the evenings she is astrydlynne

feel free to add us, im lvl 53 and she is lvl 36

---
Probably the best bug I've encountered in a Bethesda game haha
---
No. that is the heavy mod. only for the All rise. it can be removed, but then you cannot get it again
---
Well I could have guessed that
---
Sorry man, I'd hook you up, but I'm trying to get a shop up and running and this has been the best luck I've had in this game so far as far as good drops.
---
So I'm gonna hold on to them and see how much I can get for them, and use them to entice people to check out my wares.
---
I also want it to succeed.  I love it, even with all its shoddy interworking. I just see how they are already trying to push money out of this game, with their over priced items inside the ATOM store, and now repair kits.  At least just call it what it is and give us some nice stuff while you take our money.  
---
Let the whales whale if they want.  All it does is give FO76 more money which means they will do more to make the game that much better.
---
The world runs on money, you and I both know this.
---
Yes, or whatever you want.  The point it, it doesnt break anything.  It is just inside your stash.
---
It looks like a Deathclaw fucked a goat.

### CD Projekt Red
---
Okay, so I've read a couple other threads that say it's half ballistic damage, so in theory 45% of half of my damage is getting the benefit of the card?
---
It still seems like it should be more noticeable.
---
What counts as good amount of stims?
---
To be honest it does not need more abilites. It already have the extra carry weight and extra ore. No other PA gets abilities. Better to give all other PAs a set bonus. Same thing with regular armor.
---
You'll want a Vampire's heavy weapon. That'll make you tanky for sure.

This is how I did it since reclaimation day on my main. Ran straight to Watoga to claim my all rise at level 50 though so didnt wait till 60. üòÇ

Hmmmmm, welp you convinced me.

I guess I've been quite lucky as my friend and I haven't received any crashes! c:
---
I am not into the pvp scene at all, and im guessing you are -- but like I said, stash access points/times/whatever can easily be modified from non-pvp mode.
---
Pain Train is usually great for heavy builds. I think there's a perk card configurer online somewhere. Might be worth looking into
---
If I remember correctly allowing two direction item trade in the trade menus was the cause of duplication and other bugs for every Bethesda Fallout game.
---
I always have Poseidon powered up when i log in so i just claim the workshop and setup idk why it does this or if its just insane luck
---
Ain‚Äôt that the truth. I remember hitting some dry spots in previous entries, but nothing like the brick wall encountered around levels 20-30.
---
Please look at ESO compared to PLUS-ESO.  It isnt game breaking OP stuff -- it is just a few things that are nice to have. And for ESO giving you them nice things, you pay a small fee each month.  If you dont want to PLUS, you dont have too, and you still have access to the full game.  Just like with FO76.
---
Do you have a link?
---
As I said to the other poster, please look at ESO as a model.  It works, and works well.

---
So basically  turn this into a adventure membership only.
---
Oh, I was not aware of that.  Well I would much rather deal with slower trading than more duping issues and bad press
---
I would rather Bethesda focus on content and expansion than fixing issues and putting out fires.
---
I think that your argument for games making money assumes that more people will want to play a game where non subscribers are second class citizens while giving the impression that they're trying to milk the existing players wouldn't have a negative impact on the game.
---
Perception is a large factor and eso Isa different more quest and npc interaction heavy game and while I don't think that any type of monetization is inherently bad I think that it is safe to say that porting over the monetization model from one game to another isn't a worthwhile solution over a more tailor-made made model, if one were to be implemented.
---
It would be like suggesting overwatch have a subscription model because wow does and blizzard also made that. They're different games. 
---
Nice con, duper.
---
Um no, so the nuka paints are specific for a reason so are the BoS, atom store yes they should be all paints since you pay a lot of atoms for them, and the atom store ones that are single sets only are half the price. The only thing I disagree with Bethesda in terms of PA paints is that BoS should‚Äôve been on all the T models, spefically t51B since that is/was what the brotherhood actually used, I just feel that BoS PA should be t51B and t60 and maybe t45 
---
It looks nothing like t51 imo. Also, is there a reason you have to add it's the strongest power armor in game? Its really easy to get it's nothing special 
---
Lol okay
---
Thanks this the site I was looking for üòÅ
---
I do not understand what you mean by that...?
---
Here‚Äôs my help, screw TSE off, there is no current reason to focus on them, their outdated and trash only slightly useful for pve and even then quad etc are better, my help is sell every tse weapon you have buy AAE or Quad Explosive weapons depending on if your pvp or pve, if your pvp also grab tank killer
---
So? Its a good way to track play time and hopefully the game stays alive for someone to complete it. All challenges are not for all players to complete. Alot of players want so much handed to them, be happy for the huge amount of atoms we can collect by playing and completing dailys and weeklys. Its not hard to get 1000 atoms a week.
---
Like only for the adventure mode.
---
O also FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PEOPLE get class freak, you don‚Äôt realise how great it is until you use it, I‚Äôd suggest for luck, 2 bloody mess, 2 starched genes and 3 class freak 
---
FO76 version of a YouTuber
---
I understand what you are saying -- but if Bethesda plans to make money anyway, at least give the people who really enjoy FO76 something really good for their money.  That is why I suggested ESO model -- and I think it can work well with FO76.
---
I‚Äôm currently using a quad lever but I want to get an explosive lever
---
A good few mutations provide a nasty downside class freak won‚Äôt cure.  
---
Not worth it to random up muts just to be a cheap ass. 
---
Do you not know what they've been talking about adding? Pay to win is VERY possible if they're allowed to add repair kits and this other shit they've been talking about.
---
Consoles can PC can't q
---
I like that build amigo :)
---
Then get a Explosive quad, don‚Äôt settle for a tse
---
Are you a PvP or pve build? 
---
I can‚Äôt find one

Nuke that workshop / farm in the Southwest of the Map.  Billings Homestead I think?  With all the corn, and razorgrain.  Get more than you can carry in 1 trip.

Melee and rifles are literally opposite special trees. At best your build will be at half its potential at all times. Just because you CAN do it, does not mean you should.

No worries - have fun building your tank amigo :)

Again, slight surprise to not have found one, but again not 'damming evidence'.  
---
Potentially noteworthy is that I **have** been to both of these locations on this character before, but it was many many game *and* real-life days ago, so if any had been found here previously they should've respawned by now.
---
Given that being the center is the whole point of the game.. yeah assume he is..
---
Also given that this is a game for solo and team play.. solo means you are the center..

Are you under the impression it isn‚Äôt a reward for shazbot and giggles? 
---
A lot of games gave absurd achievements that reward nothing but E-Peen.

It's not funny, because it's true. üòî

I think it would be nice to have a flag pole for camps with the American flag or your name, guild, faction, team or whatever 
---
I haven't read the terminal in months, but for some reason my impression was that the piping leading upwards was for the deployment of liberator robots.
---
Who cares, don‚Äôt settle for a tse, go quad, double or vampires Explosive. All of which are so much better then tse, sure tse has a little bit higher damage but you get in a fight with anyone what you want a outdated piece of trash or something that has 4x the ammo or can heal, I still suggest however if you do sway into pvp get a AAE Lever 
---
Why is every other post on here about shoving them in your ass ? Lmfao. Do they just dissolve or do people that have used more than one just have them lodged there for ever ? I'm asking for a friend lol. 
---
Both can be milked too.
---
Repair kits aren't that bad. While I do understand why everyone's pissed. Literally no one is gonna buy that shit. I've got faith in the community. 
---
A players relationship with items in ESO is on an entirely different scale than in fallout 76 which gives your proposal a significantly different impact in fallout.
---
No, for both modes.  But I was hitting on PvP part since you mentioned the stash stuff.
---
I am sure they can make it so (on the pvp server) you only can access your insta-stash once every 10 minutes or something.  (this is just an example).
---
I‚Äôve noticed some people here will use any excuse to complain or insult the game. It‚Äôs like FO76 kicked them as a child.
---
Also, screw off levers if you can find a quad explosive, al Lowell and good you won‚Äôt one so get a tse sure, but also get a quad explosive hunting rifle, there everywhere atm and you can compare for yourself, remembering hunting rifles are only slightly inferior to levers 
---
The two HUGE tubes that you can stand in and see the sky are for releasing spy bots hidden in the smoke they release.

Absolutely not. This is a terrible idea. Caps are hard enough to come by as it is for most people dude. 
---
I totally agree with this. I would love to be able to setup bar games in my shop.
---
Since they didn't release it on Steam it's only way I can see my playtime. I'll be sad when it completes and can't track it anymore.

I've got a three star zealots 10mm that I'm saving for the legendary vendor update.

Yeah, that might be the case
---
Got it
---
 Not if his ‚Äútrade partner‚Äù  set him up for it. 
---
Honestly roaming faction soldiers/ merchants, areas, and NPC‚Äôs would be a great idea. Taking to actual people to advance the story. This could have easily been a solo open world game with a story of stopping the scorched plague and beasts . With diverse factions and characters. Like it literally could have been that and multiplayer too. 
---
I'm down. You still on?
---
No your wrong, I have a Cav assassin melee rifle build, I just sacrificed everything but agility for my Cav, strength for melee (and shotguns with 3 points for shotgun perks) and perception for my rifles, so I‚Äôm sorry but no you can defiantly do it, my states are S 12, P 11 (used to be like 15 but moved to agility for AP) E 1, C 3, I 8, A 14, L7
---
10-year olds should not even play the game at all. Not to put any parent down but what kind of parent let a 10-year old play a game like this?
---
Whaaaat? My Nuka Girl outfit with the thigh-high patent leather high heeled boots is totally practical for running around the wasteland!
---
Seriously though, yes to shoe options, pleeeeease.
---
That's what the "Wastelanders" part of the content roadmap is rumored to be. I would read more up on it if I were you. Sounds like we'll be getting back to our old fallout "choices and decisions that will impact the wasteland" and it shows a vault boy and a woman dressed in typical wastelander rags
---
Yeah but I'm playing something else rn, add epicduck00
---
Any instigating weapon period...or explosive flare gun
---
Maybe they are legendary
---
I sold 2 ants for 50c each lol

It‚Äôs their armor almost 99% of the time.  That mixed with game lag.  ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

This is my build.

---
It's geared more toward PVE,  of course.  Power armor isn't great  for  PVP in its current state though I think that could change in the future though as someone on here found that legendary power armor is coming in the future. Max out intelligence and strength. 
---
This build is great for PVE though and fighting scorch beasts and the  queen especially. 
---
The perks you see are more or less the ones that I keep permanently equipped. For crafting ammo, I equip all levels of ammo smith and super duper then un-equip when I am done.  I also equip scrapper perk when scrapping steel to make for ammo. 
---
I have my camp  near an acid deposit to smelt lead ore to make lead and also to make  gun powder. 
---
You can mine an incredible amount of lead ore from the lucky whole mine- ***BUT YOU HAVE TO WEAR EXCAVATOR ARMOR!***  I emphasize this point because I taught a team mate of mine to mine in lucky whole.  The next time he did he he wondered why he had so little compared to when we first went. Answer: excavator armor.
---
I harvest steel to make ammo mainly by scrapping weapons from uranium fever event and West Tek research. 
---
I use an anti-armor gatling gun as my main weapon for everyday use because it goes through ammo very slowly and with ammo smith you can make 180 rounds per batch.  
---
I have an anti-armor .50 cal, TSE Minigun and TSE cryolator and several Gatling laser variations that I mostly set aside for the queen. Those are the kind of weapons best saved for special occasions as they eat through ammo insanely fast and aren't really practical for everyday use. 
---
I also have an anti-armor Gatling plasma and two-shot Gatling plasma that I use as my ammo supplies will permit whenever I feel like it. 
---
Second this. I dislike damage tickers even in MMO‚Äôs, I get a good enough idea based on health drop - don‚Äôt need specific numbers popping up on screen and cluttering things.
---
Read what I said please, my build which is in fact a rifle/melee hybrid and has CAV meaning I need a lot of points in agility works amazing and I have all melee perks. However yes what your saying is someone correct, because of my Cav rifle melee I have essentially no endurance and charisma and average intelligence and luck, however the suggestion that it is useless is far from true, what he could easily do is have majority of points in perception (say 15 since most Rifleman do) have 9 in strength (piss off strong back) and unlike me have like 5 in agility and spread the other points out, his build could defiantly work 
---
Did you not watch the videos? The first guy is in excavator so it's not his armor and the second guy  is lvl 4 so it's not his armor either.
---
Will do. I'm ZeaIot. (The "L" is actually a capital i)
---
Lol. I get it.
---
Read my comments and tell me how useless they are if you want to know my actual cards pm i can squeeze the same amount of damage out of s melee and rifle as a specialist in those 2 could easily 
---
Falloutbuilds. com
---
Realized you could buy serums 10 minutes ago, bought a bunch and it is way more effective
---
 I‚Äôm gonna go ahead and say if this is in adventure mode it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre on pacifist then.  
---
They could be wearing auto stimpack armor
---
If you‚Äôd like proof a build similar to this can work HMU, sadly I got rid of my AAE Lever and have strayed away from my hybrid due to me changing from Unyielding Cav to assasin Cav and needing more and more Agility for AP. Anyway you want further proof a build like this can work HMU I‚Äôll send you what perks I have how you play it and if your on Xbox demonstrate first hand 
---
So you didnt watch the videos or read the post then? I said in the post it's in survival and in the videos we are in combat.... why are you commenting without reading or watching? That's like if I rate a book I've only seen the cover of... 
---
You baffle me.
---
I'd like to know the actual dmg with anti armor perks or weapons. From what I understand, the AA does significant damage but we don't actually see a number that relates to that damage,so we're basically guessing what the total dmg of a gun is. 
---
It was a magician before the war.
---
Did you watch the videos? The 1st guy is in PA so he isn't wearing autostim and the second guy is lvl 4 so he isn't either. 
---
I‚Äôve played pvp mmorpg‚Äôs since Meridian 58, and ovp MUD‚Äôs before that.
---
There ARE people who will troll until they get bored, but for the most part we PvP lovers don‚Äôt mindlessly shoot people like we‚Äôre playing Doom.
---
We use the pvp option for other reasons. Someone acts like a troll? Shoot them. Pvp flag enabled allows for a lot more roleplaying than structured, enforced pve does. Someone trolling you on a PvE server is basically immune to all retribution. Because people can work together to hunt reds, often trolls who persistantly act disruptive simply get counter-trolled.
---
PvP just scares people who don‚Äôt regularly play it. My niece starts sweating when she‚Äôs in survival mode when she‚Äôs on her own, so I totally get why carebears don‚Äôt like it.
---
'source?' is a common response when someone doesn't believe what you're saying is true.  It's become very common and overused so it gets down voted on occasion.  I know for me it often it often feels lazy or passive aggressive.  We all have Google. None of this applies to you, in my opinion you seemed to have a genuine question rather than just being a turd.  I'm just stopping in to maybe explain your karma rollercoaster.  I could be wrong.  Reddit giveth and Reddit taketh away and sometimes Reddit giveth back again.  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Thank you, I am on xbox but I can't get on until friday. Could you PM me the N&amp;D link for your build?
---
Loot is somewhat randomized. You‚Äôre supposed to always get the same *type* of weapon as what the scorched is attacking you with (melee for melee, etc.), but you won‚Äôt necessarily get the exact same weapon. I‚Äôm not entirely certain the reasoning behind this, I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs the result of wanting to limit the drop rate on certain items without constraining the options available for weapons on the mobs.
---
I once had scorchbeasts, 2 deathclaws, yao gui, scorched, and other stuff at the drop site
---
Well I did just watch.  Looks like armor and/or game lag to me.  I stick to my guns on this one.  üëçüèº
---
I‚Äôll make one for it now, would you like it with or without my Cav armour? I‚Äôd suggest without because that was when I was a true hybrid 
---
Same, it used to run beautifully without a problem on PS4, but now there‚Äôs tons of loading, freezing and overall bad frame rate issues. During all of this my poor old PS4 is screaming for mercy. 
---
What are the reasons for the Quantum Power Armor Paint being exclusive to X-01 and the Nuka Cola Paint being exclusive to T-51?
---
The only reason I can think of is because they were exclusive to those Power Armors in Fallout 4 and Bethesda did not bother changing that.
---
Same applies to the Brotherhood of Steel Paint for T-60.
---
Is this going down?
---
w/o please
---
‚ÄúSurprise mother fucker‚Äù
---
I‚Äôll also make one that I‚Äôd suggest for you, particularly if you happen to have sent or Cav assassin armour 
---
[https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)
---
Bethesda really has ruined the Deathclaw in general. Super mutants and Deathclaws are the go to enemy it seems. Both are supposed to be extremely limited. 
---
I hope this thing has some unique animations and abilities, if it comes at me swinging like a deathclaw the whole fight I‚Äôm gonna be pissed. 
---
Its almost like there are draw backs to playing a multiplayer game solo....
---
seriously people have been complaining over there being no human npcs since launch, like it was some sort of shock that they didn't mention before hand.
---
Idk how on earth you can say armor when I just explained that being impossible and it's too consistent and last too long to be "lag" especially when the frames stay smooth.
---
They already sell real fallout chess boaeds. Would be a clever cross promotion. 
---
Well the first 2 are lore that way and the BoS my above statement still stands, that‚Äôs the one they should‚Äôve made t51 and t60 ALSO if you didn‚Äôt know in lore etc their are nuka paints for I think all PA
---
&gt;   They also arent wearing autostim armor as one is in PA  
---
Wrong.  There is a medic pump mod which auto injects stimpaks when health is low. Not saying that's what's happening here, but  auto stim in power armor is indeed possible. 
---
I have like one sent piece and its powered and i think it's a combat left arm
---
Same, but nonetheless it is an (easy) avenue for people to start PvP with you.
---
I'll probably play in 10 min
---
astral-savant :) 
---
Dude was always on mentats
---
There is a stealthboy mod for at least some PA models. So that is an alternate source of the effect glitch, whatever he did exactly.
---
Ooo, sent is a lot easier to build, doesn‚Äôt require the rediculous AP I need on my Cav build, my pistol sent build is so much simpler. Anyway Ima grab some info off you so I can 1. Show you my old hybrid and 2. Make you the build I‚Äôd personally suggest 
---
Also, I‚Äôll see if I can find a quad explosive hunting rifle now I know your on Xbox for you
---
Power armor is still armor.  There are PVP PA builds.  And I could be wrong but I‚Äôm pretty sure there is sentinel armor low enough of a level for them to wear it too.  Again I could be wrong on the second part.  
---
But only a single piece that can only activate once every 2 minutes. So that cant be it either.
---
A little too COD for my taste. 
---
I like your build I might just copy yours
---
Cliff Bethenski
---
You are wrong, sentinal doesn't work that way. I use a full set and that's not how they work at all.
---
I just did!
---
Your giving up more than you think just looking at your numbers, your at half the dmg you could be doing all while sacrificing easy pvp defences. I will say your point spread is close to the best possible for melee and rifles for pve. You have to play it,  if you enjoy playing that build all the power yo you. It's just not the best use of points for max potential. 
---
Furous handmade is super super rare. 
---
I have a 3 star furious handmade and i turn down offers of 30k alot. 
---
Mine is...
---
Furious
---
Explosive 
---
+250 damage Resistance while reloading ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°
---
Im always open to consider tradea Ps4 name is leeberry219 
---
I appreciate the cool idea **and** attempting to save me a trip to Google. Take my upvote!
---
But they can still attack your camp, yes?
---
It doesn't take 49 special cards to get to a full damage build in any weapon. Rifleman takes 12 core perception cards to reach efficient damage 9 for damage, 3 for tank killer. Tormentor is a bad ability. Its subpar to both heavy guns and shotguns cripple perks. It doesn't even stagger. Also with rifleman you'll be firing less shots anyways, which makes the 15% chance meh. Bloody mess works with all damage its a flat 15% multiplicative with everything. 
---
For melee 3-6 damage cards (3 for 30%) and incisor for armor ignore will make you decent with any level 50 one star melee weapon with a decent bonus like instigating or bloody if you are going bloody. You don't even need swing speed if you get a two star with the 40% bonus.  
---
Next you need class freak. You can trade 2 strength for 20 carry weight, +4 perception, +4agi, +50dr/er, and +100er. You don't even need those ironclad perks. Also devoting 5 intelligence for 5 cost -50% degradation isn't needed. Degradation isn't that bad, especially of you are hybrid, since you can mix damage between your melee and guns. 
---
You don't even need white knight. You can be more than capable easily in two things, you won't have all the special perks like tormentor but not all of those perks are even that great. You could even mix in nerd rage and serendipity.  
---
Any thing you get from weight reduction perks and carry weight perks you can easily tailor your equipment to later. Need more carry weight? Add pockets or make your armor ultralight build. 
---
If you need specials for raw stats you have under armor and legendaries and mutations for that. Only get core ability perks and you can split and specialize and be very competent in two things even if they share no special. You might have less carry weight and stuff might break a bit sooner but its managable. 
---
You also ignore the fact that +30% damage bonus only costs 3 perk slots while +60% costs 9. You can easily take the 9 and get 45% and 30% versus one 60%. Bloody mess is multiplicative and 15% so thats even more. 
---
You just aren't thinking about equipment enough if you think you can only do one thing. A solid legendary can cover where you might be missing 1 or two minor perks. 
---
Unless you like having caps. 
---
Accounts with 10 year olds playing them should be banned.
---
This is not a game for 10 year olds.  Any parent that lets their very young kids on un-moderated chat with adults needs to have their heads examined.
---
World peace solved.
---
And you can tweak it to suit you.    I've personally had fun with the build though. Takes some grinding and leveling to make it fully viable.  Early game I might invest more in shot guns or melee, because I think it takes a long while for the heavy gun perks to open up as well as all the needed ammo crafting perks. Shot guns and heavy guns are in the same tree, so it's a simply matter of swapping them out.
---
You are limiting your perspective by only looking at max potential. You never considered viability. Someone asked for help with a build they wanted to play and you didn't say here is how we can make it work. You said sorry your concept is garbage sorry it isn't the very best it could be. 
---
Pretty sure it resets the count so to speak if you miss or hit another enemy. I use an anti armor handmade primarily and when they are close and I‚Äôm not going to miss I switch to the furious 10mm SMG. 
---
It's an old 2e mechanic, like THAC0.
---
This is where playing with a team has great advantage... or making friends on your server... you can rejoin and continue playing with your team or join any of your friends who were on same server as you... also makes server hopping easy to just run through your unrelated friend groups
---
I felt that way this morning. Had an hour to myself, jumped on, been playing since beta...but there were no events. No quests. I need to expand my friends list, it might be time or team up and stop so much Lone Wandering
---
Definite "regular". Because it's definitely better than a non-legendary regardless lol
---
Knowing how to paint one specific set of a Power Armor with one specific style seems silly to me.
---
What is the specific lore reason for the Quantum Paint being specific to X-01 in West Virginia anyways?
---
Nope.  Medic pump power armor mods keep hitting you with stimpaks as long as you have them. I know because I cleaned out west tek today wearing my medic pump T51b armor.  I never once hit myself with a stimpak and stayed alive the whole time and had fewer stims when it was over. 
---
Explain. 
---
....mate do you not know what assassin Cav is? I don‚Äôt take damage when sprinting, like any at all 2. I‚Äôve checked with my other actual specialist in first/rifles (also the only way you get a true working hybrid is with fist otherwise your out of points since fist only needs 3 points (9 with insofar and martial artist to be good))
---
A time to perform beyond one's limits!
---
Idk check fo4 lore you can try and find it but their is a specific reason nuka cola skins are unique. That‚Äôs also why people knew quantum was coming since t51 nuka cola was in the game and quantum was the xo1 version of it 
---
I got this too. It sounds to me like he is just extremely passive agressive and tries to put on a smile to deal with people.
---
it doesn‚Äôt have a suppressor, sadly. 
---
Hahaha okay buddy.  Whatever you say!  
---
Xb1?
---
Thats actually pretty funny
---
Everyone is dead in Fallout 76, so the only thing left is pimping out mr handies to mt gutsies.
---
On a serious note - Fallouts 1, 2, 3 - all had a lot of adult content, Fallout 4 -much less. Fallout 76 - barely anything. Drugs and booze - yep, but the rest if fairly tame.
---
Its math man. There is no gray area its literally black and white. Dmg stacks, sacrificing a few perk points will cut your dmg or defences in half. If your willing to have either half the defences or dmg of other players that's your choice. But I can't in good conscience recommend that to anyone asking for help.
---
Fair enough, but what about the second guy?
---
If you‚Äôre asking what I play on, it‚Äôs PS4. Don‚Äôt understand why that is relevant. 
---
Have you read sentinals description? Is doesn't restore health kiddo.
---
Bloodied and furious (some cases anti armor)  can do twice+ the damage of two shot.  Two shot doesn't add an area affect unless your counting missing the primary target as an aoe.
---
Because I have a 10mm submachine gun plan so you could make your own. But you're on a different console 
---
Then it‚Äôs just a loot drop then?
---
Nope they are shaped better for the bum they are suppositories
---
Ah, okay. I think I have the plan but I want to avoid wasting my resources to make some, scrap them, only to find out that it has like two mods or something. 
---
Compared to what is now, yes.
---
No suppressor mod for it unfortunately. 
---
I lacks a suppressor and has only iron sights. But beyond that it has all the normal rifle mods (stabilized, aligned, true) for barrel and stock, as well as most of the normal magazine mods (if not all).
---
It's a decent little Auto-Rifle, especially because even at its heaviest mods it's like 6.6 lbs or so, and can easily be even lighter üëç
---
Not sure where you could farm them other than buying the Plans and crafting/scrapping them for the mods
---
Does it have any other mods? 
---
I do I have a full set of assassins sent, 3 of the peices are powered. The difference is you will take double dmg I will on crits because even if you have a dense chest, you left no points for fire proof. 
---
People on trade subs and the trading discords sell completed stable flux for less than you‚Äôre selling each component. If I can buy stable flux for 40 on average (except violet which is more expensive due to rarity) why would I spend s total of 125 for the three non-spoilable components?
---
Love the concept you brought to the table. I always tried to hide behind my brick wall.
---
Thank you! I think you‚Äôre the first person to fully answer my query, instead of just saying there‚Äôs no suppressor mod. 
---
Np üëç I hate when people give vague or half-done answers lol
---
Mine too. Can't figure out why. Tried all the settings on Xbox and my TV. Nothing worked. 
---
Who cares for fire proof, I‚Äôm a Cav so unlike you I‚Äôm a much harder to hit target and if your using a explosive weapon I‚Äôm in your face and your either going to die in 2 taps to my AA DCG or even better help me kill you with your xplosive damage, and yes I‚Äôm aware that a AA vats vats build would tear me up, but let‚Äôs be honest, it‚Äôd tear up all my sent assasin (including the op af staggering AA vats vats automatic handmade build) characters aswell 
---
I just went to one today that I haven't been to in three days. It was totally empty
---
I live in Hurricane, this is a cool AF house.
---
If there is anyway something can be used to give someone an advantage that is for sale, it is p2w.
---
Walking into the wasteland with a fresh pair of Jordan‚Äôs 
---
Have they commented officially on this? 
---
Yep, throw a grenade and cause the corpses to havok and clip through the collisions; OP is going to be very very popular once those 3* star carcaases start dissappearing before people have a chance to loot them.
---
Yea
---
If you really want one you should buy a legendary from someone. But for unlocking mods, definitely get the plans to make em for scrapping, because they're not very common spawns on enemies (try scorched though if you're desperate)
---
Yeah they should sell decks slots in the ATOM shop instead of the repair kits. It's not P2W and they will finally end up by selling something.
---
Yeah, I appreciate that they gave some effort but it wasn‚Äôt what I was asking lol
---
I have a vampires and a tse both with supressors aligned grip and hardened receiver pair this with ground pounder commando and it's going to shred shit... Oh I also have tank killer and tormentor
---
Also please take into consideration, because I‚Äôm a cavalier build my agility is 14, their is no reason other then for the AP that my agility is that high, if I wasn‚Äôt a Cav build I‚Äôd have 7 apednurance for adamantium skeleton and fireproof and radicool
---
They need to understand other games and borrow ideas from them. Learn from others to make yourself better. I have high hopes for survival mode.
---
I don't like the idea of players taking from my stash box. That's a big no go in my opinion.
---
When will this be coming into effect
---
I couldn't see the video for some reason, but I know exactly what you are talking about because I have seen it. I've heard varying reports about why it happens.  I've heard everything from "it's a glitch" and I've heard that it's intentional it's how Bethesda balanced things for whatever reasons. For the records   I was only pointing out that auto stim exists for power armor.   But I am not 100 percent sure that a power armor medic pump would do what you saw happening.  I'm not entirely sure what is going on.   Only Bethesda knows for sure (and even that's questionable). 
---
The average play session is 4 hours so at that rate it'd take 5 years and almost 3 months to play 7600 hours. If all you did all day was play 76 every waking hour of every day, allowing for 8 hours of rest a day it'd take you almost 16 months to earn that achievement. And I don't know how you got over years. By my math if you treated 76 like a full-time job (working 40 hours a week with one two-week vacation and no sick days) it'd take you 190 40 hour work weeks or about 3 years and 10 months -- not 4 years+.
---
There s receivers, stocks, magazines, barrels and pretty sure muzzle attachments, many of each type for it
---
I can upgrade your BOS u derarmor if you like 
---
... suppressors? You sure, because it doesn't have a muzzle slot haha
---
I was thinking about it, what would be a decent price for something with a good legendary or two on it? 
---
No barrel or scope mods but you don‚Äôt really need them. With the right mods the iron sights and hip fire do some work close range. I‚Äôd suggest a short barrel of some kind and all the recoil reduction you can get. A long barrel increases the range but really messes with the recoil and this gun isn‚Äôt meant for range. 
---
Ok thanks 
---
I think they won't be able to after the next update
---
Yeah, most automatic weapons aren‚Äôt. Thanks for the tips. 
---
Very cool!
---
Also as I stated, hybrid can only work if the melee is fist otherwise you‚Äôd need another 6 points to squeeze out max damage 
---
Thanks. There is a little more that wasnt on video but I only had 30 seconds to show off the coolest part.
---
I have a frame counter on screen at all times, so it'll go from 60 frames, to 1 frame, and then crash.
---
Resets every 20hrs. If it's empty another player has got it first. Jump servers until you find a full one. 
---
When making them, put on super duper and scrapper, if you go the making route
---
Thanks!
---
My opinion that Fo76 is heaps more kid friendly than previous games. Fo 1,2,3 - all had slavery, sex, murder, even child murder. Fo 4 had much less of that. I don't recall anything like that in 76, also, with no NPC you're pretty much killing just some weird creatures.
---
But yes, monitoring and common sense is the key.
---
Any kid (or an adult for that matter) is much better off playing Fallout than watching news.
---
I'd prefer it if each paintjob gave us certain perks, just like FO4. Raider paintjob score discounts at raider  vendors. BoS gets special treatment at Phoenix's shop. And a random faction gets bonus goods each day with the random vendor bot. Oh, responders get 2 for 1 deals on health.
---
Such a great idea I‚Äôm thinking a lot like how the games work In Read dead.  Would also be cool if they let people bet caps
---
Well if you're just going for a 1‚≠ê to get you started, it could be anywhere from a couple hundred caps up to like 500.
---
If you're going for a 2-3‚≠ê it totally depends what it has ü§∑ anywhere from 500 to 5K or even higher if it's like a perfect roll.
---
Anti-Armor, Furious, Bloodied, TwoShot, and Explosive are gonna put you on the higher end of the price range, but they're also probably worth it lol.
---
Usually you can get a TS or Furious for reasonable prices. I suggest them as a good starter, although if you can find an Anti-Armor I highly recommend it üëç
---
Thats how they are working for me. So far I‚Äôm able to collect once a week. Seems a bit of a long time
---
The one I‚Äôve had the most success with is the handmade. I‚Äôm a commando build and have it modded for full auto. With the right mods there really isn‚Äôt much recoil. 
---
More quests would be nice. Outside the ones we can do each day. Something to do besides wandering aimlessly. Actual events maybe. Perhaps a world boss or something. Youre all obvious experts on the matter so why not come up with something. I feel like im playing Rust all by myself lol.
---
there is not nearly enough content to bring up the idea's of  sub's or member plus. Dis boy  is highly irradiated. 
---
Yeah, I thought that was pretty funny, myself. I was like WTF. But at least it makes a handy hours played counter. 
---
He's ready to deploy that sucker in the middle of an SBQ fight. Don't be surprised if it disappears into thin air.
---
Yeah man, good luck :)
---
Yep, the COBJ record - basically the record that states what workbench an item is crafted on, how many of what one needs to craft it etc etc - has no data on the field where what is actually 'created' is stated so even if somehow one managed to get or unlock the plan, which is also as far as I can see not possible, still would not 'work'.
---
Nobody is stopping you from playing!  You just need to make the game.
---
"Let us" isn't the problem, you are asking them to put a ton of work into inventing a real, playable, balanced board game for no money.  It's not a small ask.
---
Yes yes a thousand times yes 
---
Actually troll i wasnt expecting someone to say no. Maybe add something valuable to the discussion next time. Lol.
---
That's true, I was just pointing out that's it's not such a common occurrence.
---
You're bad at math then. Because it won't cut  your damage or defense in half. And you are completely ignoring gameplay context. First off say you have 100 damage and 60% damage bonus, 15% bloody mess, 20% nerd rage. You would deal 220.8(100√ó1.6√ó1.15√ó1.2) say you dropped it to 45% you deal 200.1(100√ó1.45√ó1.15√ó1.2) roughly 90% of the damage you would deal elsewise. And you can pick up 30% extra damage in melee.  Now lets take a break and look at different hp enemies if an enemy has between 225-400hp both builds take two shots to kill it. You'll hit specific break points where the pure build may 2 hit instead of 3 hit but as enemy hp gets higher and higher and the hit count increases that becomes less relavent. You also won't half ypur defense since you can easily afford similar levels of defense, armor has plenty of inate defense and many mutations give a ton of defense. 
---
You are just exaggerating to try and serve your point but it just makes you look foolish. Yes the pure build will be better, but it won't be so much better that a hybrid build wouldn't be able to compete on a realistic and functional level. PvE especially, and for PvP the extra damage isn't gonna give you a big edge, success depends more on equipment and tactics not an extra 20% damage. 
---
Huh, maybe I made something else for the daily and got the Ant beer as a reward? 
---
Not a problem at all. 
---
That‚Äôs been my experience, but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the most common experience.
---
Lighting is cool man! Is that a cave? I really want to make a cave/bunker camp. 
---
Yea that second one is kinda hard to debate, I‚Äôd guess it‚Äôs their code trying to give everyone a more ‚Äúlevel‚Äù play field and the major difference in levels.  It‚Äôs a beta... but file a bug ;) 
---
The first one could be some good luck and netcode issues, if he is hitting a stun at the right time, your client might say he‚Äôs dead when he isn‚Äôt.   Or it‚Äôs the bug from the second one ;) 
---
And jet. Dont forget the jet
---
Yeah, the whoever nuked msg only come up once. If we miss it, it's gone. I agree it would be nice to see who nuked it.
---
I ran through with two dudes once that definitely knew what they were doing. I couldn't keep up. Less than 20min they were launching. Crazy. 
---
None of you will respond to the repair kits but you have time for this.
---
not so much as set abilities with the armor but more or less, multiple mods and built in weapons/tools that would‚Äôve been used for drilling and mining 
---
They sold the game as no human npcs as well.
---
It is a cave. And the cave is so big I know a few people who have their bases built along it. They have a 4 man little city of camps in there but non are built in the part I am because it doesn't look like it has much promise at first glance. 
---
What system are you playing on? I'm on XBox and not a single time I had that issue.
---
Heck, I even claimed workshops in Survival hoping to have a nice shootout. Nothing, no one could be bothered.
---
I want a suppressor too üòï
---
ESO, another Bethesda game already literally does this. So I could see this happening very easily.
---
Try under the Cranberry Bog Main Highway. Pretty vast tunnel with a few open spaces.
---
Is the officer identical also?
---
Mind if I ask where it is?
---
Make sure to store it when not in use, as it'd be a bitch to repair if it was destroyed.
---
New drinks sometimes needs them as well!
---
Mine specifically or the cave its self.
---
The cave 
---
I'm holding onto mine. I think its neat as hell. Especially in survivor mode because you don't need stimpacks at all and neither do your teammates. Wish the rest of my team would have finished the challenge though cuz we would be unstoppable. 
---
I‚Äôll check it out. Thanks bud!
---
If you want to be evil, stand outside the vault with your bloatfly swarm and wait for a dweller to emerge.
---
What the hell do you mean by iron price? XD
---
Behold, vault dweller! I am the lord of flies!
---
It comes in black, but otherwise I believe so, yes.
---
I always assumed it was a typo and the next milestone after 76 hours was supposed to be 760. But months later, nope straight from 76 to 7600 so apparently it was intentional. After coming to terms with the intentional 7600 hours I then became sour about how shitty of a reward they give for literally giving a year of your time to them. Should've been no less than 500 atoms.
---
It was in NV, so hopefully we'll see it along with other weapons like the R-91 implemented.
---
Queen dropped me a bloodied +power +1S deathclaw gauntlet recently, but I'm not sure if I'll ever use it.
---
I've had several one-star weapon drops that I still use. Instigating and anti-armor lever rifles, quad double barrel shotguns.
---
According to some dude that 1 tapped me in power armor yes
---
Repeatable can be done as many times as you like Ex: Forbidden Knowledge - just drop those technical datas in one at a time, and you can do it as often as you please.
---
Daily can only be done once in a 24 hour period.
---
K. Had to put my kid to bed. I‚Äôll be back on in a bit. I have 2 keycards I think
---
You do a daily once every 24 hours. Repeatable events can be done as you please. 
---
Depends on which weapon you have the mods for TBH. Pick the one you can put a hardend receiver on and start from there. I got a handmade early on but couldn't modify it so it just sucked. The lever was more plentiful to scrap and mods came faster. The 45 ammo was plentiful as well. 
---
Are you trolling me? You can't be serious, yes you have limited amount of points it really is that simple. You have to give something up when you waste points it either costs defence or offence the way the point cards are balance your either giving up 50% dmg or defence. There us no argument to be had.
---
So the Biv events can be done over and over?
---
I‚Äôve never thought of this but now that you‚Äôve pointed it out I will never be happy until I can customise my shoes in game haha
---
I think pushing back new content so it's actually finished when it's released will create enough goodwill
---
Looks like you paid the gold price
---
I've killed a few 3* every day for weeks and have received 0 3* drops. Fantastic
---
I'm getting really sick of you assholes posting pictures of my mom with these stupid fucking captions!
---
What? I am confusia
---
I remember when destiny was being promoted as a 10 year game along the lines of a KOTOR but was extremely disappointed when the sequel was announced I never gave it a shot. I heard some of the newer DLC have been good but since a destiny 3 is probably coming I don‚Äôt see a reason in picking it up 
---
Trust me, I don‚Äôt either! I‚Äôm new to video gaming and not very good at remembering how to navigate anything. üòù
---
Dunno where I got them but I sold them to a train station today. 
---
I just want to see milk vending machines not always empty of any usable milk itself.
---
Back with another question!
---
Teammate modded my PA for me but I wanted to add Atomic Shop paint to it. Says it will scrap the current mod. 
---
Any way around this?
---
Man I hate the loss of food and water on disconnects, it's like salt in the wound. 
---
You can add me if you're still looking for people. I'm MrsP123, currently level 60ish on PS4 &amp; 7ish on Xbox. 
---
Actually consoles and tv's use quite a lot of power, even just leaving them on for a single day, let alone over such a long period of time.
---
PS4 actually. I‚Äôm just bad at it! Also, I‚Äôm a sheüòâ
---
Reminds me of Old Longfellow's outfit.
---
Who's paying you to post, OP?
---
Your confusion in somebody‚Äôs down vote meant I had to delete my clever posts.
---
It went over your head from the beginning. Why did you post?
---
This seems like a simple fix they could implement.  I have the same problem, and it's more than a bit annoying.  In my case, I have a 39 in. TV that seems to display the game as 40.  Most games have an option to adjust, but for whatever reason FO76 lacks it.  No settings on my xbox or tv(which is older and very limited with options) seem to solve it.
---
*Sees result of this thread*
---
"I am so proud of this community."
---
Go look at OP's post history, this thread is fishy
---
Wait.. What???
---
Perk cards aren't the only way to get defense of damage. You're literally ignoring other aspects of the game. Only a handful of Perk cards even boost damage directly. Not ever perk card is equal. 
---
You're just bad at math if you think swapping out 6-9 cards is gonna cut your damage and defense by 50%. Because that just shows you are unfamiliar with the game and its system. For instance 50 Dr/ER doesn't give you hardly any extra durability when you akready have 300 of each. It might equal 2-4% damage reduction.  
---
I'm done, not gonna argue with someone who is ignorant to how the game works. 
---
I really don't want the world to be flooded with NPCs. I like it the way it is. 
---
Humans = players.
---
This whole thread is fishy, topic post kinda reads like a "social media influence" post and his only history is shilling
---
Agree with most of the above. Just wanted to chip in that it's super cheap on CDkeys. Around $20 depending on system. 
---
Nah there are prob drugs hiding in there. This Is why u can "consume" it xd
---
Instigating. Combine it with a sneak critical for a powerful first shot.
---
I about to get off I'll be on tomorrow after school
---
Man when the game came out I was so confused about where all the random stew was coming from but it was nice lol. 
---
I am not talking about garbage cards. I am talking about a planned balanced max dps/ defence build. Cutting 6 to 9 points will most certainly cut either your possible dps or defences in half. It ok when you figure it out, remember you heard it here fist.
---
The Biv quest seems to be on either a personal reset timer of no less than 20 hours, or resets at 11 PM EST. Why would they call it a repeatable then if it is more of a daily quest?
---
if i understand right most of the cryptids we have either are FEV mutations from something that existed beforehand or where a creature that mutated from the radiation i suspect mothman and the sheepsquatch to be a case of the latter 
---
Everyone pvp‚Äôs each other? News to me
---
Can't say for sure. but I know that stabilized perk combined with heavy weapons/ anti armor perk shreds people in PVP pretty easily.   Stabilized is basically tank killer for heavy weapons.   Everyone talks about how bad power armor is in PVP, but in my experience, no armor in the game has been able to withstand my anti-armor weapons combined with anti-armor perks, power armor or no power armor. 
---
People will buy it. The lazy gamers that don't care about what's fair. The same lazy gamers that duped TSE weapons to make their lives easier. That's the problem.
---
And you're right. The repair kits aren't bad. I'm all for them being in the game as long as they're NOT in the atom shop.
---
When you're in a team or group if one person engages it counts as a return slap (equalling full dam) for the entire team 
---
(Correct me if I am wrong)
---
Well, that's the shit of nightmares.. Thanks. 
---
I wonder if I can take one to guard my stash box?
---
I just want to know what happens if you are max caps and someone buys something.
---
Totally understood. Send me a message when your shops up and running, I look forward to seeing it! 
---
What they said... there was also the oblivion ‚Äúhack‚Äù of just blocking in a corner against rats in the intro. With a lowered difficulty setting you could hunker down, block, use the heal spell every few seconds in a rhythm and level up  light armor, heavy armor, block, restoration, and so on to 99 before even leaving the prison....  of course oblivion was an amazing game that punished you for power leveling .... god I want 6 to somehow end up better than 3 and 4
---
Also,  I occasionally drop things that I don't use in boxes,  he might have found it and unable to user it.
---
I guess we'll have to see what the community puts up with. If we're lucky. We'll shut that shit down like Battlefront 2s community did. 
---
Game of thrones reference? Farm it yourself verses buy it?
---
Make it a Responder item. That seems up their alley.
---
I‚Äôd recommend a bloodied explosive, my be lever takes a lvl 80 down in less than 20 seconds, the damage per second is what you want to balance out say you can do 2000 damage on two shots but it takes 4 seconds to reload I fire off five rounds in less time at 550 per shot
---
Yeah why he Join a team with a trade partner 
---
What's you mean? I maid this account jus for this fallout76. It my first reddit account I'm on here and elite dangerous sub. 
---
This is exactly what I was wondering. 
---
There is a lake that is just northwest of the butterfly on the map in toxic valley that has an alien blaster and a rusted key. That rusted key opens dome 2 and the upstairs portion of Freddy‚Äôs house of scares, I go for that every time I start a new character bc it‚Äôs easiest for me to find. 
---
It‚Äôs under the road that goes down that whole side of the map from the mire to the cranberry bog, it stars a little south of the abandoned bog town, there is a junk node on the side of the road and when I found it a radio playing.   It then goes the entire length of the road, under the road, until just before the entrance to watoga.  There are entrances all along on the sides, but that are obviously hidden.   
---
It‚Äôs a very cool area! 
---
Hoping that the obvious deathclaw reskin is just because of it being leaked textures pasted on a deathclaw... Fallout 76 really needs some fresh new content that can‚Äôt be bashed as a rehash/reskin of fallout 4 items...
---
Possibly was trading with someone he met somewhere other than in game and found it easiest to get him to join his squad to join the same server and be able to fast travel to his camp
---
A whole flag pack would be pretty cool tbh
---
It doesn't spawn at a location, like the two other keys you have to go to several locations to obtain it... try youtube, there's a walkthrough on how to get it...
---
I got a medic pistol 10mm and medic pistol pipe. Can't really tell which uses more vats or not. But havent had a proc on the heal crit. Does it actually work? Is there a visual? Audio? I even checked my hp before and after. ü§∑
---
Verify your game files in the launcher, try lower graphic details.
---
If they added it back they could add a message: ‚Äúso and so fed the people enjoy some stew‚Äù 
---
Ok cool. I‚Äôll add you 
---
I thought pvp didn‚Äôt active till lvl5.
---
I'm trying that now
---
Very nice. It‚Äôs just pretty dark. If you have enough caps maybe get the neon letter and put them outside. 
---
If you read what he said this scenario doesn‚Äôt make sense. Some random tried to trade with him. Didn‚Äôt say they joined up. 
---
You can definitely get 3 stars on low level items. The easiest way to obtain them right now is playing any other horde event in the low level areas. I have a bunch of these type of items already. Iirc I even have a lvl 1 legendary with 3 effects stashed away somewhere.
---
Oh yeah,  the Last Bastion...  I had forgot about that.  More like the last Legendary piece you'll ever see üòÜ
---
This was a blast!!! It was late here so I couldn‚Äôt get f#!kin‚Äô loud and didn‚Äôt want to wake anyone up. Could the fights be hosted at a selected players camp and have different unique local each time, but host can‚Äôt fight?
---
This happened to me yesterday, it fills it up and the rest of the caps disappear 
---
I find it helps if im one of the first ones there. Hope this helps you too. 
---
Its active right off the bat in survival.
---
Armor penetration has multiplicative stacking, so Tank Killer 3 + AA is a 68% DR reduction rather than 86%. It's not usually diminishing returns though, because the damage calc uses the ratio of damage to resistance. The exception is when the ratio is so high that you're already dealing the full damage.
---
Maybe just a squad to fast travel back to his camp so he can grab other items, idk man
---
Looks like the Deathclaws big brother.
---
Do you realize what you said here though? In a pay to win system someone with more money and skill will always win. Someone with no money and alot if skill may lose specifically due to some guns.  It would be just like the battlefield problem a couple years back.
---
Yes but with player vending if someone buys from our vending machine...I really hope we dont just give things away without making caps. üò±üò±
---
every few minutes ive seen someone die sometimes more often if theres a gang of murder hobos
---
&gt;Is doesn't restore health kiddo.
---
Doesn't say that in the description but my friend has full set and we tested it against my anti-armor gatling gun.  It went down and kept shooting back up and I don't think he was hitting stimpacks. After shooting at him for quite a wile and stopping, his health was no longer going back up but was sitting around 50 percent.  It was very odd.  
---
Thanks! Hmm. Not sure what to say, but that's a good idea. I do agree it is pretty dark. I'll get the antique lights plan from Whitespring at some point, use candles to light the place up a bit. Maybe add a balcony on the second floor, sticking out over the front door for a 'porch light'. 
---
Someone milk me. 
---
I wear a full set of Sentinal assassin combat armor and my health is never restored by its self.
---
I tried to use medic pump in pvp but it just ain't worth it. PA is pretty squishy atm and even with medic punp, you just die when you take some good hits. From my experience, it ain't that the damage you take overwhelm the healing done, It just doesn't proc in pvp situation. I should know if it worked cause I tested it with first aid rank 3 and field surgeon. It works fine in pve, but I don't think it works in pvp. Some confirmation is needed since I only tried it out for like 30 minutes.
---
I don't think his was either but it looked like it was until  I stopped shooting. Something seemed off about it.
---
Most companies consider 1840 hours a year as ‚Äúfull time‚Äù which allows for roughly 2 weeks of paid holidays and four weeks paid or unpaid vacation/sick days. 
---
Some consider 2,000.  Just depends on the industry. 
---
‚ÄúFull time‚Äù of course is debatable. 
---
The lvl 4 guy couldn't have been using Sentinal anyway or the guy in PA
---
I religiously make the rounds daily and only occasionally do I get an empty vendor cap stash. I just hop servers and it usually refreshes.  
---
What you might need to be aware of is that vendors faction share stashes.  There are only 7 total vendors you can hit in one day.   For example, Sutton and Pleasant Valet stations cash stagers are shared if you collect all the caps at one, the other will show 0.   
---
Here a good map I used for a while before I just memorized it.  
---
https://imgur.com/a/4dkZlGp
---
Its  not as buggy as the lunch but still there is some annoying bugs here and there , the game worth it when you buy it in such a high discount 
---
That is awesome!! Very clever use of the cave system, and I laughed when I saw the neon question mark on the fermenter. I like the little instrument corner behind the area, and the place is wonderfully lit. Great job! 
---
Yeah I don't think what OP saw was from a medic pump.  I was just correcting him because he said there was no auto stim for power armor. 
---
Duel wield pistols or knifes would be interesting..
---
Yep just got one the other day, and I think possibly one other since the new paints were added.
---
That's how you spawn sheepsquatch. 
---
They aren‚Äôt that bright? They want to test what happens? Who knows?
---
I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm gonna be wooshed or not here....
---
My server always nukes bottom right ü§î
---
I think he means the cap stashes, as in the world object which has caps inside, not the vendor pool for caps. 
---
That‚Äôs because of the fissure sights , which spawn a 3* scorched beast queen 
---
Now mystery solved, thank you OP 
---
Xbox top of the roller coaster in backpack near front car...
---
Nah, if you want stew go do the damn quest 
---
I think there was a bug that always showed that area to be nuked instead of where it was. I noticed it after the wild Appalachia dlc dropped.
---
Although, there is also lots of flora nodes.
---
Thanks a million. Spent hours on little details.
---
Haha, no problem 
---
Adamantium skeleton stops your limbs from being crippled, it doesn‚Äôt prevent damage.
---
I think it depends on where it is. I went to the Whitespring and found a capstach full, but went to one near the responders airport and it had completely disappeared. 
---
Alright, it might just be a bug since I‚Äôve only seen people nuke there since the update 
---
So I have to milk my friends. Okay, got it.
---
Your welcome! Creative CAMPS are always good to see!
---
Well, at least it doesn't have wings, that's a good thing right? Lets hope it doesn't burrow, either.
---
All the things you list provide significant advantages over other players. In a game so reliant on inventory management, this is literally pay to win. 
---
They need to reduce the number of free atoms the game pours on players, then introduce more variety and more desirable cosmetics. That, along with new content to attract new buyers will generate significant revenue. There‚Äôs no need to create two classes of players.
---
It being invincible is huge plus as well.
---
Personally no, not for me particularly but you know about the recent situation last week of the topic spams constantly about say otherwise.
---
Better post on Reddit!
---
[You are in luck.](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/baplel/datamine_atom_shop_excavator_skins/) A Fire Breather skins was added to the Atom Shop textures on the last update.
---
If something of this scale had happened recently, I feel people would have talked about it. I check this sub each day, and never saw anything about it. Did you only lose caps, or did you lose everything on your character?
---
I failed more times than I‚Äôll admit üòÇ. When I successfully launched my first. I took about 30 stims (mostly diluted), 20 pure waters, and some mutt chops. Used most all of it it. Had to go back to stash before I went to the nuke site. 
---
That's what I'm hoping and why there are a lot of people trying to make their opinions known. If we're quiet about it, nothing will change.
---
It does
---
&gt;4 leaked power armor skins
---
Are you talking about the [Rider sets](https://imgur.com/a/iiCn6Nt) or something else?
---
Odds are they just disappear, based on how they handle the current system with players. Sold enough items for 200caps recently and forgot had hit the max lol.
---
There is a subreddit dedicated to builds.
---
I‚Äôve never seen an actual nuke there. I only see it on the map if I‚Äôm first loading in, before everything has loaded‚Äîor right when a nuke is announced. Then it ends up in the correct spot. 
---
I think that‚Äôs just how the game renders it on the map until all the data is loaded. 
---
ban liberals from fallout 76
---
Yeah see that's why I thought I'd ask and see if there was an option I just wasn't seeing lol.
---
Tin man! Lol
---
Are we in Kansas?
---
I only saw one for fallout 4 and I just thought I'd ask people in a general fo76 subreddit. Otherwise I only saw settlement subreddits really. 
---
That's patently false. They bleep out the fun bits of things like "I'm going to rape your mother" on TV. 
---
Ohhhhhh... nooooo...
---
Well this would extremely suck for our vending machine. üò≠üò≠
---
Nah, I‚Äôm saying I‚Äôve never has that issue.
---
Yes and I would love to have actual numbers for AP drain/refresh as well.
---
So this guy hacks into your system, has access to all your internet histories and all he does is take caps? Fallout 76 caps?
---
37k?

Hmm. I found my dome key 2 in the soot section of the map at a mine.

Cybermen!

I'm on XBOX. I have that same furious. I traded a furious .50 for it. I've had a TSE handmade for a while. I just don't know which is better. I just recently started building my commando perk cards.
---
Should be the next update.
---
Ya know, it really does.
---
Sheeptych?
---
Tripsquatch?
---
Gotcha. 
---
I figured someone who hadn't done the quest might want a set. 
---
Ahhh makes sense thank ya for the insight :D

still no end game content, still tons of bugs, dupers and other annoying gamebreaking things.

I kinda assumed that it would be similar to this. I just thought if the Gatorclaws from FO4. When looking at the original trailer, it was much taller than the player as seen by the snout being angles down and still being above the player head. Honestly really excited for this. I hope it‚Äôs very tough to kill, as deathclaws are pretty weak 
---
Ooh like 1st person fallout shelter?
---
He annoys me to. I guess I didnt verify he was dead. Now I kinda miss him
---
Yeah. I get it. You like being able to be a jackass if you want to to anyone. 
---
I still say you'd still be whining if it had been some teens and the level 200 had been their dad or big brother, because your lack of character is prettty obvious. 
---
A normal person would just shrug it off and go RP somewhere else. Clearly you've got some issues to work out. 
---
There are a lot of opinions on this, the fact is that it didn't in fo4 (confirmed by bth, but I'd have to search for source, been a while) and there's nothing saying it's changed that I've found. Though your light does. The explanation is that it's wired into your mind, just as the vats system affects your aiming abilities, etc.
---
Example. If your teammate has their light on, you see it. If they have their music on, you don't hear it. Same with enemies.
---
The game is fun and keeps getting better.
---
XP weekend. Now that it's over it will be back to asshole land. People will only willfully work together when there is incentive to do so. 
---
Its a placeholder for the nuke zone while the game is still loading, similar to how players loading in are always shown just above the mountains north of whitesprings 
---
If you wait long enough itll move to where it belongs on your map
---
Link doesnt work?
---
No different on Xbox, I've given up trying to worry about it tbh
---
If you haven't done the quest to receive the perfect storm it's a unique 10mm SMG that'll be max level if you're over lv 50
---
Pry my forest river base out of my cold, dead hands!
---
Caps hard to come by..... only makes having a bank more desired. Saving caps by not having them on you all the time and in a safe storage. Less tempted to spend them on something you don‚Äôt need and the likes. 
---
Mine too. 
---
How was I being a jackass? Is it being a jackass to tell these kids that they need to lock the top door to further prevent ppl from getting in? I've crossed multiple kids in this game that weren't cry babies.
---
And you're probably right about the teen thing.  If the low levels would have been teenagers and they told their "daddy" that people are running around outside their camp and they were "scared" and that I should leave then they have the issues.
---
Like what do you think these kids do in the game all day? Build a camp and try to go around pacifying all the little kitties around the Wasteland for fun? Gimme a break. If these kids were scared of me and my buddies sitting near their Camp doing absolutely nothing then they need to be playing something else.
---
I met a home schooled student on GTAO. Let that sink in. 
---
Seriously? [What is that sink doing here this time?](https://i.imgur.com/MDhbuT6.jpg)
---
Let me poop and wire things. 
---
It doesn‚Äôt I have mine blasting the classical radio and I can sneak kill just fine. 
---
My camp is there. It‚Äôs just haters.
---
Agreed, hoping I'm wrong though espically if they have something like a bank for all your caps in it so its somewhere safe from the ravages of pvp.
---
I came across a home schooled student on GTAO. Let that sink in. 
---
Anyone else getting War Machine vibes from that silver paint?
---
Again? [The hell is he doing here now?](https://i.imgur.com/MDhbuT6.jpg)
---
I made a post making the same point, but I got downvoted unfortunatly. I totally agree; just 20 Atoms?! They should give you 7600 Atoms.
---
There, there. I'm still recovering from the two "level up 3 times" dailies this week. x\_x
---
better at vendor than in the atom shop LOL
---
Creepy. Damn cool design, though. 
---
Don't feel like you gotta just run rifleman, expert, and master. Look closely at your perks, tank killer can be comparable, if not better than ur master rifleman card. That said, I don't use less than 9 perk points in perception, I could put 3 more, but I'm not exclusively rifle for the moment, 
---
Also, take the time to find a good rifle thru a person, here or anyone that you trust instead of hoping to find something good in game. At least after you hit 50, that is.
---
Rifle works nice with a bloodied build, I'd recommend looking into that as well.
---
Enjoy!
---
I lost some pieces of armor, but Ive heard of people losing characters entirely.
---
Sweet bro I‚Äôll check it out. What kind of stuff do you get attacked by under there? I swear where I‚Äôm at in the mire all that attacks my camp is high level crickets that like to destroy my corn. They aren‚Äôt even deterred by my laser turrets!
---
caps and a few armor pieces, it has some posts around but it got removed, because I guess posting about it since it was such an obvious exploit basically was encouraging more to try it as far as i know still not fixed so thats probaly why.
---
Lady Macbeth:

---
To catch the nearest way.
---
I literally asked for the downvotes, I have more than enough karma to spare.
---
Anyway, aside from your childish and misguided 'suck it up', I LOVE fallout games, I can easily prove that if that's even necessary.
---
That being said at some point even if you, personally, enjoy the game you can not deny that it's been a dumpster fire, can you?
---
All events should have some sort of benefit for the players on the server. Give every event a purpose other than just "Here's a legendary item that's *probably* underlevelled for you because rewards don't scale."
---
Hmm. Maybe it‚Äôs cause I uploaded from mobile. And am on mobile
---
I just want to buy one. Too much work for it.
---
Unless I‚Äôm missing something I‚Äôve noticed it‚Äôs like this when trading with other players too which stinks so I always have to hop to my inventory after to inspect it and make sure I got the right item. 
---
Medic heals every time you use a VATS crit, I use a Medic Radium Rifle and it heals pretty well actually.
---
That last one is gold! 
---
It used to only be an issue that occurred with vendors but a couple patches ago it spread to player trading as well which is arguably more frustrating because of the implications when trading for a high priced item. Most people are trustworthy but I‚Äôve definitely had instances where the secondary and tertiary effects weren‚Äôt what was claimed. 
---
I don‚Äôt think you need a brewer for that.
---
Oh yeah I was pretty worried the other day when I was paying 10k for a gun and couldn‚Äôt inspect it. Luckily it all worked out!
---
Thank you very much. I'll definitely look into the bloodied builds. 
---
Yeah, had to save the best for last.
---
That... doesn't happen in COD
---
Since nobody here has given you the correct answer, I'll give it to you. There is this thing called "Flux" and it is required in making and repairing a lot of high level items and recipes. You get flux by harvesting radiated plants, IE all regular plants, corn, mutfruit, etc, become different types of flux, Cobalt Flux, yellowcake flux, etc. There is several farms in the upper left hand corner, and nuking farms is the best way to easily get lots of flux, as the entire farms will have each and every type ready to be picked in rows after the nuke hits.  TLDR: They do it to farm high level plants
---
I saw it Harpers ferry earlier but I would say buy it from a player and save yourself a bunch of caps bud. You can probably get it for a couple thousand instead of the 10k or whatever it is at the vendor. 
---
I recently asked for advice on a bloodied sniper build - there's a lot of good tips from people if you look at the most recent post on my profile! Definitely helped me in figuring out what my build was gonna look like
---
Neither are terribly legendary, and both are holdovers from FO4 :(
---
A GOD DAMN SHEEPTAUR.   IT SPAT ACID. CRAWLED ON WALLS.  ZAPPED PEOPLE WITH LIGHTNING
---
inb4 its going to be using the deathclaw animations, calling it NOW.
---
Wait r they in the game?
---
Yeah havent notice amy difference in sneak with or wothout radio
---
I would do the event a lot more if everyone got the stew.
---
I farmed it for literal days, eventually I got enough caps to just buy it from someone for only 2k caps!
---
This is a terrible idea. The game was launched with the promise of not doing things like this. If they go back in that promise they will lose more than they gain. I for one won't pay a monthly subscription for a game. Nor will I play a game where I am at a disadvantage to people that have money to pay to make the game easier.
---
Men's bathroom in the pool area of Bolton Greens has an SMG on the ground. Not sure what level it spans at, but you could farm it for mods.
---
Kinda looks like a selfie. 
---
Mothman's a robot/vehicle, piloted by a Zetan. (No, I don't mean teh Flkatwoods monster, I mean the Mothman. No one else has seen teh head hinge open and show the piilot inside but me I don't think, but it \*does\* happen.)
---
The game is a lot of fun and keeps getting better.
---
Ooo, Thank you, I‚Äôll have a stalk lol :D
---
thats a weird looking bighorner...
---
i want to adopt one
---
If you look at the actual numbers ultracite isn't the best armor. T51 actually is.
---
In The Mire fast travel to the shack where you start the ‚ÄúDaily: Queen of the Hunt‚Äù quest and head north on the main road toward Freddy Fear‚Äôs House of Scares. There is a random encounter that triggers every server hop, I‚Äôve managed to find plans for skeleton costume and hat and witches hat there, still yet to get witches costume to drop there though.
---
The horrible corners of the brick building set would make sense in a log cabin, too!
---
Market is better, bazaar only has 1 mod is isn‚Äôt even that active, plus market has more active users and subs try there 
---
Oh If I only had a brain haha that'll be me with my silver tin man armour skipping along singing if I only had a brain.
---
Then going up to a robobrain and stealing his shit haha 
---
Also the combat shotguns short recons scope should be like on a .44 not a sniper rifle 
---
Every time I try to post it fails
---
Thanks Snoop, added, can you recall how this was awarded? Was it like when you get armor and it appears underneath the "Technical Data Removed" message,  or like ordinary loot and appeared as a quest reward.  
---
 Just trying to figure out what loot table this in, Paint, Armour or Apparel. 
---
Grafton Steel and the nearby dam spawn a bunch of mid level Super mutants.
---
Are you using the correct format? See the sidebar
---
I'm 53ish melee build, Gt = electricslime99
---
Is there any official statement about this hack?
---
What other stuff are you talking about?  Because they haven't said anything else that gives ingame effects is coming to the atom store from everything I've seen.
---
If poeple could hack your info and accounts then why would they just take fallout 76 things.
---
If your hacking into peoples accounts then I'd assume they would be stealing your info is: credit cards and bank info.
---
This seems sketchy as like other commenter said there is no one else posting about this.
---
And of it was and removed I'm sure a YouTuber would of heard of it and made a video calling it out.
---
So am unsure what to believe here
---
I loved getting the stew and thought giving everyone stew was a clever way to help players feel part of a bigger world.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm trying to help establish a line between raiders and griefers. Whilst people want to play raiders, the people playing them are not actually raiders, so really the cohesion is between them üòâ
---
I haven‚Äôt ever setup a camp in it, but I like to run ‚Äúpatrols‚Äù  down 65 and I stumbled across it on one because of the radio playing, I had seen it before but I never realized just how long It is.  
---
I only remember ghouls in it, crickets are likely though. 
---
There are different world spawns as well, Ned kits and duffle bags, good things to check periodically.   
---
Yeah if the radio or even holotapes triggered you being detected there would be a lot people complaining about it from launch. So yeah. It‚Äôs always been just that sound for you to enjoy and no one else can hear. 
---
DL's a keylogger off some sketchy site, must be some weird glitch...
---
If you still have it then I'd be interested. Away at the moment an not back till tomorrow
---
My biggest issue with the recon scopes is that they are physically too big and take up too much of your view when just moving.   That‚Äôs why I prefer the regular scopes even though I prefer the tracking of the recon scopes. 
---
To be fair, the heavy weapons usually have a tracer round every so many rounds on the belt. I‚Äôd even be fine if they added an affect like that. Realistically, ur not gonna physically hold a minigun up to ur eye in order to aim in real life, the decrease in accuracy is at least realistic.im all for tracer rounds or reticles though.
---
I have a bunker ;]
---
Unsure if you‚Äôre interested OP, but I believe this model swap is available on the Nexus for 76. 
---
Model swapping for 76 is the same as for other games. It‚Äôs how I have my own custom Shishkebab model in game. 
---
I‚Äôm aware it‚Äôd be better if Bethesda implemented it themselves, but this could be a nice workaround in the meantime. 
---
If you jump in you will have lots to do. Most of the quest are now fixed and the game doesnt break anymore. It's good tbh. You missed alot or glitches or cheats that is either good or bad. Its worth the money in my opinion. Alot of ppl will complain about blackbird if you ever see you will want it. Lol
---
Yup and what I am saying is any sentient type creature however Bethesda has them classified in the engine, will run and flee simply because they have a Legendary in their inventory. They don't have to have Legendary as a title. Things like Ghouls and bots dont seem to be affected, but Gulpers, Super Mutants, Deathclowas and other do. 
---
Sidebar? I use Reddit on my phone if that matters
---
Thats not the issue. Bethesda is aware of that. They do it anyway because despite of the huge backlash ppl are still paying real money for it. 
---
I mean somehow its understandable. Since Bethesda lost already its good reputation why not make more money of it?
---
I have took a break from Tech data, but spikes in certain loot certainly happens, I dropped 3 Bomber Jackets in in the space of 20ish submissions, but they averaged out across the whole run. 
---
 In contrast I've never dropped shielded linings.  
---
can you recall how this was awarded? Was it like when you get armor and it appears underneath the "Technical Data Removed" message, or like ordinary loot and appeared as a quest reward.
---
Just trying to figure out what loot table this in, Paint, Armour or Apparel.
---
Sure you do ;]
---
I‚Äôve been playing since the beta and have only stopped here and there, but no more than a month. It‚Äôs one of my favorite games, but you do need to have someone to play with. For me, that‚Äôs what makes it is your friends and even the community. The game itself crashes a decent amount, stupid crap happens and makes you want to break your Xbox, but there‚Äôs just so much to do! I love exploring, killing the queen, hunting down certain plans, finding badass weapons, etc. i just don‚Äôt seem to get bored. I‚Äôm completely addicted now, especially with all the updates coming!!!! I‚Äôd say try it if you‚Äôre a Fallout fan, but I am extremely biased and don‚Äôt understand why anyone would ever hate this game lol I‚Äôve been wanting a coop Fallout to play with my boyfriend since I played Fallout 3 all those years ago ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è 
---
Daily is actually a regional daily. So you get one regional daily per region every 24 hours. The biv quest you can do that every 24 hours by itself which is prob why it has a different name. 
---
It was a limited time paint. I got it 
---
"You will ride eternal, SHINY AND CHROME!" 
---
Its thanks folks like you and your attitude, that we have to deal with companies progressively face fucking us.
---
Tommarow 5pm meet me at cranberry bog psn djd532 ;]
---
Yeah, it is, for sure, a grind. :)
---
I've checked that place once, as it did not have any of the Cabinets I was looking for I pretty much discarded it, added to notable chest location.
---
 Thanks for doing this Forumla, its looking like you are picking up the baton here :)  
---
I'm assuming that they may release more build sets with DLC, similar to Fo4, but either way, I'd definitely use this 
---
I was wondering this too.  Mine is slightly off screen as well on my 65‚Äù.   I was wondering if it was the TV or PS4 settings but haven‚Äôt spent any time on it.  
---
It‚Äôs nice to know that I‚Äôm not the only one.  
---
Ok 
---
My one TSE weapon I ever managed to loot, after a horrendous amount of playing and legendary farming, was a TSE 10 mm, and I got it one day before the TSEs were nerfed. So, yeah... 
---
That‚Äôs metal 
---
Yes
---
There's a fog in the Mire possibly caused by the nearby vault's G.E.C.K exploding. That's why there are air purifiers near Harper's Ferry. Kind of a copout but I guess it explains the similar Far Harbor wildlife.
---
Wait what? T51 is the best armor in the game?
---
PSN: Tabef (atm lvl 40).
---
Damn, never realised how similar The Coffee-Enema Robot from futurama and a Mr. Handy's appearance is
---
When you see it you will have to die to the electric  chair and your memory of it will be gone =_=
---
Tabef
---
We have a hungry, irradiated, and need help. I'd like a low on ammo, or need charge (more fusion cores). 
---
Awe mannn
---
So is it a deal
---
Yeah if I'm not busy I'm down
---
GOOOD :]
---
This right here, lvl 87 &amp; 208 just nuked it the other night for flux lol
---
Its far better than most games that people who say they are glad they stayed away from Fallout 76 play on a regular basis.  
---
Anti-armor will do marginally more damage than Two-Shot on someone who has zero other armor-piercing effects. Which is a very poorly loaded character. Bloodied can all the time, but requires a 20% health build. Furious takes 10 shots to get to that damage level; if you've got a reasonably well built character, there's very few enemies it should take you 10+ shots to kill; scorchbeast queen, behemoths, mirelurk 
---
Don't have to google it i already know. For Battlefront 2 EA expected to get 10 million but sold 'under' 9 million, they did not exactly say how many they sold. Anthem didn't reach expected sales either, nor did battlefield 5. I remember them saying something about Fifa as well.
---
It's almost like there's something going on there like...
---
...like you know, the consumer actually matters.
---
an std that festers and destroys the host without a damn care..

yeah you're right.. huh

I just really hope they coded it to count as responder armor for the bot vendor. 
---
While I enjoyed it, many where the times when I was living on the edge of being over-encumbered and suddenly was pushed over at the wrong moment by magic stew appearing in my inventory. 
---
I would not mind events giving server wide rewards, but if so we need to first introduce some sort of drone-delivery mail or courier service where people can pick up stuff or have it delivered to their camps, instead of having it drop into the inventory at the wrong moment.
---
You are both correct. I think? Lol
---
Sneak was my first skill to get level 100, I was just constantly crouched. 
---
I loved spamming the jump button in Oblivion to train agility. I missed that in Skyrim. I still jump a lot in FO76 when I walk long distances, even though in drains AP. Hard to kill old habits I guess. 
---
Drives me nuts lol
---
Idk man, some people see any kind of criticism of this game as hate and it‚Äôs sad, and some people are just trolls
---
Just allow me to build a jetpack or boosted jump at least and I'll be happy
---
There are so many pressing issues but things like board games should be a priority. No doubt about that.
---
While that sounds like the perfect way to implement it, giving more options to diversify one's characters, I suspect they'll take the lazy approach of "Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3..." and so on.
---
Low Health PA/HW/Explosives build. It's what I've been running since Beta (with various perk card swaps; Tenderizer I really only throw on for the Queen; luck cards get swapped around fairly often; Glow Sites swaps in for Exterminator when I'm in Whitesprings nukes, etc).
---
Key things to get are a good bloodied heavy weapon (Gatling gun is a fantastic starter; durable, accurate, very ammo/repair efficient) and getting a Emergency Protocols torso mod.
---
Your lvl 60 would still get killed every 5 seconds by a lvl 200+ in PvP
---
A mailbox system like WOW had could really help this game.
---
Need to transfer something to an alt? Just mail it for 3 caps
---
I feel like you should say "doesn't break that much anymore" saying it doesn't break implies that it never breaks which would be wrong, i play the game quite a bit and it definitely still breaks however with this last update my game is running a lot better than like 3 months ago when i bought it and i do find it fun and i really enjoy playing it 
---
Really hoping not, i feel that bethesda is listening to the community more and more because of this game, so any idea is possible if it gets enough traction 
---
I tried what you suggested and that didn't work. However once I took the shot using VATS it worked.
---
As an fps player I really got to remember that.
---
Thanks Puckseason, added to Post with credit. 
---
I suspect the problem is less with the explosive effect and more with the bloodied-explosive combo. Odds are the guy in question had a BE weapon and the corresponding armor, meaning that if he was on low health his damage output and resistance go through the roof. 
---
No one effect in the game is 100% broken, it's combining legendary effects that' OP and game breaking. 
---
And how many can we use at one time? (Asking for a friend)
---
Picture of elder paint added to post. 
---
All the cryptids come from west tek terminal in the West wing explains the sources for everything but sheepdude more than likely arkos pharma guys
---
I live i die i live again!!! Witness meeeeeee!!!!
---
It is great, we make US great again after it is nuked.
---
I would absolutely love this!! I‚Äôd hope it could also come with those latticed porch walls - or really anything to get a nice rustic porch look. I use the wood foundation to get close but I haven‚Äôt found a good or easy solution for walls that look good with my brick home set.
---
This.  And almost every other person in a lot of Armor I‚Äôve shot in PVP. 
---
It's better than it was, alot more technically stable, with lots of new, interesting content just over the horizon. That said, it may or may not be going pay-to-win in the very near future. I'd give it another month or two before diving in, to see which way it turns out.
---
PS I‚Äôm probably older than you ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Noted
---
I prefer this over the random corpse flower stamens.
---
Haha. Ok. 
---
Chief Engineer actually. 
---
It is a clusterfuck due to area restrictions, but I love it.
---
What do you mean?  If someone damages or steals from your base, they become Wanted immediately. But they shouldn't be able to damage them in adventure mode unless you were already hostile. 
---
A clusterfuck? Haha. Its compact maybe but a clusterfuck? Lol.
---
Very nice! I think the end game Free States RPers just found their uniform! 
---
I'd love it. Honestly, this is the sort of cool, but not game-changing sort of thing I though the ATOM Shop would be full of.
---
Should be rewarded more atoms for completing that milestone 
---
I have given up SBQ after the March patch. It is almost unplayable. Screen is frozen or game crash es too often.
---
a ps4 uses about 140 watts when playing a game.
---
using the us national average of 0.12 cents per kw/h, if you left the PS4 run 24/7 while a game was running you're using around 3.30kw per 24 hours.
---
this means that, cost per month, you're adding $12.25 to your energy bill, to about $147 per year.
---
that's about the same cost per year of having a refrigerator.
---
Probably farming flux. It's about the only reason I can think of to nuke that area.
---
There are Modus radiant quests
---
AAE is my thing, or AASS for melee
---
Got a link for me? Google does not show much info :(
---
There are far fewer bugs, and the ones that are still there aren't anywhere near as game-breaking. That said, there's some pay-to-win drama stirring regarding "repair kits" going on sale in the atomic shop some time in the near future, so you might want to hold off for a little bit.
---
bloodied fire rate 10mm pistol atm
---
I went through a TSE handmade phase.  Now I‚Äôm a heavy build and my TSE Gatling is my go to.  Love that baby.  Does almost 300 damage at 50% health, maxed heavy gunner cards &amp; adrenaline mutation.
---
On the 8th. Which is today depending where you‚Äôre at.
---
enclave events are a far cry to the radiant quests of fallout 4... and you dont even really gotta turn em in you just complete em... not to mention all the enclave events are hella short.. protect bots for 2 minutes from like 4 super mutants? weak...
---
Zealots explosive Gatling plasma 
---
I have incisor on so aa melee I read doesn‚Äôt stack so I run with a bloodied SS death claw gauntlet for my melee and a bloodied SS bat as a backup
---
Well, that's what radiant quests in fo76 are. 
---
I'd think Anti-Armor; you've got such a high damage output to begin with, armor negation should push it into ludicrous levels.
---
Hi Formula, it'd help me if you could reply either direct to the post, or one of my responses, otherwise, I don't get a notification and will only see it if I scroll through the replies.  
---
Anybody have an extra recipe?  I've killed tons of scorchbeasts and dont have this recipe
---
Do you know what else is being added?  I am very curious to see what else is being datamined.
---
And we need okayish scopes for 10mm-submashinegun.
---
I can provide all mutation serums for you for 400 caps each. IGN: jchamlin
---
I had a TSE gat only thing I don‚Äôt like is the aiming even with sights. Takes a lil bit to get the hang on where it lands lol
---
They said in the 8th patch, which is likely tomorrow or next Tuesday. Updates happen on Tuesdays.
---
I have a bloodied 10mm but a 1 star. Didn‚Äôt mess with it 
---
Fair, I use incisor and have AA melee, I thought it does stack, until I see the data mining or Bethesda tells us, I'm gonna keep using it lol
---
I picked up a berserkers 10 mm and a 2 shot .44 earlier in a whitesprings nuke zone. I have zero use for pistols though.
---
Nah this dude is just lying on here 
---
Yes.  There‚Äôs a perk card to improve accuracy too.  One Gun Army.   That‚Äôs maxed out too. 
---
I think it resets. It's why I swapped my Furious Gatling Plasma for and Anti-Armor one. That said, as an auto rifle, I think you'd build up your meter so quickly that your Furious lvl35 will still out perform your vanilla lvl45 overall.

bloodied pipe revolver with pistol and pipe weaponry perks atm
---
I read that AA (and other perks) only stack to a certain level. But I can‚Äôt confirm it 
---
it adds up, yes. (about $147 per year), but I was ignoring outages and the such because you can't really predict those
---
Some you just can't learn... Check out this sheet... It's helped me tremendously.

---
Secret is to not aim until a shot hits. You get crosshairs from hip fire, then once your on target ads to increase accuracy.
---
This is a fantastic idea. If they ever come out with faction specific things, they could even do faction backpacks and that'd be really cool
---
What are those even good for anyway?
---
Colored ones are a random spawn on the third floor of fort Defiance near the elevator. 
---
I had a 1 star bloodied pipe bolt action gave it to a buddy and it was doing something like 700 damage, of course breathing on him kills him but still dirty

---
this might not change your mind, but worth watching :)
---
They are working on spreading pacifist mode to your C.A.M.P. too.
---
Yeah according to the game i have never discovered grafton dam or killed a SBQ. Ive done both on 2 different characters among the other things i havent done but have.
---
You can scrap any handmade; it doesn't have to be upgraded in anyway.  Any random one will do.
---
Though you should know, some mods have a very low chance of unlocking, so the more you unlock, the less the pool of mods there are, so the remaining once are less likely to unlock. 
---
I've been told it doesn't add the 75% and 50%, it multiplies them so .75 √ó .50, can't do the math rn lol
---
I'd happily pay for such a set. Or a rustic fireplace to go with it. Perhaps radstag antler wall decoration...I might have designed this in my head too often already.... :p
---
Yeah! If we're proudly rebuilding America, let us fly Old Glory over our hard-won settlement! Or better yet, faction flags! Declare your allegiance! Come on Bethesda, these things practically sell themselves.
---
Not bad lol 
---
You can buy the plans at the Whitespring resort. It is sold by the hunting supplies vendor called Flintlock or something.
---
RIP
---
I would absolutely love faction backpacks.... not sure if i would have raiders, free states or enclave tho, most likely raiders
---
This is a bad idea. We need banks. Not some bullshit griefing
---
I use both DS3 and DS4 controllers via bluetooth on my PC, so I know it's possible.
---
Are you able to pair the controller by pressing the share and PS button at the same time and connecting in your bluetooth menu? Depending on the OS, it's where I run into the most trouble. 
---
Okay so I go in to speak with the mayor and I get a reward since it‚Äôs part of a quest. I leave the area and check my map only to discover I still haven‚Äôt explored Mayor Grafton‚Äôs office. I went on his terminal. I just removed the marker and went on my way at that point. Sometimes you just live through it.
---
Bullshit.
---
I'm very into meta research and I'm testing builds against most dangerous players regularly. X01 offers zero protection against players and you fought naked (PA need a legendary tier).
---
Explosive lost its meta status for other alternatives, because everybody runs with fireproof and dense mods negating most of the damage.
---
Learn to be good in the game before you suggest irrelevant changes. PvE people should not try to change PvP until they git gud at it, and suggestions like this only portray the same infuriating scheme - witchhunting people for using weapons that are not even that good.
---
Explosive is only useful for farming noobs and for PvP more often than not it becomes a hinderance.
---
As I see, they never put it there are serious challenge. That there is put up with "sarcasm" or something like that.
---
&amp; how is this griefing? 
---
I think MalcolmLinair is correct, they want to extend time it takes to get the "best" one so they will make it grindy.
---
\+1 to bring the Bull Barrel mod back. 
---
Something I started to miss too. Because, when I upgraded my weapons, I got feeling like I was doing same damage as I was doing without upgrades, when doing SBQ.
---
ESO does that, and it's great. They also let you choose to see character/player names.
---
I‚Äôm a commando build and use two. I use a furious 10mm SMG to keep the adds off the heavy weapon users and when she lands I switch to my full auto anti armor handmade and just unload in her face. People say scorchbeasts are a waste of billets bur I just wait for them to land and they are dead before I reload using the same strategy. 
---
the atoms for the challenges I've completed would be cool, but i'd give every Atom I have ever earned to just finally be able to get these friggin Overseer Holotapes out of my inventory even if I can't get credit for finishing her quest.
---
Just started but down to hang out. All these people one-upping me since I‚Äôm late to the party. GT is (Zmart39). I‚Äôll probably be a straggler but I‚Äôd love to talk. 
---
Vendor them until I can't anymore, then leave legendary paper bags at vendors.
---
...And if this PA sole purpose was digging, its combat damage should be minimal and whole PA should be very bad at doing damage. This PA whole purpose should be digging, like it has now.
---
Yeah, I'm near WhiteSprings and have wild mongrels attacking constantly, turrets help me tbh
---
One of you owned a workshop.  
---
Yesterday i shoot a nice pic next to a hermit crab, because i found it hilarious that after so much time, it's the first time i noticed that the bus have a logo that says "lobster grill" :P
---
I have the same problem. I built North of the Tygra water plant and it‚Äôs constant. Every time I travel back, there‚Äôs a horde. If I spend 10 minutes there, I have to fight off another horde. I can‚Äôt fast travel because there‚Äôs always enemies. Thankfully they‚Äôre all rank five or so but it‚Äôs still irritating. 
---
Yeah I have so many locations that I have found but not registered, it's really annoying.
---
No, its 5 dmg per hit regardless of max damage of weapon.  Not percent.
---
But now its changed and Slap dmg = 0 dmg in pacifist mode.
---
So....how many times did the party crasher  get killed afterwards?
---
Its function is so that I could see a nuke timer when I join server, then determine I'm safe, then get nuke dropped on my head and my glitched camp that can't be moved, so that I would have to pay 600 total of various expensive junks to repair it.
---
In other words I became a raider and KoS whiespring nukers because of this bug.
---
yes they have already said they were working on it
---
I'm hopefully that they'll one day completely address server stability since pretty much everytime I'm running a Silo the server goes full-potato and it becomes difficult to interact with anything. In particular, the section where you need to replace mainframe cores in the Storage room, almost always takes 10 minutes because of how terrible the server gets.

"Thank you for shooting me in the Head" - Main character of Fallout New Vegas
---
Lol. Those can take a few shots. Do they ever spawn as legendary?
---
Good point! I really liked the military backpack in fallout 4, it had a similar approach, where it would give healing bonuses, endurance, more AP... but only one at a time, and you could always change it.
---
I‚Äôm was up on top of Seneca rocks, nothing ever spawned up there lol. Now I‚Äôm near arktos pharma and I get attacked but it‚Äôs small groups and fairly rare. 
---
I don't even have that great gear but either vendor fodder or free legendaries for the true peasants.
---
Do they ever spawn as legendary?
---
I hadn‚Äôt thought about that until you mentioned it.  But ain‚Äôt that a kick in the head?
---
I posting threads a long long time ago saying the only way to fix PvP would be to put a max cap on dmg output per a shot to stop fast deaths, but even at that time I also said, it would need to be dependent on the rate of fire otherwise certain would just be OP in comparison to others. It seems a little crazy that us players, can see the predictable possible faults within systems, that the developers don't.
---
If you say you‚Äôre going to do something and don‚Äôt, that‚Äôs on you. It‚Äôs not exactly rocket science. 
---
Obviously you‚Äôre free to play your video games however you choose, as long as you‚Äôre not cheating/exploiting online or intentionally trying to make people feel bad, and that includes what you do with the meaningless items you get while playing them. It really doesn‚Äôt matter.
---
What does matter is what happens outside the game. And if you say you‚Äôre going to do something and don‚Äôt, then you‚Äôve broken your word. And when you do that, don‚Äôt be surprised when people get pissed off at you, *particularly* when it‚Äôs over something trivial like a video game where keeping your word should be extremely easy for anyone with... well, integrity.
---
I fill the blue suitcase in the Watoga train station once the vendors are out of caps. 
---
Yeah, I check them now because i never knew lol
---
I went through like 50, but as I mentioned I did get lost for a bit haha!
---
Maybe if they made ROF and dmg have so e sort of math where high ROF has a DPS cap and Rof guns that are 1-4 have little to none dmg caps since atm a tse handmade kills in half a sec while a AA crit dmg lever action takes 3 sec to kill but shorter amount of shots
---
* Take only 1 rank of rifleman/commando - First point = 10%, each additional rank = 5%
---
* Take Luck-based Tormentor, 3 ranks
---
* Take Grim-Reaper (max Rank)+ Rank 1 Gun Fu
---
* Ballistics Perk (Max rank)
---
* Pay attention to the wiki on mods, it shows hidden stats on the mods like +accuracy when sighted and AP useage.
---
So out of all the info he only took fallout items? 
---
I agree seems fishy

It's random. I'm a level 20 and got a 2 shot laser Gatling I can't use till level 50. Kinda annoying
---
Yeah, now I know the path and series of actions it'll be a lot quicker. Took me over an hour. Or took me several months depending how you look at it lol
---
Where at top of the world? Do u remember what spot there?
---
My \*\*\* Grognak's axe is like this. Even with 200% perk, it breaks after a few hits.
---
That sounds cool, that would be better as perk cards I think :o you wouldn't mutate to know how to dual weild 
---
Certain ones like Night Vision scopes, can only be found, plan or Mod. 
---
Pete hasn't posted on Twitter in forever.
---
Or at least fix the corpse seeds going to my inventory too. Feels like a spit in the face to fix the one everyone enjoyed and not the one that is actual buns. 
---
Oooh yay are they? Sorry this is news to me
---
The choice of emotes is bizarre.  Who needs to say to people "let's cook!"  more often than "thanks"?  Bethesda really know how to put real depth of detail into their stupid decisions.
---
You must be new here. It doesn't matter if CM replies here. Unless they change the patch notes for the upcoming update, nothing will change
---
What would make the red and yellow Firebreather suit even better is if the shoulder lights were flashing red lights so we can be fire trucks.
---
Looked cute, might kill the whole server later.
---
I've got a feeling it's due to instability most of the time, so there's no way you could be warned. There's been a couple times where I've been given an hour or so notice, even when there's no updates on so they must occasionally close servers but usually it's just a server crash I think.
---
Oh hell yes
---
It took me about 90 seconds to down four scorchedbeasts with a bloodied explosive combat rifle yesterday :D
---
Yes, the controller is paired and "connected" but it won't activate unless I use steam or DS4windows, which in turn makes it show up as Xobx controller. 
---
Crank your luck up to 34 and it‚Äôs a crit every other shot
---
Me too.  Theyre cosmetic, but actually useful.  Perfect candidates for the atom store, yet here we are in the middle of a shitstorm over repair stuff that ought to have been in the game from the start.
---
But no black and yellow like the posters in the game?
---
I‚Äôm slowly switching to that from a melee build I‚Äôm getting there
---
damn mama dulce and her communist stew! wanna know why everyone got stew? because it was *COMMIE STEW*! Liberty Prime wouldnt be havin none of that. luckily, the patriotic capitalists at Bethesda saw fit to correct this issue. ...some of you would clearly be having a hard time spotting the communists. *YOURSELVES!*
---
...what is with those? where are they coming from?
---
I feel like calling repair kits "pay to win" overstates things. More like "pay to mildly ameliorate an occasional inconvenience." 
---
I'll buy atoms for fixing lack of most of these things implemented in game. Perk loadout manager mod is a critical fix for game UI thats punished to sit in position between being console usable and PC usable (it aint usable on PC at all).
---
I have a philosophy of buying cosmetic items as a sign of appreciation. 
---
I won't be paying subscription for missing critical convenience features, ever.
---
Glad you found what worked.
---
I have a quad eplosive harpoon with flechettes, it's really nice to have infinite ammo.  Don't need to buy 5mm or anything l, you get more harpoons off bodies than you ever need.  And it does really good damage even though I have zero heavy weapons perks.  I might be interested in trading it if you have a good offer...
---
Plant some decoy crops in front of wall. My camp gets attacked by Radrats, Molerats, scorched, super mutants, ScorchBeasts, dogs, wolves, ghouls, no insects yet. They all go for my walls, crops and water purifiers.
---
They often spawn right out of a big rock with is pretty funny.
---
Harpoons are infinite with flechettes.  Never buy a single one
---
I would not say that Charleston is the easiest to spawn him, much much  easier at Lady Janets Soft Serve. That is where I got all the Hunter Coats I bought from him for my upcoming clothes vendor. 
---
lol. Yes. I've been thinking about building a mock building for them to attack :-) Crops are tedious though, as you need to get new crops to repair them. Say, wood or steel, is a lot easier.
---
Repair one crop item, insta harvest and repair next, rinse and repeat, I‚Äôm carnivore so never carry veg.
---
Yesterday I was killed in survival. Respawn, killed again. Place bounty, respawn somewhere else, run on the back of the guy using the map marker. Found him, took him down. He had ridiculous amounts of meds and junk and suddenly I was overencumbered in general vicinity of his last position.
---
This was such an complicated logistic challenge to get the loot to my stash until he came back. I choose the position because it was a perfect trap. There was a lure camp in the middle and the stash was there. Going there by foot would mean there are four percect spots to snipe me down such that I couldn't retaliate.
---
I managed to stash all that. After 10 minutes of sneaking and eating the carry capacity drugs I looted. Free stash teleportation is definition of P2W for a game where you can have 100 stealthboys on you but be unable to loose them, unlike other players.
---
How many Atoms to unlock the car? 
---
Honestly? That was the only reason I'd ever considered returning back to that event after the BETA. The stew was great. Bonus exp and a quick snack. Do it once or twice just to pay back the server for the exp buff, by giving them an exp buff. 
---
Just wanted to say thanks again for the advice, I was able to level over 10 times at the weekend to 187. I haven't done levelling like that in ages. I only had to PvP once for the whole weekend.
---
Also if you want to talk about exploits and glitching we all need to be talking more about the level 2 mule cap dumping while the other 3 are lag switching and vats-ing through walls and around corners.  Those are the real MVP‚Äôs üôÑ
---
BE Lever Action as sneak/crit sniper. Works wonders for me right now.
---
Closed doors closing again before you can open them. Frozen enemy spawns.
---
Man with all these people complaining how terrible survival is (because they play it like idiots) I am so happy to have a positive interaction where player wanted to learn how to move, asked for tips, received them, and ended the weekend with "I farmed like crazy" positive experience.
---
You are the material to rebuild America. The people who want some obsolete items to be nerfed because they die - those are not.
---
Holy shit, I'm not ready for that. I'm just here to farm some springs...
---
I don't even pick them up if they're 1\*
---
thanks everyone
---
Ok... "lag switching" what is this 2012 Call of Duty? That's not happening. Having a mule isn't an exploit. Show me any proof at all of anyone VATsing through walls. 
---
If you can show proof of exploits that is one thing but this is just wild.
---
If you look at over all stats then yes.
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a0iq9v/all_max_level_power_armors_stats/
---
I‚Äôve never gotten into sniper or sneak in any game lol. ADHD in me prevents the patience for it. 
---
&gt;BSG needs to make PvP only available in survival.
---
If you eliminate PvP, nothing stops players from monopolizing all the workshops so others can't have them with the only goal being to deprive people of it. It sounds stupidly trollish, but there's plenty of people in survival mode running aqua boy sitting at the bottom of a lake just so they can be the #1 on the leader board. 
---
Short answer: Because loot is rolled random.
---
Me too, am ready to dump the whole damn heavy lot and clear my Stash, still waiting for display items in camp though.
---
i wouldnt mind the return of the silenced .22 pistol. i keep a pistol as a sidearm for weaker enemies (i main heavy weapons), but when my one pistol weighs more than 3-4 of my heavy weapons combined, thats kind of a drag. (i have the bear arms perk maxed out)
---
Imagine those stacking them, would look hilarious üòÇ 
---
You're not missing anything. That's just how marine armor is in this game.
---
Don‚Äôt people still have their duped Boobleheads and magazines?
---
I would like the backpack feature to replace the weight reduction perk cards.  There just isn‚Äôt anything cool about them.  
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind an overhaul of the perk system in general so that there are fewer perks that are must haves, such as damage perks, and more that are fun and add variety.  
---
As it is, there are really only a few actual builds that people use with maybe a few perks or special points left to personal preference.  Make perks that feel like a personal choice instead of boring incremental perks that take up most of the perk points.
---
Can you list game breaking things to give op an answer to his question? 
---
You must be very removed from the dark sides of this game.  Just because you don‚Äôt experience it, doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt happening.  There‚Äôs a whole eff ton of things wrong right now.  They‚Äôll fix it when they fix it and make it a lot harder for people.  Then everyone will complain about it being too hard.  
---
Yeah I don't feel like ever participating in that event again now that's its changed. Although I think the bigger problem is Bethesda pushing micro transactions in their games. 
---
Ir must be hard work wading through all the dross to find useful ideas in this sub.
---
This ya been happening to me and a few other players I know as well 
---
Super Stims I believe.
---
I would love to take a look at what you have, I also have a ton off plans, we could work something out.
---
The Death Blossoms event.
---
Maybe it was a while ago.  Not seen that any time recently.
---
Did You?! That's so expensive,next time come to see Me and I'll make a good price 
---
Wouldn't say no to a good buff. Even without legendaries a good pistol can tear enemies apart. The black powder pistol is a beast. All the criticals on a high damage pistol.. Just glorious. One shot, 25% health gone. 
---
No no no no no. You dont get to just say "people are lag switching" or any other wild baseless things and then when someone asks for proof you say "I see it even if you don't". If it is really happening there has to be proof somewhere but I havent seen any and neither has anyone else I've met. Proof or it's a load of bull.
---
build in the mire.... in survival there are no fast travel nodes out there so you should be relatively safe...
---
I've been there a million times (I'm exaggerating of course, but sure feels like it), and I've never seen them there. Where exactly do they spawn at there?
---
I‚Äôm so sorry I wasn‚Äôt focused on taking game clips while fighting a crap load of people at the same time.  I promise I‚Äôll get video of it for you next time!  I super promise!  üëçüèº
---
Same. Legendary items and many, many, many apparels for future sale.
---
I‚Äôm sure someone is selling it ahah
---
ok good, I was wondering the same thing, I had to redo my camp, becuase I guess were I was its a future location, but yes it took me 3x longer to attach the wires in my camp for the same reason I was just jumping like a dumb ass all over my camp. 
---
I thought was the only one. 
---
My first thoughts exactly. It's got to be intentional with how similar they look to Classic Who cybermen.
---
This happens to me literally all the time. I live at whitesprings on one of the fairways. Its probably the most player camp concentrated area. I always load into my camp not being able to be placed or neighbors nearby. 
---
Never fight back. Just drop your camp in the same spot once they leave and it'll all be repaired. Those guys that do it all have sentinel asassin armour and unkillable builds. They get wanted so people will initiate pvp with them and then they can farm caps off regular players that have QOL and weight management cards. 
---
It happened so often that i bought some fancy armour and built up a pvp character so i could just flip and take out the douchebags. 
---
This is the easiest way.
---
TSE isn't really more effective than other weapon types. Anyone that's serious into PvP uses fireproof and a dense torso mod to negate explosive damage. The main benefit you get is two shot, which isn't better than anti-armor, furious, bloodied, junkie's, beserker's, and several other damage buffs.
---
I kill people with a bloodied + faster fire rate hand made. My best kill streak this week is 28 kills. A TSE would be a step down for me.
---
Instigating 1star level (20?) Is the only 10mm i found.
---
pay to win is anything that gives you and advantage over none paying players,
---
and having what you suggested is difently giving an advantage over none paying players,
---
What you're seeing is just regular old damage bug. It has nothing to do with levels. You shouldn't try to conflate your level and the damage bug. They're two different things.
---
Just go and re-level a character if you don't want to wait for the prestige system to drop. You'll be able to re-level existing characters and probably lose less once this is available
---
I got a fairly stable 3man group that could use a 4th I'm level 100 and we got a 99 and a 195.. not on tonight but gamertag is d3adliest petch
---
Funny. You would think that there would be proof anywhere at all not just from you but there is none. You know what I'm gonna try you're style...
---
People are hacking my inventory and they took my Anti-armor, mutant slayer, two-shot, bloodied, explosive, ghoul slayer, zealots, furious, grognak's  double barrel ultracite gatling mini handmade.
---
Bethesda please fix and give it back!!!
---
I dont need to show proof because I've seen the dark side of this game and you havent and I see and you dont and its true.
---
I couldn‚Äôt tell you what happened before. All I can tell you is that probably about a month ago I was experiencing somewhat frequent frustration at being killed almost instantly by high level players. Play on ps4 by the way. Not as much recently, but I can tell you my health bar went down far more than 5 damage worth per hit when I had not yet reciprocated. 
---
only one heavy weapon is sightless. the only one i dont have sights for is my .50 cal, but its rate of fire allows you to walk it pretty quick. and .50cal ammo is plentiful, so be generous. it helps that it also has a nice lil bit of knockback. if it helps, if you can place 2 or 3 shots, the hit markers basically become a reticule. but to be honest, heavy weapons are not *precision* weapons. kentucky windage (for the slower firing gatling) and walking rounds are your best bet. get the perk that boosts how much ammo you can make and go have some fun! alternatively, the batteries included perk syncs well with the power user perk to keep your gatling laser spinning and the gatling laser gets an aim dot!
---
You probably want a couple because it's going to break every 20 shots
---
Murder hobos...I‚Äôm going to start using that. 
---
You misunderstood. Its worst for high level because it's based on doing too much damage and when a high level is killed because of this they lose much more than a low level. I lose 410 caps when I'm killed where as a lvl 50 loses 100. I shouldn't have to "re-level" a new character to play the game.
---
You can drop the power armor and still run heavy weapons for PvP. If you do that, you have a smaller hit box and people won't hear you approaching from a mile away. One gun army does enough of the heavy lifting that stabilized really doesn't add too much. Mix that with some proper PvP armor and your build will stand up to more damage than PA could
---
Dude what are you even talking about hahaha, I‚Äôve literally never had any of those things happen to me ü§£
---
I‚Äôve played this game clean since the get go and I‚Äôve never complained about anything but the huge exploit system that unfortunately is a thing in the game.  I don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôre questioning that it‚Äôs some sort of conspiracy.  But keep on truckin‚Äô dude.  Play well out there! üëçüèº
---
Or he recived it from an equaly kind player
---
Depends on how many people I'm with. 
---
Just me? Executioner's Explosive Dragon and either a bloodied Sledge/Grognak or Furious Power Fist. Whichever I fancy at the time. 
---
Me and one or two others? I'll either run the same setup or just go with the Powerfist to keep Scorched cleared until the Scorchybeest lands.
---
Now you are backtracking. Exploits exist but none of the ones you listed are. 
---
Its coming along fine thanks, the game isn't as bad as everyone and the media say it is, it acts and feels like any other fallout game. Most updates/patches  are bringing new life into the game but there are many hit and miss hic-ups by Bethesda along the way which have created a two steps forward three steps back approach of late.
---
I'd like to point out that no man's sky isn't a dumpster fire, yeah it had it's problems at first and had a problem with lack of content but the game has improved considerably and is going from strength to strength with an even bigger update this summer with the arrival of "beyond" which one of its features is VR capability 
---
Exactly, sane as gatorclaw from 4. They are milking that animation set a little now I think

I use this to add component tags when viewing scrap objects, but it does need to be re-run after every update (only takes 30 seconds).  Make sure you run the file checker utility first to make sure all the games files are correct.  This does not change any games files, it just a set of ‚Äútext string files‚Äù u der the strings directory.

Patch 8. It comes out April 9th.
---
I stash my hard earned caps and you start some lame gta event to steal it.
---
How is it not? And even if everyone agreed to the event, it's still a bad idea and doesn't belong anywhere near fallout. 
---
Oh my dear sweet baby Jesus.  Dude, enough.  I am not backtracking.  Have a good night!  Agree to disagree! 
---
Also all the grip meshes for the 10mm Pistol are the same and the Pump-Action Shotgun is missing more sight options.
---
Beth, please fix.
---
I guess its over then. You made claims with no proof, got called out, gave up in the end as it was all baseless. Good night sir.

If the security team wins the bank stays open and they receive rewards.

I‚Äôm a girl.  And like I said, I‚Äôll make sure I get video next time I‚Äôm fighting 8 people, that‚Äôll be my first priority, JUST for you!

Ok then ma'am. Have a good night and hopefully your delusions subside and they can let you out of the halfway house soon.

They're on the legendary loot table now? Sweet!

Hahahahahaha.  If you only knew.  I‚Äôm just sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo crazy.  ü§°
---
The link is working now. It was a problem with the site it seems.
---
Should have heard about this on friday at the latest...leaving it to sit over a weekend was a bad call. Even a "We see that this is contentious and will be discussing it in house" post, something. 
---
Can't speak in regards to the OP, but for me...
---
* Taking Workshops is fine, IF you're taking the Workshop, If you're doing to PvP someone, then not cool. Especially if the owner is across the map.
---
* Setting traps to catch people in to PvP - Not Cool 
---
* Attacking CAMP - Not Cool
---
* Attacking People - Not Cool
---
Though, in regards to the last two, BGS has/ is pretty much solved that.
---
Niice!
---
So you kept harassing a guy, who in return killed you, rightly so.
---
So you reroll a character and keep killing him because you couldn't in the past? Now that's salty, why are you proud of this?
---
Disclaimer: I am a filthy casual.
---
This would sound amazing in a Col. Gutsy voice.
---
use them, since 99% of decent legendary items I've gotten are single star variants. Every 3 star I've gotten is garbage.   
---
The absolute trash, though, is being hoarded on alts for the legendary vendor. 
---
More like a shot
---
if you fix it to 200% with fix it good it goes nearly as high as metal or heavy combat but degrades pretty quick.
---
Only one time so far
---
Even at a cap per weight unit for mailimg stuff would be fair.
---
Well yes, but from what i was told thats through the console itself and not through something Bethesda integrated into their game
---
I used to be up there as well; believe it or not, the only thing that ever attacked me was a Scorchbeast. No video so no proof, but it happened after a couple of weeks of playing with nothing happening up there. Outside of that the only thing that spawned were vertibots and cargo bots that did me no harm.
---
No lol. These guys are purely Pvp, they are a group and clearly state this. As for being salty, that's no to, I was mythed because I could not kill him, he was practically invincible. 
---
True but not everyone has credit cards haha
---
5mm? i got too much of the stuff! and im a heavy weapons user. go to your tinkering bench, put a marker on lead. once you learn where lead is in the wild, you wont even need an extractor. pencils? *theres lead in that.* lousy ass protectrons? *kill it, theres lead in it.* childrens toys? *i shit you not, theres lead in it* paint buckets? *about 5 lead a piece homie.* combination wrenches that are everywhere? *yup, lead.* and the ammo boosting perk card is a god send. for 15 lead and yadda yadda other components, i make 180 rounds of 5mm. once you learn whats in junk, you can make better decisions as you travel along...
---
I don't think those kinds of kids play 76 tbh.
---
The reason I found the guy at his camp was because he made a post on groups needed stating his teams names, saying we want Pvp, join on Gt etc. So I did and got whooped numerous times, unable to kill this certain guy was really annoying and I just wanted to know why, I even politely asked him for help and tips on my build lol. 
---
Endangerol is opüëç
---
Semi auto vampires laser rifle. 
---
Silly, but I so miss the good old days of MUDs. Prophecy was my shit.
---
yeah, survival is shoot on sight right now.
---
i tried to holster my gun or speak on mic to let them know i am not hostile even i can kill most player i run across but man they always shoot first.
---
even one guy put the Picture emote and then as soon we took the picture he attacked me with a super sledge, Thanks to blocker perk card i didn't get one shooted so i vat crited his ass and moved on.
---
Have you guys received any info about the Pay to Win feature yet? Even if you don¬¥t play the game a subscription to this sub is so much fun, holy shit Bethesda.
---
Currently running a instigating lever with a vampires laser rifle as backup. 
---
Yea I used to see a few hanging out Down the hill but they never came up. I have a video of my buddies fighting them and me up on top waving 
---
If he's purely PvP, how is he level 283?
---
They‚Äôve definitely changed both the number of diseased enemies and the infection rate. 
---
I used to be able to play a few hours without catching a disease and had a nice stack of disease cures or antibiotics. Now I‚Äôm constantly riddled with diseases. 
---
I have 100% chance of getting a disease whenever I see a diseased enemy, which is pretty much any time I run into enemies. 
---
When they first changed it a few weeks ago I actually had to stop playing because I contracted five diseases in an hour just building my C.A.M.P. 
---
They aren't 
---
Thank you, I was wondering how come the Buried with Honor daily wasn't available yet in a world and yet the Strange Brew daily was.
---
Happy birthday to the ground 
---
Please elaborate on no 'end game content'
---
Oh shit!!! That‚Äôs where it came from. Yeah, do that again. 
---
I remember months ago, there is a player who has 900 hours but bethesda banned him anyway. Yes, lets give people a reward for being loyal to our game!
---
it's because it wants you to get specific locations  if you played beta, challenges came out after beta.. you cannot re discover locations you already found create new character and find those locations on that character and it will complete for you
---
Sorry, not so sure about medic legendary effect. I've been always after two-shot, anti-armor, bloodied and explosive... what a boring guy I am lol Hopefully, Bethesda would bring other legendary effects as good as those in some ways.
---
I have a few questions on the build. 
---
Do you switch out the lock pick perks for something like Glow Sight to give yourself even more damage in nuke zones?
---
Same for Hard Bargain, unless you're going to vendors a lot then Suppressor or Tenderizer might help for when you know you're going into a combat situation.
---
How many fusion cores do you usually take with you? I noticed you use Power User but not Batteries Included so I wonder how much time you're able to get out of a fully charged core.
---
Oh, for sure. I know. And using terrain, etc. it always a good idea.
---
What I'm talking about is countering silly meta. Not normal fights. 
---
Survive is one thing - one shotted while fully buffed, dodgy, sprinting with full assassin/cavalier armor on is quite another. Then, when you actually make it to the opponent, getting through that MASSIVE disadvantage built in to melee, your hits don't land and you can't take advantage of VATS crits because of that?
---
As an energy weapon build and finding my double tesla rifle lacking, I am super jealous. üëç
---
[My bloodied build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1f643de&amp;d=c72la2lr2l71l12lt2p02pg2ph2pp2pi2s00ek0eh1eo2ir0ib1a72a42ar2an2ao0&amp;w=ce0cm2if2iq2s72sb0a30e60e42el0lm2au2ag0at1&amp;n=&amp;m=). For full health I'd probably just swap serendipity for born survivor, and swap nerd rage for one more point into demo expert. 
---
Only need 2 ranks of fire proof if you have a dense torso mod. The third rank makes close to no difference. A third rank isn't going to help you tank an explosive shotgun any better than 2 will. Sometimes you just die no matter what.
---
You really don't need blocker. The last patch made melee pretty non-viable. I'd drop that down to 1 strength and run another perk. 
---
DR is almost meaningless for PvP and that's why PA builds generally suck in the current version of survival mode. Evasive is near useless. If you really want an idea of how much damage this reduces, just plug in some imaginary numbers into the DR formula. See what 45 DR does when you're taking 250 damage. Now take that end damage and compare it to the DR you get from 1 star assassin armor (-40% damage and DR calculation). You could do the same for sentinel/cavalier.
---
I usually see single shot (non-explosive damage) capped at 190 HP, so having bloody mess is well in excess of what you'll need. All of this seems to be on the back end after damage reduction and damage resistance is passed through. Explosive damage seems to be accounted for separately (meaning total damage can be in excess of 190), so I'd keep all ranks of demo expert. 
---
If you're looking for ways to reduce damage, you really should take suppressor at max rank. Field surgeon&gt;First aid for how short PvP engagements are. Serendipity and born survivor don't work well together. If bloodied: serendipity, no born survivor. If full health: born survivor, no bloodied.
---
Some people like dodgy, but I've never liked it for a rifle build just because you should be using your AP for VATS and crits. You could run dodgy, but then take all your VATS related perks off because you won't have AP to use them. 
---
I wouldn't bother with born survivor. Mysterious savior is ok, but kind of a waste luck points. Revenant is a meme for PvP. 
---
People without what die very very easily?
---
There's an exploit to multiply the DR of your power armor infinite times.
---
Low wight will probably go well with bird bones and jetpack.
---
I had it die like that for me yesterday too haha 
---
Nothing about being 150 levels over a person inherently means they do more damage. This is damage bug. It used to happen more frequently than this.
---
There's a prestige system where they plan on making it so your level is reset on the character and you gain some other benefit. I would imagine this means less cap loss as well. I understand your position, but I don't think my level 320 character is entitled to lose less caps than my level 60. I understand the rules and accept them. Until there is a functioning prestige system, this is just going to be how we play the game.
---
It is level 40.  But I am still quite happy. 
---
I went back and tried playing a few out of nostalgia... legend of the red dragon did not age well. I also can‚Äôt believe how casual everyone was about the ‚Äúsleep with the bar wench‚Äù leaderboard. X_x
---
And a bunos for every the killed had before s/he died
---
Your damage depends on how close you are to the enemy
---
Energy weapons still need sorting in the damage and anti armor departments. Also, do you have all the right perks equipped?
---
Holy shit this company is so shit. It is disgusting what the fuck.
---
They straight up lied to their fans.
---
They copied a whole game, didn't even bother to fix its bugs.
---
They refuse to upgrade their ancient engine.
---
AND STILL THERE IS PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT THEM.
---
This stupidity level is beyond my expectations.
---
anti armor is good because it ignores half of your targets armor, it doesnt directly add to the base damage of the weapon like explosive does but from what i‚Äôve heard explosive counters the effects of sentinel and cavalier as well so it‚Äôs a pretty powerful combination
---
Its automatic. So commando. 
---
Yeah but all 9 points?
---
People are saying its godly in pvp rn i dont see how tho lol
---
I did not know that about the helmet opening and closing. Good fact!
---
Nah respecing, also demolition expert dsnt wrk on explosive energies.
---
I even had an amusing PvP moment. I wasn't watching the leader board and must have hit the number 1 spot. Someone followed me through cranberry bog but then 3 scorched beasts started attacking them. I was able to snipe them and get on with my XP session. After that I actually started staying on the leader board for the added tension üòÄ
---
I suggest not getting your hopes up because this will never happen. Go to gta if you want to perform heists. They dont belong in fo76 at all. 
---
The only thing I agree with you on is that we need banks. Like, in our camp. Untouched. Completely safe. Your idea doesn't even sound that fun either. No thank you.
---
The explosive peek on eergies literally does nothing. Demolition expert dsnt even stack with it
---
Definitely debatable. 
---
And swimming in EverQuest. :)
---
Today I popped my cherry in survival. Not that I haven't died before and one time from players, but this time I killed another player.
---
I was sneaking through Summersville, killing super mutants for the pistol challenge. And then I heard some shooting around the corner. "It must be scorched", I thought to myself. But a level 23 player jumped on my side of the corner and started shooting at me. He did very little damage and I managed to stimpak myself while dodging bullets. And I decide that this time I will not run.
---
So an epic hit miss fest started I had no AP, since I was 100 pounds over limit and after 3 missed shots from my black powder pistol, switched to my trusty pipe revolver and to my surprise, killed the player in front from only one shot and he was only at 50%.
---
So my first kill was from a relatively equal stance, while shooting second. 
---
Unfortunately no as they weren't intended to exist lol. Any weapon will seem crap if it doesn't have the perks to buff it is your answer though. Commando is more about crits anyway and laser weapons fire rate is great for that.
---
He advertisers the fact, can you not read you fucking douch. 
---
Ooh sorry hard. It's someone's time of the month
---
no matter how much you play, if you dupe, you deserve to be banned
---
I don‚Äôt understand this concept of ‚Äúloyalty‚Äù to a game. If one is playing a game, surely it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre having fun; where does ‚Äúloyalty‚Äù come into it?

---
Oh I love the idea of having the radio host comment on current events! What a great way to find out which events are active just by listening to the radio! 
---
That‚Äôs because he was a duper. 
---
By now those playing the game are unlikely to stop playing over this even if they complain on Reddit.
---
Those that rage quite are long gone so I doubt BGS are that worried about effecting the gross user numbers.
---
Tweaking the game to encourage Atom store purchases is part of business, all businesses adapt and change to maintain a healthy bottom line. Apart from new sales of FO76, the Atom Store is the only source of income.
---
There is no "Heavy" or "Sturdy" version of Marine armor.  Its trying to compete with all the other armor types and fails.
---
Studded Heavy Leather will have almost twice the stats as marine armor.  Matter of fact, it beats them all.   Just have to repair it more often.
---
The plasma rifle is half ballistic, the Gatling plasma is all energy 
---
We absorb them through our skin
---
I agree with the caps limit: as a one-character player, hitting up Survival for extra exp or the weekly challenge is basically shitting all my caps out all over the place.
---
High-Level players are just moving targets for the duped-set-TSE-camp trolls, and it‚Äôs nothing short of rage-inducingly-infuriating 
---
If you get that achievement you don‚Äôt need atoms, you need a fucking intervention. 
---
AA Handmade with Tank Killer as a VATS-Rifleman 
---
Quad explosive harpoon gun is indoubtedly one of strongest and funniest weapons in game. With flechettes mod it also produces more ammo than it consumes. Its like the dragon but four shot and quick reload. Definitely must have for heavy gunners. Works awesomely as a sniper rifle for vats.
---
The ground is very grateful ü•≥ üéâ üéà 
---
I think it won‚Äôt scrap the mod, it‚Äôs just a visual warning for the paint.
---
I got it to appear at the one near the overseer camp.
---
lunch boxes
---
It appeared as a quest reward with the ammo. I guess I've been getting them instead of the paints by bad luck.
---
I love the way you write.
---
‚Äòit‚Äôs nothing short of rage-inducingly-infuriating‚Äô
---
So apt.
---
Same here. In fact none of the mire dailies work for me.
---
I'm pretty sure it is a West Tek experiment. Don't blame us for all.
---
Yup are getting confused with the Gatling Laser, or your sources lied.
---
Even using my bloodied super sledge, Scorch Beasts are mostly a waste of time, the loot is just laughably bad, I just eat the organs because they are tasty.
---
That's a good idea. I keep throwing molotovs and they sit there in mid air for a few seconds before detonating.
---
Wym?
---
Awww, c'mon, if we're going to have an on board voice for our PA, i for one vote for Liberty Prime. 
---
So there is no such thing as a bloodied pipe revolver... Yet. 
---
I was beleaguered when I found that you can still get camped out of train stations. What even is the point of ‚Äòsafe fast travel points‚Äô when you can just get TSE‚Äôd from outside them? Beta or not, Survival feels like it just pandered to those haxing there way to character #3/4/5, and the Apex-Fortnite-teabag-dance generation. 
---
The extra experience and guaranteed legendary is just absolute garbage bait to get the grifters away from casual players by giving them an unlimited sandbox of exploitation. 
---
#rantover
---
Bloodied super sledge after she lands, AA handmade before on spawns.
---
I got that too, and "Heart of the Enemy" and the one with the barrels in the Grafton Dam. Might be more, but these are the ones I noticed as bugged out for me. 
---
And so on with recipes, plans, etc. I believe is a BETA issue. The thing we did in the BETA doesn't really count toward the challenges afterward (?)
---
Laser rifle has always been under powered, fast breaking and in need of buffing.
---
The Gatling Laser, a heavy weapon, is favoured by many and has recently been buffed along with some other weapons.
---
Gauss, using VATS crits as much as I can.
---
Sorry I'm late to reply but I can confirm that you can just make a bunch of Level 15 hand mades to discover all the options. 
---
What peopme do in their spare time is non of my business, also i pkay with a few retired guys who pretty much just play fallout now and are over 1000 hours, so there are good enough reasons to play that long, especially over the course of a few years, but 20 atoms? Really, 20
---
Certainly made the adventure servers more enjoyable, seem to be so many more players now without the triple number level griefers making trouble.
---
If you take over any workshops, you can be flagged PVP at any time.
---
All the gotta do is
---
1) Find you on map
---
2) Fast Travel to your workshop and claim (flags you PVP)
---
3) Fast Travel to your location on map and 1 shot you
---
Nothing will help you at that point because you are flagged PVP.   Stay away from Workshops unless you want PVP.
---
I‚Äôve played a pretty terrifying number of hours myself since launch, and as you correctly point out, it‚Äôs nobody else‚Äôs business. On the other hand, Bethesda neither should nor should be seen as *encouraging* this with a non-trivial reward. 
---
Agreed. I‚Äôm just super salty that the PvP servers not only get exp+caps from PK, but also BONUS exp on top, along with a Pacifist option that doesn‚Äôt work. Like, how much more poorly could they have slapped it together?
---
I‚Äôm thoroughly convinced these ideas are just shat out with little to no QA tests done at all. Either that, or nobody in the office ever tries to think along the lines of toxicity, period.
---
Congrats!
---
I solo-cleared an entire silo, got to the launch control, and couldn‚Äôt figure out the code stuff. 
---
Looked online, found a code, and the code was incorrect.
---
Right then a LVL 100+ player came in and I had to step aside so that they could launch the silo.
---
I felt stupid. 
---
I guess I need to research it more.
---
I ran 76 to Point Pleasant, up to the lumber mill. Two runs at about 20 minutes, I have 140/150
---
I can't speak on the hermit crabs but the monongahela river was actually found to have tiny shrimp in it, so crawlers are completely viable.
---
It it‚Äôs a really good one I may attempt to bazaar it, Otherwise I drop most of that stuff at a station of a vendor. 
---
It can sometimes feel like you've got all the ones possible by scrapping even when you haven't because of the way scrapping works. If you take the table u/MatchesMalone89 posted; as i understand it, the game essentially rolls against part of a similar table, including the mods you already know. So if it hits a mod you already have 15 times in a row or w/e, no mod learned. 
---
Definitely getting the fire breathers skin 
---
Up voting for the flawless Steve Irwin reference 
---
But didn‚Äôt they say it would be customizable? 
---
Well that pretty much sums up why some players wanted to have this additional danger even for their PvE encounters. Amount of fun, thrill, and cautiousness necessary to survive is amazing.
---
Plus, it's level 40. A Max level will do more damage. Recently, people started to sell the explosive versions of these guns at a very high cost for no reason,,mainly because the explosive effect isn't available anymore, but it doesn't mean the guns were good.. mainly an expensive novelty.

Hey, if you are on PC then I'm interested in buying it and I might pay you very decently, contact me privately if interested, I'm a quad collector so you'll be able to rip me off

Hold on , you‚Äôre upset that a pvp server gives bonuses for pvp and they are giving increased xp in a BETA?
---
Yeah. The disconnect or game crash is bad enough. Loosing all beneficial effects is salt in the wound.
---
Level 55 here. Hit me up: Gaffythegrey
---
SERIOUSLY!!!! I thought i was the only one that thought this was nutty. Thank you OP. Lol
---
I agree with the hermit crabs but I think the fog crawlers fit in just fine 
---
I can sing all the radio songs.
---
If you blow them up or got a piece of the action with the aoe of an explosive bullet, yes.  Kinda like tagging enemies for loot.  If a player tries to kill you indirectly by gunning at all the cars around you, you take no damage.
---
LOL
---
I do get your point but certain things in game specifically the brotherhood paints make no sense , whenever you encounter  dead BoS  in power armor at BoS areas like fort defiance etc.. They are in t-51b yet the BoS paints are for t-60 which I've never seen any wear in WV.
---
It would be been logical to make the paint accessible to t-51b and t-45 aswel as t-60 
---
Lml the lvl 40 version does same dmg as 50 version.
---
Go do the mission at the tea cup next to charleston station. Lots of ants will pop up
---
Last night I was preparing to fast travel back to my CAMP. I ate a deathclaw steak, drank vodka and used a bobblehead of strength. Then the game crashed and I restarted it. No effects left. No meat increasing str left. No bobblehead left. I had to walk back instead. Not a fun situation!
---
Harpers ferry and both watoga vendors have it as part of their inventory but only sometimes you might have to server hop. I rarely find players with it for sale but if you do it could save some caps, also they're kinda buggy when snapped together the neon letters don't stay in a line and try to hover off the surface you place them on. 
---
For a discounted price, like 20-25 bucks, its worth it. The reason its not worth more, because its still an early acces game and will be for a while. Missing basic features, unpolished systems, tons of bugs, server issues.

Yea that‚Äôs what I mean I 100% agree wi5 that 
---
It‚Äôs a bug with the game displaying where the nuke actually is.  I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs actually been nuked before, but I‚Äôve never seen it actually done.  I would say if you see that area nuked 99% of the time if you wait a couple minutes the map will update and show you where the nuke zone actually is. 
---
Just curious - I've got prepared 3 gatlings for SBQ fight - TSE, AA and Zealot Explosive - which one to mod with Prime receiver and use for SBQ to do significant damage? Right now I smashing her with Bloodied/SS/STR supersledge (that does around 1250 with full unyielding, melee booble and some meat (glowing steak) and more than 2k with adrenaline 5\*, but I'd like to use some big guns build.
---
Hot 
---
nice find 
---
What end game content do you want? I swear people want a game they can play for the rest of their lives for 50$
---
Actuallt you dont see the faults within your proposed solution that developers do. The max-cap of damage output would only favor high RoF and multiple-projectiles weapon even more.
---
Sneaky snipers are currently the meta but most of them concentrate around using one-two shots from an automatic weapon. The reason for that is how often they are able to crit for vats-range combat, how often they stagger for vats-range combat vs invisible enemies, and how quickly it eats through dodgy for distances longer than vats. On proper build, I'll sell you 2 crit shots to head in a second if in vats range. No match for that.
---
I play unyielding bloodied sneaky sniper build and I need to unload caps to alts every two-three days because I get full and the profits would go to waste. I should be nerfed. Critical hits from automatic weapons should continue to pierce through various damage reduction effects, but should not get the basic x2 damage bonus, and do 1.5x damage with better criticals. I'm strong enough without vats to eat people. I'd like cavalier and sentinel non-sneaky builds to regain viability because my first character is cavalier and its useless now, he was so strong that he made assassin-sentinels useless himself but he's no match for my sneaky sniper and sneaky snipers of my enemies. I should be able to eat through sentinels HP with a regular magazine. Now I can take four such guys in one magazine.
---
What platform you on? I believe you can just drink a ready made version of it. If so I'm on XB1 and can give you one. 
---
Didn't play the beta, only have 1 Charakter.
---
Same issue.
---
I tried to do the daily challenge to drink a rad ant lager and kill 5 ants under its effect. First, i still dont have the recipe, so I did a 'looking for group' for buying the rad ant lager.
---
When I finally found a player which had the recipe and was able to produce and sell to me, i bought 15 just to be sure.
---
Then i went to Appalachia Antiques, which in my opinion is the only good spot for ants spawn. Giant teapot event spawned only 1 ant once, the substation north of watoga has only death ants killed by the deatclaw, the investigator cabin sometimes has ants.
---
I managed to get a spawn in appalachia antiques every 15 server hops, Ive been able to kill 4 out of five, so i failed the daily cos i ran out of time.
---
But as you said, in appalachia antiques most of the times they were glowing ants. I remember investigator cabin had a few normal ants.
---
So yeah, these alcohol challenges/quests are a pain in the butt sometimes... hope they change them cos Im starting to think to become a alcoholic in real life too.
---
I just love the atmosphere in the mire.

It's by far my favorite area in this game.

I think it's not a bad idea, but I hope it will be those 2 only. PA is expensive to maintain so it's a welcomed bonus, but if it shares legendary effects with regular armor it will make it pointless.
---
No because it's complete bullshit.
---
So, here we are. How'd your love for Fallout 76 go? Love it?
---
Wait there are mods for the single action beyond the ivory grip??? 
---
The location discovery one definitely seems to be bugged for me too, both old and new account for Grafton Dam.
---
From my experience the "Kill X" Challenges seem to want you to land the killing blow rather than just being involved in the damage dealing. Kind of lame considering several people will be fighting the SBQ and only 1 player will get the challenge completed.
---
Don't repair your crops. Scrap them. It gives you one veg/fruit/etc. and one fertilizer. Then just replant it.
---
 I do them for 100 caps. I‚Äôll message you, no one should have to buy them from the enclave.
---
I had this issue when I first installed the game back at the start of beta. Verifying files caused a small repair download which fixed it for me, hopefully it will do the same for you. 
---
:-O Say whaaat?
---
The marine armor plans can spawn on the shelf next to the fridge in the barracks.  Near where all the scorched spawn.  
---
It seems it can be marine armor, under armor, or robot armor Plans.  
---
Add me on PSN at radiationdaddy - I‚Äôm just getting online, will be a few minutes but I‚Äôd love to start the day off with a bang! 
---
Thats the key for the New river gorge bridge - east. Not TNT dome 2. 
---
Thanks, my fo name is AirborneDawn345
---
Appalachian Antiques in Cranberry bog - there are 3-4 possible spawns - ants or ants+bloodbugs, scorched and ghouls. I go there when I need ants. Also there is Thunder Mountain Substation M-02 a little bit north-east, where always is a deathclaw fighting ants - kill ants first (when you get exp, also the ant meat spawns for you - if not, you'll only get glowing meat).
---
Damn 100? I‚Äôll buy a couple but won‚Äôt be on until like 4 EST due to work. GT is same as Reddit name
---
Its a powerbuilders dream with ridiculously thrilling PvP (if u git gud first), state-of-the-art exploration and environmental storytelling. Wondrous mess that allows you to place a trap against indestructibe structure, then hit it with an appropriate weapon while low health to force the game to calculate ridiculous amounts of forces and kick you flying into the air, so you would get a amazing 4 second window of opportunity to shoot people midair and get yourself called a hacker. Its a tool to express your creativity against creativity of other people. People may call it broken piece of shit for all I care, this is the best game ever taking their steps from mud and dirt to the throne of thrilling gameplay.
---
When they released it, it was halfway between catering to casuals and to hardcore gamers. Now they gave us two different modes and the main lackluster aspects of gameplay became irrelevant as now simply getting your junk back to safe spot is ALWAYS a risky logistical challenge.
---
I play apex. I think I'm good but I'm not a regular champion. Encounters in Apex are thrilling, but then the game gets rather stagnant, and if you screw up you can't try to have your revange. The continous thrill barely lasts for more than three minutes before the smoke clears and the game returns to loot'n'sneak phase. When I fight in Fallout, I get to have this thrill for 40 continous minutes at which point I need to have a break because my hands are trembling. This game is a tool to express the creativity and tactical superiority, and the reason to play it is that there is always one russian guy thats stronger than you that you just have to take down.
---
Ty! And don't feel stupid, it is confusing lol. I did it as you're meant to, but in future I'll just be checking online to save time and keycards.
---
What happened to you was my biggest fear, that I'd do all the work and a higher level would just walk in and launch. During the last phase I was like c'mon c'mon. When I got to enter the code I was like oh yeah baby lol. Didnt even really take it in cause I was too excited the whole run. Next time I'll enjoy what I missed in the blur üòÇ
---
Ill add you but prob wont do it yet as i dont even have any stimpack atm lol i want to be able to not be a giant burden xD
---
Sent you a message too 
---
All backpack designs should have the same benefit, I don't want to use some shitty looking backpack because the Vault-Tec one doesn't have as much carry weight.
---
Yep it‚Äôs crazy Caps in the Enclave and doesn‚Äôt even make sense. The price of the Recipes are more then what you can have on you for Caps! They definitely screwed up there big time. 
---
Specifically it's at  Mount Blair Train Yard.
---
And i belive you should buff your Intelligence if it's low, right?
---
I just got it like last month and am having a blast. Honestly its better now that most of the major kinks have been patched out anyways and i see a lot or people playing :)
---
Hey, I can give you some if you‚Äôd like! I always help out my teammates if I can :)
---
I think it is intentional. A way to punish people for server hopping  
---
Hey man, ain't no free meals from Bethesda.
---
Alright then lol I really appreciate it. I love soloing but i just dont have it in me again lmao i need teammates lol
---
sell or just give them away to low player that will have a better use than me.
---
I've often wondered this myself. Everyone has been saying how it's thr best armor in the game, and I could never figure out why. What was I missing that they weren't? Was there some secret to making it protect me better than my metal armor that I just don't know?. I tried looking at perks and everything and just could not find anything that made it so much better. I got a full suit (minus the helmet), and have held onto to it in hopes I coukd upgrade it better than I am able to now, thinking maybe that's what I'm missing, but with not it not being a common loot dropped by anything, I can't scrap anything to learn any upgrades for it, unless I make it myself and scrap it (assuming that even works). So what's the big deal with it? Seemingly nothing from what y'all are saying. So now my next decision is whether to keep what I have or sell it.
---
What a waste of life playing 7600 hours of Fallout 76.
---
I have the psn app on my phone so if you wanna shoot me a message when you wanna tackle it ill be there!
---
just like the gulper it uses it looks like a deathclaw because it uses its animations and bones (bones for model rigging not actual bones)
---
I like you
---
Thanks Snoop, really interesting. I suppose we will never know for sure, there are loads of permeation's it could be, all obfuscated behind RNG. 
---
 Between how much techdata I've submitted and how many underamour you've dropped, I dunno, makes my hurt thinking about it.  
---
I guess it‚Äôll help discourage server hopping if vending machines are only for your server while your online
---
Now more than ever.
---
Bugs are getting ironed out (sometimes they come back though or new ones get added, it is Bethesda after all), and new content was introduced and there is a shit ton more to come in the next months. They released a road map for the end of the year with lots of additions, new quests, new mechanics and whatnots.
---
Go for it.
---
I love it and the A frame down the road. 
---
Wait that was a thing?  I always remember walking around getting cat meat stew and wondering why. Thought it was an hourly thing. 
---
I shit out ghouls like you for breakfast
---
Short answer: Yes
---
Long answer: The player-base is well-alive and friendly.  I made a second character a few weeks back as a fresh start and I've been having a ton of fun playing both solo and with strangers/new friends. The bug fixing and balancing over the months has made the experience better, too.
---
The initial bad reception from Fallout 76 has resulted in retail outlets dropping the price as well, so IMO you should just go for it and see for yourself :)
---
How about you just leave instead of assulting every one who enjoys a video game get a grip fool 
---
errr..... I just checked the image I posted of my rewards -  
---
https://imgur.com/a/sT35DY6  
---
It appears I have dropped it at somepoint, must of been before I started tracking data. Holy shit. 
---
thanks yeah i look for player trading it
---
so, just becuase you got rocked in PvP, doesnt mean we all have to adjust to your wishes. learn, adjust, and move forward. 
---
When challenges require you to capture workshops I usually log off as soon as that challenge fulfillment shows. Good work Bethesda. I guess that's how you wanted it.
---
So much overreaction to this lol 
---
its term from D&amp;D  referring to players who just wander around murdering things and not RPing often times derailing the experience for other players
---
We were talking about changing camps up from week to week. We'll get more information out in the next couple days as to when and where the next one will be and yes this is a great suggestion that we probably could implement in the next couple weeks! 
---
That's resistant lining, not shielded. I think you just buy resistant from one of the vendors, and shielded is only obtainable from tech data once you've learned all the linings besides shielded. Must be why it didnt drop for you.
---
Other than the ivory grip which doesn't even apply properly (not shown when inspected), there is a Prime Reciever for Single Action Revolver and that's about it. .44 Pistol and Western Revolver have a plenty.
---
Yeah, people are always super surprised to hear this. It's true.
---
I had to afk for a minute and left my guy playing the bass in the speak easy and when I got back to my computer someone was playing the piano and another player was on the drums. Love shit like this! 
---
But they would die from not watching their starvation and hydration bars
---
Buy it cheap
---
Got the game for 25 euro as a live code. People are selling the game second hand for 10 to 20 euro.
---
lol. Thanks for letting me know. Have an awesome day! :-D
---
The clouds have parted.  And revealed another layer. So, I am going to go out on a limb here, with zero data and guess that you have a better chance of dropping paint if you have not learned the vendor Sold BOS Lining.  
---
Sketchy data seems to indicate this :)
---
I still enjoy it although the end game can be a little bit of a grind and repeat process... I think it plays fine as a single player game, the story might not be as robust as the others but that's a trade off when you're running across Appalachia and someone else runs across your screen. I'll never forget that first moment.
---
The terrain is really cool if you're interested in building a CAMP. I have high hopes for where the game is going, that's for sure. My biggest advice is don't fall in the trap of trying to build the perfect "online" player who hits the hardest or has the best stats etc... Just log in and play to have fun.
---
I guess i kinda assumed this was how backpacks were going to be implemented. Everything else you equip is based off of your character build, so I assumed the backpack system would be similar
---
Was it an issue of Naughty Vault Dwellers?
---
The more I think of this, it makes sense, adding Underarmor plans to the loot table the less chance you have of other items.......
---
That is true. The only thing I dont like, and probably most of the players, to spend money on another dlc (I mean any other game now as fo76 dlc are free at this moment). Why I should invest more money on this same game when I already spend like ¬£60 to buy it. Its not a little amount of money for a game these days. 
---
Your outrage over nothing and your just makeing up extremes that don‚Äôt exist also no company cares about you there not and never was your friends 
---
Your attitude is the bane of emergency departments everywhere.
---
I won‚Äôt leave as that‚Äôs a stupid overreaction to a non problem 
---
Where do you see values for items on the free market?
---
100 caps? N 3 1 L 5 0 N üëãüòÅ
---
This would be fantastic. You can also put a recon scope on a 44 and make it something with a weight to rival a rifle.
---
I'm on PC and used to claim workshops often. After having been one-shotted a few times I've stopped to do that. I used to claim them and set them up for others to enjoy with free water, resourses and workbenches for all to use.
---
Four times I've had my CAMP attacked and it's been located in the very south of Whitesprings, far from the clubhouse, for a good while now. A few times I spoken to the griefers and I have gotten predjudice about nationalities of players. Yes, I'm in Europe.
---
I played right from the private beta and can say for certain this game has improved so so sooo much since launch. 
---
Does that mean there are no issues still? No.
---
Have 95% of the issues been fixed? Maybe like 82%.
---
Honest opinion? I left the game about a month after release because it was broken and unplayable, however I gave it a shot again last week and have been playing non-stop since then.
---
If you enjoy the Fallout world, survival style games and can put up with the few bugs that remain.. then yes, I'd say go ahead and buy it.
---
the only location i know that it‚Äôs at is the Pleasant Valley Ski Resort Vendor
---
Many dislikes for you man, because you don't name authors. It's screens made on Russian discord F76 HUB by  Garust and Farget. And we got proof of it. 
---
This would be fantastic (ability to see and ability to determine not to look at it)
---
Alternately - add a combat log tab in the pipboy we can scroll through. I'd also like to be able to see how much damage is coming in to me.
---
I suspect the PC folks can / already have a mod for it.
---
There is perks for that. Also making macro using food and water every couple of hours is not very hard
---
Yes, it exists, I sold one 3 days ago for 10k (turns out I've already knew it). I didn't looted it though, traded it.
---
It could be vastly improved by only initializing PvP if you as owner actually return to the workshop to defend it. Treat claiming of an owned workshop as slap damage and only if the owner return to within the area of the workshop has he accepted the PvP fight.
---
Explosives expert or medic backpacks that give perks for the thing they‚Äôre associated with, like 10% explosive damage increase, or reduced weight on chems. 
---
They still exist.  I found them the other day.  They are just very rare and are not sold by vendors any more.  
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b7tqcs/for_the_first_time_since_the_vendor_plan_update_i/
---
I have one only because I bought it off of someone. Legendary pistols in general just seem to be rare outside of maybe black powder pistols.  Those are the only ones I found multiple times.
---
Or, depending on if short on junk or caps, moving the camp repairs everything for free. 
---
Hey it looks like the under-armor does not drop unless you have learned the other BOS ones sold at the vendor. 
---
 This means, once you've learned them, another loot enters the table, making paint less likely to drop. :(  
---
 It appears that through a fluke my search has been easier. I'm going to have to edit the post....again.
---
Had forgotten about the prime yes. 'oticed the bug too. Thanks! 
---
One flaw; commies don‚Äôt have any food
---
I'd love to see that set have the best unarmed damage. It's weak, but if the damage output wasn't horrible there's at least be a use (maybe only on emergency protocols / etc. but something)
---
Some of the backpacks have leaked via dev room. It sounds like some of them will have features beyond carry weight. 
---
I saw this just yesterday, took a screenshot to report as a bug. 
---
Sorry, what does this mean?
---
Thanks, I have to say I am underwhelmed though.
---
I've seen sub membership on fo76 rise lately so that's a decent indicator. I love it but it's not for everyone. 
---
Yep, this and Appalachia Antiques worked for me
---
Thunder Mountain Substation TM-02, couple of seconds sprinting north of Watoga. 100% spawn-rate (at least in my experience) of 3-4 rad ants and 1 deathclaw, they always fight though so you gotta be quick to rid the place of the deathclaw first.
---
Same here.
---
No Mire dailies will trigger for me. Experieced this with four different accounts as well.
---
I can do them once, that's it.
---
I can get more or less consistently some Forest ones (mainly Ecological Balance and Tea Time), Ash Heap (the Camden Park ones most of the times unless they decide they won't), Savage Divide only the Pumpkin Carving one that I can think of and Toxic Valley (most commonly the Hemlock Cook one or Target Rich Environment, less often the huntmaster one and very rarely the barrrel one).
---
I can also often but not always trigger Cop a Squatter in Watoga Medical Centre. When I manage to trigger it about 30% of the time I cannot complete it either because the target mobs are just not there, or they have spawned inside a collision in such fashion that not even explosive weapons will hit them or because the game just doesn't feel like it.
---
I'm lvl 122 and I see this plans all the time for sale 
---
Negative. No vendors sells those anymore. I check every vendor recently just to rule that out.
---
T51 is best at kinetic DR, which is the most common damage in the game.  Ultracite is even resistance across all three categories, kinetic, energy, and radiation. 
---
Yes I'm sure both came with it attached I'm not saying I put it on the game did it for me... Maybe a glitch on their part
---
I can confirm this, next time they should use watermarks... 
---
 Yea, shame helmets are all cosmetic. 
---
There is one Helmet - Marine Armor Helmet that has DR - with high INT you can make it \~20 DR. I can make you one, you scrap it and 100% learn the plan to make yourself more.
---
Where did you find it? Was it a drop or a spawn location?
---
Yeah that's a stupid Challenge, just like the "play for 7600 hours" shit. I bet the reward is 20 atoms as well. Just poor choices
---
Are those real skins coming or mods?
---
I want this, the greenhouse building set from FO4 and a concrete bunker building set. Ideally with matching roofs for the last two (I like using greenhouse roof pieces as skylights).
---
In my experience, he usually runs from workshop to workshop! I catch him most often at the Munitions Factory up north above the Red Rocket Mega Stop, or near Sunshine Tidings (I believe that‚Äôs the name) - the little workshop in the forest that has a food processor. 
---
PS. Don‚Äôt forget to include what system you‚Äôre playing on, buddy!
---
You on Xbox and if so did you catch his GT? I tend to be a judge jury and executioner to lhigh levels praying on low levels who are trying to lvl with the 2x xp
---
I too confirm this information! Fallout 76 HUB - best russian discord server. =D
---
I've had this happen too. I have a little bar south of Morgantown and have been gifted decease cures and my first legendary weapon on that character, back when at lvl 30. It was a shotgun I still use at lvl 51. Several people have bought beers and bourbon I have offered for a few caps. It's been fun to have visitors when I've been at the camp.
---
My bad, didn‚Äôt realize they apparently disappeared from an update. I‚Äôm too low of a level to clear that place out myself so was only able to check it out one time. 
---
https://amp-reddit-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/amp.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aqxhnp/bos_combat_armor_plans/?amp_js_v=0.1&amp;usqp=mq331AQECAEoAQ%3D%3D
---
It‚Äôs a known issue apparently. 
---
I got it a few weeks ago full price (so my friend who‚Äôs using my Home Xbox could use it as well). 0 regrets, loved every second of it. Screw sheep reviews and ratings, most people that posted reviews either played during the buggy launch or just hopped on the hate train.
---
What are those things?
---
good point! And good tips, thank you for that :) (I'll edit post right away).
---
You what do I do with the 99% of legendaries I find? Overseers stash if the reason is it‚Äôs low level or if it‚Äôs trash I‚Äôll sell or put in a suitcase at any of the train stations 
---
I think they saw bullets flying about the repair kits and popped a stealth boy. Can't blame them. I'm pretty confident community managers aren't involved in monetization strategy descisions. They're just the unlucky bastards that will take the the verbal abuse from the... Wait for it... Fallout of those decisions.
---
Many of them are bugged, I love the game and I‚Äôve been playing since lunch. But it does make me feel like ‚Äòthey can‚Äôt even get some simple challenges right‚Äô
---
You could get really complex with a bunch of effects
---
* Carry Capacity obviously
---
* Weight %'s of certain item categories (Aid, Food, Weapons, Armor, etc)
---
* AP Regen, drain rate for sprinting, etc
---
* Run speed
---
* Food spoilage
---
Basically they could mix and match positives and negatives, balance out things like the one with the most storage capacity decreases run speed and hurts AP usage, then some are more moderate with no negatives, or have very specialized uses.
---
Of course! :) And check on r/market76 - sometimes people post when they find him so others can get what they need from him as well!
---
Well first obstacle is platform.  I‚Äôm on PC.  So if that‚Äôs not a problem, I have Caps, TSEs, random 2 shots, and some AA weapons :)
---
How?  Weight has nothing to do with those today.
---
Butchers Bounty perk, 3 points in Perception  
---
Press the additional 'search' button for 40/60/80% chance of finding extra meat  
---
Even works on already-dead corpses  
---
Helps a ton for getting extra ant meat to make more ant lager  
---
I usually server hop Thunder Mountain Substation and try to grab 2 or 3 ants per hop. Gotta be quick to get in there before the Deathclaw kills them all though. Explosives might help here if you've got any handy for AE tag damage
---
Have you tried moving your camp to a different location? That may or may not help.
---
It appears that Bethesda has at least 3 titles to announce at E3, I have high doubts it has anything to do with Fallout but it‚Äôs a heads up just in case
---
Every detail is in my linked post.  
---
You can try reinstalling.
---
What was the fb group called again?
---
Eso DLC, es6 and the ship game.
---
I've got instigating, anti armour and quad .44 revolvers. Three different guns the, but all three on one would be great
---
People probably say that because there's a loading screen that says something similar "Marine armor is second only to power armor in protection". It's not, it just has decent rad resist - I'd go with something else.
---
They did have issues with 21x9 ratio, it was patched then botched then supposedly patched again
---
Ah thanks
---
Hey uh, occasionally some friends and I will do a silo run and launch at whitesprings or SBQ.. any interest?
---
I went for a assultron with robobrain noodle arms and axes. my friend made a robot he called herbert that was a robobrain torso and protectron legs once he got to nuka world he gave him one arm with the mascot hand "for slapping"
---
Has Bethesda responded to this outrage anywhere?
---
He is conspicuous by his absence given his position in the company.
---
I hope that there is nothing nefarious going on, despite FO76 having its fair share of ups and downs I do not want wish him personally any ill.
---
I've had this issue since at least the brewing patch. I'm on PS4 if that helps.  
---
I switch between combat rifle and shotgun a lot, so suddenly using fists can be a surprise. I can get it back via the favorites wheel but in an emergency I'm pretty slow at getting the right thing from the wheel, damn you lack of keyboard shortcuts!
---
This was a route map that someone was working on. Maybe this will help.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9vxi2c/grahms\_route\_now\_with\_20\_more\_pixels\_and\_half\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9vxi2c/grahms_route_now_with_20_more_pixels_and_half_the/) 
---
He tends to walk by workshops, and will stop in his tracks at night.
---
Beats them all in **total** stars maybe, but Metal will always give more ballistic resistance, for example
---
Because fallout 76 has lore a little screwy with Armor.
---
In fallout 4,  Marine armor was the best. Its severely lacking in 76. 
---
The loading screen help says it "the best" XD
---
Yep, several times. I tried Harpers Ferry, Berkeley Springs, near Thunder Mountain but on the opposite side, near Tree Tops and so on....nothing ever changed
---
Hahaha, that‚Äôs great.
---
My base at Solomon's Pond (in the hills to the east of Whitesprings) used to get blasted by Scorchbeasts pretty frequently. One day three turned up and a I gave up and left. In most camps I've had, I'm only attacked when I spawn in my base or fast travel there. 
---
That PipBoy looks like the back of a burned-out hippy's Prius
---
The fact that Master Lockpicking/Hacking can only open 1 level of difficulty is damned ridiculous.
---
There should be tiers.
---
Base is 1 level.  Expert is 2.  Master is 3.
---
They should have been level locked at every 5 levels but they should ***absolutely*** have tiers instead of the completely asinine way they work now.
---
Yeah i guess your right, its in the same legues as the people who spend 20 years at a job and get rewarded with a pen
---
What does that mean?
---
Yeah not me. I‚Äôve got 356mbps, I have the same number of crashes before I upgraded from 60mbps.  Connection is always stable to the provider. 
---
Should be up here shortly. Also, a few pictures of my camp. Since posting this I've had a FEW scorched and mutants (both low level) come along as well as some wolves, but that has been rare and only when I was in camp working on stuff.

I have a suspicion that such design choice is done on purpose. Perhaps in the later updates they will do something with the perk cards that will change the way we use them in some way.
---
heh yeah I've ran from V76 now through Point Pleasant, past the Nuka Cola factory, and almost at McClintock now. Nothing so far :P But hey I didn't know about the night-thing, thanks for the tip!
---
I've seen Graham at the Top of the World, which isn't part of one of the mapped routes shown on the map. I think he wanders everywhere.
---
They're in many garages in FO4, I think they were used as car lifts back then. Civilians wouldn't have power armour and so commercial garages wouldn't make them the centerpiece of their workspace
---
The point is, it's not really worth the effort. I don't care about getting the stew, but I used to do the event every time because it was a pleasant surprise for the sever.
---
This is how it‚Äôs started in every game. Even if it‚Äôs not ‚Äúthat big of a deal‚Äù the next time they do a new pay to win it‚Äôll be ‚Äúit‚Äôs not that much worse than repair kits‚Äù.. etc.. etc..
---
This is not my video but holy hell:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq65FVjZsWg
---
someone data mined some of the info and saw some backpack mod names they are - Default / high capacity / armored / refrigerated / insulated 
---
they also had 2 flair slots and a material slot (human skulls sloth toys teddy bears a lantern ect) 
---
I feel with time we will see more of them but several of them look interesting already as I'm wondering if the fridge version will stack with good with salt or if it just keeps everything perma good to begin with and I'm interested in armored and how much armor do I get for it 
---
I've got no further suggestions for you my dude, sorry I couldn't help.
---
I've had ants up at the Pleasant Valley Ski Resort. Not often though.
---
They‚Äôll make the best one in the atom shop who tf are we kidding? BGS has went all out greed mode for this game 
---
Yeah, you have to dig it out of your friends. I suggest a Crazy Straw.
---
Apparently we sell legendaries for points, and are able to buy either a weekly and/or daily legendary. 
---
It would be nice though if we could buy specific legendary effects to have on our weapons of choice.
---
I agree....i checked yesterday to see if regular items had empty star slots...they dont.
---
I'm almost afraid to ask this, can you confirm you have dropped any paint? Because I got an awful feeling....
---
If you‚Äôre in the mire you can hit Big B‚Äôs or Sunnytop station for a stash.
---
i think it basically just splits the damage in 4 and just kills the accuracy so it kinda becomes like a shotgun but it really just becomes trash, i‚Äôve never ever found that mod useful in any situation because the accuracy becomes so terrible
---
Yeah add me! Anyway to make a trip through a silo and launch my own for the first time would be great lol
---
Plus good exp even after i complete it anyways lol  
---
Quick question, have you learned all the BOS Underarmor plans? 
---
I don't think it increases the damage. I think it reduces the range but increases the spread. But stand to be corrected.
---
I feel offendes that my "carry everything" policy is boring to you, i like carrying 30 weapons and ungodly amounts of everything else
---
Yep same issue here. Got 3 "discover locations" challenges bugged in the mire, cranberry bog and toxic valley. Also SBQ and megasloth kills do not count. And while we are at it can i get rid of oversser's holotoapes and quest pls? And do something about "kill wendigo" quest that keeps popping up too. Pretty please =) Somehow these are the small things that annoy me the most in this game.
---
That would make it pretty useless but I guess it makes it but more things with a lot less damage
---
Quick question, have you learned all the BOS Underarmor plans? Have you dropped the BOS shielded underarmour plans from tech data?
---
I am rather curious how many player encounters on Survival are aggressive and how many are friendly. Sounds silly and all, but this is exactly the kind of game and community where folks might play nice on survival just for the hell of it.
---
Queen of the hunt never activates for me either :(
---
Yeah that sounds like a gun that would break after a few kills 
---
Since it is the worst armour in terms of protection (T60 has double the armour in torso comparison alone) it should have a little extra in regards to combat performance. The extra mining rewards (that I can't get to work properly) is not combat and while the carry weight is good, it lacks in combat protection
---
1. There are specific perks for specific types of weapons that reduce breakage - i.e. Makeshift Warrior for melee (I apologize I can't remember the gun ones, but they're there).
---
2. IIRC yes, I rarely have to repair x-01 tbh and don't have it. I could be wrong on this one, it may just make it cheaper to repair.
---
3. Yes, get incisor and martial artist first for any melee weapons, diversify.
---
1,2,3 vendor fodder.
---
Just to clarify. This is not my first character. I have a lvl 130, 55 and 61. All of them I used for adventure mode and was getting quite bored of the game. I figured survival would be full of grieving and trolling so I didn't much look forward to it. But it's pretty great and look forward to the future!
---
Yes. But still, its not fun at all losing 500 caps as lvl 200 against someone who suddenly got 50. It should be the same, because of the same powerlvl. Thats why i play a new character only for this new gamemode that seperates the whole community. Its fun to play without any caps and meds and a extra challenge, but still the whole gamemode wouldn't be necessary if Beth just implement it into the normal game with simple restrictions. Something like: Faction Pvp. Would fit better into the world and players still do something together.
---
And the one or Grafton

It's so hard to resist... On mobile, it's money hand over fist.

Never let them convince you your device is an arcade cabinet.

gun gattli, main receiver
---
9,000  ultracite munition
---
is the most efficient, reaching almost 400 damage with the adrenaline bonus
---
Like passive! :)
---
Crash 
---
I agree with him, if it's everytime - reinstall.
---
hey man, ty for the fast respone! i think ill keep them for a next char.
---
It would be way more funnier of that one who is doing the event, needs to bring those stews to actually players and trade it with em.
---
Fair enough, but I was playing with friends and their games crashed and I laughed at them cause it hasnt happened in a long time for me (knock on wood)
---
Yea noticed that aswell ... only Daily quest that ever pops is the Air/Water/Soil Testing, and Jack with the Pumpkins
---
(oh and biv works)
---
Most of the encounters I've had were hostile. But I've met a few good people out there. Play cautious and trust no one but if someone needs help give them a hand and a friendly wave. I'm pretty sure after the initial rush all the people who are there only to kill low leveled characters will get bored and leave, leaving a good mix of aggressive and friendly players.

---
But you can upgrade a regular gun into scorched killer/zealots, Making it legendary.  Or no?
---
Due to design cards unlock at a single level, this was the easiest way to level lock the different tiers even though it is janky and frustrating on the user end.
---
Just keep making level 15's and scrapping them. You'll unlock everything eventually. There's also a freebee that spawns in a shelf, in a shack on one of the rooftops in Berkley springs.
---
I do really wish they would add an (All Mods Unlocked) thing next to the gun you're about to build if you've got them.
---
 I have also thought the timing of these along with the new dungeons was odd, almost like they don't plan to put workbenches in them. This then makes you need to "buy" a few basic repair kits so you can repair  your gear without needing to leave the current instance your in. If they really are steering the game to make you need to have to have a few of  these kits on you to complete a dungeon then that makes it P2W in my opinion. Other option would be to carry extra gear but would limit what  other loot you can gather.
---
I could be wrong but I have played a few other games where they add little things like this and then release a "new feature/quest" where if you don't have that new item it becomes harder to complete. I think BGS's sales are really hurting and they need  more micro-transactions. The atomic shop items are just plain goofy at  times and I doubt they are selling as much as they planned. I also think  that's why a lot of the daily and weekly challenges have just become  more tedious for a menial amount of atoms. They can't afford to give away as many free atoms if they need people to pay real money. So now that have to jump into the P2W area to recoup lost sales. 
---
They nerfed White Night so "we did not feel it was required to have at all times", the changed other perk cards to supposedly bring them more in line with others (not talking about the TSE nerfs). Then they change the rate at which weapons and armor break down and the cost to repair them. Don't forget the Ballistic Fabric change and the amount needed for armor. Take all of this and now the introduction of repair kits in the Atomic Shop or from "certain quests", and it sure feels like this was in the works for a long time. I don't think this was really just a "Hey we say this online and think its a good idea", I think this was in the works for awhile. When we see what other "Utility Items" they release in the Atomic Shop, I feel it may become more evident that they are causing the game to be more grindy to steer us into spending money for these convenience items.
---
Again just a theory 
---
I'm about level 30 now in Survival with my new character and I've had quite a bit of fun after around level 20 fighting others within that range. I'm literally playing a raider (camp near top of the world, only using raider/trapper armor and leather rags underarmor) and I got in a 1v3 vs 2 Responder Cop uniform people and a vault dweller around Morgantown. We all had a good back and fourth between each other and nobody was getting 1 shot at all from legendaries or 10 different mutations XD. It felt like some legit faction warfare, even if it was just 1 raider vs 2 responders helping a guy fresh out of the vault. With some more damage and balance tweaking with an actual faction system survival could be amazing.
---
Got a fusion generator at your camp? You are more likely to be attacked the more power you camp generates. I have camps with zero power and they never get attacked. Camps with fusion generators, well I'm likely to get SB, mutants, scorched etc.
---
Pay to win? relay?
---
Stuff dosnt even break fast enough to consider this pay to win...
---
but yea cry in your basement about how bad Bethesda is and circlejerk about obsidian as much as you want.
---
You could just ignore it
---
I hunt these plans everyday. People seem to find them anywhere and nowhere.  All i need are arm plans.
---
Ive found enough robot armor mod plans to build a house out of
---
As a carebear, I quite agree. I hopped on survival when it came out, and found it super stressful despite never seeing more than one player (I generally do stealth sniping. Saw the player hopping about at max range and moved on to another area because carebear). I'd love to level with the XP bonus, but I don't see it as worth the stress for me.
---
You hero. Me too. 
---
Happened to me too. 
---
+ Love the free stew community feeling.
---
- Hate dropping all my loot 'cos I stopped sprinting.
---
"Crash land next to vault they had been in contact with". Like "hey, since we're buddies can we park here?"
---
Yeah I found this problem as well. I'm doing a stealth commando build, currently level 131, but robots just seem to be too perceptive against my chameleon armor and rank 3 sneak perk - maybe they have advanced stealth detection systems or something. I just switch from commando to a rifleman build with my instigating hunting rifle (legit - does around 600 damage with covert operative rank 3 \[gives 2.5x sneak attack damage\], instigating effect and all rifleman perks rank 3 - don't have bloody mess yet for some reason). Even though I haven't fought many powerful robots in the past times (only fought protectrons at watoga - can one shot them each time no matter where I hit with instigating hunting rifle), I have tried fighting loads of colonel gutsys (I think they're a bit too OP) before, but every time it took them 5 shots to take half my health. 
---
I would suggest using troubleshooter's legendary weapons (those can be dropped by any legendary enemy - 98% of all legendary weapon drops are complete bullshit and troubleshooter's effect can be on the weapons) and pulse grenades - troubleshooter's does 30% more damage to robots and pulse grenades are electric, so I think they deactivate the robot for a short period of time; besides, pulse grenades are almost as powerful as plasma grenades. 
---
If you don't like any of these techniques, then I would suggest sniping robots from a long distance with a suppressed hunting rifle - the hunting rifle can do well with sneak attack criticals (especially with covert operative rank 3 and mister sandman rank 2 - mister sandman gives the bonus: "Your silenced weapons do an additional 50% sneak attack damage at night".
---
Also, if anyone is willing to trade a Healing Factor Mutation Serum for 40 stimpaks, a full X-01 Power Armor set with Recon X01 helmet (level 50), 1000 caps, a 3-star Regenerating Sentinel's (reduces damage while standing and not moving by 15%) leather armor piece, 3-star Life Saving Sentinel's Robot Armor piece and a handmade rifle with a suppressor, I am on PS4 and my character name is vladgor2008

What do you mean 2 legged flatwoods?

This is your Soap Box talking get off me nobody cares.

Stabilized in perception. One gun army in luck. Lock and load in strength. This is my heavy weapons build.

After my first solo run, I was so whooped I didn't even wanna go through the nuke zone lol.

I support this as an explosive vats sniper. But I do think that line of code that makes them have a bigger boom when shot is still in there from fallout 4. I've seen them mow down mobs that way!

No, but I've got some regular ones and thats what they are angry at, seemingly :-) Ghouls, mutants, rats or what not - they all hate electricity with a vengance. As they have been bringing me great legendary loot lately, I dont want them to stop. Just wanted to know if its something special with my spot :-) I have camped other places, but never had the frequency of attacks Im having now. 
---
Thanks chap. Will give it a whirl.
---
Yea its a bit like Trammel and Felucca back in UO days ain't it ;)
---
Scorched killers isnt the same. Its a regular mod, more damage to scorched....less to everything else.
---
üéª
---
Truth is, the game was rigged from the start.

I‚Äôve seen some people running around with some nasty Tesla rifles and I‚Äôm curious lol

Hell yes, been wanting this since FO4. And it seems like it'd be trivial to make. Same skin as Long &amp; Short, medium zoom, and the Recon effect. Mash that together, boys
---
Must be time to Buff the marine armor
---
I can understand people getting upset about Bethesda adding in non cosmetic items into their store but I dont understand 1 but how people are claiming its pay to win. They are just basic repair kits that add for a nice QoL change and they aren't even the top tiered repair kit then can be made. Anyone claiming its pay to win with this are just looking for an excuse to jump on the complaining bandwagon.
---
Was able to scrounge up a Bloodied Western revolver with higher vats hit chance and less vats AP cost. They're out there, keep looking! Making an old Western character now
---
It's in luck and you can get starched genes at level 30
---
there "should" be around a 15-20% damage increase with each tiered level. That's the case for other guns, but I haven't personally used a laser rifle. Also, have you tried different receivers on it? Unfortunately, Bethesda did already buff the damage on these, they just need to go a bit further. 
---
Any way of checking if  BOS shielded underarmour plans  impacts tech data loot?  Once you learn the vendor bought BOS underarmor the Shielded plans starts to drop from Tech Data.  Worryingly, some evidence that once this starts, Paint stops dropping. 
---
 Does the Data files indicate anything?
---
Why is level 60-100 even a thing on this map when level dont matter after you reach 50?!
---
This fact alone makes this "guide" stupid.
---
I would join, what is the link?
---
YES it is intentional. Server will spawn random enemies near your camp.  And these enemies will disappear in the middle of teardown. I ever saw this happen when I hid nearby and enjoyed watching a group of super mutants tearing someone's CAMP apart. 
---
Yep, I'd like to see more server benefiting events
---
Yep 100% not a single paint. Why?
---
It's not worth keeping because you will probably need to eat and drink more food and water than you collect.
---
Replace tank killer with one gun army. Tank killer is for rifles. Stabilized under intelligence and dump demolition (explosives) because it is a waste of 5 perk points. Get bullet shield/lock and load.
---
Yes, exactly that!
---
So, weekend is over. Business hours. Can we get a response or even an acknowledgement on this subject now? 
---
You think that is worth it?! You will always have to keep moving and running in Fallout 76, so you will always be getting hungry and thirsty and likely will need to consume more food and water than you collect
---
Furious 50cal and anti armor gatling gun
---
Didn‚Äôt realise that tank killer didn‚Äôt go with heavy.  Thanks for the input. Much appreciated 
---
The whole challenge system is totally fucked. My level 255+ with everything on the map unlocked has still not "discovered the Ashheap".
---
I have no doubt they literally didn't test the challenges at all. Plenty of them never trigger. Several trigger incorrectly.
---
I don't have a link for it, but in the PAX panel for Fallout 76, Todd Howard said something along those lines. The idea that you turn in your legendaries for tokens that can then be exchanged to get gear you want.
---
But we don't have any actual details beyond "you get tokens."
---
Whether you spend them for specific items or effects, or just at chances of re-rolling items you have, we don't really know any specifics.
---
Necro.
---
It says I've collected all the Logs AND the Journals from the overseer 17/17 and 6/6
---
But I still have the "follow the overseers journey" in my mission.
---
Am I missing something really obvious ('lve listened to all of them as well) or is this just straight up bugged to hell and gone?
---
Honestly that's a big no from me.
---
Dev time is a huge waste on that
---
SOUP FOR MY COMRADES!!!!   
---
We need more communist propaganda in-game.
---
THE PEOPLES LIBERATION FRONT OF MAMA DOLCE WILL NOT BE SILENCED!  
---
I think this is being implemented. Bethesda has said they are making your camp still in the world after you log out. This can be implied as you will return to the server with your camp.
---
Oh boy, wait until you see a sloth in game lol.
---
Could my problem be that "Evan" was killed by Todd Howard for me?
---
I have a constant problem of things just dieing randomly (even friendly NPC's).
---
No I dont have any mutations and it wasn't another player in the area.
---
Don't know yet, I've asked the same question to others who have not dropped paint after multiple attempts, and I've also asked those who have dropped all of the paint.  
---
I'm trying to rule out that once Shielded starts to drop, the paint stops. I am sure thats not the case. 
---
I want a mobile app for trading and inventory management.
---
Either way, if it doesn't look good, I wont use a backpack. I dont even where a chest piece armor because I cant find one that goes good with the harness. Image is everything lol
---
I don't have this particular problem, but the stutter/freezes that happen every 10-60 seconds and last for 0.5-1sec is almost game breaking for me. Especially when in battle. And it's been there since launch. Even Skyrim SE heavily modded doesn't have this issue.
---
I'd love to see this and actual number HP on enemy HP bars.
---
I'd love to be able to tell if DoT effects actually work; as it feels like Flamers and the burning laser weapon mods don't actually deal damage.
---
Quest reward when it shows the list on the screen like when you get clothes, ammo and aid. 
---
I was on yesterday, I just hit 50 on a new roll, and whenever I come across a player who is under level 10 and doesn't immediately shoot me, I gesture them over and leave them some stims, radaway, and purified water before stealthing out.  :) If someone is doing an event I fast travel to join them, complete it with them, then run away as soon as it is completed.
---
Basically, I've been playing PVP as if it's extra hard mode PVE, and I only take down players if they come at me first.
---
Honestly, I don't think they're worth hanging on to. This game both encourages and penalizes you for being a pack rat. This game also encourages you to do you, so find what you like and stick with it until you change your mind.
---
So, are they always hostile when they spawn? Just curious, after watching the video shared below, but never saw anything on it (considering how much empty space is in there, may have just missed it or soemthing).
---
I only see this as a problem if they don't have workbenches during the dungeon raids. then these become a possible must have item if you can't manage your inventory loadout before starting a dungeon. However as you get the 150% repair kits from events then it just depends on their drop rate and how many events you have to do before taking on a dungeon (if they don't have workbenches).
---
The rest of the game is beatable without them as there are plenty of characters running round in the triple digits who I have assumed to have taken part in the SBQ quest and probably plenty in double digits who have too and they didn't need them.  
---
In PVP they aren't viable as by the time you access them in the middle of a fire fight you'll be dead. 
---
The same goes for refrigerators, and ammo and food converters and sending scrap back to your camp. They are nice to haves and not necessities.     
---
Yes, and every time you arrive, or someone else arrives, they spawn. 
---
Can I ask, have you dropped any of the new paint yet?
---
I'd more prefer a dps chart... but that's more for when addons come around. In previous fallout's it didn't matter, but it'd be good to know what sort of dps thresholds need to be met for SBQ.
---
Gatling gun is definitely the best heavy weapon in the game - efficient on ammo, high damage per bullet, ammo is easy to craft and you can find it in hundreds on super mutants when they drop it. If anyone is using gatling plasma and needs ammo for it, join me on PS4 (name is vladgor2008) - I've got 65 plasma cores that my friend gave for free. 
---
In White Springs you'll notice a lot of inaccessible doors, with all the faction vendors being placed there in the next patch and player vending in the next, you'll probably get your wish.
---
This!!  Take it off the map, give us an app.  Let us trade real time off screen
---
I wonder the same thing.  IT appears you can mix and match to get to level 3.  I have a lockpick 2 and an expert lockpick 1, but they appear to stack, so I can now open L3 locks.
---
There is a similar setup for auto-weapon cards.  ground pounder and (something else).  Both give +10% damage on automatics, but the perks have 2 different names
---
Any good handmades or lever actions?
---
It's so you can easily swap out to 1, 2, or 3 as needed.  If you combined them into a single card it would be 3 or nothing (etc.) or you would have to run with 6 ranks of the card to get an option to have 1 or 2 installed instead of 3.
---
Makes it easier to share a single rank of lock picking with your team while still having more than rank 1, and not having a ton of Charisma.  I think 3 people could install and share 1 Lockpicking (Master, Regular, and Expert) and everyone on the team would get the effect of all 3.  I have only tried it with one myself but it should work.
---
One star Legendaries are very common. Most of us don't bother holding on to them with a few exceptions like Instigating super sledges and Grog Axes. Executioners is also very useful. 
---
Those Legendaries you listed are very low level and not really worth much however the instigating board would be quite helpful early in the game for PvE
---
Guys, I think we didn't complain about this for a months! Let's get to business!
---
If they can do it in this ancient ass engine ***WITHOUT*** impacting performance, go for it.
---
Though if the game crashes as my screen floods with numbers when I hold down my Plasma Gat's trigger, maybe not. 
---
&gt; From what I understand, the AA does significant damage
---
It's typically around 25% damage increase, upwards of 30 on high armor mobs like sbq. Someone took many many hours and put forward solid math to back up that figure. I'm just too lazy to look it up.
---
Of the three you listed, TSE is your best bet. Zealot's doesn't do any extra damage to scorchbeasts, sadly. Hunter's does work on them though.
---
Right!? I'd get so much of my game time back if I could trade at work during breaks or while my kids are hogging the TV.
---
My survival character is lvl 15. He uses mismatched weapons in shit condition from dead low level enemies. He is having the time of his life. 
---
If it wasn't for this comment, people might actually believe you haha
---
I run in heavy combat, with a mix of Vanguard, Unyielding and cameloen..
---
Really like it, no ider how it works in pvp since i keep off that stuff, lol
---
\[I had one of these back when I played\]([https://i.imgur.com/Br4cQ20.png](https://i.imgur.com/Br4cQ20.png))
---
1. Weaponsmith for cheaper repair and to repair to 200%, gunsmith for slower degrade (both INT) 
---
2. Power patcher for cheaper repair, armorer to repair to 200% (both INT).
---
3. They would benefit from 1h melee perk yes
---
I can't be of any help for prices sorry
---
We probably won't get this sort of thing for a while. When bethesda allows mods in a year or two on private servers, that's when this sort of stuff will start popping up.
---
I stopped for a couple months, but those periodic freezes are still there. I'm sad :(
---
Yeah that's for laser guns - it's the barrel modifications that change whether the pistol is automatic or not instead of the receiver. But laser guns break very fast (I heard a gatling laser breaks after 2 reloads)
---
I upvoted that 20 times to make myself feel better. Let me access my inventory while my kids are playing so when it's my turn I can just play.  With my awesome new gun I bought with real time trading on my Fucking phone. Even if I could just access stash and work benches off world to manage stuff.  
---
Please don't create suggestion posts if they contain topics which have been retired to Bethesda Plz: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/bethesdaplz
---
I hear you. Sometimes when you're not looking for them they seem to just pop up. The Tactical Helmet for example. I farmed that thing for days. Completely gave up but one day I was helping a low level when suddenly the plans were where they were supposed to be.
---
I'd suggest switching to a higher DPS weapon for the queen. As awesome as the Gauss Rifle is for regular play, it doesn't have the DPS to significantly affect the SBQ fight.
---
I will likely be on tonight between 6-8 eastern time
---
Why mention the tommy gun? It's like the worst rifle in the game (even worse than pipe gun)
---
Hot damn no wonder! I have a hunter's gat plasma (not explosive) that melts her. With lots of drugs, of course.

Well not the Grafton monster. üòâ
---
It does when the frame rate is sub 30 and I can't aim for shit.
---
yeah, except doesn't have suppressor mod
---
It STILL HAPPENS TODAY. It also happens on Elder Scrolls Blades :\ so it must be an engine thing. It sucks so bad.
---
Whitesprings would be a good location for this; workbenches and NPC vendors are already set up.
---
&gt; There is a similar setup for auto-weapon cards. ground pounder and (something else). Both give +10% damage on automatics, but the perks have 2 different names
---
It's not quite the same though.  The weapon damage boosting cards have 3 different levels (Normal, Master, Expert) but each level can be ranked up 3 times.  The Hacking and Lock Picking levels are only one rank each, but three different levels.
---
Really?! They could have gone with Sheepacabra and they choose Sheepsquatch?!
---
I wouldn't be surprised if he did just wander everywhere.
---
IMO I feel like the odds are better if you simply just stumble into him on accident. Too much area to cover if you're trying to find him.
---
I agree, it seems a bit ridiculous to be able to craft guns and armour which are entirely useless after your first legendary drops. Like, why would you even bother to learn to craft in the first place? Unless I'm missing something, at endgame level your armour crafting is only good for modding gear, you are never going to equip a piece of equipment you have crafted. Some way to add legendary effects to crafted gear is a possible solution for this, so I support that
---
yeah levelling up our legendary weapons would be awesome. got a 3 star troubleshooter's 25% faster fire rate 15% faster reload 10mm pistol at uranium fever but it was level 35 instead of level 45
---
Well as one per put it on twitter " They were literally feeding the people" Loved that comment, Yeah I was confused too, just thought it was Vault Tec rations lol
---
i can only assume that this post was intended to troll with the recent shitstorm about repair kits
---
10mm SMG consumes way too much ammo
---
I'll look into some changes, but having to be 100% PvP focused instead of being able to PvE with some added tension kind of sucks. People in my level range are fun, fair fights but it's pretty often I get one hit KO'd.
---
I even had a guy come into my base and tank all my 8 turrets firing at him and kill me in two hits. Just seems like the losses should be less when that scenario is possible.
---
High DPS - nice. High ammo consumption - bull crap
---
You missed April Fools by about 7 days...
---
I think it depends on where you build. I'm on a cliff on the border between the divide and toxic valley.  Very rarely attacked.
---
It's not exactly like that. At pax they said you turn in legendaries to get tokens,to reroll your  already owned legendaries.
---
you need help man, pick two or 3 guns and be off with it!
---
Yeah it definitely is an engine issue. It even happens on Elder Scrolls Blades. It's like it's loading new cells (i.e. distant map areas) and just sucks at it. Been an issue since launch, it depresses me :(
---
Yeah, thats when i seems to find things...when i stop looking in certain spots and just start wandering the map and stoping at any random spot. 
---
Right ? it doesn't even activate when going near the terminal...plus it was a cool quest to do !
---
I disagree. Plenty of people have an interest in this. 
---
Unfortunately, if you were given your wish list it would be pay to win, way too early, and a lot of people who stuck through the first few harsh months may very well throw up their hands and walk away. Can this happen? Sure, piece by piece and when the development of new content is on life support. For now, you suggestions should remain a "road map for a dying game", and I don't mean that disrespectfully as it would pay for new content. 
---
They are making progress ironing stuff out from launch, I played ESO beta and enjoyed it, but it wasn't what I was looking for. When I played 76 Beta I enjoyed it, I leveled very slowly and didn't face all the game breaking bugs that the hardcore gamers were stuck with it. Ignorance can be bliss sometimes.
---
Seemed like a lot to me, maybe the repetition made it seem like I was loosing substantially more than I am. I still feel like that incentivizes farming low level players. No risk, kill 3 or 4 in two hits and you get all the rewards.
---
I don't even get the testing one....it's been 300 hours of the same daily
---
All the brotherhood plans i do have, i found in the mire. People seem to say the divide is good tho...idk
---
Hell yeah!! I'll RP as Abraham Lincoln Ghoul Slayer
---
Thing is, i rarely get those ! i just get the pumpkin one. Doing it or not changes nothing, i cannot activate anything else, ever
---
The damage on the weapon card stays the same but the actual damage does get a significant increase.
---
Just restrict the amount of aid items/caps lost for substantial level differences. If a level 140 is killing levels 20s in a single hit, farming train stations and quest areas is incentivized. They just need to look at those kinds of imbalances and adjust the rewards I think.
---
I keep seeing people calling FO76 an mmo. It is not an mmo in any shape or form. Two dozen people a server isn't massive numbers of people. It's hardly even an rpg, though at least you could make a case for that depending on your play style. It's what's most commonly referred to these days as a looter shooter.
---
Sometimes I have to go to an area to get the daily to pop, like the one at the hotel in the mire, I have to get near it.
---
üëç
---
Sounds like a great Idea to me, I would love to build me a Log Cabin.
---
i will hit you up once im at home, I would buy some from you, if you let me :)
---
it was just copied text from fo4.
---
I understand your side of the argument, but being able to destroy a base is important.
---
As soon as they do this, low-lifes will build turret bases at the golf house and nobody can do anything about this. (They can't add more no-build zones because people are already pissed about the current ones)
---
If you're "wanted" and stumble into someone's camp, you'll get torn apart by their turrets and can't defend yourself if their in pacifist mode. (Disabling camp turrets in pacifist mode won't work because "how is my base supposed to defend it self from pve")
---
No matter what, people will whine and complain, so they'll just cause new problems by solving other ones.
---
I'm not saying they should drop everything and develop it right this second. I'm talking in time frames such as a year or more. There are obviously other things to fix right now. 
---
&gt;For no money 
---
Literally every update they release is for "no money". This isnt any different. 
---
Bethesda nailed it with the design can't wait to scream when I run into it
---
It would have to be a separate cell, like an empty cave with a hatch and ladder.
---
Opening fight: 
---
queen in the air - aae .50 cal
---
queen on the ground - medics cryolator w/ fire rate -&gt; swap to furious minigun w/dmg while aiming
---
end fight (low health):
---
queen in the air - executioners faster fire rate .50 cal
---
queen on the ground - medics cryolator w/ fire rate -&gt; swap to executioner's prime gatling laser
---
also, hella drugs. 
---
Yep, tried that. I went with no other daily active, nothing. I went with other daily active, nothing. I cannot interact with the bots nor anything else...it's really weird
---
Skyrim for Apple TV, Skyrim for Android wearables, and Skyrim for your toaster?
---
You're obviously projecting your self-hatred on others lol. I mean seriously who the hell frequents forums of games they actively hate? Why get worked up about something like that.. 
---
So long as it‚Äôs logs inside and out, so direction doesn‚Äôt matter.
---
Reapeatables you can do repeatedly unless they bug out ( tech data ), dailies you're reminded once a day that the devs still haven't fixed any bugged quests.
---
You'd think quest in an rpg would be a priority but hey.
---
Milk of human kindness should have 50% damage reduction for everyone including you but you get 10% XP
---
Keep in mind, they are junk and you should stash them as soon as you are done crafting them to prevent loss due to......... lack of life. Violet, Crimson, Cobalt are in high level/highly nuked zones and are the least common. Fluorescent and Yellowcake is super common (White Springs) so focus on the first 3 and be sure to balance your stash for your purposes. 
---
Keep a stock of high radiation fluids, hardened masses, and glowing masses (with glowing being the heaviest) to purify the bounty of the random nuke launches you encounter.
---
Or just nerf those lol 
---
Is there an audio or visual? Or does it just start to heal? 
---
what if we could get camp item to make caves that act as a loading screen for a underground area that you are able to build in and is instanced? perhaps where the cave is can effect if it has a resource extractor in it? also would be cool to have a underground set of camp buildables
---
Ummmmm wat 
---
Damn, I really thought zealot's will be useful for SBQ. Need to sell it, 18 lbs less in the stash ;)
---
Which affixes combination will be best for SBQ for Gatling Gun? AA+25FR?
---
But Aliens themselves are Cryptids/Mythical Beings, therefore the Flatwoods ARE still mythical beings.
---
How do you know unless you pick it up?
---
Switch to melee and wear PA, it helped me with my rear entry problem. Super Mutants are still jerks though.
---
\*Vas Rel Por\*  
---
"all my stuff is at my house, we can trade there"
---
I just killed one a minute or 2 ago
---
I carry a bunch of melee weapons anti armor, ghoul slayers, and instigating along with a few guns you gotta be prepared in the wasteland. I will carry more once the back packs come out.
---
Mothman was never given any explanation, but they seem to be smarter than your average creature. and if mothman cultist notes are to be believed and various other notes, they might've existed before the war.
---
Theres also the interloper lurking at the bottom of lucky hole mine, that thing is most likely not a mutant either.
---
If you want it to be canon, then let it be canon. 
---
I‚Äôm sure the self proclaimed ‚Äúpurists‚Äù would disagree, but I‚Äôm a long time fallout fan, and I like the lore of this game.  I think a lot of bleeds really nicely into other stories. Some of it doesn‚Äôt, but I‚Äôd rather the story evolves rather than stagnates. 
---
I still refer to the bible sometimes though, so maybe I‚Äôm not the best judge?
---
unless Bethesda says otherwise, it is canon.
---
r/nocontext
---
Not with level scalingüòé
---
It‚Äôs canon officially speaking, but if you aren‚Äôt happy with that, I think there‚Äôs a cannibal family in Fallout 3 whom you can talk about the state of WV with, mentioning its completely uninhabitable. 
---
In essence, 76 technically can be considered non-canon because of that. But to be clear, Fallout 76 is canon.
---
Dang, I got no idea then
---
I believe Watoga Station and Phoenix in Watago, if they don't have them server hop otherwise scrap a lot
---
As a heavy gunner with a 2 pound minigun . I have to disagree. Moar gunz
---
Yeah maybe but I‚Äôve got friends with meta builds that are lvl 15, and I‚Äôm lvl 32 on my alt I‚Äôve been leveling in survival and have no problem taking out lvl 100+ players.. I just feel like it‚Äôs a risk v. reward type of thing 
---
Best Rifles:
---
1. Handmade
---
2. Lever Action
---
3. Brotherhood Recon Rifle (get from Recruitment Blues BOS quest at Fort Defiance)
---
4. Hunting
---
5. Combat
---
Worst Rifles:
---
1. Submachine gun (low damage and high ammo consumption)
---
2. 10mm SMG (insane ammo consumption)
---
3. Railway Rifle (we all know why)
---
4. Black Powder Rifle (insane slow reload time)
---
5. The Dragon (slowest reload in the game after single action revolver)
---
6. Assault rifle (low damage)
---
7. Radium Rifle (low damage and useless unique rifle for only +15 rad damage)
---
8. Syringer
---
Best Pistols:
---
1. 10mm
---
2. Western Revolver
---
3. .44
---
Worst Pistols:
---
1. Single Action Revolver (slow reload time and crappy damage)
---
2. Black Powder Pistol (ammo weighs too much, reloads too slow)
---
3. Black Powder Blunderbuss (ammo weighs too much, reloads too slow)
---
4. Flare Gun (does 5 damage)
---
Well aren't you late to the party. Too bad I already quit playing. Maybe when I start playing again I'll keep this in mind. 
---
Drop them in a container at the vendors, I have the plan for the top hat so I don't need to sell legendaries. Sometimes I'll leave 1 legendary in each container, kinda like an easter egg hunt
---
This game is only becoming better and more relevant, pick it up.
---
You already have armor pieces that reduce your  weapon, food,and junk weights by 20% I would be fine with it just having additional carry weight.
---
I agree with your post - it really does elevate the gameplay.  I'm constantly moving my camp too, claiming workshops and getting in and out, just so I can quickly craft some ammo and drop my Aid into Stash.  I only take a small amount of Aid out with me, knowing I could potentially lose it all.  
---
That said, I think the Caps loss is too high, which is the only thing that deters me from always playing in Survival mode, because I'm not the best at pvp and die often LOL
---
What‚Äôs the link?
---
ok thats good, my GT is the same as here.
---
It‚Äôs a goat costume 
---
Rifleman changes based on many things. 1. Thing is do you want to be VATS one or a non-vats one? There are enough rifle perks that you won't have enough perception to get the VATS targeting one unless you skimp on a damage boost.
---
haha, I came across one the other day, breakdancing in a shopping cart in the alley behind super duper mart.
---
How about JARVIS?
---
Just want to let people know this is still an issue. I was wondering why my axe was apparently depleting so fast, checked today just as I was repairing things and saw it's not repairing past 100% but all other weapons are. Mine is a 3star so I think it's a bug for the weapon regardless of levels. 
---
Honestly I think there are already different cults. For inatance the holotape you find with the mothman comith part 2 is called the interloper, the guy says how there are beings far greater than even the mothman and he goes on a search for the interloper. He has another tape at lucky hole mine which touches alittle bit more on it but nothing really confirming any other cryptid just yet.
---
Still People on the Internet that still got their bubble up, still wearing their pink glasses? Wow, thats surprising actually. Whats not so surprising is that Beth is a Mil $$$ company and everything that makes em money is a good thing for em. Making such harsh moves like putting not wanted stuff in their microtransactions, or monetize mods from other people in the past is something they made several times now. 
---
The only thing we can do about this is to raise our voices until they response, thats exactly what the Community Mods stated here in their RESPONSE: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b9pxk6/repair\_kits\_megathread\_mod\_statement/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b9pxk6/repair_kits_megathread_mod_statement/) 
---
Being tight lipped about everything regarding reasons why anything is how it is has been Bethesdas MO this time around. I kinda get it, but you're right, when they backpedal, some sort of reasoning would be nice
---
However, if any company came out and admitted they did u wrong with an apology, the fallout (intended) might be worse from the masses. As many people have said, "it's a slippery slope".
---
For now I'm okay so long as they don't make something you really need be a purchase. Up to this point, I've never had a moment where I've kicked myself for a gun break and said I'd wished I had a kit. If I'm dumbass enough to run to a nuke without preparing first, then that's on me. These kits are strictly for preference of play, which, to me, is tantamount to cosmetics.
---
That would be great!!!
---
Is. This. Game. Not. Fallout. Canon.
---
I just want an ammo auto feeder for my minigun. Maybe put steel and lead in and it makes it for me on the fly too.
---
I wish more games gave a played time. It let me accurately track time to Platinum. 110 hours.
---
This plague could be why. Or maybe someone  took harsher and more exetreme motions to stop it.
---
Will message you the link
---
My problem comes from the fact that if you land on a server where the top three have been alive for less than 2 hours you know some one shot assassin is making the rounds and in one hour you are going to be visited and murdered so fast you don't have time to think, as everyone above you is going to get torn up and there is no way to stay off the top three other than commit suicide every half hour so that at least people can't take your stuff. 
---
There is no real counter play to people hunting you, they don't render far enough away to deal with, and being shown on the map in real time with a small enough circle that they can walk right up to you even without seeing you by just checking their map every now and then. 
---
I wish people rendered as far away as scorchbeasts do, as they are the biggest threat, but don't render until they are essentially right on top of you.
---
\---
---
I get some small satisfaction out of seeing these people flounder helplessly as I smile and wave from my unkillable hiding spot, but that's not really playing the game.
---
id sh*t myself if they added the jersey devil 
---
I carry 3 Grog axes, and I think that is exactly the issue and it always will unequip whatever weapon is in the 9:00 slot the first time I fast travel after logging in, even if I equip it as primary 
---
Oh that would be cool, super reduced weight on ballistic ammo, and it auto-feeds into your heavy-weapon haha that would be great.
---
Same here, but every time i click Play in the game menu, my game loads for 20 sec, and then it crashes and automatic shuts down.   D8&lt;  
---
I really disagree. Why get rewarded if your don't contribute?
---
You're still the issue. 
---
You came into their camp uninvited, then came back over. 
---
The lvl 200 just politely asked you to stay away. 
---
All you had to do was leave them alone, but somehow the simple request made you go into an emotional rant. 
---
As you've made clear, it's not really about their ages. It's that low lever players felt uncomfortable with you entering their spavce. You feel like ylu ought to be able to walk into someone's holuse uninvited without a high level player showing up to warn you off. 
---
That's *you* being overly sensitive. 
---
Everybody you meet porentially has some high level friend who is likely to show up if you bother them. Get over it. 
---
I enjoy it personally, I would recommend it to others.
---
On an aside, I genuinely dont understand the issue with Repair Kits?
---
I've definitely got my money out of it. Game is much more stable and they are adding lots of new stuff. Aside from the repair kit stuff, it's in a pretty good place.
---
It is canon.
---
I think I'm more interested in non VATS and more damage. Because vats is purely dependent on crit hit isn't it?
---
You can destroy camps in survival, you need to watch the leaderboard and if you are close to 1-3 you need to leave your camp 
---
if by 8th you mean 9th, sure.
---
Or raw flux degrading. 
---
That's your OWN opinion. The reason is that some enemies could be tougher than a level 50 and level does matter in this game.
---
It still works just fine. I can text people in the game, using my phone. Just offering you al alternative. 
---
I know that, but leave my camp why?  I became wanted because I was in my camp @ #1?  Why did I get a wanted?
---
They put a bounty on you.
---
I figured they were just fancy butt plugs. 
---
In 76 there's also a fan mail to Shanon Rivers from Kent Connelly, the guy who gives you the Silver Shroud quest line in Fallout 4. 
---
I've heard you could raise a support ticket with Bethesda for stuff like this, possibly via their website?
---
Ahhhhh.......ok.   I get it.  Butthurt they failed  Post deleted.  
---
Maybe I am being too naive thinking a n AAA company will just come out and admit their mistake. I just really don't like how it suddenly went silent.
---
Personally, I don't care too much either about the microtransaction unless it starts to affect core gameplay like GTA Online, but I am also worried Bethesda will start to focus on gameplay affecting atomic shop item once they start on this slippery slope.
---
I think they're used in one of the booze recipes, too. 
---
Do you have the Grounded mutation? Halves energy damage
---
Use it with a true automatic compressor and your damege goes up dramatically. Pair it with a furious laser weapon and it actually works wonders. Well for me anyways.
---
Someone else just mentioned this and I agree. The game already has all those ski lodges and cabins so the model should be here! üëçüëç
---
Thank you good sir!
---
^Also desolves in your butt after approximately 1hr.
---
I am really glad someone with more Creation engine modding experience than me has said the same thing I've been saying around for a while. The Creation engine gets such a bad wrap - every second gamer thinks they are an expert these days and the problems always overshadow the feats.
---
The engine is not without its bugs of course, but I really appreciate the succinctness of the good things you've described better than I could. Cheers!
---
Are you asking about 1\* Weapons, 1\* armor, or both?
---
askig b/c
---
Drackar39&gt; use them, since 99% of decent legendary items I've gotten are &gt; single star variants.
---
I agree, not all 1\* (weapons) are junk. 
---
For example, 
---
When I was about L22, I ws given a 1\* L20 vampire machete.  30 odd levels later, I still have it, and a spare I picked up.  It still does a very respectable job against most enemies (including bots)  and can hold its on in a WS mob, but has recently been replaced by a non-legendary cultist dagger as my goto melee.  I still carry the VM a backup.
---
And
---
I recieved a 1\* Executioners combat rifle from the Faschnacht parade.  
---
Friday night, walking through the Divide, I had my first stand your ground encounter with a L50 scorchbeast.  Took it out with that 1\* rifle.  While taking pictures of my first SB kill, another one showed up.  Took it out with the same rifle.  during that picture time, a 3rd one attacked.  Took it out with a combination of that rifle and the above mentioned cultist dagger.  
---
THe attendant minions were more of an annoyance, but hipfired to take them aout.
---
Got a bit farther down the road, and was attacked by #4.  Executions rifle once more.
---
Those were my first 4 SB kills, so I don't have a basis of comparison - 
---
each SB took about 220 shots.  IDK if thats "good" or "bad" performance.  I do know there's no issues with durability - barely registered on the condition bar.
---
OTOH, most of the 1\* armor I get is not as effective as the non-legendary armor I already have, so most of the armor so far is vendored.  
---
Yup theres another problem.
---
There's an easy way to fix this. What I do is start a new character and you'll level up when you pick up the cards in the vault :-) Delete and start over next week.
---
Hell yeah im excited to see this, the 76 community is awesome 
---
He was on the cliff near big teapot looking out towards Poseidon power plant yesterday 
---
I incinerate magazines with my intense reading
---
The opaque writing is normal, basically it‚Äôs ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù but really it‚Äôs just that you‚Äôve seen the quest before, since it‚Äôs repeatable. The only thing I can guess is you haven‚Äôt finished it in time? I‚Äôve done it several times with no issue
---
He was there in the Elder Scrolls panel at PAX East. Pete Hines has a habit of getting into fights with people on Twitter, and did so again shortly after 76 was announced. So it's likely that the higher ups asked him to keep shut on social media and not damage the company's image.
---
I built by Charleston in a low level area, and constantly get attacked by a variety of enemies. They're level 5 and are easily killed, but if my one turret issues they'll slowly chip away at my base over the course of an hour.
---
Proper nuisance
---
That actually sounds great
---
Its not an opinion you shithead, its fact, that everything above level 50 dosnt matter.
---
How much for the decon shower?
---
1k?
---
Well, that's depressing.
---
I'm on x box, you?
---
You missed nothing kind internet person, your diagnosis is accurate, thanks for the support, I just want to see even more diverse ridiculous stuff happening in the game and lets face it alien blaster deserves some love.
---
That makes sense, thanks for the clarification.
---
Cool. Will be on tonight
---
Sorry I suck in literacy, translate?
---
Best Rifle - Handmade Rifle
---
Best Shotgun - Pump Action
---
Best Heavy Weapon - Gatling gun
---
Best Explosive Weapon - Auto Grenade Launcher
---
Best Pistol - 10mm Pistol
---
Best Melee Two Handed - Super Sledge
---
Best Melee One Handed - Power Fist
---
Best Melee Unarmed - Knuckles
---
And the Best Weapon in the Game - The Flare Gun... Nah, just kidding. The Handmade Rifle
---
It's canon. But if you are a bit of a Kent Connolly you will find lots of holes.
---
Did they 'roll back' the bugs again?
---
 Approximately what time? 
---
Right.  
---
But the question is, if the normal/master/expert all have the same effect per card, then why are there 3 different names?  i.e., whats the difference between normal 1 and expert 1?
---
Does normal 3 stack (addative) with expert 3 to yield twice the damage?
---
6pm GMT
---
But can it be milked?
---
But that raises two qestions: can you upgrade nice 2\* item for a ultimate 3\*, and can you get 0\* item to 1\*.  
---
From what I understood the PAX talk it seemed like if you have 3\* with one bad perk you might get it to 3\* with no bad perks. But I really want to have a 3\* wooden armor set and force people into asking how is that possible the wooden barbarian is so strong :D
---
I think as long as they move the spawn inside the lobby and block pvp, Whitesprings is a great spot.
---
You keep the effect, I did a bit of testing on it. However I didn‚Äôt test what happened if you hit a DIFFERENT enemy. 
---
That's 2pm EST right?  I think so.  
---
Yes,  I'll be on then.  
---
Survival is only tough for the first 10-20 levels, until you get the right perks. Also if you used the settlement system before, this will be trivial. For a brutal fo4 install modern weapons mode and make it tactical.
---
Storywise and true Canon would be: The Long and Harsh Winter. That Winter lasted almost 30 Years and to this date it will happen one year after opening of Vault 76. Maybe thats why WV is told as uninhabtiable. And as we know to this date, such Winter stuff is definitely coming to Fallout 76 as a new Gamemode :D
---
I‚Äôve been stashing all that I can because of this Legendary Vendor coming soon. I have saved 40-50 of them. Before that, I just put them in coolers in train stations or sell them. 
---
Cool 
---
Maybe you were fighting something with poisoning or bleeding effect? SB, Mirelurk queens etc.
---
It's so each tier is level locked. Otherwise you'd have all 3 within 2 levels of the first
---
Don't the heavy Gunner perks say non-explosive in them?
---
Or Welch IIRC.
---
Just buy them at Watoga
---
They already said that ES6 and Starfield won't be at E3 2019.
---
Just to to Watoga, Phoenix, or Harper's Ferry and buy them off the vendor.  They are pretty much always there.  Plenty of other vendors around that have them too.
---
Ever since the Vendor change back in Patch 5, Handmade plans are not rare.  Even level 100+ characters have them in stock.
---
If you're going for non-legendary armor, definitely scout armor. If legendary, then sentinel's marine armor. 
---
Oh really? I didn't know, thanks for the help :D
---
Game has improved, still some bugs nothing too game breaking, I have the occasional crash.  Don‚Äôt ever really have server issues (xb1)  they are starting to roll out consistent dlc the biggest one comes out Tuesday With the new quest line coming. if you‚Äôre worried about the story I‚Äôd wait to see that, but other than that I absolutely love the game have 800 hours in it. I‚Äôve met some incredible friends and have traded and interacted with far more people then what  I would of thought. People around the wasteland are usually kind, 76 have by far the nicest player base, people are always willing to help new players
---
I love the game 
---
My psn is purpleduke_15 
---
"Repair Kits are our first attempt at a utility item like this, and we plan to make adjustments based on your feedback, so we hope you‚Äôll share your thoughts with us when they go live later this month."
---
They're waiting for feedback after they've gone live.
---
This would be amazing I‚Äôd love it. If I‚Äôm out all day and I see an item someone‚Äôs selling it‚Äôs a pain for both of us to have to wait. Would be great if it was free wouldn‚Äôt mind spending a little on it though 
---
Never, and I search all the ones I find. They don't drop loot if my turret kills them, but I can still check the name
---
Dude did you read the title? We're discussing the best non-power armor armor
---
Building turrets not only kills them, but also lowers the chance of attacks happening
---
I bet a lot. Anyone running around in PA with a rocket sledge is an easy kill.
---
We know one vault has stuff like valves on pipes that probably need to be turned. 
---
Stealthboy mod for PA acts more like the chameleon legendary (requires crouching/no movement) while also constantly draining AP and your core. It‚Äôs kind of bad.
---
I tried mount Blair train yard and abandon mine Elaine and still no spawns and same results after I server hopped a couple times 
---
They all stack.
---
You equip Rifleman, Expert Rifleman, and Master Rifleman (all rank 3) for a large boost in your non automatic rifle damage.  Same with all the other Normal, Master, and Expert weapon damage perks.
---
3 Perk points are better spent as 1 rank of each of the 3 tiers. (Math there).  But 9 perk points spent on 3 x 3 Rank cards is the max bonus for a particular weapon type.
---
A select few weapons out there do appear to be affected by more than 1 type of boosting card, meaning you can boost more than just the 3x3 on those particular weapons.
---
THIS GAME SERIOUSLY NEEDS A WHITESPRING RESORT FILLED WITH VENDORS AND CRAFTING BENCHES
---
There have been multiple breaches into otherwise inaccessible vaults. Several people have posted a number of pics here on reddit. 
---
Level 83, i just roam around exploring without aim so im down for whatever, GT ludeyy
---
Exactly! Personally I'm hoping the only difference between backpacks is purely cosmetic. But either way I'll use what I like the look of over what has better stats.
---
Pleeeease! No huuurt! No kiiiiill!
---
its already the hub, the wish has been granted, and 1000 posts about not having a hub will never change that this has been the hub since day 1
---
1. Gunsmith
---
2. Power patcher
---
3. no, all melee perks apply to deathclaw gauntlet \*except\* the Gladiator perks
---
X01 and Ultracite have highest radiation protection, but T51b has best damage and energy resistance by stats
---
There's a lot here that supports us getting back to the usual Fallout Formula.Here's the link to the original main article: https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019
---
And this is the description for the content update chapter: Embark on a tale with true choice and consequences in¬†Wastelanders¬†‚Äì our biggest and most ambitious update for 76.¬†Wastelanders¬†will include a new main questline, new factions, new events, new features and even more surprises.
---
And this is my opinion: they added a lot of Easter eggs to the road map visually. For Wastelanders it shows us leaving a vault with a bag of loot while we lead a young vault girl away, though her silhouette isn't outlined like a vault suit. In the background. There's a compound with barbed wire and a light on in the watchtower. Finally the last panel shows a miniature robot next to vault boy as he waves.
---
Definitely needs this.
---
Squirrels exterminated...
---
I would have assumed it‚Äôs referring to things like a missile launcher and Fatman not the explosive bullets on a mini gun/Gatling?
---
And make it so you can fast travel inside when a nuke is active.
---
If the pack on my Union Uniform gives benefits to black powder weapons, I'm good.
---
So we're all literally... RESPONDERS!
---
That's what power armor initially reminded me of back when I first played with it in Fallout 4.
---
Inventory management is a huge part of Fallout 76. Giving extra caps and inventory space is pure pay to win stuff.
---
Actually I have been using Speed Demon (mutation) and Rejuvenated (perks) for about 3 months now and I can tell you that clicking the fast wheel every 10 minutes for a drink and 30 minutes for food is definitely worth the 10% extra move speed.
---
Rejuvenated actually forces me to be constantly well feed/hydrated and it has not been an issue at all.
---
As you said, you constantly move in this game. Combined with increased AP regen I get to be able to move really fast everywhere. And, depending were you are in the game, at some point food/drink is simply not a problem anymore.
---
Maybe the message could also list the items you accidentally scrapped to make the stew. "Sheepskin scrapped  an Ultracite Power Armor Left Leg to feed the people!"
---
Uh - That might be to change a Commie Whacker into a Bladed Commie Whacker.  (You can get one in Camden Park)
---
What discord are you in lol yeah the game is canon 
---
I've always wanted a log cabin set. Please Bethesda, it makes more sense than a barn or brick house. 
---
Not sure? But going just off the stats, you can get just the crafted Studded Heavy Leather armor to 45/77/0 (Physical Resist/Energy Resist/Radiation Resist).
---
You cannot get the numbers to that high on any crafted armors in the game.
---
So is there some hidden resist that is not being included in the stats then?
---
no but when you add scorch killer to a legendary weapon it adds a star
---
I haven't checked to see what happens when you add it to a regular weapon
---
That'd be why ad supported with a paid option would be nice then it's not pay to win it's pay to remove ads.
---
Yes, I just avoid the workshop challenges.  Too bad there is not a way to just get a prompt when someone is contesting the workshop, to just say "Give Up" and let them have it without PVP.
---
Anything Bethesda writes now is canon. Parts of the Bible are still supported, as Bethesda has taken vault ideas from there. They've actually said it's semi-canon up until they want to change something
---
????
---
all I did was asking what the best gun for PvP could be?
---
I prefer to ritually smoke my bobbleheads
---
The atom shop is also overpriced! Lower the prices and make daily challenges actually doable and not based on having an overabundance of drinks and owning specific recipes.
---
Exactly. Just make it free so low levels can get in it would be perfect. 
---
Ditto to everything you have posted.  I have 1 piece of  3\*marine armor (torso) that I wear, only for it's perks. I can make the wetsuit, but I use the BOS under armor for it's buffs.  I love the assaultron helmet and was a big fan of it in FO4.  I made one, but it's just a collectors item.  My char has to wear her bottle cap sunglasses at all times!
---
A lot can happen in 200 years. I don't think our dwellers survive this though
---
I imagine it would be more like you will replace your two good perks with bad ones, I wouldn't try this. I would like to reroll the perks on my three star ghoul slaying deathclaw gauntlet tho
---
The backpacks should have the same carry weight bonus but also be modular so we can add things like melee weapon weight reduction or food weight reduction or whatever.
---
It's lots of fun, but it still has game-breaking bugs and overly frequent server crashes. Keep your expectations low and you'll be fine. I am glad to have played it.

Also don't put repair kits on the atom store.
---
Not too many, they patch it up pretty good. I mean sure the patches aren't pretty but the story could fit
---
God Bless and Jesus loves you. This post is a method. It's your own choice if you want to play this way or not. Don't go to people blogs and act like a tough guy. That's very dangerous and unhealthy.
---
Omg pleaseeee
---
Dude you talk like this is real life.  You damn right I can walk into whatever house I want. I know the consequences. But you act like their is some moral code I HAVE to follow. 
---
And you're right,  it does bug me.  Mainly because it's people like you and the level 200 who make these kids so entitled now. I'm not overly sensitive.  If you honestly think it's ok for anyone to have to bow down to 10 year olds in a rated M game, then you're the problem.  You're the reason games get so watered down and censored because little timmy might get his precious feelings hurt. 
---
I did back away and leave them alone. Even tried to help. But why should I? Because the wittle kid was scawrd? Aw boo hoo.

Good that I'm already armed to teeth and my only wish is to create ridiculous tools of destruction 
---
I went for a PA/HW/Explosives build, as I think they synergize quite well. I‚Äôve transitioned lately to a low health build, but you can swap nerd rage out for full Gunsmith.

Nope. Kind of mad about that one. Only paint Ive ever got was the initiate plan. 
---
The responder eyebot that scans you to determine if you're wearing responder gear or not. Essentially some gear is tagged as being faction based and I'm hoping that the skin applies the proper tags. 
---
Marine is actually pretty well balanced considering that it has respectable radiation resistance. The radiation resistance comes at a price of other stats, though, but it's actually great if you like its particular brand of stat diversity. Trapper is the only set with higher overall RR at the cost of most of its ER, meanwhile Robot Heavy has higher ER with less RR.
---
If you want to hyper optimize for only DR/ER then it obviously makes sense to choose an armor type without RR.
---
I‚Äôd go fire breathers

Imho it's random, they probably will produce 60/hr average at varying rates, but they'll only hold 5 each.

Also the ported barrel for the handmade.

You're probably right. You can prove it by checking the damage on your furious explosive with the perks on and off. If that does work imagine the damage a bloodied explosive heavy gun is doing with adrenal

Ah ok 
---
I personally hate game trading, people, yuck. An app to trade is a great mediating tool. I'd pay, screw ads.
---
This would have to be a whole new department for them I think, I don't try to whine too much abt Bethesda, (I'm not that emotional about a game company) but I feel like copy/paste/charge is more on their level for the moment.
---
Still, I have hope!
---
Soooo...... what happened to the dumbass with the OP hammer?
---
The downside with a flechette harpoon is that it gets massive drop on the projectiles. I‚Äôm talking past 40 feet you have to start aiming so high you can‚Äôt even see your target anymore. Does fine at point blank range though. 
---
Guaranteed any spawn and the Bootleggers shack in the cranberry bog, just doing of Macs farm. Only spawns 4 per server though 
---
The game itself may have borders we can't cross, but I have to think the people of West Virginia would abandon ship at some point and head for other states.
---
Bloodied/AA/Hunter's + 25FR/Explosive. Any of those combos should be solid.
---
There's a military backpack that you can buy from the creation club
---
The game is fun, particularly if you play with friends. I really enjoyed the exploration phase. The soft survival elements are fun without being oppressive. The endgame is a hot-mess, and there are still an absurd number of game-breaking bugs and server disconnects, but it's alright if you can have humor about it. I'm glad to have played.   
---
Among my friends, half finished and quit, and most of those who remain are limiting their playtime. There's still plenty of players on server though. 
---
PSN.  And I don‚Äôt know yet if I am inclined to sell. 
---
Yes.

Not on pvp

I just did a backwards snort at this. It wasn't pretty, I have a cold.

Totally Aprove this!
---
Insted these Red's should give everyone on the Server a mini Nuke and a Fatman for free.
---
So we can show them some good old American Justice for good!
---
Anything from WS goes into the ice chest. I drop stuff from WestTek on the ground in the middle of that intersection because it's a big pile of bait in survival. ;)
---
I hope so, the sudden quietness just felt way to unnatural. The community managers are usually pretty active after Inside the Vault has been released.
---
One of my alts lives in a cabin. Came with trophies mounted on the wall and a nice porch with a grill....

Automatic weapons ftw. Best DPS out of the three.
---
Cool.  IDK that.
---
Thanks for clarifying!

That Chrome one...
---
" BY YOUR COMMAND!"
---
Love it. Do it. This is a quick path to feeling even more individual in the world, which the game needs.
---
OMG! Do you have a time machine?!? ARE YOU PSYCHIC?!?
---
Sadly it has only two stars.  If it had also had weight reduction I would have been too excited to  write.  
---
I haven't tested this, but I've heard the rate is constant across however many you build.
---
So you could empty 1 purifier every 5 minutes, 6 every half hour, or 12 that are full after the entire hour, etc.
---
ok, thx for info, I'll start looking for something like this, I'll craft Prime receiver and try how it works.
---
Yeah, and $147 is about twice what it would cost to just buy 7600 atoms. That's without waiting a year, and ignoring the hardware costs of running a relatively high-end game for a year nonstop, which could go much further into the hundreds if you burned out an expensive graphics card on it
---
Automatron was also my favorite. It was great modifying loyal robot companions and creating new settlers hell on destruction. 
---
Ada became my favorite companion too. Hooked her up with the stealth blades and assaultron laser for the awesome death animations. 
---
I never supported the creation club
---
You don't understand the issue with them putting non cosmetic items on the shop?
---
Despite them saying it would be cosmetic only?
---
I only suggest ads with the option to pay to remove them because otherwise it'd be a pay-to-win situation because app users would have an advantage over non app users.
---
I don't get too upset over a game even the RK's don't bother me too much I'd rather have fools pay for them than have to pay for add-on content. I worry we may get to that point especially since Beth is tight lipped about player numbers and profit from 76
---
Took me a while to realise why I had loads of canned meat stew but I do miss it 
---
Hopefully they are just doing a "maybe they'll like them after all!" Silence. Even though the Repair Kits don't bother me, it's what they mean for the future that makes me hope the backlash gets them removed. :( Fingers crossed aye!
---
No‚Äîwe were like two bullets crossing in the night...err, daylight.   
---
Where do you encounter this bot? And does it result in anything valuable, or just different dialogue?
---
FYI - Shotgun ranges are broken in 3rd person. A quad explosive will kill you at the very edge of your sniper rifle range if you don't have cover. 
---
But you could do this too . You get atom points for free so if you are the only one without a repair kit , it‚Äôs your own dumb fault 
---
I loved the Gauss in prior versions of the game, in this one sadly its mechanics even with all the right perks is just still a bit too tame and too long in between shots if you have to hold a charge between each then you may as well go black powder dragon and do double that damage.  
---
I'm primarily a rifle/sniper player, I don't usually care for heavy weapons or Melee but after spending the first 100 levels trying to go rifle build and being underpowered I'm having to start really experimenting with other weapon types. 
---
Shotgun is a viable build and probably what I'd recommend. 
---
Automatic weapons are good against enemies but still pretty nerfed in PVP because there's a stagger delay in between time it accepts damage to prevent one shotting, often auto will trigger this as too much damage and too fast which gives someone even more chances to retaliate and you can do nothing. 
---
You wanna try to get sneak attacks which does 2.5 times more dmg with right perks and of course sneak perk in agility 
---
Anti armor explosive 50 cal
---
OK, thanks, going to try and gather some more data, you are the 2nd person who gets Under-armor plans but has not dropped the paint.  
---
I don't want to jump to conclusions, but I am starting to see a pattern. 
---
This is my hw/PA/explosives build (used with a low health build, thus nerf rage; swap it for 5/5 Gunsmith if you aren‚Äôt ready for low health). 
---
Yep, I also don't care about repair kits, but am worried that they will take microtransaction further.
---
Please write to me privately so I could share with you one cool information piece. I can't buy it as there's no crossplay, might as well help you make your day even better.
---
I can't speak for everyone, but after my son bought me the game to play together (which didn't work for some reason, I thought it was because we were account sharing, doesn't seem to matter), it went on sale hard and I took advantage and got an account and the game for my oldest daughter because I want to love it with her. (Still, didn't work, but that's off topic).
---
Not if they made it so you don't get the perk cards until a certain level, which they pretty much already did. I don't remember what level I got the first lockpicking &amp; hacking cards, but when I did, I didn't get the second one for like another 5 or so levels. In that sense, it's still tiered, so it still doesn't make any sense to do the cards this way.
---
I mean pvp 
---
Just to add, I have not learned the other vendor bought BOS Underarmor plans, which seems to be a pre-requisite to dropping shielded via tech data. 
---
6 months after the games release, an entire weapon type is useless and bugged. A weapon type that was just fine in Fallout 3, New Vegas, and with few bugs in 4. Strange happenings here in Appalachia.
---
Oh my goodness it's only after you've said that that I realise how much I want different camo patterns for the tents we can build! ;D
---
This. I just did it on a L37 character, got the L45 gun. Gave it to my mule. 
---
I have the chest piece mod which reduces the magnitude of staggers, hopefully that helps. 
---
You keep being you! My buddies level 15 alt killed a level 112 "professional bounty hunter" yesterday. I'm still laughing about it.
---
1. Gunsmith for guns. Makeshift Warrior for Melee. 
---
2. Power Patcher for Power armor, but you generally won't need it. Power armor durability is generally quite good, even if you use your PA all the time. 
---
3. My understanding is that the Deathclaw gauntlet and Moleminer gauntlet only benefit from Iron fist (unarmed). I really should double check that. 
---
The new storyline quest with sheepsquatch and stuff
---
Some of the raiders did. The die-hards, I think. The ones who looked out for non-raiders and didn't kill their victims
---
One is the traveling responder vendor that you can often get to spawn near Charleston train station, by the farm on the lake. 
---
The other one just gives you random "aid" loot if you're a responder and in appropriate gear. (Police, military, and bos stuff doesn't trigger it but actual responder named gear does). 
---
Other responder bots will give you verbal responses if you're in responder gear but haven't found anything else unlockable that way. 
---
I've gotten the Officer and the Soldier plans, but have never gotten the shielded plan. On a side note, I've also gotten the field scribe, engineer, fatigues and bomber jackets(2x) outfits.
---
It does seem for a "survival" game that there's not alot of prepper style things we can use/build.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm gonna do.   I‚Äôm new to furious so I also need to work out if the damage multiplier works with non vats shots.
---
A sorry emote would be great. Hey dude that randomly appeared, sorry you got hit by that missile because you went melee. I don't want to fight!
---
You launch the nuke so the edge of the zone is just on the fissure site, then fight her outside the nuke zone so theres no rads
---
Or better yet, no Atoms at all!!! 
---
I don't think the 60hr yield is true. I've noticed that the only time I've gotten anywhere near that is when I installed one in a workshop boundary in water. In my own camp I was lucky to get 10/hr. Why on hold 5 if 60/he is the yield?
---
I thought you meant for a second that they accidentally reverted it and was excited.
---
Play on PC. If you haven‚Äôt experienced the mods.... it‚Äôs a life changer. I flat out don‚Äôt play when Perk Loadout Manager gets broken by patches, I just wait for it to be fixed. 
---
Since survival came out I have had one friendly interaction and it was when I stumbled onto a level 6 as a level 140. All others were shoot first encounters.
---
Thank you!
---
Now I need learn how to calculate if I've reached full damage and could afford to use a 2 or even a 1 point Tank Killer card instead of needing all three points in it?
---
This is what I'm guessing. I built five or six, but I've considered taking a few down and timing it out to see if this is the case.
---
Speaking from experience, my Furious/VATS crit combat rifle will crit kill you in no more than 1 magazine. I'm not bloodied either. I have sentinel assassin on a heavy weapons alt and the key is never to move but even then VATS is your enemy. If you can stay at max range though it will help immensely. 
---
p.s. Dense on the chest does help.
---
Dude.
---
My post was FIVE MONTHS AGO in the midst of a lot of anger and hatred towards bethesda. 
---
You're a little late to the reply party, and I don't think you really know what you were replying to. 
---
THIIIIIIIIIIS!
---
I saw some in the game already, so they have the texture?
---
For walls, they should all be the same but have the outer corners be a separate add in. So snap snap, 90¬∞ corner, snap goes the log ends for outside.
---
There should be two types of corners though, inside log ends and outside. One sticks out more than the other.
---
While we're at it, make corners for the brick, and CLEAN UP THE WALLS for God's sake, there's so much paint in the world but my perfect brick walls are plastered with the worst interior color; dirty stucco
---
I don't think so. I've never played the beta and still had this bug. I haven't check the challenge in a long time but the challenges said that I had learned less than 10 recipes in one hundred hours of gameplay, which is bullshit.
---
Thanks. 
---
Depends on the type of encounter. 
---
Executioners combat rifle 1\* is my goto at the moment...dont recall base damage but its 2x damage when enemy health is &lt; 40%.  
---
Took out 4x SBs back to back with it this weekend.
---
Prior to that was a marksmans hardened sniper rifle (90 dmg) or vampire lever 1\*.
---
faschnacht parade was a supressed 45 smg. (easier to get hits on the sloth)
---
Just picked up an antiarmor 45 smg 1\*, but haven't had the chance to try it.
---
I also have 2x ignore x% of enemy armor perk
---
The thought is there will be more holotapes as more DLC is released, so possible technically the quest hasn't been completed.

Good thing I just got the vault tec skin bundle, time to start saving up again

---
You don't want tank killer, you want Stabilized which is hiding in Intelligence. Stabilized gives you armor pen in power armor. High Voltage Jefe is your best friend and it's pretty easy to make for +15% damage 
---
My Kill the SBQ completed when I launched the nuke on her location and she was successfully killed.

Creating a board game from scratch is no easy feat.  There's rules, balancing, playtesting.  Then they have to program it, test it (HA!), and implement it.
---
Its a huge undertaking for little reward.  I know personally that I play video games to play video games.  I don't play video games to play board games.  I play board games for that.
---
Correct 
---
I agree totally, ur right, the ads should be an option
---
This is very true. I mean, I love all the elegant houses and awesome builds people have shown off, but I'd really like some grimy tents, campfires, sandbag walls, junk fences, etc. to give that 'crazy person with a shotgun' or 'covert forward observation post' look I crave :)
---
So someone has breached through the space station door and found a vault entrance in the past? Any links?
---
hmmmm.... propably it's too early to decide, they will change a lot after this beta.
---
I predict they nerf bloodied, but this doesnt affect my weapon decision right now.
---
Same here. I hope they add a feature to hide / show the backpack while wearing it.
---
Don‚Äôt buy it unless you like doing a bunch of nothing/ enjoy giving those useless items to new players just so you can make stupid posts about how great this game is. This game sucks don‚Äôt fucking buy it 
---
There are specific spots where enemies rarely spawn, or spawn and wander off in another direction, but these are rare, and highly specific spots.
---
I have my camp in the bog, and the vast majority of enemies don't bother my camp
---
They effectively are now, they used to not be but that was causing a lot of hit detection issues and at some point they changed them to be hitscan, or at least near enough to hitscan that I can‚Äôt tell the difference. 
---
I went to someone's camp yesterday and they have 3 industrial purifier in the dirt and not by any water
---
&gt;One gun army does enough of the heavy lifting that stabilized really doesn't add too much.
---
One gun army has a  4% stagger chance and a 12% chance to cripple a limb.  Stabilized has a 100 percent chance of ignoring 45 percent of armor.
---
What is the deal with this? Is it going to be like the fasnacht masks, like an event drop? If so... this guy will says he got his bag from the event i bet...
---

Heavy leather is great for energy resistance, but metal armor offers significantly higher physical resistantce. So does trapper,which offers rad resist. I have a heavy metal chestplate that offers 100+ physical resistance when repaired to 200* I think heavy combat armor with the BOS material mod is the best tho, it gives ~70/~70 at 100% durability 
---
Have you learned the The BOS resistant lining plan, bought from a Vendor?  It looks like thats the trigger for the shielded to start dropping from Tech.  Its also starting to look like once you start to drop the Shielded the paint stops dropping. Hope I'm wrong, still gathering data. 
---
Well at least you cannot do that anymore. I was confused when I first did this shortly after release and wondering why all my ammo was gone.  Did not pay enough attention 
---
If you take out only the level 1 lockpicking or hacking perk cards, it makes the level 2 &amp; 3 cards obsolete. I've already tried this thinking that if all I had equipped was the level 3 card, I could pick/hack all levels leaving two slots open for two other perks. It didn't work. It wouldn't let me pick/hack anything. So you have to have all three equipped to pick/hack level 3,  at least the first two to pick/hack level 2, and at least the first one to pick/hack level 1. I haven't tried this again recently, so unless it's been changed in a patch, I'm assuming this is still the case.
---
I was doing it loads more when we all got it. 
---
Lost a power armor arm or two, though. :/
---
Make the mail system an event.
---
Thanks for being overly zealous in removing a post that references something (god forbid, apparently). There are far too many posts that simply ignore rule #6 and aren't removed, but whatever.
---
After a certain point, the only real reason to craft is for scrapping/learning mods.
---
I built in the Ash Heap just west of Lewisburg. My camp is also constantly under attack, but never from legendaries. Ive traveled to my camp to see rival groups fighting it out to see who ultimately gets to attack my camp. Super mutants, ghouls, flies, mole miners, mole rats, scorched, and even scorch beasts (3 at once, that was fun).
---
How many people actually have mule accounts? Seems like an expensive convenience. 
---
I had that place too! But the damn supermutants kept breaking my stuff. Lol
---
There was an exploit where people would consume 100+ bobbleheads and become insanely OP. They would disconnect and rejoin and the timer of the bobbleheads would be reset. 
---
Haha I farmed a bit. Hit a level n a bit, then got off. It was almost 5am mind u!
---
I have a one extra bos plan, and it happens to be legs.
---
It is worse for me, i have to carry you and tony too... Eyoooooo

Just need to find a recipe for it
---
I know the "nuke the edge" trick. I don't have any unyielding sentinal gear yet, just unyielding.
---
I've gotta say, waiting until I got a bloodied deathclaw to drop "naturally" is really nice. I had to completely switch up how I played. 
---
PC?
---
Okay, thanks! Good to know the quest is supposed to remain in the pipboy. The timer definitely didn't run out though, it still had 15+ minutes left when it just vanished from my screen. I'll give it one more shot and see what happens.
---
Correct, I believe Tank Killer is only for rifles. That's why I switched it out for Stabilized myself.
---
7600/24 = 316 Days
---
Not as long as you'd think.
---
Nope, seems they are just trying things out. It might work, it might not. 
---
This may seem long, but at nearly 1000 hours of gameplay, I've learned a lot, and I'm still learning new tricks.
---
1. Under the Intelligence tree; Gunsmith affects durability of all guns except Pipe guns (Use Licensed Plumber for those), and Makeshift Warrior affects Melee Weapons (Unarmed not affected, I have tested this thoroughly on a DC Gauntlet).
---
2. Power Patcher (Under Intelligence) Affects both Durability and Repair Costs for PA (Doesn't seem that affective, or needed for durability, but saves materials when repairing)
---
3. Unarmed Weapons "Do Not" benefit from any Melee specific Strength Perks , but do benefit from " Iron Fist" (In Strength). Also they do seem to be affected by Intelligence Perks "Ninja" and "Mister Sandman" (Still testing the latter).
---
Bonus Info: "Fix It Good" perk allows you to repair any Armor/Power Armor to 200%, and "Weapon Artisan" Allows you to repair any weapon to 200%, Also repairing above 100% increases the Damage for Melee &amp; Unarmed Weapons. 
---
For Armor, "Studded Leather" can be crafted for any level, and will provide better protection than most any Legendary you will find for levels below 35, It can also be Deep Pocketed providing an additional 50 lbs. (10 each piece) of Carry capacity.

That robobrain just refuses to get played like a Skyrim NPC.

Can wooden armor have more than one star? I've never seen it

For furious it doesn't matter. As long as they are consecutive shots on the same target, it should proc.
---
I‚Äôm primarily gonna use it as a shotgun, so that‚Äôs fine by me.  Really just want a good close range weapon for when those Vaults open up.
---
No. Nor do bonus points from mutations add to the number of perks you can equip.
---
Yes. 
---
If you are stealth the Instigating explosive lever action will work great, base dmg 2x on first hit + 2.50x dmg from stealth + VATS crit.
---
Without the VATS crit i can kill almost all mobs with 1 hit.
---
This is probably a super newb question but when I tried to do feed the event I got stuck because I couldn‚Äôt find the fuse box. Where the hell is the fuse box?
---
Instigating Gatling gun, it's slow but very accurate for me if you fire in bursts.
---
Creepy but really cool. I hope he isn't so BAAAHHHDDD.
---
It's also an awesome spot for flux. I've nuked there several times and a team of 4 with the right perks can end up with 80+ Stable Violet Flux.
---
Mine is not explosive, but I've seen it go as high as ~700 dmg per shot when my hp is at or below 20%. Could possibly go higher, but this is the highest it's been when I've looked.
---
A voice assistant that could do some nifty thing would be a great addition for PA, currently with the lack of legendary effects on it, and the usage of fusion cores PA feels very underpowered and useless aside from being a pack mule. Some buff or gimmicky addition like the above would be a good thing.
---
No confirmed 3* wood items so far, to the best of my knowledge 
---
So, where did you come across this image..?
---
No, if your Special stat is higher then the penalty you can still use all perk cards your default special can handle.
---
however ive noticed that if something boosts or lowers charisma to a number outside of your normal special it can impact perk card sharing. Example -
---
if you have 5 charisma and use magnetic personality with a friend to bump it to 6, the game will let you share rank 2 perk cards. before shortly un-sharing them
---
Umm.....15-4 is 11.   On a side note, yes, you will be able to equip 15 Strength cards, you just will lose the added carry weight from the -4 strength.  
---
Please feel free to report posts with clickbait titles. Your post was deleted by the automoderator after it received several reports.
---
I was very critical of survival mode when it came out specifically the spawn killing glitch.  Now that it‚Äôs been resolved I‚Äôve gone in a few times to play in that environment. 
---
Overall, it‚Äôs been a fun/different experience as I always have my guard up and finding myself really watching everything I do including where and how I move and how I attack others or defend myself. 
---
My last death (other than losing 300+caps) was to a person that literally came within feet of me and both of us were in stealth mode.  I hesitated and got shot but it easily could have gone the other way. 
---
In adventure I play a completely different game but in survival grenades and mines are your friend.  It‚Äôs one way to equalize the one shot sentinel types or the overpowered PA types. 
---
There aren‚Äôt power armor plans besides enclave and ultracite. The comment you responded to was one hundred and twenty two days ago.
---
This is a glitch that was made when they fixed hot swapping after a weapon breaks. 
---
Thanks! 
---
My fully specced non legendary pipe revolver does 112 damage. It has the same accuracy and range as the hunting rifle, with cheaper repairs and ammo. I have other weapons, but this has been my main for this entire playthrough
---
I too have never discovered the Grafton Dam, though, I have tested this theory while completely clearing.. the Grafton Damn, inside and out. 
---
I need a "the in game mic sucks and dosnt work, here is discord so I can tell you one thing" emote
---
The woman who does the overseer, Rose and many more has for me at least, an incredibly grating voice.
---
It's so...atonal. Not at all melodic.
---
Agreed. What I really want to know is who I'm paying to win against? We're all - either solo or with friends - playing at our own pace. If it was Fortnight where the playtime goes in sessions, I could understand. But I don't care if someone my level has done more or less of the game than me. 
---
Perk slots are based on your base SPECIAL stats, and you can't add extra and aren't forced to remove extra depending on any temporary effects.
---
Those were bugged and were never supposed to have the key. You have to go through a fun little mini-quest to get it. 
---
I have a small sample size as I‚Äôve only gone in a few times.  I‚Äôve killed 5 and have been killed once.  Unlike adventure when I choose to enter survival I assume everyone is hostile and play that way.  
---
I imagine it is the result of us constantly nuking the landscape.
---
I went from doing that event frequently to never bothering because it didn't really help anyone any more
---
GG bethesda
---
I love this idea, but I will probably just choose whether or not to have a backpack due to asthetics, I'm one of those people who only carry 30 pounds of things with them, despite being able to carry 215. 
---
Or make it responder markings, red and blue like a cop car or EMT.
---
Its a post-niclear apocalypse with mutated creatures running around. And multiple races of aliens as of 76. What's impossible?
---
The problem is you're a really big, noisy and squishy target in PVP that I know I can VATS.
---
I‚Äôd like to see a soot covered variant.  These were used in mines after all.
---
I haven't forgotten you, I get to where I'm bnearly done with the list and I find more lol, for now I can tell you that, aside from on top of the monorail tower (west of watoga, 10 bags) there's 4 in blackwater mines.
---
Blackwater Mine
---
*Inside building with bot, there's a yellow sink and eyewash stations to the right. Turn right as you enter to face wall and walk all the way to it.
---
*Face right again, on the wall in front of you now theres a metal shelf, to the left of that, against the wall, on the floor is bag 1.
---
*Load through mine door, head straight down the shaft, over the (highly irradiated) bridge and find double doors on right, enter.
---
*Pass the weapons station on left, through another door, head up steps.
---
*Face right, go up those steps.
---
*Face left, enter next room.
---
*Face left again and go up steps there. At the rail, on the floor, 3 bags.
---
It might seem a little long winded, but I hate nondescript directions, so I'm trying to explain according to how I'd prefer it.
---
So far my entire list (including the mentioned sites) includes 30 bags and 19 gnomes from 10 main locations. A few we pass every day!
---
It definitely would be a welcome change.
---
I'm playing without mods. Just plain old vanilla.
---
Not true. 
---
It works in my Guass rifle just fine. 
---
That's where I nuke when I steal someone's nuke. 
---
Well that makes sense. Like the enclave production terminal not having the next plan until you buy the previous lining.
---
I make time to play around 4-6pm EDT and whenever I can on the weekends (for certain 5-7 am Sat/Sun).  I've been solo forever (Lvl 86) and looking for new quests. GT: PickledSandwich
---
Thanks lemme try that 
---
Rad-X diluted to not inhibit your mutations (I assume you have mutations and are using starched genes) will help with the up-close rads. If your build allows it, serendipity and dodgy are must haves if you are the only one pulling aggro. You won't be able to power attack as much as your AP is your shield.
---
Can't wait until my workshop is actually attacked by one
---
And then Bethesda will probably ninja nerf it so that way not everyone can have an easier time killing SBQ
---
that's good to hear.  
---
I'm split.  In my mind is this really pay to win?  Does a repair kit really give you a "winning" advantage over me?  I don't think so.  I now have 2 toons over lvl 200 and I can count on one hand how many times I have ever "broken" something and in every situation I have had a 2nd weapon on me avail.  
---
But, 2 things bother me about this.  The first being as long as a repair kit isn't a necessary item to complete something in the game, then I'm ok.  The second is this "could" lead to more significant problems.  If they get this past us then whats to keep them from eventually giving us actual items in the ATOM shop that really can make a difference like weapon mods, or enhancements.  
---
Again I personally don't think the repair kit is a "Pay to win" but they did say ONLY cosmetic items would be in the ATOM shop.  If Bethesda really wanted to turn this thing on it's head and look like heroes, make the repair kit an in-game recipe to be found and give us 5 of them for free in the ATOM shop to promote it.      
---
I've not personally experienced this in Xbox, but off topic a little, why do people feel SBQ is endgame?
---
"It'll rust your armor" *to be read in the same voice as "you'll shoot your eye out"*
---
I have a 55in Magnavox, and my menus are the same, just a little bit off screen. It's odd that there's no way to set your view area, I feel like that's been sort of standard for quite a few years now.
---
Don‚Äôt feed this ^^ troll....
---
Oh wait, never mind üëÄ
---
Only cus you buy the OP weapons and armour and steal peoples loot bags
---
You can get plans to buff that and the marine wetsuit.  The under armor uses lots of ultracite,, the marine armor uses ballistic cloth and steel I think.
---
Yeah same, my heavy guns are th lightest weapons i carry
---
You did good.
---
They‚Äôre Pez dispensers. Or like those M&amp;M candy canes. 
---
Guns with fast fire rate (semi auto) are good for vats. That's a lot of the reason people are looking for handmades right now on the trade subs.
---
I like pistols for vats. But you need one with anti armor. You also can't mod silencers on any but the 10mm...at least to my knowledge. So they get outclassed pretty quickly imo.
---
I would look for any of these:
---
-combat rifle
---
-assault rifle
---
-handmade
---
-or a pipe rifle if it has good legendary perks
---
You can run vats on these in full auto but they are ammo hogs.
---
^ ^
---
HeY KiDz WaNnA bUy SuM dUpEsZ?!?
---
We have no clue on that yet. It think we'll just be able to reroll,not add effects.
---
There should be a mission marker for it, but it's off in the little loading dock rooms off the main room on the first floor.
---
Trust me i can tell you as a high level player we go down just as easily to someone who has built their character for pvp, then the losses very quickly stack up
---
I saw somewhere, before they implemented it, they said they were testing the idea out for feedback.
---
I don't feel like it's game breaking to have repair kits available for purchase to get ahead. It's hardly an advantage over others if someone is ignorant enough to run into any nuke zone with only one gun.
---
Plus, if it's a heavy Gunner who's pulling a lot of weight on the damage, why wouldn't we be okay if he wanted to be sure he killed it?
---
Yeah sure fullHACKferg with your stolen legs
---
I get the feeling the game is not far from going over the edge into stupidville. Pretty sure we dont need legendary power armor. 
---
 What are other end game choices? Farming whitesprings for chance of useful legendary?
---
I could take it or leave it. I only do this mission every now and again to restock on dog food (Good Doggy perk) if I happen to be running low, because there seems to be at least four or five cans in there during the event (but not at other times).
---
Err. Your solution is the current implementation? When you unlock a perk you are free to continue to rank it up forever onwards. Therefore having an overarching 'lockpick' would allow complete access shortly after being unlocked
---
Bethesda plz wood3* items unobtainable from typical loot pools for people like me
---
Can pick it up for the price of a fast food dinner, what‚Äôs to loose really, if you can‚Äôt afford it now I doubt you have internet anyway.
---
This is why they work in teams to grief other players. They are farming caps that way. 
---
Fallout 3 Remake ;)
---
Raising my hand in firm, 100% solidarity with this. The fact that the Atoms are for strictly cosmetic things is the only reason I tolerate the system's existence. 
---
Repair kits = less resources.
---
I spend most of my time in-game acquiring resources.
---
These are "decrease timer" microtransactions wrapped in fancy packaging.
---
I'm the only one of my circle playing Fallout 76. In that circle, there are five other people who had played 3, New Vegas, and 4; there is one other person who has only played 4, but I am 100% positive would play 76 if at least one or two of the others started playing it first. 
---
Making the Atoms strictly for cosmetics is the \*\*ONLY\*\* step forward. If you change it, I'll stop playing. If you change it BACK to cosmetics-only and admit your mistake, I'll go back to playing. I'd be happy to reward you for admitting that you made a mistake and undoing a bad decision.
---
But maybe let's save some time and just \*not even get to that point.\*
---
Cosmetics.
---
Only.
---
Period.
---
There are a couple bugs like this in PVP which might be related. I've experienced the VATS bug multiple times where I couldn't damage someone VATS who was shooting at me. I think it has something to do with "fix" to fast travel invulnerability and they respawned within the last couple minutes? 
---
We had a group that moved a camp next to where we were leveling at WestTek yesterday and I could not cause any damage in VATS for some period of time after they respawned. We only had a rough idea of where their CAMP was and it would take them a good 20-30 seconds to get back to us. Aiming from the hip or down the sight worked fine.
---
id be okay if it was even just 1 free can to every player on the server.
---
Hm, dodgy. If martial artist doesn't apply to power attacks that may make sense.
---
I've learned everything up to Protected.
---
Also, the chameleon glitch is annoying as the person is invisible until they crouch. That needs to be fixed as well.
---
I‚Äôd like to suggest that bethesda add a plastic crunching sound when you use them, so it really sounds like we‚Äôre taking a big old chomp
---
Man I love data miners for games. I don't mind the silver one but I'm not super excited for them. 
---
Does anyone think they'll release halloween skins?
---
ikr. endgame is what you make it. My endgame is building camps and securing the golf club for equal fair farming. That means destroying any camps designed to auto farm the golf club.
---
But recently I joined a BoS discord group. its really cool. they give us weekly missions, and we can get points on various things to rank up. This opened up the game so much for me.
---
They have lowered the price of a lot of the new items in the shop, though. Best tip, wait for bundles and sales. 
---
Yes, they appear to have been removed from Forbidden Knowledge drops and treasures a couple patches back, but they do spawn in the world.
---
I finally got the BOS Arms Plan a few days back, and a friend also got the Legs plan from the same location;
---
Standing in front of Pleasant Valley Lodge, facing Top of the World, between them on the left is a little street vendor booth, and the plans spawn on a bookshelf. If you server hop without picking up the plan that you see there, you will see different plans each time, but if you pick it up, you won't see another plan there for 20 hours.
---
\*gate leads to hytloth 5\*
---
\*dies\*
---
Ahh, good ol times ;)
---
This would be amazing.
---
As opposed to a small squishy target in PVP that I can target without it. So what? 
---
Are you referring to just rad damage, or damage overall? Rad shield is always good, and it seems easier to farm the mats now that alcohol recipes also call for the strangler blooms.
---
Let me understand you, you want me to make all the effort to allow everyone else to gain free food? They want it, they can make the effort.
---
I take of Picklock (not master/expert) all the time and have rank 2 lock picking.  It is usually the lock pick I swap when need Green Thumb real quick.
---
I also pick lock 1 with Expert only equipped as it's the first in the list of perk cards.  (Saves scroll time when swapping).
---
You only need a combination of any of the 3 cards equipped to pick a lock of the appropriate level, they don't appear to need to go in order.  It's been like this for some time as I have been doing it this way ever since I got the 3 cards and had to swap in/out with my rifleman and green thumb perks as needed.
---
I‚Äôm near white spring station, sometimes I get dogs, wolves, ghouls, scorched and super mutants.
---
You can't target what you can't see and people in Assassin's Sent/Cav or spamming stealth boys are much harder to kill. Just my experience... PA is for PVE.
---
Top of the World middle level already looks like a hub. How about there?
---
Same build with a bloodied vats crit dragon... doing 700+ dmg without sneak and crit added
---
I have gotten 6 shielded plans whilst getting BoS paints.
---
Haven't hit West Tek yet ... but I was just playing with my son last night.   I checked and my main two weapons (lever action, and a power fist), were in 'basically healed' condition.    Went from Mega Rocket walking over to the various Bunker's on those quests ... by the time I went through a pile of scorched at the Halloween House, and a quad of level 46 Gulpers near the model house ... my lever action AND my power fist were both broken.    Left us screwed w/ 1 Gulper left, me down to a sniper-crossbow I use to conserve ammo (I'm level 48 right now), and my son (level 16 - who I'd drug along with me, since we'd been working on his quests earlier) ... Ended up dying a lot.  Running.   Sneaking back for my junk.   Then having to go make supply runs for the adhesive &amp; screws needed to fix all our equipment.   Before heading back.   Meant we had like 1hr of questing with 3hrs of running/panicking/scrounging-parts just to get fixed back up.
---
i would like it but that would lead to that 1 body vanishing, all your loot gone, or you dont know which body it is.
---
I have enjoying survival for the most part. I ended up unluckily running into high players three times in a row and got all my junk and aid taken after each time I got killed. Check my aid and I have literally none now, even though I had like 20+ of most useful things, at least 60+ stimpacks, and over 200 purified waters. I think you should lose some aid items when you die, but I think losing 60 stimpacks and 200 waters because I got killed three times is kinda ridiculous. 
---
I have the same problem. I could get all other locations with a second character, except Grafton dam. Will try soon with a third. 
---
I've learned BoS Shielded (bought it from someone) and still beeing rewarded with T-60 paints - until now I've got Knight SGR, so looking for 3 left - Paladin, Officer and Elder.
---
Until the devs fix it - and in all honesty I hope they never do or at least they don't do it until all the other hundreds of bugs have been fixed - RadShield does not block mutations.
---
And you could stock up on nuka cola for AP regeneration
---
I have about 150 hours in and love the game. That said, I talked 3 of my friends into buying it and none of them played it for more than 10 hours. So, I guess it's not for everyone. Also, I'm pretty upset about the impending 'repair kit' implementation in the atom shop. I have mot played since they announced it and if they proceed with it, I will not play the game again.
---
I tried Survival this weekend for the first time becuse of the "double XP" weekend.  Obviously, this was BGSs plan which was a good one.  
---
Like others I felt like I had no need for PvP on this game, I typically don't enjoy it as I'm not great at it but have been feeling like I should start a new character in general and it seems like a good way to experience Survival mode without risking my aid and leveling up a new character quickly.
---
it was so different then I had imagined.  Every time I hear the sound of someone getting killed anxiety ratches up a notch.  I had many non-aggressive encounters and only a few PvP encounters.  Once I was the top spot on the leaderboards having been alive for over an hour.  a couple others I instigated and felt the thrill of fighting for my life and sometimes winning.  
---
Loosing all the junk and aid hurts but basically it makes the stash box more critical.  every now and then I would drop off most of my aid and the junk I want to keep likme screws, etc...
---
Overal a pretty cool experience where I was able to do a lot more of the quests than I had expected.  I will definitely be back to Survival in the future.  It was much better balanced than I expected.
---
To the degree that FO76 has a story, it's that the scorched plague and scorchbeasts wiped out the  post-bomb inhabitants of West Virginia. 
---
Therefore I'd say the two most important actions you take are: 
---
1. Curing the scorch plague, which you do early for yourself in the Responder storyline
---
2. Eliminate the SBQ to prevent further spread, as most of the factions aspired to do. Even the Raiders (Rosie) wanted the scorched gone. You're accomplishing what the BoS could not. 
---
Those are the critical steps to resettle the area and allow West Virginia to begin to heal. 
---
No, it wouldn't 
---
It's just a playtime counter. People are being hilariously willfully ignorant about this. You can just work an hour IRL and buy atoms, of course you're not literally supposed to play for 7600 hours.
---
I‚Äôve gotten several BOS Shielded plans and just got SGT yesterday 
---
I actually don't know and I wish I had the answer too.  The problem is her rads.  If you're going to melee her, you'll need to be right in the middle of that radiation.  The only solutions I know of are 1: Wear a Hazmat suit and/or accept that you're going to die a lot or 2: Have a friend to share RadSponge with, to keep the rads from killing you.  But 2 is obviously undesirable when you're Bloodied.  And as we all know, Power Armor has some magical property that banishes rads more effectively than any degree of Rad-X/RadShield/Rad Resist armor can.
---
The SBQ didn't use to be like this.  As long as Drop Site V9 was open, you used to be able to go right up to her in Unarmed without problems.  But at some point, somewhere around Patch 5, she acquired this never-ending rad cloud around her.  It may be intentional, or it may be her cropdusting attack failing to turn off.  Who knows.
---
I'm guessing their code can't support this. Looting one thing now is often slow or buggy, with loot lists appearing in "pieces". (For example, kill a boss, see he has 4 bullets and a pistol, wait 2 seconds, now he also has a boss quality drop and a stimpack)
---
With how delicate the servers seem to be, I doubt it will ever happen. 
---
It would be great though. 
---
I agree with this, Dodgy is definitely worth it. I have full AP regen armor plus all the perks and it always goes off. I tend not to use Blocker any more because there are so few melee in Survival.
---
how so?
---
As of late, not really. The only post response to this was just the mods saying how they need to tackle on how to combat flooding posts and that's about it.
---
I'm just guessing that we **may** (Not certain but a guess) get a response towards the backlash in tomorrows patch notes when the update rolls out. If not then well this weeks **may** (Again, a guess) "Inside the Vault" may have it.
---
It would pack the loot into all the bodies 
---
I had 5 Shielded Plans acquired before getting a single of the new Paints.  And I have now received all of the new paints up to Elder.
---
So no.  I do not believe that getting the Shielded Lining plan makes you unable to get the Paints.  They are just rare (Between Paladin and Elder I turned in over 50 tech data).
---
Pretty much any decent build will be competent enough in PvP. Equipment is more of a determining factor as well as tactics, get ambushes you win 9/10 times, get ambushed well... 
---
You'll probably want general damage perks and a few of the stronger defense perks. Serendipity is a popular one, fireproof for reducing explosion damage. Lone wanderer if solo. Lifegiver if good if you have the points to spare as its a pretty direct durability increase. 
---
If you want the best build then look up some optimized builds, but those builds don't really improve performance much in my opinion as PvP is very broken right now with damage being super high and a few legendary equipment combos being very strong defensively.
---
ü§î Hmmm, OK, I'll keep an eye and an ear out. Cheers! 
---
This would arguably connect a lot of dots in the fallout lore.
---
I never claimed it was mine, this was on the fo76 discord and since nobody knew about it I decided to spread the word
---
Honestly:  Just make an easier way to see all the events that are happening.  Make them show up on your quest list (optionally) ... or make a list of them on the map, instead of you randomly scrolling.  
---
And most of all, SHOW A TIMER!  I used to love jumping into random events.   Until I got tired of paying 50-some caps to fast travel to an event ... just to find out that it was ending in 2 minutes and zero possibility of me completing it now.    So now, unless I'm near an event, I don't bother.
---
My view is that there is no real endgame. There's a point where you've done about everything (even after 1100 hrs of slow gameplay on ONE toon and nearly 80 camp plants), I still find more locations, learning new plans, and meet/help new people, and have 2 different builds I have yet to try Even then other stuff can be done that develops organically. Especially when we're getting more and more content.
---
I recently started a small store selling serums made to order. It's been a really cool experience for me!
---
I just don't see SBQ as an endgame, but I play a lot like I did in 4, and it eventually DID have a true endgame. Though I continued because of mods.
---
O was actually thinking about building one hiring some people to stand guard and hiring vendors to sell there 
---
what will be the range? Some areas are big 
---
I just want markers!  I‚Äôm sick of spending so much time looking in y‚Äôall grass for supermutants.  Last night I had to go swimming to the bottom of a pond to loot the scorchbeast I shot down. Took a while to find him. 
---
People play nice during events (not sure, can you even attack one another if you're in an event? Seems like it teams you up), but outside of that... assume everyone is hostile. I've waved at someone, had them wave back, only to be shot in the back by them a few minutes later when they had a tactical advantage. Now I'm always hostile.
---
But if I wear hazmat armor I have to take off my unyielding armor...
---
That's why I run a chameleon bloodied sniper build. I kill you before you see me. If you see me, I'm dead. Lol
---
&gt; people in Assassin's Sent/Cav  
---
And almost no one has a full set of either.  Everyone  on her claims to, just like everyone claims to bench press 300 pounds in weight lifting forums. 
---
looking at sheer numbers, the marine armor gives great stats *for its weight*. the only armor that is lighter is wood. *but* you gotta use the ultra light mod on each piece. the thing is, im cool taking a DR drop, with all my heavy weapons, im not taking damage too much, but the marine armor *durability* is garbage. i mean, one good jaunt out into the wilderness and back, my 160% armor is down to 70%~, the torso piece being the worse. ballistic fabric doesnt just grow on trees mafk! (guess whos switching armor types today)
---
However much they want it to be
---
Thanks Pluto. I'll look for you tonight.
---
OK now you know authors please add them, it will be right thing to do. We got proofs if needed 
---
owww you want the bioschock suit....
---
Great news, thanks for the input. Looks like its simply bad luck!
---
Crikey! I have never experienced this myself... guess that's how long since the last time I bothered with her.
---
She did have a small amount of 'residual radiation' like all SBs and scorched creatures do but nothing major.
---
It‚Äôs great. And it‚Äôs on sale everywhere deff worth the buy. 
---
thats why i said endgame is what you make it. There is no real endgame. 
---
Honestly I only see repair kits even being handy in SBQ fights. If you have the 200% repair perk and use more than one weapon repairs aren't usually too bad. I have 3 heavy guns, and 2 melee weapons. I normally only repair once or twice a week probably about 5 gameplay hours between them. 
---
I wouldn't waste my atom on them. Just bring an extra gun. 
---
Civil war era top hat sellinng
---
Do **nothing** but farm for 3* god roll weapons/armor. During the 12 months it takes you to find one, you should have accumulated max caps.
---
Well if it's going to be only these PA Legendary effects, I think they'll server well, because they're not too OP but also useful. I wonder how Low weight would work , because if that's affecting the actual base pounds of the PA piece, then that won't see much use except quick swapping PA parts. Another possibility would mean that if you fall from a high place, you'd either just glide down or not have that super hero landing animation, which gets annoying half the time with marsupial XD, but I think it'll most likely just affect the base pound weight, which I guess it isn't that bad.
---
And Unbreakable just speaks for itself XD
---
Ok
---
I guess I'm looking at it from outside the story based endgame then? 
---
I just scratch my head when people say "welp, queens dead, games over, off to a different game".
---
Sell to players not vendor bots.
---
Bots are the gamestop of the fallout world.
---
400c for God roll sentinel chest piece 
---
The only thing I sell to the bots is Halloween costumes for 60c each
---
When they eventually have such the faction vendors represented at Whitesprings (not sure if this is tomorrow or coming with "player vending" next month), I believe this will happen on its own.  Whitesprings is already a location where some number of players are hanging out, and if you put all the vendors there, there will be little reason to fast travel anywhere else.
---
I like your thinking
---
yes!!! i saw that, and i thought, no way it is the best, the game is trying to trick us!
---
Ok thanks I will do that. 
---
This is true though. I had to replay to do some of the starting missions and get to level 10. I‚Äôm missing out on a hundred+ atoms of challengers that I know I‚Äôve done. 
---
I cant say i have done but i will do, thanks :)
---
They key with Furious is having it paired with VATS crit. That effect significantly changes the crit damage. My first hit in PVP staggers, the next shot does minimal damage and the 3rd is always another crit that usually ends the fight. It's a rare combo and works best on a combat rifle as those are a lot more VATS friendly. I use my 3\* Furious combat rifle over my AAE handmade except at long range where I can't VATS.
---
Also, if you're not a VATS user, Furious is likely garbage.
---
It‚Äôs well worth it. Really fun with plenty of content. If you like building forts you‚Äôre in for a fun in just the c.a.m.p. Alone. I‚Äôve spent hours just building and changing my camp. 
---
For my melee non-PA bloodied build, I used glowing blood packs and/or Diluted Rax-X, along with frequent use of Diluted RadAway, and didn't have much trouble with the queen's rads. I got dropped by damage once, but thankfully someone revived me. 
---
Wandering an inch into the nuke zone, on the other hand, is instant death. 
---
Absolutely nothing is impossible in the FOverse.
---
I just found it interesting about actual shrimp in a river in WV is all.
---
not anymore...
---
It so annoying to try to join a friend and then you have to force restart your computer to get back into the game. 
---
This, I hit antique store daily about 1/3 times it‚Äôs bugs 
---
I'm not bloody but I am chameleon and as long as I'm hiding in a bush you're dead. If you see me... where do I respawn? ;)
---
Build nothing but water purifiers and sell it all you make bank that way 
---
OMG LOL the third one
---
One good weapon or armor piece can fetch a nice amount on the trade subs. In the meantime scavenge and bulk up your junk and sell it to the vendors or players.
---
Thanks for the tip
---
The issue seems to be triggered when one of the characters is near their Max weight limit, or is suffering from Dehydration/Hunger.
---
I have encountered the problem with my Vendor characters, and been able to fix it by reducing weight, or feeding/hydrating them every time.
---
"Wearing this?" \*points to drill\*
---
"Wearing only this."
---
Adding an item degradation system to the game that hinders your experience and then selling repair kits in the Atom shop is an EA-level type of scam. Fuck this game and fuck Bethesda, I'm out.
---
so if i kill ghouls at golf club, then hit the shops then the villas. the villas are a decent distant distance from the club, but the trail of bodies would extend that range, no doubt causing a lag loading up all the loot.
---
Or player trades. I made 17k caps (15.5k profit) from two trades, in two days. Of course, after a few smaller trades, I was at max caps, and then blew 22k getting plans and a final armor piece.
---
Do you know how much it would take to sell out all vendors
---
Modern weapons makes this a whole new game. No more tanking anything, if it sees you first you might die. 
---
If your on Xbox I‚Äôm happy to give you a load of civil war top hats , they sell for around 40 caps each to help with daily vendor runs (200 caps each from the different faction bots) 
---
my camp rarely get attacked, 
---
ne free legendarys for me
---
FYI: pres "repair all" option on your CAMP thingie and you dont have to rebuild, doesnt fix all to full but good enough most of the time
---
Sure
---
Long ago in a wasted land; I, Aku, the shape shifting master of radiation, unleashed an unspeakable evil. But a foolish vault-dwelling wanderer wielding a TSE weapon stepped forth to oppose me. Before the final shot was fired, I nerfed his weapon, ended duping, and flung him into Survival mode where my evil is law. Now the fool seeks to return to the vault and undo the future that is Aku.
---
I don‚Äôt think that it actually does. I have a tse two star handmade and added scorched killer to it. Still a two star 
---
Ideally it won‚Äôt fast travel you miles away into a pile of glowing when you‚Äôre level 22 :) 
---
Ah man, I was a hard pkk in UO... until some huge undead event wiped put the city I lived by.
---
The devs are trolling the player. It's a two edge sword you see. On one hand they WANT us playing for many years to come. However, if one were to actually spend 7600 hours in-game, that would be tremendous amount of time spent playing a single video game. They don't really want to reward that.  It's akin to the Go Get Some Sun achievement in COD. Albeit much worse. So yeah, it think it should be 10 atoms to be honest. All this coming from a guy who's put nearly 500 hours in. ü§£
---
It's a model swap, apparently coming from the Russian fallout discord
---
With lv3 hard bargainer it takes 40 too self out a vendor but you'll be getting so much water that it actually broken build 4 industrial purifiers and you'll earn back what you sold in two hours.
---
I respectfully disagree and I cannot bench press 300 lbs. ;)
---
I would love for the backpacks to have perk card slots for utility perks so you can equip an extra 15 points of cards but you would have to earn the points to add to your pack by completing events. and then have skins for your backpack like clothing so they can look different.    
---
Yeah, the last time I did it, I was taking in about 8 rads/sec.  It's not standing-in-the-middle-of-a-nuke-zone bad, but it's notable enough that you're going to keep popping RadAway the whole time you're standing there... and if you draw her aggro and are trying to maintain 20% for Nerd Rage and Bloodied, good luck.
---
I think having more events creating server wide benefits would be a great way to get people doing events that otherwise are NEVER run. Also, scale enemies appropriately.
---
Wow ok. But haven‚Äôt they put some cap on your water purifiers like they stop producing until you collect the 2 it‚Äôs made
---
I would love to be able to drop my rifle weight from 20 to lower than 10. 
---
A Vault Dweller can dream.
---
As another poster said, Civil War Era Top Hats.
---
Crafting one only costs one cloth, but it sells for 20-30 caps at the vendors. So you can just mass produce them and sell them off to quickly hit your vendor cap quota for the day. 
---
5 an hour per industrial purifier. Your literally using the games own mechanics against its self. 
---
You can use raider PA at level 15
---
From my experience, even since beta it was never unplayable. You just have to think of it from the fact that it's a huge game and it will have issues. You can't expect a game like this to be perfect straight away
---
I would love it if tokens could be spent to level up weapons/armor.
---
Nothing quite as irritating as finding an amazing weapon or armor only to find its 30+ levels below you.
---
I can make 90 union hats (90 cloth) at once, they weigh 9 lbs total and I clear all vendors. Not the 240 lbs and hours of time it would take to collect and sell 240 water.
---
You mean the only roof in the game? Lol. We went from FO4 and too many roofs to FO76 and one style üòÇ
---
Real skins. My man. 
---
I think the game is using sex to attract players ü§£

I am fairly sure the point of this challenge is just to give you a place to track your time played.  Also they plan to support this game for 10 years (supposedly) so who knows.
---
yes please. 
---
Running into weird creatures is like one of my favorite things about this game. 
---
we nuke west Virginia like every day. its uninhabitable by fo3
---
Yeah, I'd like to remove poison aura
---
I'd be surprised if this 'weird little trick' survives the patch where they 'pool' the vendor's cap 'allowance'.
---
I am actually surprised that they have let it run for this long.
---
Must be that it has further implications - changing the price or slapping the UnsellableItem keyword on the record - or chances are they would have already done it.
---
As any nice things 'make the most of it while it lasts' because having nice things is generally not on the menu, if it appears there is usually a mistake or an oversight.
---
In bulked form, ya?
---
Xb1 GT: CurtVermin8149
---
I think this would be a really good idea!
---
That works too personally I use the water cuz I catch a disease every 5 mins. and usually its dysentery, but hey what ever works for you. 
---
That.... must be painful? 
---
I don‚Äôt see the big deal. It doesn‚Äôt look like a deathclaw and it‚Äôll probably act differently. A lot of real world creatures have a similar body structure. 
---
Yes, it is normal depending on you location, and enemies are attracted to all Electrical items.
---
I have my CAMP in a very volatile area of the Cranberry Bog, and it is regularly attacked by very High level enemies, including SBs, Mirelurk Queen &amp; Kings, Gulpers, Hermit Crab, and many others, all of which are sometimes legendary.
---
I have minimized the damage with a carefully constructed Camp that keeps most electrical stuff out of reach, but still have to make repairs nearly every time I return to camp.
---
The drops I get from enemies more than cover the repair costs, and the occasional Legendary, is a bonus, so I'm not even considering moving. 
---
Definitely get stabilized, bloody mess, one gun army and all the damage gunner perks. You should be pretty solid after that. Due to how Dr works bullet shield isn't super great since its easy to get an acceptable level of DR to negate most PvE damage and you can get plenty from mutations and equipment.  More direct durability perks are probably better, lifegiver is a 4 cost investment but its a solid durablity buff. 
---
The reload speed perk is okay, bear arms is more utility (although with heavy guns it can be necessary if you have 3-4) if you're using a gatling plasma you can craft cores with extra shots, if its a gatling gun then the reload isn't bad considering how long it takes you to run out of shots. And usually everything is dead before you need a reload anyways. 
---
If you're dead set on having all the heavy gun perks pick them up, but not all perks are created equal, and the extra points could help you dip into another specialization for some utility  (6 str perks can get you +30% damage and 75% armor pen on melee, which makes many level 50 one starred weapons viable in general PvE) 
---
I‚Äôve got plenty of Chems I can sell if they do fix it üòâüëç
---
I agree with medium recon scopes, but don't agree to recon on lever action. The lever action rifle is so OP compared to other rifles, so this should be one of it's drawbacks. 
---
I usually use lever action, a pipe and the gauss, but gauss is so clunky in vats, that it really needs a fix. Charging up a shot before you go in vats, is usually a 100% miss, unless the enemy is in your face. 
---
   
---
if you break the cores with explosive shots, the marker does not diminish I learned it the hard way 
---
IMHO, so far, 76 is much better than whatever (insert opinion source here) says.
---
Like any previous FO, its got its quirks and issues, some of which can be very frustrating.  For me, it's not as stable as FO 3&amp;4, but very solid compared to FO:NV.
---
That said, I have not reached the endgame, and I dont PVP, so I have not reached the point where I might experience some of the issues talked about.  OTOH, those issues may be corrected before I get to that point.
---
I didn‚Äôt forget. But I‚Äôm more psyched for sheepsquatch than I am angry at repair kits. (Just the fallout fan in me) 
---
Horrible idea 
---
I don't think that's much of an excuse...? It would just require breaking them into separate assets where available: ie. Miner Uniform - Top, Miner Uniform - Bottom or some such...whereas things like the Steel Worker Uniform (overalls) and Red Dress (a dress) remain as occupying both slots. Other games manage this just fine. Ultimately my concern would be more of them being able to stop them from clipping horrendously...I still have problems with some underarmour clipping through my Hunter Coat upon logging in for example. :(
---
neon letters... you only get blue, and they are annoying to connect.
---
Ikr there was this event called horde of sheepsquatches and when i got there to do the event
---
Yeah its really bad again, about 1month-2 months agao it was really good...
---
I prefer heavy combat armor in my opinion
---
Responses have been of excellent help, definitely helped take me in the right direction.  I‚Äôm a bit of a sniper at heart but maybe a top notch heavy gunner build will finally make me give up my ghillie suit üòÇ
---
You have a point there
---
I would like to join I'm a level 105 and I have a few friends that would like to as well. My gt is seasonswither86
---
Yeah. 
---
Nuke it from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
---
I actually agree with your headline. I played all week to get the Medical Malpractice legendary gun for my Mistress of Mystery build character. No one was greifing anywhere at the train stations or Vault 76 spawns all week long. However, I did get into a few pretty fun scraps with a few other players. I gotta say it was rather tense trying to not get caught by higher lvl, better equipped players, especially when your #1 on the longest life list! Not to mention it was the first time I participated in the Hunter/Hunted PVP Event and I gotta say that was wicked fun hunting down the other players to be the top hunter! I just wish there was some kind of reward for it.
---
this means more people will  build on golf club, active passive mode, and farm forever.
---
Damage numbers and a parser would be very nice. I don't believe they will implement.
---
I run the vendor gambit each log in, 7 vendors. Then hit a few stashes I know of (I use fortune finder perk and the stash perk in luck so you get more caps, often I'll get 300 caps from one total). It's not a ton at once, but it builds quickly. Also, it doesn't hurt to find out what the trends are for acquired goods on Reddit, explosive and bloodied weapons/unyielding armor seem to be popular just now.
---
Yes. They even spawn INSIDE your house. 
---
I lost 1.2K .45 rounds and when I realized I just closed the game and cried at my desk
---
You gotta stash the bulk of your aid. I only keep like 10 stimpacks at a time. Helps avoid losing too much stuff. 
---
I wish I had plan for top hats, but I do for Confederate ones. 15 caps each and they still all together weigh less than most guns.
---
Are you referencing the nuke on WV lumbermill this weekend?
---
First time I've seen it there - I'm guessing someone was after flux, or all the mutants at the mill really annnoyed them :)
---
Or perhaps wondering about one of the internet maps showing some sort of nuke mesh site just to the north of the mill, and thought perhaps nuking the spot would make it appear?
---
1 xbox one

4 I'm trying to do the last part of the quest "one of us" but everytime I try and enter the national radio astronomy research center ,my game goes to loading screen, loads about 20 seconds  , freezes (gear stops spinning) than kicks me out to dashboard,  
---
I did a search for a fix but only see people having troubles with holotapes. 
---
It would also be great to make it like vault 76 and your camp by allowing it to be a free fast travel location
---
I agree, sorry if it seemed argumentative, the mentality is irritating to me lol
---
While wearing a sheep outfit.
---
Yes. I received the initiate paint back in late November and Shielded dropped for me in January. Since then I've found 2 more PA paints and another Shielded.
---
This was an awesome little story! Funny too üòéüëçüèº
---
Thank you :D, I know now my problem I had no defence perks. Do you think this is a good survival build for my TSE Lmg?

yeah and then get revenant
---
Yep and it still shocks me that people don't understand that at this point. 
---
Only way its pay2win is if your a bad player and dont repair when going into pvp...plus you cant get them in game also. Shut up üòÇ
---
I have a screen caps of me standing over a Flatwoods monster that comes up when fast traveling... yet I've never killed one according to the Atom challenges. I think I've found about a dozen things it hasn't counted for me.
---
I don't even bother with that anymore... I have just gone full skyrim with it and just kill whatever spawns around the vendor and sell the vendor whatever they drop - weapons, meat, aid items, whahaveyou...
---
really? I have a three star tse shotgun and I put scorched killer on it and it has four stars now.
---
Is your game on a properly configured SSD? Both of those games you mention have very high disk I/O.
---
Hey, so I know this is a month old but I wasn't sure if you had explored the  **National Radio Astronomy Research Center** (NRARC)  yet. Apparently there was some weird conspiracy shit going on there having to with a test they did with the National Isolated Radio Array. Apparently they got a huge amount of data that freaked several people up including the higher up ranks and people started talking too much to one another and we sent off for "early retirement" there is even a holotape of a guy mentions some weird stuff going on and the guy he was talking to had been recording the conversation and some people came in during the recording to take him away. 
---
That‚Äôs sounds pretty easy
---
Pic? Bc I was really disappointed that it didn‚Äôt increase the star on mine. How long ago did you do that?
---
I‚Äôve dropped on SBQ multiple times and killed her well over 3 dozen times since launch and the challenge says I still need to kill her. I‚Äôm afraid it only counts for whoever gets the last shot on her, sorta tough when 15 people are lighting her up. Also the challenge to ‚ÄúMake a friend‚Äù I‚Äôve meet new people through FO76 and added them as friends/had them add me as a friend. I don‚Äôt want to make any more friends just saying 
---
There is a bug right now with VATS that might be related to invulnerability from spawning. I had someone damaging me that had respawned within the 20-30 seconds (it took them that long to run back to me) and I could not damage them in VATS. This happened repeatedly and I had to free aim to kill them. If I waited them out a good minute or two they went down in VATS in 3 hits.
---
Ok thanks. 
---
I'd figured it was so you couldn't share all 3 levels at once, but I think your idea makes more sense.  Or a combination of both.
---
yeah. it seems people are quick to argue over the internet. 
---
It gets better every week. So yes it‚Äôs deff worth it. 
---
How lucky can one ghoul be
---
He shit he and he shot me
---
Like a fella once said
---
But ain't that a kick in the head?
---
Me either. At least I dont think I did and just dont remember getting them either through reward or vendor. Will have to double check when I get home tonight to see what I can make. The other strange thing is these didnt drop until I was Lvl 150. One drop ar 150 and the other two drops ar 151 yesterday. More than likely just a super huge coincidence because aim sure other guys got the plans below this level, but some thing odd to say the least. 
---
I've literally never seen a huge demand or Repair Kits or even a single request for it but that's just my experience so I dunno where they got that idea from.
---
Good luck on links, since reddit search sucks. Don't know if anyone has breached this one, but yes, at least one, maybe two vaults, have been breached, with a fair number of pics. At least one of them seemed to have a reactor and a bunch of pipes with valves that seemed to lend themselves to a quest, but otherwise looked a lot like Vault 76.
---
Fair enough. I definitely haven't been focused on PvP, though I've set most of my perks for it, I probably just had bad luck over the course of a few days then.
---
Weird.
---
You do it so i figured it was okay.
---
But aren't all the cars also nuclear reactors? I can't imagine them still needing a lift for the engine block or anything past that point. Or maybe they all know how to easily fix that stuff. Anyways, I do see what you mean by them having more than one purpose. 
---
Exactly, before modern weapons, I couldn't care less for companions or thriving settlements. There were enough beds throughout the map, so I can save my progress. When I installed the mod, the first I leveled was a local leader perk. It made the progress so streamlined and satisfactory. And it finally made the stealthy sniper viable for me. Otherwise it was full auto everywhere and nuke to Kellog's face for easy run.
---
I check data files myself, because I needed them a week ago: Raider vendors (doesn‚Äôt matter which) and Watoga Shopping Center (Phoenix)!
---
Fair enough, that's a sort of balance I guess. Suppose it would be too slanted the other way if you did something about it, then.
---
I switched to commando and would never go back. I do use a ton of ammo but it's so easy to make after an ore run.
---
p.s. The combat rifle is very VATS friendly.
---
It is a big deal because this is how it always starts. Give them this inch and they will take miles.
---
Indoor fireplaces would be amazing. Think they should add other musical instruments with a bluegrass theme too, like washboard and spoons, and harmonicas and moonshine jugs to blow on. Course, instrumental synchronization with other players would only make it even better.
---
Explosive is a Legacy prefix, AKA cannot be found anymore on enegry weapons
---
A primed bloody explosive gatling laser. 150,000 damage per violet flux. Beat that.
---
Or show the mods in the Modify menu, just greyed out with a red "no" circle like in the CAMP menus.  That way they can always add more and it wouldn't mess up an "all mods unlocked" statement.
---
Thats pretty cool actually.   We are thinking of doing a bike ride on the Appalachian trail
---
Just whacked a lv80 sb in the glasses cavern in 1. Shots üòÇüòÇ
---
What are you struggling on? I was able to beat pretty much every quest in the game by 100. I am a completionist, so I just started marking things on the map and explored everywhere. Was pretty easy to level doing that.
---
I generally do, but I was in the process of organizing my stash the first time I got killed lol. Normally I can hear people sneak up on me, but I didn't luck out during this encounter.
---
Overall I had a positive experience on survival, but definitely had an awful play session last night.
---
More events generally would be nice. it's a little limited right now IMO.
---
Yesterday a group of friends were running our alternate characters through Whitespring.  We were all level 25-35.  Some higher level characters kept blowing up the cars either as we got to them or immediately after we killed the ghouls (sending the bodies flying).  The explosions didn't do a huge amount of damage, but the ensuing rads did.  We were all melee builds, but after a while I pulled out a rifle and started blowing up the cars before we got to them.  THEN one of them started to try to get between us and what we were fighting, hoping to initiate PVP.  We had all switched to pacifist though, so that didn't work.
---
Sounds... delightful.
---
It‚Äôs not because of their performance, but because they‚Äôre somewhat rare-ish since Bethesda removed their ability to drop with the ‚ÄúBullets explode for Area damage‚Äù roll so all previous explosive energy weapons dropped/duped before the change are considered ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù when it comes to performance they are still pretty bad if you ask me lol, even after this ‚Äúbuff‚Äù.
---
You can‚Äôt lose caps is pvp if you‚Äôve already lost all your caps in pvp
---
OK where an announcement or anything that's we talking about? 
---
yeah i dont think Bethesda realizes how bad the servers are, or else shouldnt they prioritize the server stability first and foremost?
---
nothing else matters if the game itself cant even function without crashing constantly
---
Best comment 
---
Use the Open option instead of just taking, and you can view the item specifics before picking it up.
---
Gotta get back, back to vault, Vault Dweller Jack
---
yawn
---
I use it.  It triggers when I get overwhelmed.  It's easier to keep equipped than lifesaving armor pieces and it works in power armor.
---
Yeah:
---
1. 1st camp near Gauley Mine on the railway bridge spawned scorched, robots, mutants, ghouls, dogs - they attacked without prejudice.
---
2. 2nd camp between Silo Alpha and NIRA in a little cave and ticks used to constantly spawn at the back of the cave and bypass my single turret.
---
3. 3rd camp up the hill from Huntersville used to have mid level mutants and scorched spawn and snipe my water purifiers from like 100m away.
---
4. 4th camp just North up the road from the Overseer's camp. After my previous troubles I built a little locked garage adjacent to my house to house my fusion generator and all manner of low level creatures used to spawn INSIDE the garage and attack it: ghouls, scorched, and mole rats mostly. 
---
5. My current camp just outside Charleston I came back yesterday and all my crops were decimated and my turret broken. I found the wreckage of a single eye-bot lying on the ground.
---
So yeah it's a constant fight for me and turrets only do so much before they get destroyed. You're lucky you get legendaries I guess!
---
Those are great suggestions
---
Cabin set and a diner set too.  Why do we get a diner door without anything to build around it?
---
Breaking the cores worked fine, but we didn't use explosive shots. We "pressed e" to break the cores, since that doesn't use up weapon durability. 
---
It was the next step where you have to remove the cores and replace them with fixed or found cores that didn't work. 
---
Nope....
---
&gt;Its useless because you can just manually use one
---
IF you notice your health is that low in time.  That's a big if when you're being swarmed by ghouls at Whitespring.
---
Agreed, to my surprise survival has been a boost to my enjoyment of an already great game.  I learned a great lesson last night, EVERYONE is out to kill you. 
---
Last night I was headed to Westtec (sp) to get some steal when I was deep into about 6 super mutants I saw a lowly level 5.  My focus was on the Super Mutants so I paid him no mind.  Well, come to find out he was one of a 3 man team and I soon had all 3 bearing down on me.  I dis-batched the other 2 (lvl 100ish and 80 ish) fairly quickly.  Then turned to the level 5 who was still shooting me and then........also ended his life.  
---
I pretend it's the all natural meat and gravy kind.
---
It's not the same helmet
---
oh man i thought it was my tv, you mean everyone has this issue?!?!?!? mind blown
---
Just get rid of them. If you can hack the terminal, you can hack it; same for locks. Stick a difficulty indicator on them as with ESO and be done with it. 
---
We really need to get BIV some help. He‚Äôs out of control 
---
I have close to 350 hours in the game. It somehow reminds me of Diablo II. You level up a character, then you realise it's crap. You decide to make one even better and start planning your ultimate build + farming equipment for it.
---
As for the story part, take your time and listen to every holotape, read every terminal entry and note. It's environmental story telling, which requires some digging and investigating. 
---
I would recommend, because I still play it and will continue to do so, until I no longer have anything to do. But compared to a Korean MMO it's a walk in the park.
---
I‚Äôm going for a sniper build and I used to run a laser rifle but eventually it became to weak, and I haven‚Äôt been able to find one that‚Äôs up to par. Do sniper rifle perks apply to semi auto laser rifles?
---
The increased carry weight effect doesn‚Äôt last long, and when it‚Äôs over you get a withdrawal effect that reduces your carry weight by 50 instead. 
---
It's definitely an interesting area, very real life spooky lol! Bike ride would be really nice the whole trail is beautiful 
---
I'm in a spot where attacks are really rare and only seemed to happen when I had crops on the outside of my house.  I don't have those anymore, but there was a point where I had my foundations arranged in a donut pattern, with dirt in the middle for crops, and those were never threatened.
---
I don't know about the energy situation.  I think the route to my Fusion Generator, or putting it behind other props like I do, confuses the enemies.  During a small period when I had Windmills (because they look cool), they would get plinked all the time by stray bullets.
---
Now, conversely, my friend had a house with the same problems you describe.  Constantly under attack from high-level bugs and Super Mutants.  He also had all of his crops on the outside, though.
---
This. PERIOD. This is the true (until everyone made posts about it) best secret cap hustle in the game! I just hope they don‚Äôt do something to fix it because it was definitely not intended to work this way! Lol I do a vendor run everyday, when I have the cap space, and I think it‚Äôs like 1200 caps or something like that a day. If you don‚Äôt have ‚Äúgod roll‚Äù items or are not making big trades etc. then this is the best way to get your caps up! So get out there and find the civil war re-enactor 
---
Sit on a trainstation roof with a handmade.
---
No.  The clean space suit helmet is identical to the regular space suit helmet except in its color.  That means it has the -2 PER.  The atom shop helmet is different.  That being said, the veil of mysteries is so easy to get, that the atom shop version isn't really much of an advantage.
---
That sounds great, but for most players that won't be their experience.  
---
It‚Äôs takes like 3 shots to kill something, and it‚Äôs 10mm ammo. It‚Äôs everywhere. Not high consumption at all if you don‚Äôt lean of your controller and just fire like a moron. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
---
Nice. Time to save up caps to get me some plasma plans.
---
I think all the power armor sets need some unique options like this.  T-45 &amp; T-51 with combat upgrades since they were used by grunts.  X-01 with energy weapons upgrades since they were experimental and used by the Enclave. Ultracite armor with anti-scorched upgrades.
---
I think in FO4 there was another layer of mods you could add.  Instead of paint being cosmetic you could add Winterized coating etc.  They should add something like that but leave a cosmetic layer (regular armor can be covered by cosmetic outfits so why not?)
---
Just off the top of my head there‚Äôs a few perks I‚Äôd get rid of for more DR or damage output type perks. Pack rat, bandolier and white knight. Those are great Quality of Life perks but those points are wasted imo. 
---
I‚Äôd max out dodgy and serendipity instead and roll with 1 strength and invest those extra points into agility or luck. Also max out lone wanderer and change travel agent to suppressor or just move the point to luck or agility.
---
So you‚Äôre a rifleman build which gun are you using?
---
I always opt for the medium scope.  You have enough peripheral vision around your target to stay aimed and pop off the next head without having to drop aim and look around for more enemies.  I only use recon scopes on bolt action pipe rifles, because they block the entire lower right section of the screen on a hunting rifle or gauss.
---
I greatly prefer a lever rifle for long distance shooting, and those don't have recon scopes.  I don't really miss it.  The compass marking feature is only mildly useful.  I guess recon scopes have a larger field of view while aiming, but it's really not very difficult to keep track of enemies if you pick out a couple good vantage points ahead of time.
---
Night vision scopes are absolutely terrible.  They're like plain scopes, but worse.  I just roll with the standard medium scope.
---
Just have it for those under level 15...
---
This. 
---
I had a few Assassin/sentinel pieces that were useless to me, and once PvP came out one piece can get 15-20k easily. 
---
I got lucky and bought them on a whim last year and they‚Äôve been sitting in my storage ever since. 
---
A lot of mire quests aren't popping up for me. Queen of the hunt hasn't happened in months. Boomer never has anything. I too, spend most of my  time I'm the swamp.
---
ugh can we go back to complaining about the atom shop?  
---
Interesting.
---
I actually do have a full set of Sent-Assassin and I can actually bench 300. 
---
Double whammy.
---
I never knew I was so unique. 
---
Giving away free food? Fucking communists!
---
*Liberty Prime intensifies*
---
same. I can fast travel to all these locations that haven't given me credit for discovering. how is that even possible? they may seem like a tiny amount of atoms but when I looked they'd add up to a nice amount.
---
I left a toothy in the whitesprings suitcase last night while trying to reduce my stash
---
This broke a couple patches ago. Surprised they haven't been able to fix it. 
---
Yeah, it sucks. I've bought a lot of gear just to see those other stars. Then sold it back for nothing. 
---
I don't have pics but I can back this guy up, it adds an extra star for sure , it's the only 4 star gun I have
---
It‚Äôs definitely nice for time saving but I had no trouble finding things to sell while I was playing. Now lvl 217 on my main character and just the amount of aid items and bulk materials one can sell makes it easy to max caps everyday. Hat plans are definitely nice tho, I have the union and confederate hat plans on my characters and only takes me about 50 cloth to max out in caps now.
---
I love this this just made my day so much better
---
Take your time and enjoy the scenery and story.
---
levels will start coming faster soon enough. 
---
Into the 30's, you can get into both the westren side of the divide and the ash heap, both of which have higher level critters with more XP.
---
Start the excavator quest at 35.
---
  If you have a good melee weapon, you should be able to stash your important junk, then do a short WS run, just make sure you have PA in case someone nukes the place while you are there.  Lots of XP opportunity, but a lot more difficult than the forest or toxic valley.
---
Not long now until CAMPs become immune.
---
Main Weapon is a TSE, + 50% Limb Damage, Prime .50 Cal Machine Gun. I also have a Furious Explosive Gatling that I used to carry as a back-up, but since they fixed Heavy weapon Durability, I no longer Need to bring both, The 50 can handle 3 consecutive SBQ battles (7500-9000 rounds) without breaking now. When the Queen is out of range, I switch to an Instigating/Explosive/Vats Crit Lever to take out Mobs enemies without wasting Ultracite ammo.
---
I'm up to 7, need just 1 more for a full pie!
---
Can confirm,  just pulled shielded mod,  then Knight rank II  soon after. 
---
The one you can find in game still has the -2 perception debuff, while the atom shop version doesn't have the perception debuff.
---
I'd prefer a standalone version of the game. With an actual storyline. The whole point seems to be a grind to the highest level. It's dull. Same "events" done 30 times is inexcusable. Unfun. 
---
I've never had a normal fight with them; they either stand still and do nothing or run away from me.
---
I love the luck perk that repairs weapons. On a melee weapon, a break is pretty rare. They do happen, and that makes a repair kit nice to have. Unless it weighs as much as a backup weapon. Then I would just carry a backup.
---
Thanks Doctor, yeah, just looks like some real shitty luck some people are getting. 
---
Right ? I‚Äôm starting to think those quest only pop up to players below level 50 at this point...
---
A safe zone? The whole map is safe? You can't engage in PvP unless you both agree to it. There's the mansion in the middle that is pretty safe from PVE
---
Not the one the OP is talking about. The atom shop version doesn't have the -2 perception debuff the ones found in game have.
---
We already have NPC's in FO76.
---
We have "Grahm" and chally the moo moo
---
Unless something changes, tomorrow.  They typically bring things down for maintenance at 11 EST and are out for 2-3 hours.
---
Wish granted!!!
---
I just discovered the magic of the emergency protocols mod for power armor. If you want to be tanky, get that mod.
---
At 20% health incoming damage is cut in half and you get a movement speed boost. Badass.
---
Imagin√© you have a mod for syrenge that negates for each shot x amount of seconds it would make the syrenger usable
---
Both marine and trapper seem to have awful durability compared to the other armors. I find that my trapper leg breaks twice as fast as my marine leg, which breaks 4 times faster than my metal chest piece. It seems that the durability doesn‚Äôt increase with the higher level variants of some armor.
---
500+ hours in,  down for another 500+
---
This build is also coupled with full Sentinel-Assassin Armor set-up with a TSE Guass Rifle, or a TSE Hand-made.
---
If  full sets of sent. assassins become very  common, you can count on it being nerfed.  It's what happened with TSE.  A weapon  that had a low probability of dropping was suddenly everywhere thanks to duping.   I'm fairly confident that probabilities were programmed in such a way where getting an entire set was unthinkable, and yet people have them.    Nerfing them doesn't mean reducing DR stats per se, but  buffing how it's effected by anti-armor perks and legendary effects. Or drastically increasing  the breakage rate while also increasing materials needed to repair it.  Or making it so the upcoming repair kids don't work on it at all, 
---
If you can predict the market a bit you can buy low and sell high. I loaded up on energy weapons a few months back and now they sell for big bucks.
---
Putting us on pedestals like you just described is just as weird as being a creep. So congratulations on being their "token woman" that they "protect" because they feel like women have to have males protect them. 
---
Another story of the migrations to ESO (Elder Scrolls Online.)
---
Why do we get corpse flower stamens put in our inventory but not stew? 
---
Studded heavy leather definitely does not beat all armors. If you place a high value on ER I guess you could say that but I don't know why anyone would. There aren't a ton of enemies that deal energy damage.
---
The best all around is easily heavy combat armor with the BoS mod. A chest piece will get you 86/86 DR/ER. More if repaired over 100%.
---
I think it should just reset everyones hunger meter on the server and maybe give a temporary buff to slow hunger over the next hour. I know some people complained in the past about having food added to their inventory that could bump then over the carry limit. 
---
I am on Xbox. I would enjoy that and if you want to trade we can. 
---
Probaly everybody. 
---
It's a hunter gatherer game that limits how much you can gather and hold. 
---
So Its a nessesary evil. 
---
why are you being such an ass? didnt you want to know what might have been happeneing to make the 2nd person take no damage? the guy gives his idea and you shit all over him? wth is your problem?
---
Nah not everyone but from what I can tell, Maybe like 30-50% of people seem to get it. 
---
Doing something similar.
---
Chasing the recon scope for my handmades as well,  so lots of crafting and scrapping.
---
Vendor bots. Or suitcases near the vendor bots.
---
Yup, which is why I just act like anyone else playing this game instead of some "Oh I'm a woman and can only play with other women" crap. I've not had issues with being a woman and playing this game or pretty much any online game recently.
---
Oh dam I thought today was the 9th lmao 
---
Still no
---
He was gang banged and swatted until he seemingly played nice. 
---
no, integrity means you would stand by what you said, if you said it will end at 7 but then call it early because you got a good offer, then you have NO INTEGRITY
---
its very simple
---
If the melee weapon backpack isnt a golf bag we Riot!
---
We all thought it was a feature... 
---
im getting the same issue on xbone. and must be something recent, because ive been in there before. game just drops out. pretty lame. 
---
I‚Äôm honestly not a huge fan of demolition expert either, I usually go with nerd rage. since the nerf you‚Äôre only getting 60% of 25% instead of the full 100% increased damage. So basically if your base gun damage does 100 then you get 60% of 25 which is ~ 13 extra damage per shot, nerd rage is better all around imo.
---
I was obviously referring to then part OP thought was cool - everyone coordinating to take down the SBQ. The pvp was discussed as an interruption of that awesomeness.
---
Do you have the grounded mutation 
---
But even if the deathclaw kills them before you get there, if you have the butcher‚Äôs bounty perk you can still search the corpses for more meat. I never bothered with butcher‚Äôs bounty until trying to get ant meat. 
---
And detract from Bethesda's new ability to monetize in-game bonuses? Are you mad? ^^^/s
---
Because explosive prefix on lazer weapons don‚Äôt drop anymore 
---
It doesn't take that long to repair stuff. How easy do you want the game to be??
---
I'm a long time ESO player. This game could use a bit more ESO in it, for sure.
---
Interesting. I know exactly where that is. I usually find Metal Armor plans so I figured that's all that spawns there. I'm going to have to pay more attention to that spot.
---
Not sure if you still have them but I would be interested in the Belinni, Mimosa, and Cranberry shine recipes. I have Mountain honey and Nuka Dark to trade and caps for the third or something else if wanted. IGN is Drazhan
---
RaIdeRs are all just PvP cowards. They don't actually have the skills to earn caps in Survival, so they try to provoke people, or exploit game mechanics, to take caps from other people. 
---
There are true raiders but they seek the most damgerous enemies, not the weakest ones. Thrill addicts dont get off on freefrags.
---
Bye.
---
Sure! I‚Äôll be on in a couple hours , I‚Äôve got 800 ish cloth so I‚Äôll just give them away GT KnowledgeHound 
---
The scorched across the road at Thunder mountain endless take shots at my camp from what feels like way to far way....  But 3 or 4 times a day I gotta go wipe them all before they pop a wall. 
---
I'm now noticing that theres a gap between the frame and the barrel
---
Yes! I've been wanting this for while.
---
As stated in other comments, scrapping regular level 15 works just fine, it has been a while so some patches may have affected things, but I was able to learn every mod for the Handmade rifle after crafting &amp; scrapping 38 of them.
---
In over 100 levels (since scrapping 38 HM rifles), and lots of plan farming, I have never found anything new for the Handmade, so it would seem you can (or could) learn them all by scrapping.
---
I agree, it‚Äôs nice when your low level. I pick up so many glowing bloods etc. that I‚Äôm the same exact way. I find my self looking at my aid and I‚Äôll have 90 glowing bloods left from just selling hats. I will say it definitely helped me get on my feet caps wise because it‚Äôs seems to me once you start getting some caps saved up, they just start pouring in and you hit max fast! When I was low level it seemed like a hassle to save up 3k! Now I‚Äôll blow 3k just to get some space. It‚Äôs honestly pretty crazy. I had to start 2 other characters for cap stashing! As if I‚Äôm really ever going to need that many caps or something lmao
---
I have learned all of the BoS Underarmor plans and continue to receive duplicate copies of Shielded through Technical Data.
---
I never liked the bloody until I was getting one shotted no matter what. Unyielding armor boosts the hell out of my stats and a bloody lever does over 600 with out sneaking. Lol
---
Seems like it would just make sense that if you used a serum when you already have that mutation, it removes it. 
---
I only have a problem with frame rate when first loading in, other than that there have been SERIOUS improvements to performance since launch, imo.
---
I've noticed this too, I think this is sudden shadow LOD changes (e.g. distance shadows become volumetric shadows or "long shadows"). It's only noticeable at some places, some times of day and/or weather, I think - usually sunrise/sunset and possibly when there are lots of trees around.
---
They're gonna take miles anyway. Regardless of what you guys do, they will be trying to make as much money as possible. Especially after the botched launch. This situation is not a big deal at all. It is certainly not pay to win. It's more of pay to skip grinding for adhesive. But you also lose out on XP from gathering supplies so if anything it hurts you. 
---
Sadly yes, your "RNG" is tied to the character you are on. Some characters just will never have good drops or anything, while another may get great drops. There is no real way that I know of to change your characters "hidden luck" other than making a new character.
---
FLUX! Gotta get that precious flux.
---
Sure 76 is a watered down fallout with issues. However, Colonial Marines was a disgusting abomination. I played it and tried to finish it. 
---
I hopped in last night because I wanted to get the pistol on my pistol character, and had a blast.  I‚Äôd forgotten how much fun it is just hoofing it everywhere.  On my first character I walked everywhere from last teens to 100 because the stash limit was so low, so it was refreshing to give this another go.
---
I really love the bog and the tactical nature of the ditches.
---
If it weren‚Äôt for knocking out Biv‚Äôs dailies I may move over to this mode permanently.  Can‚Äôt wait to give it another go tonight.  Though I need an outfit swap so I‚Äôm not as visible!
---
Gauss rifles are so clunky in every way.  They're like 6' long with a suppressor, the ammo is relatively heavy, the charging mechanic is terrible and they're garbage in VATS.  The charging mechanic alone kills that weapon for me in terms of utility.  If I could pre-charge it like the Fo4 laser musket and click to pull the trigger, that would be so much better.  Or if it auto-charged, even at a slower charge rate, I would be much more inclined to use it.  Having to hold down the trigger and release to fire is so counter-intuitive, and I miss a LOT while free-aiming because of it.  Canceling a charge by opening the pip boy or swapping weapons is also not a great "feature".  
---
The hunting rifle actually does slightly more damage per shot than the lever gun, and can be fitted with an armor piercing magazine that actually makes the per-shot damage significantly higher, but the trade off is the increased recoil on the hunting rifle and slower rate of fire.  Because of the fire rate and much better VATS accuracy of the lever gun, it's better for taking out the relatively small mobs in 76.  Because you're sometimes competing with other players for enemy kills, I prefer the lever gun without question.  In Fo4, I stuck with a two-shot hunting rifle that I found on a legendary enemy in the Glowing Sea over Old Reliable.  It was more accurate at very long ranges and hit much harder with a .50 receiver.  Because of the zoned effect of 76, I'm never making very long shots, and can't stalk the way I could in a single player game, so the lever gun has way more practical advantages with slightly less accuracy, damage and range.
---
See I fell the opposite way.  Not having turrets seems to make your camp safer,  IMO.  Also,  living in a low traffic area decreases the cham6 a random player will stay close to your camp an trigger the mobs.  So far if no one comes around and you don't have turrets mobs only seem to spawn when your there. 
---
Nobody is saying laser rifles are good.  Check your sources.
---
I‚Äôve been saying for so long they need perk card loadouts. They don‚Äôt need a lot but just a few. They should connect it to the new system they‚Äôre adding for after hitting lvl 50
---
Glad to help, especially since my alts C.A.M.P. may or may not be located at TiptheRat Lake ;)
---
Lol you paid for a game and got a full game. It had some issues but they were fixed. It's not like they put guns in the store. They put repair kits lol. They offer no big advantage other than skipping some grinding for supplies. 
---
After the first week, repairing became just another automatic function I do when I log in. 
---
Log in 
---
check food/chem stocks
---
Check weapon/armor condition
---
Cook/repair
---
Play without worrying about starvation/weapon breakage.
---
It's not that hard. There are enough benches throughout the world, that if something breaks, it's due to your own carelessness.
---
"Doctors are not required"
---
It is because they would have to adjust each part of the outfit to fit seamlessly into everything else. Other games dont have to deal with the very old Creation Kit engine, and when other games do this they plan this mix and match from the start. I think it's a bigger load of work than it seems.
---
I picked up both on my witch hats at the pumpkin house in the northern part of the divide...

Bonus: theres a fun little quest there that'll give you plans for a pumpkin grenade.

Bethesda, we're still waiting for your response.  We're pissed, and we're not letting it drop.

What is lacks in lore is makes up in ability to make your own story‚Äôs alongside other players üëçüòã
---
Well hopefully we find a need for caps again so the trading market can start being more willing to accept caps and not just trades. I‚Äôm hoping the legendary vendor requires caps for a re-roll in addition to the tokens so we can start to normalize the in game economy, that‚Äôs just my opinion tho.
---
They really hate player made generators and crops. If it's made by previous occupants of the land, then it's fine. But as soon as something new is put down, they will come and try to destroy it.
---
It really doesn't make sense.
---
Got tired of them, constantly shooting my walls to get to the generator, so finally started to make camps in areas not occupied by enemy spawns. It's lonely at top of the mountains, but the views are fantastic.
---
Ha! Get off my lawn. :)
---
Raider scum!
---
You can‚Äôt speak for everyone. 10-15k Caps a session says otherwise.
---
It does. Even thought the Energy Weapons got a durability boost last update the Splitter modification still causes my Laser/Ultracite Laser Rifle to break after only a couple clips. 
---
im on ps4, how much you asking for it? im using a regular handmade now as my best weapon, im not sure where peopel get these explosive and 2 shot weapons
---
If you're on PC I have a handful of Shielded copies I believe.  They continue to drop Shielded even after learning them.
---
I'm not sure that's wise since you could get every mutation via rads and just remove the one-or-two you didn't want at the end. It might make the rest of the serums obsolete, given how powerful class freak 3 is. 
---
the amount a resorce generator states it yields is true *but* what it fails to state is how much it will *hold*. the industrial water purifier will make that much, but it will only hold FIVE waters at a time. youd have to come by every 5 min. to empty it. its for game balancing. if we all had purifiers with 60 waters in them, no one would need water. we'd all be the most hydrated mafks in fallout history. but the high rate of production is so youre not just sitting there for 30 min waiting for *some* water. FO76 is not very intuitive with explaining how game mechanics work.

I use the perks in Luck that mean your stuff randomly repairs itself. It reduces the huge amount of tedious inventory management by a small measure.

I‚Äôll be on 4 or 5 hours. My GT is Tron89000.

I always did that in my head when playing the original fallouts and I'm curious how it will playout with people.

Bloodied 1* handmade/combat rifle will let you take a big group of mutants in single magazine with 1-2 ammunition pieces per mutant.

Unyielding bloodied sneaky vatser is current PvP meta.
---
If your on Xbox I‚Äôm happy to lend a hand with starting off üòÑ
---
Weapon artisan and fix it good from the intelligence cards help a lot too. You only have to repair half as often 
---
No, you don't know what pay to win means. Anything that you can purchase that gives you any advantage over other players is pay to win.
---
You have to be trolling.
---
There's a lot of big reactions to small things that make this game look worse than it is. There's a lot of talk about game breaking bugs, frequent server crashed, things that people think should be in the game but it's not, etc. I've got a lot of time into the game, and I don't see much of any of this. Everyone's experience may vary, of course, but the things that still need work in this game have very little impact on me. I'm playing the shit out of it. 
---
The indication also seems like Bethesda plans on constantly evolving the game, so it will only get better. I do not think it would be a waste of money to buy it. Worst case scenario seems to me you try it out and it doesn't measure up for you now, come back in a month and it will have improved. Odds are you'll like it if you enjoy scavenging, shooting stuff, and character creation.  
---
That's the point though, I don't think it will act differently. I'm happy to be proven wrong but I'm going to assume this thing roars, flicks up dirt and swings with it's arms in the exact same animation as the DC
---
i want the game to be hard but not on stuff like repairs,  make enemies harder, smarter, difficult quests. it feels like they made item degradation so annoying so that you crawl through content. lets say you have an hour to play, you will spent that time just fucking around in your bench and finding junk to repair armor/weapons
---
For some reason, Imgur keeps telling me it will be shared momentarily... but it has been that was for 3 hours.
---
The other plus of here is having a camp within walking distance of Silo Charlie for nuke runs.
---
that would be good if they allowed us to use more perk points
---
Is the 60/hr limited to all purifiers in the CAMP or could you have say... 2 purifiers pushing 60/hr which effectively results in 120/hr?
---
Ooh, and then they should add a Hockey Mask and a Hockey Stick in the Nuclear Winter update.
---
Oh sorry Xbox 
---
There are 3 categories to consider:
---
1) Caps from vendors
---
There are 7 vendors x 200 caps = 1400 caps total (they are going to consolidate these into a single shared bank in an upcoming update).  Not a lot but it's a nice and easy income.  Civil war top hats or union hats are cheap to craft and lightweight.  Civil war suits, Halloween costumes, and vault suits are also good but take slightly more materials.  If you just like to scavenge, chems with "pharma farma" are good, and you can sometimes double them with recipes and "chemist".
---
2) Caps from the game
---
There are perks that help find and loot cap stashes.  Some people have guides to do cap stash runs.  You can also get some caps from events and dailies but it's not much.
---
3) Caps from other players
---
Farm farm farm.  Farm legendaries to sell.  Farm lead and steel to craft ammo.  Farm ingredients to craft meds. Farm nuke zones for flux.  Pick something that you have fun farming anyway and go crazy.  Or you can just scavenge everything and sell stuff as you accumulate, but that's a slow road to caps.  If you want caps fast you'd need to focus on one thing.
---
&gt; In my mind is this really pay to win? Does a repair kit really give you a "winning" advantage over me? I don't think so.
---
They are adding in dungeon-like areas, maybe ones you can't easily just pop out and repair - so carrying a repair kit may prove more valuable than you think. Also, with unlimited 100% repair kits, you can then spec out of repair perks and add more damage ones, giving you a direct benefit. Also, nothing is stopping them from tweaking the way enemies hit your armor, making it break quicker. Maybe new enemy types break armor quicker than others. A store with an in-game shop will ALWAYS push that shop, always. Once you add in game changing items, they will change the game a bit so those items become more and more enticing to buy. They have tweaked plenty of things already, nothing is stopping them from "fixing" the item degeneration and repair systems to push repair kits.
---
To me, they are firmly under the pay 2 win umbrella. 
---
Damn. I would have bought it from you if you were on PC.
---
I would prefer a Liberty Prime statue
---
Well, I do believe that the sights aren't supposed to be functional, and only increases the accuracy (I think, at least) of the weapon. It would be really nice if we could actually use them, though.
---
Well that did it. I'm buying at least two skins now.
---
I've had the same thing happen to me at Hornwright HQ the other week. Happened like 4 times so I went into the game then instead of having it kick me out I just quit the game closed it and reloaded it and that seemed to work. Or maybe it just started working on its own idk. 
---
Hey, at least you can look at the map or your pipboy during that 10 second load time without locking up the game. 
---
I suggest using PA with Emergency Protocols, and just using a Bloodied SS or heavy gun for the queen.  Unarmed these days, those rads from the queen are the biggest problem.
---
Nope, doesn't make any more sense than being able to take a serum that *gives* you a specific mutation.
---
The balance (such as it is) is that they are either very rare or very expensive to get the plans for.  So it's not any worse to spend money to get 5 specific mutations than it is to buy serums to *remove* 5 specific mutations.
---
They'll add this in, but the cure serums will cost atoms &gt;.&gt;
---
It isn't hard though. You need to have weapon and armour degradation. Otherwise you'd have people running g around with God mode armour and un breakable weapons.. just keep a healthy stock of the few materials you need and it won't be a problem. Having a few weapons on you to switch between helps too.
---
Pistols go great with VATS/Crits, and good legendary effects are Anti-Armor, Quad for the revolvers, and Explosive or VATS effects, 33% better chance to hit, reduced cost, increased crit damage etc. A revolver with Quad, reduced cost, increased chance to hit, and a decent agility score can pop off several shots in one go. Add in the luck perks for Four Leaf Clover, Grim Reaper's Sprint, Better Criticals, and Gun Fu and Adrenaline from Agility, and you have yourself one hell of a build. Just aim at the weak spots, which further increases damage. Oh, and all 3 ranks of concentrated fire is a must too.
---
This is what my pistol build will look like:

---
You were lucky then. The game was simply unplayable for some people, me being one of them.
---
The update they did after the beta literally made the game unplayable. It would crash the second the game window appeared. This lasted for over two weeks and after talking with "customer support" I was told I was to blame for having a "far to out dated PC to play Fallout 76 according to my specs"... Yet my specs are/were well above their listed recommend specs AND I was able to play the beta without it crashing every time I tried  launching the game.
---
This game, the PR department and customer support were all absolutely shit for the first 2 or so months of this game's life.
---
I do feel like it should give something amazing, even if it is just a silly joke. But if someone goes ahead and does it.. They should damn well be rewarded.
---
"omg outrage culture and hate mob" - imbecile who has literally nothing to add to the conversation
---
Why even open your mouth if you have nothing to say? Who do you think you are to decide what people should and shouldn't be upset about?
---
Had the same problem (PC) yesterday in the silo. I've learned through the past 2 runs though, that if you just wait it out, it will eventually fix itself. Don't leave.
---
I am pretty sure it was never intended. That bug is now actually on the "Death Blossoms" event. That's why you sometimes have some random corpse seeds.
---
Mire/Toxic Valley. Cranberry Bog and Ash Heap are cool too.  
---
I think the regions in this game are all amazingly well done.  Even Savage Divide and the forest which I think are usually boring have some cool spots.   
---
My only complaint is the game doesn‚Äôt have near enough reason for players to hang out in the toxic valley or ash heap.  The main quest doesn‚Äôt really bring you there, and it‚Äôs level locked to fairly low level enemies.  Hoping we get major DLC in both.

I really hope we get to comment on this system before it‚Äôs rolled out and we‚Äôre stuck with garbage.  There‚Äôs good room between writing your own legendary and having to sacrifice small animals to RNJesus for decent rolls.  I‚Äôm ok with a system that has some RNG in it, even if my RL luck is 1.
---
Also upgrading gear from lvl 30 to 50 is a must imho.  I‚Äôve got some sweet, sentimental items that I really would love to use endgame.  Why do I only get great rolls on level 20-40 gear?
---
How about you just leave the REPAIR KIT thread instead of assaulting everyone who doesn't enjoy them get a grip fool
---
Speculation. Come back when theres facts. 
---
Still waiting for white or silver for Ultracite or even T series.... 
---
Well, server hopping for mutations is already making serums obsolete.
---
*that* i couldnt 100% confirm. but i have two sizes of water purifiers and they both seem to work i dependantly. and having multiples of the same resource generator at workshops works the same. ...why you need so much water? hitting them chems pretty hard?
---
Two Shot has always been garbage. Inaccurate as hell. High damage doesn't mean anything if you only hit half the time.
---
Pacifist completely reduces the chance of PvP-initiating crossfire? I was helping some lower guys through Alpha Silo last night and kept smacking them with my All Rise while shredding the Assaultrons (they were all Melee builds like me). Didn‚Äôt want to accidentally start a battle lol
---
I got it a while back for half off from Amazon ('physical copy').  I've got to be over 300 hours now, that's what, 10c an hour?
---
Even if the game has problems, if you can get 300 hours of enjoyment out of it, it's worth full price, and even better if you can get it cheaper.  (at 300 hours, I'm nowhere near done either).
---
Yeah I always start with a bit of radiation roulette to try to get a few of the ones I want and none that I don‚Äôt. But that usually ends up being like 3 max before I get really sick of it. 
---
This suggestion is covered in my inside the vault feedback from Jan 1, subject Containers for player and team utility. I would love to see both portable and built in world and in camp/workshop/team BASE types of containers for the entire spectrum of purposes we can exchange, give away, transport, or store items.
---
Thank you for raising it again to the community and Bethesda cm attentions. 
---
Where is the Black? Did they luanched yet? The first one wit red an blue i dont like it
---
Do like I did, just build where the flag poles are!

I've found multiple quad revolvers. I sell most of them ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

There was a Fallout 4 mod that auto-looted for you. Considering how often an enemy corpse just vanishes leaving no loot implementing an auto-loot into 76 might be a good idea. I'd advocate it only for looting enemies though as the Fallout 4 version would just pick up everything in your vicinity.
---
Me too.  Its hard to fight the scorched queen when she is flying.  I need to spray and pray.
---
Check WS after a nuke.  If you can't/dont collect enough, occasionally, someone will drop a paperbag full of it.  (Last weekend, someone left a paperbag with 5+ of each type of flux in the room with all the workbenches/PA stations)
---
My 1.8lb bloodied gatling says she is all i need in this world. 
---
So no, I'm not expecting a brand area project for them to be perfect, but I expect after paying over $80 that I could at least play the game.
---
Also, my "far too outdated for Fallout 76 computer" is running the game absolutely fine months later after they fixed their game ... &gt;.&gt;
---
stash is full. its not that its hard, it just feels like its there to slow you down. also it just makes sense imo that item degradation would be a survival only feature. also since everyone server hops to find the spots for rare junk like ballistic fiber it makes gathering them a bit more annoying. its a perfect system for survival but imo makes no sense in the normal mode. maybe repair kits will make it better.
---
Hoping someone will shoot back and get a wanted by hitting the camp?
---
Lol I agree without a doubt. It's ideal for my lvl 51(ps4 üòâ) enemies normally range from 25-35 those are easy xp opportunities. With the workshop in the west it has some decent resources to either scrap or sell for caps. Character flow is light so long looting sessions go primarily unbothered.
---
Thanks for posting this, my CAMP is right over your character's left shoulder behind the little red building Charleston Station. It's there purely because I have access to water and I wanted to build my house in keeping with the adjacent house. I did not know this was where this event spawned, I don't keep up with these little Easter eggs I just build stuff, farm my crops and sell my purified water. My intentions were purely innocent!
---
I will be moving my CAMP tonight.
---
I think there‚Äôs a settlement that needs your help. 
---
We're just complaining and you're letting us complain instead of helping us understand. This silence is never a good sign, because we know you're well aware, and choose to ignore it.
---
Maybe that's because we completely understand the rule of cosmetics only being broken.

Id love it to be able to check certain things mainly rather than trading. Like being able to check my perks and even rearrange them from my phone would be kind of cool. I'd love to be able to favourite a server from it, so you can select one that's less laggy and be able to unfavourite and check server status like how many people are on it, if it's got any reported problems because it sucks to go through all those loading screens to just have to log back out and then go through it all again. It would be cool to change your characters appearance from your phone too. 
---
I suspect there are many potential spawn locations with a rare chance, but those I found seem to always spawn armor related plans, so I would suggest server hopping those locations that you find Armor plans.
---
It's going to be a reward from a quest chain, but we don't know the exact details of what it will do. Some datamining indicates you'll be able to customize it for specific effects, but it's not clear what the requirements are.
---
Walked thru some Firecracker Berries?
---
The level 4 is probably a mule trying to get rid of some inventory. 
---
I have a melee/gunslinger build. I've always loved being a gunslinger, but all I'm using my pistols for is to get some pop shots from a distance and then finishing them off with melee. They desperately need a buff.
---
I have a 3* explosive cryolator it's kinda fun to fire it, for the whole 5 seconds worth of ammo that I have on me.
---
Funny that its now expensive just because of it
---
More like Bethesda doesn't want them to reply. If they don't, we can't complain any more than what we were already told.
---
Everytime something upsetting happens in the game, you notice Bethesda chooses not to reply, because their excuses don't add up.
---
Choosing not to say something means they don't care about how we feel about it.

I use power armor but I have the decency to use a weak weapon.  I'm just trying to tag stuff. 
---
Have u tried a tesla rifle for tagging? Then you can stay back and tag everything. 
---
All that aside. I feel ya
---
Ahhh nice, it is good to get some info on it. I am glad beth are doing more to add extra carry weight to stash and person. This is good work from them.
---
Completely.
---
While not surprising that a few of you refuse to acknowledge the difference between a currency and items purchased by currency, the items that are in the atomic store are not available in the game itself as a drop.
---
There is a distinct difference between having a thing drop in world, and having a thing in world that is earnable and enables you to purchase many different things from an out-of-world store.
---
why should they care about how you feel?
---
Oh and so far,  the absolute safest place I've found is in the middle if the water next to harppers ferry,  no attacks not once.

Turn on pacifist and lob a molotov into their mob of ghouls.  It won't help with jerks taking your dropped loot, but it'll make sure you get to loot what they kill.  It also won't blow the corpses sky high and cause you to lose the loot.  Plasma grenades won't launch the corpses either, but they're much more dangerous.
---
*scratches intensify*
---
Good way to get caps. Just stock a ton of water and sell it. It's the best thing I've got right now.
---
I swear. Is that really what they do? I thought some random invisible and undetectable enemy was attacking me, instead it was my own stupidity üòÇ thank you
---
You can sell great rolls for low level characters to appropriate people. I'll pay as much for level 30-35 gear as I would for maxlevel, if the gear fits my precise needs.
---
i love posts liek this that complain about the "immersion breaking" of a floating house, but people have no problem with 30 foot tall mirelurk queens and flying giant bat-monsters

Man I haven't been there since like middle school. I thought it shut down, it was in bad shape then and that was 15 years ago!
---
The area around Hemlock Holes, &amp; the Water Park are good for Violet &amp; Cobalt Flux.
---
Usually I use luck to get ammo and stimpaks in the early game, and start to switch over to the repair ones for later. Best not to start thinking about what they need to improve, you'll be at it for ages.
---
Damn wish I‚Äôd known that lol, kept having to apologize over the mic. I‚Äôm usually either solo or on a team so not used to collateral damage
---
shhhhhhhhh
---
Have they fixed them now?
---
Yes! still want to trade! added you, ign Landromat how much will you pay for plan?
---
It's a mainstay of the FOverse honestly, perks like armorer, weapon artisan and fix it good help to over repair armor and weapons. 
---
Keeping cards equipped like Makeshift warrior, Gunsmith and Licensed Plumber help to reduce degradation.
---
I constantly have R5 Gunsmith equipped and honestly my TSE Lever is the only rifle that I may need to repair the most.
---
Using armorer/ fix it good I don't necessarily repair my marine armor that often at all.
---
Granted at earlier levels it seems like a grind but it does get easier.
---
Yes, and somehow it's looked like that for the last 40 years. 
---
Ah, fond childhood memories of my grandpa taking us for a day at Camden, then my step grandmother "getting a headache" and we had to leave at noon, and then grandpa drinking beer while driving back home on curvy WV roads with all his grandchildren in the car.  Good times. 
---
Would like to know ign of that "raider".
---
The key to avoid this kind of jerk IMO is to safeguard the camp with double/triple locked door - all with good placement of hidden traps / turrets. Do not let anyone in. Losers get jealous with anything even pixels, so don't let them see your stuff. Also building few plants and purifiers unlocked outside also seem to deter these losers since they get to loot free water from the camp.
---
It has a higher than normal legendary spawn rate. And possibly a faster respawn rate for monsters. It's THE place to go to get your first set of legendary gear. 
---
It's also turning into a defacto player hub, something the developers seem to going with, since they are putting all the vendor factions there.
---
I don't agree. There's still a PvP element to adventure mode, with the workshop's. The only thing that changes with survival mode is the PvP restrictions. Even adventure mode is meant to have survival elements. Take eating, drinking and fixing away and you're taking large elements of the game away.
---
Botstop outside of Lewisburg in the Ash Heap. The tree by the bus near that bot stop has some on it usually.
---
No way :D
---
Good idea. 
---
Another would be to make those duped items worth more as mats.
---
Whatever you feel is reasonable. I can go up to 2k but if you see another plan, etc we can work something out.
---
I'm there a lot when I'm testing builds or farming for materials so this works out. I used to just farm and run. Now I'll definitely make a habit of looking at that spot before moving on. 
---
Everything always repairs to 200% for me. So I guess so.
---
is this on PC? I haven't seen this at all, but then, I stopped taking workshops a while back so idk
---
I know, just ironic that the only roof in FO76 is also a green tin roof.
---
Better actually be an interesting and challenging fight , as oppose to a generic fight like a deathclaw or something.
---
most of those people either duped the weapons or bought them from a  duper
---
i have 3 characters, a lvl 90, a lvl 80, and a lvl 32, and i've only ever had 1 explosive weapon drop, i felt very lucky, of course it was a lvl 30 smg, but at least it was one
---
I take random damage all time, I've even had completely invisible enemies kicking my butt until I somehow ran far enough away from my invisible assailant. 
---
In PvP they can be quite effective.
---
There like people who go in and out of passive mode on GTA 5.
---
**That's customer feedback.** They think that they can ignore certain feedback because it breaks their promise to cosmetic only in the atom.
---
aaaand now im calling bullshit that you just "found them"
---
The issue is that even a lower level item with the right legendary effects is still better than a max level cap item.
---
That's a really good idea to solve that problem. But it makes me mad for the legitimate god-roll items I've acquired. I'd have to practically start all over. So I doubt this would fly. It would hurt more than it would help since the dupers are in the minority. Honestly I think the steps they've already taken were pretty fair and effective. 
---
That works? I figured with the new patch and slap damage removal that wouldn't do anything. Plus if it did that's being rude right back...
---
I've heard that it all goes back to "Sonic 2sday."
---
Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was massively influential because it coordinated an entire, worldwide release on a given day.
---
I suppose I was lucky then
---
I never even thought of this but I love it great idea!!
---
Does it mean my tse gatling plasma is quite expensive atm as well?
---
That's a shame that I vendored my explosive cryolator several month ago though...
---
December. Several patches ago.
---
People already cry, saying so-and-so weapon is OP. They will really cry getting killed by a lvl 60 weapon..
---
Just buy all the duped shit and drop it in a fissure lol
---
But I do agree. Want to make that God roll tse obsolete? Make a lvl 55...
---
But to have this successfully work, Bethesda needs to stop duping 
---
A Tesla rifle, eh? I may have to resort to that. 3 runs today and I had the same shit happen and got practically nothing.
---
Yesterday I switched characters a few times and once saw my character A camp disappearing one piece at a time while my character B camp appeared one piece at a time. (Camps are in the same spot)
---
Earlier that day I saw someone else's camp disassembling (while mine was assembling).  It happened more than one time and each time was the same base (which I have never seen).
---
Bloodied, is that the prefix which ups your damage due to low health? I think it's clever but don't want to have to respec around it if possible. Do. You think I'd need to shuffle points around to get the most out of it? 
---
Where survival pvp is atm it's seems to come down to who gets the drop on who. So providing your build isn't dirt I don't think you need to be top tier damage wise to ruin people's days.
---
I have a furious handmade that's OK it's base dmg is just over 100, my lever action is good mob clearence with headshot accuracy and crit. 
---
Again I think my weapons arnt aligned with my build well. 
---
Another good idea.
---
I agree. In Adventure mode, the Whitespring is essentially a "trading hub" w/ workbenches, etc. Even in Survival, I've run into other players inside the Whitespring and not gotten griefed, though I think in that respect I've just been lucky.
---
I wish they had planned more events like Fasnacht to roll out, that was a real reason for players to converge, work together, and trade with each other.
---
I can run over and empty my junk extractor and run back out before the foundations appear around it.
---
They must have changed it then. Because I added mine last month. I‚Äôll get a pic next time I‚Äôm on to show. It has the scorched killer receiver but still only a two star tse
---
I've had times where this happens and I think it's a delay in the server processing damage you've already taken. It's kind of like how you will get random XP long after you killed something. I'll be walking along and all of a sudden I hear grunting like someone's taking damage and then I'll lose a couple HP. But it's usually within a few minutes of having fended off an attack of multiple creatures. I never have it happen if I've not fought anything recently. 
---
The Charred ones do look like they are formed from fecal matter.

---
with each faction vendor only holding 200 caps a day and a fixed amount of stash space, you might want to start diversifying your revenue *stream*. but really, its a hard place to be when youve exhausted all the vendors, got a full inventory AND full stash box. start planning ahead...  pro tip: *you* may have QoL perks to lower the weight of whatever, but it goes back to full weight once its in your stash box.
---
When it comes to pure stats and DPS, they just simply cannot compete with the meta, however I have to agree somewhat because a weapons effectiveness relies heavily on whether or not the user knows how to play its strengths and weaknesses correctly.
---
What is wrong with the post?
---
Yeah it's funny they go from commenting almost daily, to complete silence when they know they are dropping some questionable stuff that people won't be happy about. 
---
you gave feed back. they dont have to reply.
---
It doesn't affect mine.
---
Thank  you too!
---
I think you need to chill out and wait and see what actually goes on tomorrow.
---
Also, they've been silent for about 2 days at this point not "this past week"
---
I've got a little outside shed, with a stash box, a tinker's bench, and working on adding a purifier to it, for everyone to use. Too low level, too few plans at this level to really do it up just yet.
---
Power armor over powered? In what sense? I alway thought PA wearers were big and slow and loud as fuck.
---
If it wasn't for nuke zones I wouldn't even have a set.
---
Those are great for the Queen from what I‚Äôve heard!
---
I think raiders are spineless wimps anyway. Not too smart and only brave in groups or when OP against an opponent. Looks like the description fits. 
---
I actually feel a little sorry for them. Anyone who "roll plays" as a raider probably has bigger issues in life to contend with
---
Happens all the time for me, has since day one on PC. Sometimes it's even accompanied by a blood splatter on the screen but HP is unaffected.
---
Just gotten used to ignoring it :p
---
I think a companion app that is basically your Pipboy, with maybe some extra ‚Äúsocial‚Äù features, like trading, etc. is a missed opportunity for Bethesda. 
---
&gt; I believe they are fully prepared to take this amount of backlash with silence to let all die quietly without taking any action to correct the situation.
---
Yup, the community managers haven't said a peep since the info got out
---
...say, whats your screen name again? *throws on full assassin gear*
---
He was glitched up into the shelf on the wall for me yesterday. I think it's a cry for help.
---
The chest is great but leather is better for the limbs. You trade like 3-5 ballistic defense for around 30 energy defense.
---
Yeah the instigating prefix is definitely something I need, explosives I'm meh with as I don't want to drop into the explosive perk card. Have a heavy weapons build that I love though. 
---
You too man, I kept getting beers for a long time.
---
Man, you're a pansy who is acting tough, but when it came down to it, you cried because someone told you not to go into somebody's camp. That's pathetic. Move on. 
---
You've had a lot of others agree with you that the mean old level 200 guy who asked you to stay away is bad and ought to be banned.  As stupid as that is, take comfort in it. 
---
I'm going to block you now, because your indignation and entitlement are tiresome. 
---
Those costumes are amazing.
---
Blackwater Mine is also very convenient. Rad shower near the entrance and radioactive barrels a little further into the cave. As for farming, I got two first mutations via this method, but it's too tedious. Just buy :)
---
My question was directed at this specific spot. I already know people have glitched into vaults located at other spots in the past.

Does Suppressor work in Pvp? I thought I read it doesn't work on players. 
---
Are they all the same condition?
---
It‚Äôs possible.  If you want thru a firecracker berry plant without picking them they will burst and you will take a small amount of damage.  
---
It took me by surprise the first few times.
---
That said, you can hit random, temporary, invisible walls that will halt your forward motion, jumps, sometimes even stagger you, when nothing is around at all that appear to be random glitches.  
---
Wtf that‚Äôs happens? I thought that was Todd trolling me
---
Nice, dragons a good shout. Quads a must on it for me, loading times a killer! 
---
You think the silence means nothing? It means they will ignore this particular feedback. They release it, ask for feedback, then stay silent. There is a big issue here, they reply to almost anything, even people's stories. The choice to stay silent is over an order from Bethesda, not that they want to.
---
Is duped items really an issue?  Level 70 player haven‚Äôt ever duped or traded/bought weapons. I just find them and use them. 
---
Yup! I just leveled a new guy in survival to 32 yesterday and hope to hit end build tonight. Bloody all the way.
---
Stuck terminals or work benches are usually caused by server lag. Signals from your PC travels to Internet but the game server did not get it. I suggest relogging at different time of the day.
---
I believe that quest is a side quest and should be droppable. Just go to PIP and look under data and side.
---
It‚Äôs fine when you don‚Äôt like something. Everyone is entitled to dislike things. It‚Äôs when you start trying to influence others to stop liking things that‚Äôs a problem. 
---
I play in survival though.
---
Honestly, it's a smart and effective tactic on their part. It's frustrating and I don't like it, but I understand it. It's hard to fight something that runs from you. If they ignore the complaints, they can't generate any more backlash than they already have. Think how things would've been different if EA hadn't done their 'sense of pride and accomplishment' statement. Bethesda has literally nothing to gain by commenting.
---
Auto on a vats build, surprised it works? I have a heavy weapons user that absolutely shred though, great fun. 
---
I found a firecracker Berry an walked through it. It was that. I'm surprised I didn't think of that, especially considering both times it happened there was one right behind me and still exploding haha
---
If you're on PSN I'll help you set it up, also if we can find this guy's PSN name me and three of my friends looooooooove to troll the trolls. It's our favorite pastime recently. We do to them what they do to others; shoot them, stalk them, obliterate their base, wait for them to build up workshops and then steal them.

I haven‚Äôt tested it honestly, I don‚Äôt see why it wouldn‚Äôt work tho as it doesn‚Äôt state that it‚Äôs only for PvE but it‚Äôs entirely possible that it‚Äôs bugged in some way. Personally I don‚Äôt use it I was just giving an alternative to travel agent if OP wanted to keep the points in charisma. 
---
Yeah this last weekend my place got attacked/half destroyed by 3 totally different people on different servers
---
i finally just gave up on trying to play at all until the patch comes to make it so they cant harm bases in adventure mode
---
i bet people are doing this as they know soon they wont be able to grief the bases in adventure mode, so they are trying to get it in
---
i cant fucking wait until our camps are finally safe form asshole teenager @#$@#@$
---
lol I was afraid of that.
---
Also some emails between Kent and Shannon's husband about plans for building up the hideout.
---
It works fantastic. I have a 3\* Furious/VATS crit combat rifle that kills very quickly and might be a lot of the reason I love the build so much. I also have 4 Powered Assassin pieces plus chameleon so I never run out of AP.

The mire and toxic valley. Both look amazing at night.

I don't mind realistic encounters with other players, even PvP encounters. People who exploit the adventure mode limitations to harass low level players aren't roleplaying though. They are just being assholes. Me and my friends love to return the favor.

Agree, Roses quest will take you places that are not level appropriate, especially when you get the steal from supermutants portion...

Path of the wind has lots of lower level critters.  
---
So does morgantown airport.  Lots of L10 mutants at wade airport.
---
WV mill is a good for lots of mutants - sit on the opposite hill and snipe the outside guys.  When you go inside, they will swarm you.  
---
Snipe @ grafton steel and grafton dam as well.  
---
Camden park has a fair number of low level scorched.
---
You should be able to do everything in toxic valley.
---
At about L30, start on the fringes of the ash heap and work towards the excavator quest.  
---
Lewiston(for the veil quest, I think)  is also level dependent.  L48 Mutant swarm  and a wendigo if a high level has been through, low level ghouls and scorched if not.
---
I would recommend a good medium or fast melee weapon for a WS run.
---
 If its not nuked, the ghouls are usually in the 40s.  On a good day, you'll get a couple legendary weapons out of it.  There are a couple buildings they will attack en masse.  THere is one building with a wendigo.
---
  In the nuke zone, you'll get 58s, usually in groups of 5.  Its doable, but tough at you'r level.  
---
I‚Äôm on both sides of this. I‚Äôve been on the nuking side many times. By the time I get there to enjoy my Nuke, others have gotten the spoils. 
---
Conversely, I‚Äôve also been ‚Äúfirst on the scene‚Äù from a nuke I didn‚Äôt launch, and gotten to all the goodies before others. 
---
Honestly, I‚Äôve stopped being frustrated as the Nuker and stopped feeling guilty as the first on the scene by simply educating myself on how the game mechanics handles respawns. 
---
If you missed all the ghouls, it‚Äôs ok. Take note of some of the names in the server (or be on a team) abs just close and rejoin. All ghouls respawn. 
---
Or just wait it out. The game will automatically respawn them if you haven‚Äôt hit than arena yet after a certain amount of time. 
---
Also, even after the red circle clears, existing ghouls will still spawn and flux will still be available until it has been harvested. 
---
The one downside to still getting a he Flux after the zone has died down is that the enemies will no longer be carrying Hardened or glowing mass as much. 
---
Nuking WS comes with risks. It‚Äôs not like SBQ where anyone that put a shot in can get some rewards. The goodies the individual ghouls drop are usually only claimed by one person, so instead of getting frustrated, just think Shit happens, and seek workarounds. 
---
Yeah they are, I've just crafted them, and the resistance they're giving me isn't even the resistance it said in the armor bench.
---
I think I'll be getting the fire breather one! Hopefully for some rp action.
---
The Mothman of the Point Pleasant statue and style looks sick in real life.
---
I can see it now:  someone running, lights flashing, screaming into their mic "WEE OOO WEE OOO HONK HONK HONK WEE OOO."
---
That's 2000 Atoms please.
---
I ate one 
---
I hated the modern weapons mod, personally. Frost is a much more interesting, brutal mod if you want a challenge. Granted, it's a complete overhaul so not necessarily appropriate if you want the vanilla story.
---
Blame BGS, they  built a bully trainer with no regards for the ethical questions.  It's working as designed and creating bullies.
---
Not sure it'd be too new. They already have Shelter and the FO4 companion apps.
---
This is pretty much just a companion app wired up to their existing APIs. 
---
It doesn't affect your stealth, but I find it covers up other telltale sounds I need to hear, like footsteps and grunts from mobs.  It makes the game harder for me if I have music running.  I've even taken to lowering the ambient music volume so I can hear the environment more clearly.
---
this is beyond science
---
So you wanted White Springs all to yourself but this other dude is the greedy bastard?
---
Then you suggest people should go one at a time, but you couldn‚Äôt wait for dude to leave and go through again? 
---
Maybe you should just play Animal Crossing. 
---
I've got his name, but on XBone.
---
I'll most likely be breaking out my melee character next time I see him online, and go hunting. I've yet to lose a fight between him and anyone twice his level.
---
Oh god no, I can't stand that shit.
---
It's the best day of the week to roll out new stuff. Everyone is busy on Monday. You never release things on Friday because then you can't react to problems until after the weekend and some people skip out early or take the day off. Thursday, likewise doesn't give you enough time if a patch is needed. So Tuesday/Wednesday is usually ideal. And I know in retail, those are also two of the slowest days, so they do new releases then to drive some more mid-week traffic. I don't know why movie theaters don't do the same.
---
Could not agree more!  Modern weapons was the great Equalizer for adrenaline filled fun.
---
You haven‚Äôt launched one before? also gonna send request, BioHazzard223 
---
"road beers" are timeless 
---
Ah powered, completely forgot about that prefix. That might be a game changer. 
---
ill give it a try, thanks for the info
---
Awwww that's awesome!! 
---
Do it!  I‚Äôm jealous of the $15 but hey join us!
---
Source? I found the Great winter of 2130 but it should be almost 30 years later the Reclamation day. Did I miss the dates?
---
Omg, I'm doing this!
---
Somehow it's still open and looking worst than ever haha!! 
---
Thank God.  Because you're annoying af.
---
Since the beta period, challenges have been wonky, but only some of them. If you want this fixed, please do report which challenges or criteria are not counting specifically. Some are not retroactive if you're playing on a character since beta. In which case you have to do it with a newer character, perhaps for the learning recipes challenge for example. In which case if you *do* it with another character and it is *still* not counting, (like the Grafton Damn discovery) then we can chalk it up as an identified, specific challenge that needs to be fixed.
---
So jealous. I've only ever got 1 and that was on FO4.
---
I can't believe that was considered a 'bug'.  Seemed to be working fine.
---
For sure!! I didn't have any pictures without my face in it sadly so I just posted the one from inside the museum. We drove out to the places he was apparently first spotted but sadly only saw some butterfly's lol! 
---
So waiting my turn and making one pass, then leaving so someone else can have theirs is bad manners? Your name fits.
---
I was able to put mine away once I completed finding all of them. One possible mistake some have is not following the beginning of the quest to pick up the first tape while you are still inside Vault 76. Doesnt matter how many you get after that, you cant get back in to get the first one. Also the one you get at Site Alpha for dropping a nuke somewhere besides Fissure Prime gets passed over fairly often, you have to go back to Site Alpha a little bit after launching to get your holotape of severe disappoint.
---
Oop ash land locker near railyard
---
Because nobody does that‚Äôs stupid ass corpse flower mission so nobody cared enough to put in a ticket.  But people really like the mama dolches and so they would do it, people would get stew they didn‚Äôt understand and complain 
---
Wait... 
---
you mean it's actually *possible* to gets something out of one of those?
---
Ahah 90k . How is that even gonna be handled? You pay 25k and then be in debt for the rest untill he wants to cash in?
---
Anyway lasers and plasma are quite good now,and if you don't use the grounded mutation,they also have good damage.
---
*Wa-cha!*
---
I was not disappointed reading this thread.
---
You first 
---
Oh I see the "all raiders" part now. Over generalizations are terrible. I don't mind actual Raider roleplayers, even in Adventure. People that exclusively prey on low level players though are just angsty teenagers with too much free time imho though. I was against all PvP before but now that I've gotten used to the combat system (because this game doesn't really give you a choice, it's either learn how to PvP or don't enjoy the game) I find it a lot more fun. I use an Executioner's Gatling Gun with 33% VATS hit chance and it slaaaaaaays. I took on 4 people for the Converted Muntions Factory earlier today, all but one were above my level. Beat them all. I don't even have PvP gear.
---
I also enjoy hunting Raiders. Ad Victoriam!
---
To maximize water production use at least 1 of each size purifier. The first built of each type gets the production, everyone after that just adds storage. 
---
I believe the "medical malpractice 44" is still obtainable from the survival mode challenge this week. Not 100% sure, but I think you could still get it until tomorrow. It's not very good, but for the benefit of anyone who cares.
---
I had a 3* wendingo only drop abraxo....nothing else 
---
That‚Äôs the weird part, there wasn‚Äôt a mission marker and I went to that room and clicked everything I could and it wouldn‚Äôt work. Guess it was just a bug?
---
The forest! I only live 3 hours away from the game area and walking through it is like walking around google maps in a way lol. It‚Äôs weird, like all the sounds and sights instantly make me feel like I‚Äôm more involved in the game if that makes sense
---
Maybe try running anywhere possible in the area. Ofc make sure the quest is marked in your pip boy. Try closing app and restarting maybe. I‚Äôm not sure haha 
---
Interesting. I did pick up the first on in the vault. But I've only dropped 1 nuke and it was on the Queen. I guess I know what I'll be doing tonight. Thanks for the info!
---
I'm going to make life take back these lemons
---
Yes and don't forget a pvp match takes seconds. All those strategies like lob a nade,then switch to this,then pop that med.........you're dead at the first step slowpoke!
---
Depending on your Perks, your crafted armor may be crafted above 100% Condition.  Shown by a, sometimes hard to see, white bar ontop of the yellow.
---
DR of armor above 100% Condition is scaled UP.  So the higher you are above 100%, the more DR it has  (ER seems unaffected).  And your DR will drop until it reaches 100%.  That point it will be the base item DR, and will stay there until 0% and it breaks (it will not drop below that base value, even at less than 100%).
---
Anything goes in the wasteland

More screenshots + costumes [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bauu6a/sheepsquatch\_sheepsquatchs\_costumes\_easter\_egg/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bauu6a/sheepsquatch_sheepsquatchs_costumes_easter_egg/)
---
Some of these were added or updated in a later patch and need to be cleared by a new character since it's already been 'discovered' on a main. I made a new character and fast traveled to a friend but it didnt pop, on another alt I discovered it on my own and it cleared. Through a bit more test runs, seems like it actually has to be legitimately discovered and not jumped to.
---
However, grafton dam is a legit hiccup, all others I have been able to clear by roaming on foot as a new character.
---
I have to say seeing stuff like this really makes me happier and happier I didn't waste money on this game. I'm never buying an EA or Bethesda game until they're years old and have been reduced to 5$ prices on sale 5 years later.
---
Wow I would cry too... luckily I‚Äôve only lost trivial things but that much ammo would really burn me.
---
Meh Vats is great but when you get the people who constantly pop stealth boys hoooooo boy it‚Äôs fun &gt;_&gt;
---
Yes! Rifles, baseball bats, ski sword.
---
Unfortunately no-one's tested the AP limit. It was roughly damage = 6x DR in Fallout 4, but the formula seems to be slightly different in Fallout 76.
---
agree with iamjjohnson. 
---
Post nuke, no airborne rads, but plants are still irradiated; go gather flux.
---
Not all enemies are glowing/bloated (but they are around), along with a few  nonglowing/non-bloated legendaries, but at slightly lower levels. 
---
  Did one like that over the weekend - the bloated ones were almost in a stupor - walked right up to them and got at least one hit in before they got off the floor.  
---
OTOH, went to the golf club, and every one of the usual critters in the building was gathered at the front door, and attacked all at once.  
---
That was messy.  
---
Huh, I guess so. Yet another glitched event...
---
It's pretty surprising how fast AP regens. I did some testing on this a while back. Naked with no perks I takes around 13 seconds to regen. With Action Boy 3, Rejuvenation 1 and 4 pieces of powered armor, well tuned and some craft-able food it's around 2.5 seconds.
---
I'd love this. It'd be balanced if it took more flux to craft or something.
---
PLEASE. 
---
If someone is using a glitch to get permanent invisibility (as has been suggested above) then the stealth mod for PA is a potential source for the glitched invisibility and the usefulness of the mod under normal circumstances doesn't really matter.
---
Alternate Alternative suggestion, give us a liberty prime statue crushing a liberator 
---
I too have never completed I am become death. Never launches a nuke yet.  It‚Äôs tough I‚Äôve gone in the silo solo and came out 30 stimpacks and 700 308 ammo less. Not sure how far I made it. But i gave up. 
---
Not really, because it's all guess work and you have to hope you get the combination you need.
---
Just starts healing, it's a lot like Vampire just triggered by VATS instead.
---
Ones a heavy combat armor 
---
Yah let accomidate you and your abundamce of money and not worry about ppl who dont have that many caps sounds good to me
---
I won't disagree with you on that and I think lowly of people who initiate PvP in adventure mode since survival was released. True PvPers can't stand world of slap damage. I also see the co-op people needs as valid and I'm in favor of making the camps ungriefable for adventure mode pacifists.
---
Well I got the right to post my opinion sense when was that banned? On a board full of opinions? The rest you did is just ranting nonsense your really triggered typeing that reply I can tell but calm your salt levels block me and move on with your life before you bust a boood vessel over your anger 
---
&gt; giving you
---
giving =/= selling
---
I'm like just under 700 hours in at this point. This summer I'll rack up wwwaaaayyyy more. I can do it before 4 years.
---
Stupid sexy radiation monsters.
---
I camp in the forest around center map just south of Helvetia just to keep from having to move around a lot. But as for enemies and general aesthetics, definitely the mire. Toxic valley is also very cool, but it's kind of boring and has too low level enemies. 
---
I was able to kill the 10 unruly feral golfers the other day. It took a lot of server hops and a little luck. Once a level 20 or under entered the area around the Golf Club, they actually spawned. Am I glad to be done with that so I can explore or farm at Whitespring as I please now. Which is to say do anything *other* than constantly farm yet.
---
When it gets to a point for me to outrage I will outrage but until then ima keep my pitch forks and nooses for Todd Howard‚Äôs neck in the closet 
---
yes, your left is "heavy combat" the right one is just "combat"...
---
I‚Äôll help out if I‚Äôm free to do so. Gt KnowledgeHound I‚Äôve seen some organise nuke drops on here before but others people just tend to turn up to fight her 
---
I got my first pie in the beta, first day! Wandered into flatwoods and decided to hit the machine, not expecting anything. I was shook when I ended up with one though. I've never gotten one before or after that, not even in fallout 4. Unfortunately, I was so surprised I got one, I assumed the drop rate had been increased and ate it :/
---
up to 5 but gave one to my team mate so back to 4 more to go for a full pie
---
Exactly, I had to server hop 3 times but I found the spawn point, thanks !
---
"but it's canned from ancient dry goods, why does it go off faster than eat steaks?" 
---
Eat it quick. Once removed shelf life becomes short lol
---
I did a non nuke run today. Just got a suppressors explosive combat rifle!! Only lvl 40 though. I'm at lvl 165 and it's the 4th explosive weapon I've found. üëçüëç
---
Yeah just a thought kinda have to reload western revolver tho
---
That‚Äôd be disappointing. I‚Äôm hoping for some head-butting action. 
---
Dump your junk before going into a nuke zone and you won't have that problem.
---
The production rate is for your entire camp. So no matter if you have 1 or 50 purifiers, you will only produce water at the rate of one purifier. And it's pretty random which purifier it will appear in first. Once all your purifiers are full, then it stops producing. So, basically, having multiple just makes it take longer before they max out and stop producing. So you can go longer between trips to your camp to empty them out. I have 5 going and I can get by with only stopping at my camp once per session to empty.
---
We need more wall and roof options in general. 
---
Nope lol tried that already 
---
Been fixed since sometime in December.
---
Funny, I always thought Mothman was taller. :)
---
If you lunch nuke on fissure prime, tell people here and they will come :)
---
Was in 3 SBQ fights myself last night, people show up from nowhere :)  (Xbox)
---
Yes! All the good stuff is sold while I'm at work. This would definitely create a better market and higher prices as more people would be able to participate.
---
cloaking armor makes you invisble for a short time after youve been hit.
---
You know it'll be like the Fasnacht Megasloth who'll be dead before he can even register he's died and when he does die properly he'll drop a mint roasted lambchops recipe, one of those costumes and a 1\* level 35 leather left leg.
---
It's as stupid as going into a post about hamburgers and being a childish moron to people for talking about hamburgers. I'm saying you're 15 at the oldest. 
---
I use a full set of weightless bos heavy combat armor (with chameleon mutation) over in survival now and again....it holds its own for the most part (obviously not as strong as cavalier or sentinel variants though)
---
Besides, ghouls are melee. So you can avoid them, especially if you have marsupial mutation. However, these dudes hit hard and a pack of them can surround and overpower you in a couple of seconds. The best spot is the golf club building, you can jump on a green bus roof and shoot from above. 
---
Be patient young one. They are adding that with a future patch.  Moving the vendors all to white spring will organically create a hub for players.
---
If you nuke Fissure Prime people will show up. If you drop the nuke east of Fissure Prime so the nuke just hits the edge of it while leaving the drop site outside of the nuke zone you'll get even more people. 
---
I think the more stars they have the better the drop. I might get a 1\* TS western revolver from a 3\* enemy, but the 0\* only seem to give me armor and rarely a weapon I don't want. However usually melee weapons from a 3\* usually have 3 effects. I have yet to get a 3\* ballistic at all. 
---
No. It‚Äôs sucks. Level 300+ dickbags who do nothing but grief 
---
The 'make a friend' has bugged me since November... I've made animal friends, pacified robots, made in game friends, cleared quests that suggest 'friending' things... and NOTHING!!!
---
It's a fun world but more NPCs and quests would make it a lot better. The perk system is really fun and so are mutations. 
---
I have relogged several times, heck I even tried it on different computers. 
---
fuck that makes sense but its pretty confusing. Thanks for the heads up.
---
They tried, Berry Mentats still see them. üòà One guy wasn't stealthed or sneaking but I still couldn't VATS him. He still died though. Him and his sweater vest and Faschnact Witch mask.
---
It was thrilling. I had a friend in party with me who said he would come if I needed him, but I did it on my own just for the adrenaline rush. It was great. I haven't felt that much energy in this game in a while.
---
Nice find!
---
Oh cool. Hey does the amount healed change based on damage dealt or are there other effects that determine the amount healed by the trigger? Are there perks that can increase the healing? 
---
the smaller one is normal combat armor, and the bigger one is heavy combat armor
---
I see the mentioned so many times, why does it make sense to you folks?  if egg crate has six slots it can hold up to six eggs, sometimes there will be only three, but it can hold six, but if the crate only had one slot it can hold only one egg, or none...  it doesn't make sense the other way around...
---
that being said, I think the creature should drop a legendary equal to the star level, no more, no less...
---
When you say it's "no longer there," what do you mean? Is it in your quest log, but not showing up on the map? Is it not in your quest log at all? 
---
If it's in your log but not showing up on the map, try unfollowing all quests and then following them again, sometimes that clears it.
---
If it's not in your log at all, maybe go try talking to rose again. You may need to try to re-trigger the start off the quest, and those are usually location based it seems to me. 
---
Walk there from a new character, that worked for me on everything but grafton dam. Fast traveling using a friend never ending in any discoveries but walking on foot across the map did.
---
Indeed. Would love chat too.
---
My advice is that if you see several low level characters, do not start on that server  Because they join the battle and do nothing, they just get in the way.  increase the life of the queen 
---
If I bought a 6 slot egg case and it only came with 3 eggs I'd be pissed.
---
I've seen this brought up in the past and I love this idea!

If they don‚Äôt drop any sort of legendary, give it a second and look again. I guarantee it will be there in a few seconds. But if you get the drill or something like that you are outta luck. 
---
When he killed me in Survival mode, I dropped all of my Atomic Shop repair kit aid items‚ÄîI want a refund!
---
So a Yao Guai Deathclaw mix?
---
Everyone in the lobby will show up.  
---
Get in a lobby where you can see more high levels in it than under level 50 ppl 
---
Start the event and they will come.  People are bored out in the wastes.  
---
I think many (like me) are burnt out on the whole process of launching the nuke. But the nuke zone it‚Äôs self is still worth it so I show up to every one. 
---
Now i am confused why i am getting corpse flower stamen
---
the screenshot just says bladed. 
---
Bladed (what) is the question.
---
The missing word is the key - 
---
That would be a mod for a (likely melee weapon to add blades.
---
There are several to which you can add blades - rolling pin, commie whacker, et al.
---
Obtain the appropriate item, apply the mod, and enjoy the results :)
---
You probably  didn't play when the game was discounted because that's when the game was still populated with people farming Whitesprings. Most of the people now are playing survival mode or left the game because a lack of new content. I play on PC, so I can't guarantee that the experience is the same on a console.
---
While it does suck...
---
1.	Start firing. You get a wide crosshair
---
2.	Aim afterwards. Crosshairs contract,giving you a pretty good aiming reference.
---
For arms, agreed. The best/most balanced all around is combat chest, leather arms, metal legs.
---
Sorry,Ps4.
---
Dps is irrelevant if their damage mitigation negates it all. A  explosive laser rifle with the splitter and auto capacitor will decimate any sentinel/cavalier build in seconds, despite its inferior dps.
---
The Firebreather skin is HOT (pun intended)
---
I also like to run the pacify perks as that gives you a box on enemies which helps massively with aiming.
---
Dont pay next time more then 200 caps,that's the maximum price.
---
Just incase you aren't aware or you can't get the coat, there is a Watchtower just south of Wes Tek that has an explorers outfit. It goes pretty well with the assult gasmask as an alternative until you can get the coat :)
---
Damn what platform are you. I have about 5 caps and can give you weapons, armour and meds for some capsüòÇ
---
You literally charged me 250 for one of them
---
Oh. Hell, yeah your right Stranger! But still the Gamemode is coming :D
---
THIS...
---
many of these quests have been updated and changed. Same in other MMO's, new or updated challenges dont 'grandfather' in. You played a character right before patch X and completed what became a challenge after patch X you will still need to do it again. 
---
I agree that pacifists need a way to remain passive, but previously I had said that should extend to Workshops as well and have since changed my mind. I don't pick on weaker players, but I don't run away anymore either. Just like the Brotherhood of Steel in FO4, I need resources, and occasionally that has to happen at gunpoint. I will give you the opportunity to leave though, and I won't chase you down and destroy your base or anything like that.
---
And you are but you didn‚Äôt buy the eggs you killed something and took it from its corpse, be grateful your cooking at all
---
But between shots or while aiming the crosshairs disappear.
---
lol. You have any vanguard combat pieces? Im on PC :-)
---
I made a character for survival that's just pure Rifle PvP. Puts out a ton of damage with a ton of damage resistance. Really fun going back to adventure mode and running into the few people still slap-damage griefing. 
---
They never expect to be one-shot by someone 50-100 levels lower than them.
---
I'm interested to see the players gather together when the faction vendors arrive at the Whitesprings. I do feel like this will naturally turn into a player hub but I'll mention this overall idea to the team. :)
---
Berry mentats don‚Äôt make them vatsabke, you can also outranfe the effect. But I‚Äôm glad you had fun ! That‚Äôs what the game is about 
---
He can spawn without his lemonade stand as well, I found him on the road next to a supply drop.
---
Well to whoever wanted that Fire Breathers Excavator paint, you got your wish
---
I had a full set of assassins. Kept getting one shot. I said f it and re did my armor. I'm either crazy or assassins dont work for me.
---
That I'm not sure of I haven't really had the chance to test on many weapons, Medic doesn't seem to pop up that often to be honest. I don't think there are any perks that increase it however.
---
Great post, 10/10.
---
We have a civil war clan set up and that would help greatly with the general aesthetic of the group

If you enjoy the part of fallout that involves running around collecting scrap, shooting things, building and leveling up it's awesome. If you like fallout for the story or npcs, it's not going to deliver.    
---
The launch problems of cheating and server instability are solved as far as I've seen (for now).    
---
For me, it's totally worth it.
---
Invest points into White Knight will reduce the cost of armor repairs to a almost nothing. I only equip the card to do repairs now but if you use it all the time your armor wear is very, very low. Check the link for a guide on the best armor sets.

---
That's so great! How cool of your husband to take you on a Fallout trip around Appalachia! 
---
What about vanguard marine?
---
I have this same objection. Passive mode, grenades - got it. Thank you hive mind! 
---
It happens to me all the time, even when I'm not over encumbered. And I'm always well fed and watered. For me, it seems I can only initiate trade with a player one time. After that, they aren't able to start a trade with me or accept my trade request. But if they initiate first, then we have no problems. 
---
I wish it were bigger, Although I am using the body of the deathclaw, I would like it to have a size similar to a behemoth 
---
I had a two-shot level five that I got shortly after leaving the vault.  It was my go-to weapon for the longest time, but I gave it to a level-6 that just came out of the vault and gifted me some junk.

Kinda wish I kept it seeing this now, lol

Are you seriously suggesting we all take a turn during a nuke farming event at Whitespring? I have never seen people do these. Nobody use sneak because it is a farming time. Taking a turn can never be done because these ghouls are open to every players &amp; not reserved for a single player. This is not a fo4.
---
If you want to farm the zone for level, but not high lvl enough or still squishy, find a way to tag behind higher lvl players while getting your shots in. Or tag them all and stand on top of bus while getting your shots in. I have seen lvl 11 and many lower lvls in hazmat suit do this without problems nor complaints.
---
Thanks, but not what Im looking for :) The point of this post was not trading, but to get attention to the fact that caps are useless right now. I appreciate the offer, though :-)
---
impressive CAMP mate, id love to come and have a look. please send me a friend request

Snake Eater MTL
---
I'm on xbox one, hopefully we are on the same platform
---
It's not in the log at all. Only the main portion is Flavors of Mayhem. I did speak to rose again and nothing. Only marker on my map is for Rose. Idk might just have to wait it out it seems. 
---
I'm very excited to whack it. 
---
They should make it drop Sheepsquatch wool that you can give to a robot tailor who can turn it into some new clothing items like Wool Caps, Flannels and Sweaters.

Upvoted for "Never release on Friday" :)

Got a drill off a one-star and a syringer off a 3-star this weekend (no legendary prefixes) ...feelsbad.jpg  
---
I thought they fixed the lootpool to remove those items as eligible drops.
---
I went and looted other corpses and went back, still nothing, has been the only fluke like that I've had
---
The kicker is that you don't know until you get it on, so trading can be tricky if ur not really up on stats for each
---
Nah sorry also on Xbox so dw
---
YES! THIS. I server hopped before doing the silo run (solo, took a bit more time but not much) to make sure there were multiple (I mean at least 5-8 people) that were above level 100 on the map. Not that you need them, but honestly, most people below level 40-50ish aren't thinking about doing the event (or even ready, weapon wise). There might be a few low levels that jump in, but if you want to ensure a successful event, scan the map for some higher levels.
---
I didn't say it was "Immersion Breaking" I just said they are abominations of all things science.
---
Same as all those mutated creatures roaming the wastes.
---
I'm sure The Enclave can take care of them.
---
I was also going to comment that I don‚Äôt agree with your suggestion. But I was trying to close a deal before I said anything hahah 
---
Yeah, it's not even really necessary. Been looking into it when the game launched and of course that character is still level 20 something because of the melee and TSE/BE/AA metas. PA really doesn't require much healing. But I've been developing the character this weekend over the last few XP bonuses. I'm gonna have to get all that figured. 
---
My aim is a charisma luck agility build with sneak to stray away from the mobs and provide ranged healing support. I have a medic flamer which is funny because you can't build vats from blasting fuel at your teammates. But like I said I've got a pipe pistol and a 10mm, just trying to figure out the details. 
---
I find him all the time on the east side of the map. Fo from watoga and follow the yellow line.

Is it always site Alpha or from where the nuke launched? Also, does the player need to launch the nuke or anyone on the map?
---
I've seen this a lot with the ghouls at the golf course granted only get 1 star garbage from them. At least that's what happens to me 
---
That would be awesome. I wish we could have dogs as companions or at our camps to go with it. 
---
Diseased prefix overwrites the Legendary.  It was a Legendary enemy.
---
Happens often with Ghouls all over.
---
Check your settings, there's an opacity adjustment for hud
---
Happens a lot at Whitesprings for some reason.
---
Complete the questlines, clear areas you've previously discovered, but didnt  clear.   Aimlessly roam areas to discover new places.
---
From what I understand, you have to be min L50 to do what needs to be done to launch a nuke, so there's that....
---
He really needs to carry more than the 2 recipes and lemonade. Such a waste of a random event spawn.

With Vault 68 and 69 the experiments are flipped. In 68 are 1000 Men and 1 Woman and in 69 1000 Women and 1 Man, so it might be easier for Vault Tec. It's easier to say that 2002 People are going in that vault that and when entering, they seperate them due to some reason. I mean people would get suspious when they know that only women are going in that vault.   
---
Maybe Vault Tec didnt thought of that and didn't had time to transfer the men in an other vault and during that, the bombs hit, so either one or both vaults never got used, because of poor planing. 
---
Radshield should help a lot with the rads.
---
Ideally you have someone crippling the queen so that it doesn't hit the melee guys. I'm currently running shotgun/enforcer so it's easy for me. Sufficient explosives might also work (they certainly work on humans), but I haven't tested that.
---
Drops from legendary enemies or traded for with other players 
---
This may be an unpopular opinion however I like how these have been set up compared to other MMO's. 
---
I could go through the challenges and complete easy ones like 'take pics in or around this huge area' and get my atoms... then a couple months later it is updated to 'take photos at specific spots in this area' with the old atom challenge gone. I dont lose my atoms I earned from completing it before the update and now I can earn more atoms for doing basically the same thing. 
---
Some require running a new character, or going to places and using weapons I dont particularly enjoy. The game is saying 'get out of your comfort zone after this patch, try something new'. Some challenges are telling me to be more proactive instead of letting others clear my messes, I need to get the final shot not just tag and run. 
---
I enjoy the push to try more things, though I do also moan about having to use energy weapons or making trades with someone to get some hoppy hunter IPA.
---
They randomly drop from Legendary enemies
---
What's your luck at? Not base, but under stats tab? I find 3 star more often as I've upped my luck using unyielding armor. I've heard luck can affect your loot
---
I love woods, so it's the Forest for me, on the river.  
---
 I leave my camp open as respite for the lower levels. 
---
The occasional Diseased Ghoul at Camp Venture will be Legendary as well.  It's just that the Diseased hides the Legendary prefix.
---
It‚Äôd not mods if legendary weapons which from from legendary enemies they come in 1,2 &amp; 3* variants but it‚Äôs all randomly generated as to which you get. There are Sub Reddits made for trading mostly legendary items 
---
I literally spent hours trying to get marsupial and adrenal reaction without getting electrically charged or empath. It is almost impossible to do this through server hopping.
---
I'm just always out of acid ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è there's only so many Snallygasters.
---
From looting legendary enemies after you kill them. 
---
i thought white knight was getting the ol' nerf job soon tho?
---
There's always been stories that Camden Park is haunted because there's an Indian burial mound in the back of the park.  You were also about 10 minutes away from the Pumpkin house too (although there wouldn't be any pumpkins out right now.)
---
These are legendary effects. You get them from killing legendary enemies and being really lucky or killing a ton of them or, more honestly, a little bit of both.
---
Sound like you were in an area an L17 can go, but probably shouldn't.
---
Darn man. Maybe it‚Äôs getting more unstable. Last night I witnessed a new one too; the one star minigun that the ghoul dropped actually appeared as an item in the world beside his corpse. And then disappeared. In a few seconds I was able to find it again in the corpse loot. 
---
[PS4] I'm begining to think they want us to waste untold countless hours switching perk cards manually. 
---
Why does Bethesda hate us please love us and make this a reality.
---
it does. not much, but decent enough. the stats are of the jack of all trades curve. 
---
Didn't work for me either.
---
Weight is a good indication. That's about all I know of though. Otherwise it's a fashion show üòÇ
---
Why 
---
I don't think those items would become useless as I have a few lower end ones that still work perfectly fine. I still use a double barrel shotgun even though its only level 25. Because it has anti armor and explosive on it. I do see how raising the level limit on items can make them "worse" in some eyes but in reality there will be people to continue using them as just because they are a lower level does not mean they are suddenly bad. This is mainly because of how powerful some of the effects can actually be on weapons and armor.
---
Coming soon to an atomic shop near you
---
You have to launch it, I went in with a group they gave me a key card and I entered the code myself. It can be at any Silo but you can only pick up the Holo of Disappoint at Site Alpha. If you go there immediately after launch it may not appear yet, give it some time but go by there before the nuke zone clears for added protection of receiving it. I have not bothered testing how long it sticks around.
---
Apperently not. I could see that some items dissaperd right before i was able to take it. I hit most of them but was to slow to loot. Later I just spammed E to get everything but still other players where faster. Also there wasn't that much mobs. Also not many players where there. 5 including me at max. Probably dropped it to far south. 
---
I play with low hud,all stats hidden..And cant see my healt bar üòï that is why i ask
---
BoS aren't Raiders. We don't massacre and put people's heads on pikes. We appropriate advanced weaponry and resources and we defeat threats to the wasteland at large. 
---
I'm also super helpful, so. I help people more than I hurt taking over workshops. I also fully set up workshops and power up Poseidon, Monongha, and Thunder Mountain. So when I'm done, the next person just has to show up.
---
Um that's why u carry a very small amount on SURVIVAL mode. 
---
I've killed people and gotten all sorts of aid items off one characte. 100's of stimpacks,  radaway, a marsupial serum  other things.
---
I surely dont notice it in adventure mode lately, nor do i really care. But i played a lot of survival mode over the weekend for the double xp. Although most were fair fights, there were some where the other player simply took no damage. Could be they are just lucky and have legitimately found the best gear in the game. But it seems more likely to me that there are a good number of players who are still running full sets of duped items. 
---
It wont keep me from playing. Im still having fun. üòÄ
---
yeah, did you read the last part?  I agree a 3 star should drop a 3 star, the analogy was to point out how a 3 slot egg container can't hold 6 eggs, so the OP, and other's that have had a similar idea, don't make sense...
---
Minimun for healt bar
---
I mostly found it comical, maybe the wendingo visited my camp and thought it was dirty so gave me some cleaner for it
---
I bet it‚Äôs a really good cleaner.
---
The bag is not always in the exact spot of death, and sometimes the marker doesnt appear either, especailly if you die again before recovering the original.  Additionally, if you pick up more junk, then die before recovering the first bag, the first one is gone and is replaced by the new junk you picked up.
---
.
---
One time I was killed standing in the middle of the road, but the bag reappeared inside the adjacent building.  
---
Another, the bag moved into the high grass nearby.
---
Or... I died at the top of a cliff, but the bag was at the bottom.
---
Grid search is time consuming, but it's helped me find a "lost" bag or two.
---
Sanjay here, I‚Äôve got an anti-charisma bobble head up my ass!
---
I go to Whitesprings and the clubhouse when I see no other person on the map (granted someone crouching around won't show), but if you aren't trying to get in there to shoot them, I'm going to melee the heck out of them because I'm already taking rad damage because they are hitting me on top of the nuke radiation. As well as getting diseases from them (most likely).
---
If I see other players in the clubhouse, I try to get out of the way so we can all tag them--especially the legendaries. I will literally run around with them chasing me towards other players so they can get a hit. But recently, it looks like if you want things like hardened or glowing mass, you need to be the first to grab it from the body. Maybe it has always been that way.
---
Maybe team up with the melee player and say, "Hey, go in there and get them excited, hit them weakly and bring them out here for me to finish."
---
In essence, I don't think there is a way in this type of event to make the different player types/approachs play nicely together.
---
Care to put an X on map?
---
I'm getting ready to do the launch in a week or so.

I wonder if she bugged and got stuck on the edge of the map and this was her... unbugging.
---
Lol 
---
I randomly got a 3* from some low level something. It must have been a 1* enemy but I don‚Äôt remember fighting any. I didn‚Äôt even notice that I got something because nothing popped up on the screen and I found it going through my weapons. 
---
This is quite annoying in general but one work around that I've found is to equip the pacify perks. As when you aim at a enemy you get a decently small box to work as a cross hair. It sucks to have to use perks to be able to aim more effectively especially when they aren't meant to be used in that way, but I do hope this helps.
---
That‚Äôs a ballistic weapon 
---
Is there a way to *know* if she's crippled? I have enforcer, and I have the heavy gun perk that has a chance at crippling, but I have no idea if it *worked*
---
Lol, took me a good 30 seconds.
---
It exists, if you go to the r/fo76market there's someone selling it on XB1. I would love it. I'm rocking the Longshoreman out for rn thiugh, hardly anyone has or uses it.
---
Honestly, the lore is pretty fire. You just have to find it.
---
I‚Äôve won three out of the four I‚Äôve found, I thought it was just a better chance to get one
---
Aren‚Äôt there enemies that spawn there?
---
For no reason lol. they don‚Äôt drop any more, and are legacy weapons. That‚Äôs a pretty solid reason to jack up the price. 
---
Probably a mothman esque fight where he has interesting mechanics but we're way to powerful and so blow him away immediately with no challenge whatsoever
---
But you even said you didn‚Äôt wait, you tried to beat him to the clubhouse even though a melee power armor build is going to move far faster than a sneaky sniper build. 
---
You‚Äôd have been better off waiting a few minutes until power armor dude moved on the the clubhouse and then you could have hit the bungalows. 
---
Of course my name fits, I picked it crybaby.

Raising my hand in firm, 100% solidarity with [this comment from a fellow lurker](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b9pxk6/repair_kits_megathread_mod_statement/ek73wal?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). The fact that the Atoms are for strictly cosmetic things is the only reason I tolerate the system's existence.
---
I'm the only one of my circle playing Fallout 76. In that circle, there are five other people who had played 3, New Vegas, and 4; there is one other person who has only played 4, but I am 100% positive would play 76 if at least one or two of the others started playing it first.
---
Making the Atoms strictly for cosmetics is the **ONLY** step forward. If you change it, I'll stop playing. If you change it BACK to cosmetics-only and admit your mistake, I'll go back to playing. I'd be happy to reward you for admitting that you made a mistake and undoing a bad decision.
---
But maybe let's save some time and just *not even get to that point*.
---
When your food and or water meters are depleted you will take damage
---
If you're on PS4 I know a couple people who sell the serums for 400 caps a piece. PSN name is the same as on here.
---
I thought there was glitch/issue with the beam splitter, giving 5x the damage  per shot and that was part of the reason?
---
When the game was announced at E3 Todd described it as a "softcore wilderness survival game" so yeah, things like gear degradation and needing to eat are going to be a part of it.
---
And it will be even more fun if they move most of the PVP to this mode and off adventure.  
---
Before that happens, can the white springs mirrors get a brick wall fix?
---
They embed themselves into brick walls, on both sides, and are currently unusable. At nearly 1000 caps, I expect them to work.
---
Bethesda, please let us grow ballistic fiber trees in our camps!
---
I claimed a cabin as well. I wish I could remove already placed things, or at least use them. Why the bed is not a useable one is baffling, when any scrap of cloth on the ground can be slept on.
---
uhhhh.
---
Wut?
---
Just do what I did for the one workshop challenge.
---
Use all of the resources available to cover the workshop bench and it's entire surrounding area with punji boards.
---
Surprising how much damage those things do just standing on half a million of them.
---
^Also ^for ^anyone ^who ^has ^gotten ^a ^workshop ^on ^ps4 ^absolutely ^covered ^in ^more ^punji ^then ^floor, ^I ^apologize.
---
&gt;but my perfect brick walls are plastered with the worst interior color; dirty stucco
---
put em on backwards. Looks great from the inside.
---
especially because I would like to actually play some of the holotape games i have found and not lose food/water and risk getting killed.
---
I'm going for High agility/Luck Commando, and using my [This gun](https://imgur.com/a/1pYlb2u). So far I can manage to fit in around 4-5 crits with Full AP, but still working on my armor set and moving some perks around. Should be good for when group content rolls around like the underground stuff/Vaults.
---
I don't see this as a big deal or Pay2Win either. Only in early game is repairing challenging due to the ballistic weave, and usually its as easy as just crafting an identical version of the item and scrapping the old one. Once we get to 40+, if we play normally, we should have more than enough resources to repair. Hell, on some of my characters, i don't even loot anymore b/c the repair costs are trivial.  
---
There's a good chance it will later become a traditional fallout rpg. It's in the teaser for the Wastelanders preview.

They will still only he safe as long as you are not flagged hostile towards the opposition
---
Are the red stars on houses commie red stars?  Seems a pretty blatant symbol considering the pre-war environment.  Seems I saw a few on farms.
---
Non explosive have been super high as well, 50K+.  I thought the reason was a glitch with the beam splitter mod giving greater than intended damage, ie the 5 beams each give full damage individually, that is why I was asking.  It is not centered on just the explosive part of it.
---
Would have been great if they hadn't accelerated food spoilage rates to a ludicrous lvl. I went out there did the event got 5 stew ate one and before the effect was gone the rest was spoiled... So pretty pointless now could be a nice way to get feet fory crops though 
---
What is a building set/piece **you** would like to see?  
---
We keep throwing out all of our ideas but what is something you personally would like?
---
Check setting in your firewall like Internet Security software. Turn it off for a few minutes while you enter the terminal &amp; see how it goes.
---
Yes. They could be easily removed. But maybe Whitespring would be better because of that
---
There are plenty of NPCs. They are either ghouls or infected by the scorched virus. That's literally the current lore. As the game evolves I think they plan to have another "instanced" story line, and I imagine it will be after the SBQ has been defeated and we really start to rebuild.
---
Thanks for this today‚Äôs challenge with viv involved old possum and I needed some aster all you guys got karma :) pharma
---
Well to be fair you were at whitesprings so- it seems like you enjoy wasting your time looking for trash.
---
Super cool! I'm from England originally as well so I hadn't seen a whole bunch of the US so this was really cool. We also recently went to Washington D.C. and took pictures with the FO3 locations!! 
---
I love the gauss on paper, but in reality it's a very bugged gun. Often with fast paced gameplay where you're in and out of vats a lot, the rifle "charge up animation sound" hangs, and i can't run with it. I have to holster it and take it out again to fix this. 
---
They did fix the reload bug on the lever, so I hope they will fix the gauss soon, although it's much bigger problems.
---
I feel your pain.  Im sure the thread will be full of coping strategies.  Real issue is we need adventure to be truly focused on coop, pve play.  I'd even be ok if they ramped up the random NPC patrols on adventure to compensate.
---
I‚Äôm half hoping for it to be in a controlled environment so for example you don‚Äôt have your armour only your weapons or something.
---
hello sir, thank you very much for your detailed answer!

Bloody/unyielding are the end game builds that no other building type can match dmg wise. Includes pve and pvp 
---
I gave up on the idea of melee a while ago. It's nice DPS, but she spends half the fight in the air and bugs out there sometimes. I run a bloodied heavy weapons build in PA with emergency protocols. My fights SBQ fights rarely go over 5 minutes and are usually far less if she lands early and I get decent extra mob spawns (Adrenaline is amazing). Ultracite .50 Cal makes short work of her.
---
I would be ok with 3 *‚Äôs dropping 2 * and 3* loot, but it‚Äôs really wack that they most often drop 1* trash that‚Äôs best dropped or sold to a vendor
---
Weight and armor rating are the two ways without putting it on, but putting it on is 100% effective at telling you what type it is
---
Ooooo that's fun!! I'll have to head back there to see the pumpkin house for sure :) 
---
No denial it is a lot of work! I just think it would be a good investment in light of their apparent Atom shop strategy...more components = more variety = more sales/engagement/whateveryourmetric.
---
It's also easier to keep consistent updates rolling in when you're committing to some smaller releases to keep the shop showcasing "NEW" content, which in turn keeps people logging in...for instance it is easier to update daily or weekly with consistency if every other week you drop a big release like a new full outfit bundle (in the vein of what they release now as full outfits) and can also update with new small items (essentially how they sell hats...but they should probably sell more than just hats, especially considering they erase a lot of hairstyles down to "bald" :I ). I fell out of checking into the game for over a month because of the lack of new content tbh...why log in and grind the 40-50 atoms I can snag when I don't even see something I want to buy with them, when I don't need to see what new thing they've added (Fortnite's shop does a great job of driving daily check-ins for example).
---
Aesthetics is the end game for a sizeable % of players in a lot of persistent online games, they clearly realize that with how they've structured the shop, with both skins/paint/outfits and CAMP items. Expanding the number of slots they can target makes character customization more compelling/engaging for players, allows for more price points in the shop, and ultimately overhauling the system sooner than later would limit the amount of revision to old product they'd need to do...as is there isn't even THAT much variety to the outfits in-game. :(
---
Gatling guns are stupid accurate at long distances with VATS. Even if not, they don't spread really bad, so once you get used to where the bullets fly while firing it becomes almost second nature. 
---
I know I've got a bunch of 5mm - I pick it all up, but never use it. I'm happy to trade / sell it - I regularly use .45 &amp; 5.56 if you've got any available.
---
It's been said the beam spliter mod is broken so the gun does 5x the damage.  It's like if each shotgun pellet gave full damage in itself.
---
The base damage resistances. There are plenty of spreadsheets on here or Google that go through them. Some complete and some aren't. Let me go grab a pretty decent one....

It's pretty obvious when the queen's fully crippled, because she doesn't do anything. With the back legs crippled, she doesn't move. With the front legs crippled, she doesn't do the melee attacks. With the head crippled she doesn't do the sonic attack. With the wings crippled, she won't take off, or at least not as quickly.
---
What's difficult is figuring out whether you're personally doing anything useful, but then that's standard for queen fights. Enforcer seems so reliable that you can put a couple of blasts into each leg and it will work. One Gun Army may take longer.
---
I built an almost identical "Guest Facilities" shed like you describe, (even have a clean bed) on the approach path to my camp, unlocked my water purifiers and I have only had 2 "griefers" in the past couple of weeks.  My main compound is locked up tighter than a nuns knees. They started at the Guest shack and only got a few items before I was able to get there and run them off.  My reasoning was that they would start wrecking the easiest stuff first and it seems I have been correct so far. To address OP's vent,  I have just resigned myself to dealing with this type player and their play style by just accepting it.  They are here to stay until Beth extends no damage pacifist mode to camps.  Everyone knows this, but it is harder for lower level or new players to deal with, so I say there is nothing wrong with venting about it here either.  I think the overwhelming number of responses will be supportive at the very least, and downright vigilante at the most.

Instead of having it on all the time, why not add a target dummy for your camp that you can shoot to see damage numbers, it could even have equipment slots so you could test the effects against enemies with armor, allowing decent theory crafting.

So will an Explosive handmade, and it will do it a hell of a lot faster than any laser rifle. That‚Äôs where the DPS comes in, damage mitigation is completely ignored with critical hits, no matter what weapon you are using, you can melt through Sentinel/Cavalier Armor with a non legendary pipe pistol if you land a critical lol.

No, but now I want red and gold power armor paints.

If that is the case its perhaps because I am only able to be on 2 or tops 3 hours every other day or so. Mainly due to real life items. I assume you play much longer?
---
God yes I want this! My brick house looks odd in the woods.
---
It is tough! I used basicallly alllll my ammo. 
---
The assaultrons never stop lol 
---
Added! 
---
Oh, right, yes. Plenty of NPCs to shoot but I wish there were more quest-giver NPCS I mean.
---
Ps4 unfortunately but thank you. Have they said whether the game will get additional locations or DLC?
---
Luck doesn't affect loot other than durability and condition, according to everything I've read, and the info in-game.
---
I would like a bar with configurable taps.   As a vending machine.
---
&gt;at a very high cost for no reason,mainly because the explosive effect isn't available anymore, but it doesn't mean the guns were good
---
I had that written already. If people want a piece of history, then that's their decision to pay the high prices, but it doesn't make the guns anymore useful, due to the glitched effects.. 
---
\*\*\* The OP said that people were calling these guns good, but they are weak. According to a bunch of people on here, the explosive effect doesn't work properly on it with perk cards either. They are for collectors, and that's it.
---
 It's funny because people were literally selling these Laser Rifles and TSE Teslas for less than 1k a couple weeks ago (after the patch that removed explosives from the loot table), then out of the blue, I started to see extremely high price tags all in one day pop up. That's just how the games economy works when CAPS have no value. Luckily I got mine for cheap cheap.
---
Yeah this will be my first launch coming up
---
Well I did watch your broadcast. Loved it missed my shout out though....
---
If y'all need more questions feel free to hit me up.
---
How about making it level appropriate?  I‚Äôm level 45 and just dropped a level 15 3* scorpion which dropped a level 5 1* bloodied 44 revolver.  IMO that gun should be level 15 not level 5.  
---
Nope, any session at the most would be 3 hours max. Just now actually, I logged on, and as soon as it showed the world it crashed to desktop. Not a disconnect but just shows length of play doesn‚Äôt matter much.
---
I only do pvp in PVE mode when 4 things happen 1 they are firing at me for no reason and non stop 2 they stole my junk when I died in a sbq fight 3 they spend 20 min  at a vendor that I need 4 they are wanted for fucking up one of my friends bases or min
---
Exactly, after 500+ hours of playing, I will fully repair my weapon to 200% at the start, then I only have to repair armor like every other session.
---
I‚Äôm now making a Vault Dweller Jack character. Bethesda please add katana and those little wooden shoes
---
well, there's is nothing left to say other than that you might be right , lol
---
That's why you would have an option to only allow the things you select as I mentioned before.
---
Tomorrows update I believe 
---
Wow. Guess i have just been lucky so far. 
---
It adds a star, I've modded four or five guns with it and it has always added the star. Not sure what's going on with your handmade though.
---
E X T R A T H I C C
---
In the vending machine I think?  Not really sure as it's been a while since I was there.
---
I‚Äôll be on in about three hours
---
I got one too about a month ago.
---
They sure have. Check out the inside the vaults and the road map on Bethesda.net they show upcoming updates including dlc. There‚Äôs new quests coming on Tuesday I believe 
---
Technical data also Drops them
---
Closest right now would probably be the order of mysteries' sword and a bathrobe lol
---
Yeah, it would be cool til you turn your pip boy on and its pretty much nothing but perverts and racist manifestos playing 24/7
---
It seems they are trying to push the Whitesprings in this direction by centralizing a vendor from each faction in this spot, and also combining all the caps pools into one large one. The Whitesprings should turn into a one stop shop for players of all levels at this point. 
---
All they need to do after that would be to
---
A) Introduce a ‚Äúno kill zone‚Äù on the Interior, though with the split between survival and adventure and the other changes coming to adventure this may not be needed. 
---
B) Rearrange a room, perhaps the unused ballroom upstairs, to host  terminals directly connected to each players C.A.M.P. vendor when the feature releases. Just have it so when you log in to a server your camp automatically links to an unused terminal, or just have a home screen where you can select inventories by player name.
---
And of course 
---
C.) Have a rotational trading post where the traveling vendors have a chance to spawn and offload their wares assuming they are not present anywhere else. Maybe in the Foyer just before the shop. 
---
All in a the Whitesprings is largely unused space and has a lot of room to house a large trading post and player hangout. The inside, despite its √ºber clean nature is incredibly bland as well, leaving plenty of room for expanding on what‚Äôs already there. 
---
It would be far more likely that I could make a log cabin or a mud and daub hut or even a drystone hut than a barn.
---
There is a report button. 
---
&gt;It‚Äôs not called a raid because I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to be like a raid in other games. Fallout can‚Äôt handle the kind of stuff like a Destiny raid would require, like different people going to different spots to activate this special thing that allows you to da
---
Im expecting some sort of matchmaking system like strongholds in Anthem.
---
Whitesprings. If people stop nuking it. Maybe they need to make it a non-nuke zone to be the hub people wanted for so long.
---
You sure. 
---
You might be right. 
---
But I would assume energy Ammo equals energy weapons. 
---
Mire for life. I live in a cozy treehouse against the cliffside north of valley galleria. It's perfect for me, other than the relentless tick invasion. Bless missle turrets. 
---
No. Tomorrow, April 9th. Servers will probably go down between 10a and 11a EST and be down for 2-3+ hours.
---
Pretty sure he is trying to say when he had a stroke that berry mentats just make them glow purple and not targetable in vats and vats has a limited range of about 50 meters so less than half of most render ranges 
---
Yeah I think this would be good, you never know someone might have the item you want when they visit your vending machine. Would be nice if we could put things we want to buy and for how much too 
---
LMFAO!!!
---
*Take some vitamin M, you pansy!*
---
I had around 3k caps yesterday, today I have maybe 500... wish I had a "too much caps problem" üòÖ
---
I didn‚Äôt know you could claim buildings in this game. I never tried though. I always just assumed it was a no. But monsters breaking things would be a downside I guess. But I do find a lot of ‚Äúoff the beaten path‚Äù places and I‚Äôd love to set up camp there but never knew I could. BUT-
---
Not being able to use any of the stuff in the cabin? That seems rather pointless. I don‚Äôt understand that at all. You should be able to use the bed that‚Äôs there as if it isn‚Äôt claimed you can use the bed? 
---
Awesome thank you. Been getting back into the game for this update. I could have swore juice head said it‚Äôd be out Monday. 
---
This I did not know.  I shall be unlocking all mine then. 
---
but I didn't fast travel there to a friend to disocver it. I literally walked on foot to discover it and can fast travel now after the fact. and nothing was discovered from beta since I started over entirely after beta...
---
It was like that for me for the first 2 weeks of play. Then the fashcnat parade stuff came and that was it. 
---
Thats my cranky grandmother build, silly.
---
I just brought my first srum last week. All it cost me was 50 nuclear waste.
---
I don't know if this mega thread is going to get enough attention with only 600 something thumbs up.
---
Grape will remove rads w/o removing mutations, solid stuff 
---
Anything that gives us the opportunity to give cool stuff to everyone on the map sounds excellent to me. 
---
The darkness is my favorite part of the mire, it looks really looks creepy, great for building spooky camps 
---
It usually isn't worth my time to explain something to jerks and idiots, but you seem to genuinely not know how the spawns work.
---
If you go through Whitesprings after it is nuked, you get ONE PASS which will spawn ghouls for you. After that, your presence doesn't cause any more spawns. So if you enter once first, trigger the spawns, and then someone else kills all the ghouls, YOU can't trigger any more, but the person who ran in after you triggered the area CAN leave, re-enter the area, and trigger their own one-time spawn, thereby getting way more than their fair share of ghoul spawns. That's why it is bad form to run up on people after they have spawned an area. Just wait a few minutes until they move on, then you get YOUR entire ghoul spawn in peace as well. This is why people hang around in nuke zones after everything is dead: They are waiting for a new player to enter, trigger more spawns, and steal them. Which is why I watch the map in an attempt to find the place clear before entering, and to not end up taking someone else's one time spawn. So yes, I tried to beat him to the club house so he wouldn't get there right after I did, take my one-time spawn, and fuck me over. If he had only waited 3 minutes, we would have BOTH had a full spawn and not been competing. 
---
If you know this and do it anyway, you are a jerk, and you can go fuck yourself. And if I can find a way to fuck you over for doing it, or stop you, I will.
---
And I know that whatever I say, if you are someone who does this you are going to downvote me and keep it up, because assholes have to be physically stopped before they will give up something that is advantageous to them, even if they know it is bad for the game, or harming society in real life. Which is why we have things like an army and police force to take care of society's assholes so it runs well enough to function at a high level. 
---
So if I can make people aware, find a counter-measure, or maybe the devs notice and put in a mechanic to fuck the assholes, I'm going to do it. And by your reaction I'm almost certain you are someone who does this. You are aware that it discourages people from bothering to launch nukes, and you are somewhat shooting yourself in the foot with your assholishness, right???
---
I love this idea. 
---
Currently though, I have a PS Vita in my desk at work for this exact thing.  Remote into my PS4 at home over wifi, log in, do trades all day :)
---
"Hello, I'm Op. I cheesed 3 billion golf outfits and cap stashes and now My money is worthless so pleaseeeeeeee change the game to accommodate me!!!!!"
---
Meanwhile I've found maybe one damn revolver way back in my early leveling that wasn't worth keeping when I hit higher levels. Kind of hate you just a pinch right now. Been wanting a Quad Western revolver.
---
Silenced Gauss will handily take everything down in a few shots if the sneak attack multiplier doesn't poop out.
---
I‚Äôm usually really good at remembering my weapon artisan but today I forgot and only fixed my instigating fire axe to 100% instead of 200%....... the air was blue lol üòÇ I could definitely use that max QOL build lol
---
I can't remember specifically where at McClintock.. But I know they always spawn at Sugar Grove in the locker room.
---
sweet mother of ATOM.  MMPR/Voltron suit is getting closer to reality
---
None of that is initiating aggresion imo 
---
It's been mentioned quite a bit bit, just the nature of the sub other issues arise &amp; push topics off radar.
---
For awhile I was leaving one chassis with standard paint &amp; another with Atom Shop paint, puts up the little symbol next to the name. Only useful for two sets however, and I immediately nullified it with the Excavator paint, so it's not much of a work around. 
---
Yeah, sucks you have to carry something just to counter rudeness, but I guess molotovs it is from now on.
---
I keep getting drills this weekend from killing 3\* enemies. Turns out better luck at whitespring train station, I purchased a 2 star troubleshooter hand made with explosive round from the vendor bot, so finally an explosive handmade.
---
Just put the wheelbarrow, the brahim will appear.
---
I see what you mean, though I guess it'd have to let you set the price you buy the items at as well. Unless it goes off of the prices items are vendored for.
---
If i see anyone near me i will try to only tag enemies so others can get a hit in as well, to share the love
---
Were you in a low lvl zone?
---
Always Vigilant is the one that bugs the hell out of me. I don't mind the others - it's just a quick "hey, here's the quest, go do it" intro, but with Always Vigilant, he never shuts up and is a whiny bitch the whole time.
---
Also it better be a quality flag like the one in the Enclave bunker, not that weathered and damaged one you build in the camp
---
Is this a complete list? I'm on the lookout for 
---
shadow chest combat armour 
---
and 
---
shadow arms leather
---
It's under your resource tab on the building menu.
---
Love this idea 
---
Did I?, well that was a mistake then,so sorry.
---
Did You buy me more?
---
That's what I was thinking. Also I enjoy collecting junk and using it to build stuff where I could sell for those who need it.
---
I'm sure they will give us the option to put a price tag on it. That way I can lower the price and sell more stuff.
---
Lower prices mean more stuff sold and higher prices make it harder to sell.
---
Im running a silenced Gauss &amp; Brotherhood rifle. Sneak attacks still deal a ton of damage per bullet
---
Actually, they weren‚Äôt. The Excavator Armor program never made it past its initial test. After the Hornwright autominers beat the Excavator suit in the Garrahan v. Hornwright challenge, Garrahan was forced to shut down the project and sell all of the existing suits to Hornwright for pennies on the dollar just to stay afloat. The only reason there is Excavator armor in Appalachia is because we downloaded the schematics from Garrahan‚Äôs R&amp;D department and built our own suits.
---
Thanks for letting me know! Gods suggestion however I do f have any paints. Hopefully Bethesda will do something about it soon.
---
i sneak my whole way through and never get hit by one enemy, until someone in power armor comes clunking by aggroing all the enemies
---
Especially considering 90% of the 3* stuff is junk anyway
---
Liberty Prime would like to know your location.
---
Hopefully it's based on what you put. I want to put items at 50% or lower so I can sell more stock. Kinda like Walmart.
---
This will make other players come often.
---
Glad we could help.  
---
Disclaimer - combat viability may decrease severely using the QoL build.
---
Most people will. And then there are the other kind of "special" persons...
---
I'll look on my alt
---
All Red Rockets and Train Stations have benches and a stash box
---
Nuka Dark stacks with both party boy/girl and Cola nut, making it a really powerful alcohol.
---
Haha, yeah, those junkie's lead pipes...Gotta collect them all! lol
---
After the war...apologies for past tense.
---
Thanks for the suggestion, I'll take a look at it, when I have time.
---
I believe I've finished every main and side quest in the game. Any recommendations for end game activities besides the usual (nukes, events, grinding for rare gear, working on camp/workshops)?
---
Bloodied Prime .50 Cal with a fully min/maxed bloodied build. Hits 650+ damage per shot without Revenant. With Revenant it gets crazy. 650 damage at 9.1 shots per second is quite good.
---
Lol üòÇ
---
Yes I get different varieties of Nuka Cola there from time to time.  Also for you young ghoul slayers, especially when th rad count is high, visit the pavilion and drink from the water fountain, you will be cured of disease and get a small heal.  Sadly the water you can gather from that fountain does not retain those properties.
---
Do robots attack an aggressive to others player? For some players that might not matter, but could end up being a deterrent in large enough groups...
---
One preorder option for FO4 came with a Bobblehead inside the Vault-Tec lunchbox, so some players, not me of course, but some, actually got to test this out.
---
I know everyone is disagreeing with you but I kinda agree, once you hit a certain point in this game it‚Äôs ridiculously easy to earn caps and there‚Äôs nothing at all to spend on in game, and all the best items are only up for trade.
---
Although this would be a bit regressive for people with few caps, so maybe they could make it so 1* legendary = 1 token, or 2 tokens if you spend 500 caps, then everyone wins?
---
IMO this should require a minimum INT and having maxed out a relevant perk card eg requiring a maxed version of ‚Äúfix it good‚Äù plus ‚Äúarmorsmith‚Äù to make legendary armor.  Make it so that you aren‚Äôt decked out in the current BiS gear before lvl 50.
---
Hillbilly Hotdogs (Hillfolk Hotdogs) is also pretty close by as well! It‚Äôs a sight to see regardless of its connection to the game. I will say as a native of Huntington, I was super disappointed the city wasn‚Äôt more prominently featured in the game.
---
Yea, I mean... given that "all of the people" are dead except players...
---
The game itself has been decent - some bugs, nothing major.
---
Bethesda made some PR mistakes, but their biggest ongoing mistake is cowtowing to player demands.  Change too many aspects of the game, and it no longer resembles what drew players in.
---
I have all the upgrades. I dont know if I have all the under armor plans right off. There's 4 or 5 if I recall and I have at least 3.
---
I‚Äôve gotten two from that machine. Wonder if it has an accidentally higher rate.
---
That's pretty awesome I've been thinking about buying one. The only thing that has stopped me is the proprietary memory cards. Which I think stopped a lot of people from buying one. If they used Micro SD cards the Vita would be still selling strong.
---
nice!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Not a bad idea. Maybe the lego vendor is not the place for a cap sink, we do need one
---
You have an ultracite customer here! When is business hours?
---
One of the most condescending ways to say you‚Äôre gonna play the game, but‚Ä¶ welcome. You‚Äôll find most of the things people have said about the game to be over-exaggerated. 
---
Like I went back to the very first Overseer camp to store some stuff cause I didnt know if stash boxes werent linked and stuff. S
---
So I can just put stuff in benches and boxes?
---
Minor inconvenience for hardcore players, major one for casuals. Agreed that you should work for it, but I'd be putting the requirements to work and not the stats.
---
No. for some reason the bed is unusable, camp or not. I run across this sometimes in the world. Sometimes it has corpses on it, so it makes some sense. Other times it looks fine, but is just not clickable.
---
The cabin has a cooking spit outside, and radio inside as well as several containers that are handy for food and med spawns. As well as transferring stuff to friends(instead of dropping a bag on the ground)
---
Staggered?
---
It's a fertilizer extractor in the resource tab. Costs like 10-12% of your camp budget each though.
---
Ah.  Ok.  Why does it run away when I try to milk it?
---
Loading screen in the beginning of the video was so long I stopped watching it.
---
Improve that next time please.
---
I've heard there's an exploit that boosts the damage. I have no proof but watching videos of players getting one shot killed by a Tesla rifle when they're in PA...something stinks.
---
I‚Äôm curious if you have had a friend paint your power armor one of the other paints say officer or paladin and all you have is the initiate paint learned can that mess with the drop rate of the other paint plans I‚Äôve been farming for them since they were put in but haven‚Äôt gotten a single one
---
do you have the plague mutation?
---
&gt; a missed opportunity for Bethesda
---
This could basically be the title of the game. And that's coming from someone who loves it.
---
How much for the toilet &amp; welcome mats?
---
It‚Äôs usually best to prevent the incident from occurring.
---
I verified the files, and it said the game was completely fine.
---
well that is why you are hurting it
---
The Stash Boxes are linked, so you have access to anything you put in at any stash box you find. The benches are for breaking down your junk into lighter components.
---
Maybe, it just seems odd how my health will start to steadily drop, it looks like healing factor in reverse. 
---
I‚Äôm sure before when staggered I took a hit directly losing health. I also have pneumatic chest mod which reduces the magnitude of staggers, so maybe I am staggering but it‚Äôs so small I don‚Äôt notice it anymore.
---
They do take some time to start playing music just make sure light is on should start eventually
---
Jesus
---
We really do, the lack of ingame value for caps is effecting the trading markets badly
---
Build the apalachia radio then turn it on(the light will glow), then hang out a while or fast travel to a station somewhere and mess around a few minutes. Sometimes the radios have a delay to working. Usually after a few minutes my radio will start playing music.
---
What a Great place to put a Text chat!
---
it has its own keyboard, doesn't interrupt the main screen during action, and everyone has one, this is a good idea!
---
Every train station has a stash box as does each red rocket or you can access your stash at other peoples camps you may find. Its safe they cant steal your stuff. Just make sure its a my stash box, the overseer ones look similiar but everyone can access those outside of her camp though it shouldnt be an issue.
---
Sorry, I got zero data on that. Everything is pointing to RNG, for sure paint is dropping less if you are also dropping Under Armour plans (which makes sense as there more types of loot to drop, annoying, but makes sense)
---
I see what you did there.
---
When I load the game, sometimes a message says that they will not always like you to milk them
---
I'm still confused as to how many T60 paints there are total.  I have BOS I, II, and IV.  Those are the designations in crafting stations not the ranks. Does a III even exist?  Or did is it giving them to me out of order?
---

If your PC, I'll give you 10k for one of those plans, it'll complete my collection.
---
I can't say how the robots react when players start to attack each other, because I've never been around robots when that happened. Otherwise, the robots seemed to act exactly the same as they did in adventure mode; they attack hostile mobs in their area, and if you clip them, they'll become hostile.
---
Right. I'm PC as well. 
---
Did you have to wait for the entire progress bar to fill by slowly ticking up? If so, yikes. I wonder how long that takes.
---
Ooo good question, following to see if anyone knows

Add that robot work bench from fallout 4

Add fisto from new Vegas

How do I put this gently...

Juice is an idiot.

[Here](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019) is the roadmap. Note that Player vending has been moved to begining of May rather than tomorrow due to technical difficulties. We will still receive shear terror and some other things tomorrow however.
---
ohh,,, a cloaking lv91 assultatron would be so nice :D lol
---
Hmm it is annoying I wish they would put in something that made the drop rates of items not already gotten a little higher then for things already obtained or take a majority of the useless basic loot out of the faction events and quests kinda dumb when you turn in 20+ technical data and get 10+ army fatigues or bomber jackets
---
I love the American flag and have it plastered all over my camp, but I would like to see the other faction flags as well either as plans, or in the AS
---
Not sure why but I seem to see some nice 1 to 3 \* weapons from Whitespring, enclave and watanga vendor bots about every 6th visit picked up a 2 shot combat sniper rifle and a bloodied 50 cal now I'm walking around overweight lol
---
I just want to say, that after a million Whitespring runs, I've never gotten good weapons or armor there. All my best stuff came from WestTek, RobCo Research and Fort Definance.
---
I only nuke Whitespring for the flux and the XP these days.
---
Personally I alway try to get everyone in on the hits. If I come across a legendary (even 1*) I will hit it and then coax it out to an open spot while using the "follow me" emoji. 99% of people seem to understand the priniciple of letting everyone get a hit in. I've cleared the golf club with a group of 10 and we all got to hit almost everything.
---
Maybe try mentioning teamwork over the area chat or something?
---
300 total
---
The ability to name objects is something that should arrive in tomorrow's update.
---
Forgot the first part of my reply: you can drop your camp near any un-named structure if it is not too close to a named area. Several cabins, caves, and raider camps fit this bill. Someone made a map to help find such things. 
---
https://i.redd.it/iap7tl2yqip21.jpg

The bulkhead doors are still sealed though
---
Devs said that when you power up a Player Vendor Terminal, your CAMP will become visible on the map.
---
I would love a Travel trailer build set as well. Like so many places and people just live in those silver trailers. I would love to just place my own and then decorate the inside. Then make a cute yard and what not around it.
---
If Fallout is your kind of game, you'll have things to do.  Rebuilding your base can keep you going if you're at all creative, and there's always more gear.  
---
But the main thing that draws me to things like this are just plain exploring.  There are thousands of little nods and interesting non-stories told in the form of scenes all over the map, and sometimes you can spend hours at a location and not know that there is a story just a few yards away.
---
One person started documenting some of these [in this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b02w9i/i_made_a_unmarked_location_map/), but honestly there are really *way* too many to include in one map like that.
---
Great thanks for letting me know, I haven‚Äôt been that up to date with reading the patch notes. Thanks
---
Have at it! There‚Äôs so many camp items you can make appear to float

Tell me about it  :/

Oh where you replace the damaged ones? I‚Äôve found it‚Äôs best just to take them out and replace them one by one or it stops working

I've started to go into 3rd person mode with my big guns because you get a dot when you aim.

The Bethesda specialize in keeping silent, wait until tomorrow.
---
Thanks! Unfortunately I‚Äôm on PS4

No reapomd yet, as far as I know.
---
Lol that's awesome :D
---
Hah, ALLL the downvotes from the people that do this. Bunch of cockroaches don't like when you turn the lights on them. :)
---
That‚Äôs how mine would look if I didn‚Äôt drop all of them after the first one lol
---
Shit, that or just outright choosing which server to join.
---
Unyielding armor would make those even higher, and make the other stats useful.
---
Your post history is confusing then. Seems like you're hooked bro.
---
I actually went out of my way to do this when a lot of lower levels were on the same world. It was nice to be able to do something that helped everyone.
---
I used to start up powerplants for the same reason but realized most people don‚Äôt bother with the junction boxes since they didn‚Äôt always work until a couple patches ago.
---
I‚Äôd love to see a whole series of missions that had map wide benefits.
---
Wow.   Thats not right.
---
But yes, I agree. A rejoin last server is something every server based game needs tbh.
---
I lol'd
---
IMO you need areas that are safe for noobs.  When I was low level I had to server hop way too often because a lvl 100+ came into the area and suddenly the mobs tripled their levels.
---
Watoga today 3 legendary's dropped wooden armor.
---
Unf. That chrome armor is looking sexy as fuck
---
lol is juice not as reliable as I think he is? I guess he‚Äôs the only YouTuber that the algorithm puts in front of me who gives updates on the game. I swear he kept saying Monday but I could have remembered it wrong.
---
why did you shoot him back to enable him to actually hurt you?
---
Even though it wouldn't be with the lore i would still love a securitron. Would be awesome to have its own perk card for people to upgrade them and even bring them out in Appalachia with you or your team.

Agreed. Scavenging for resources to repair items can be a little tedious but it gives me good reason to go out and loot. Give me more purpose to visit different areas of the map. Gives more purpose to use and have workbenches at our camps. If they were to remove item degradation ,I would probably begin to get bored of the game since its giving me less to do. (Btw I don‚Äôt play survival)
---
Indeed.  Yesterday I was on a server where a good 3/4 of the players wee Lv. 110 and up.  Decided to nuke Fissure Site Prime.  SBQ was dead in about 10 minutes. X)
---
I figure it's safe to ask as they're already running behind schedule implementing it so it's too late to run up and down the chain to add it at this late stage. Well, at least I'm hoping it is and I haven't just given them an idea they hadn't thought of, lol
---
Pretty sure they can it's just rare.
---
You also need to bypass the reactor restart in the terminal behind the lockpick door.  That allows you to advance.
---
My stash box is currently full to the brim with Golf Skirts haha. With the right stats and perks I can sell them for 29 caps each. Keep an eye out next time you're in whitesprings....
---
I‚Äôve never heard of this being a thing, why are you worried?
---
Sorry I didnt really mean it in a superior way. I was on the fence about trying it but for 15$ I don't have much to lose and I was trying to spread the price for those who are on the same boat.
---
I‚Äôll give you 500 .45 ammo for them
---
I read that in the voice of Mako. Good job üòÇ
---
Maybe you could pull off a bloodied build maybe you could pull off a sniper vats build. Luck will give you critcal damage and it has refresh perks on your AP. So depending on your agility perks and if you can get armor and a weapon all with ap refresh and +1 agility and a weapon that has vats bonuses id say thats your best bet but im no expert on builds.
---
I just don't see the need to remove items that were previously thought to be permanent when special 'limited time' items and bundles are already put out regularly.
---
Yeah, I would love to hear what all of the team would personally like to add to the game
---
ammo is the first place you should be looking..if youv played thr game enough the first thing yiu look for is missiles and nukes.
---
Super sold.
---
nerds
---
So I have to lockpick a level 3 lock and back a level 3 terminal? Including perk swap out time it would be faster to just repair the reactor
---
Psn VillainesSarah
---
Lol thanks xD I needed to correct it but my phone was being slow
---
Sorry, you'll have to mail it in if you are unsatisfied with the nylon texture.
---
I did not know that.
---
As far as I know you get them in order - Initiate (I), Knight (II), Knight CPT (III), Knight SGT (IV), Knight Officer (V), Paladin (VI) and Elder (VII). You have to learn previous to get the next, learn it and so on. I don't know how it works when you buy higher plan.
---
The chrome looks like one of those living statues in the park üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Thanks for the info!
---
It's the stubbed-toe mechanic.  Out walking you occasionally stub your toe and take damage (even in power armor).  At least that's what I tell myself.  I read a while ago that it happens with an incorrect collision calculation with the terrain textures or something.  The game thinks you take damage either as very slight fall damage or weapon damage when you collide with a certain texture.  I liked the stubbed toe excuse better.
---
Don't forget fusion cores
---
I hope there are some new jumpsuits or other apparel that is very rare in the new dungeons and raids.
---
I... didn't.
---
He  couldn't hurt me. He just trashed my CAMP.
---
your assualtron looks like someone stole its sweet roll.
---
Bloodied .50 Cal is currently the highest dps gun in game. Very accurate for a heavy weapon, can reach 650+ per shot with adrenaline going and proper setup / psychotats, no spinup, good sized magazine. 
---
Bloodied Gatling Plasma will overtake it as highest dps weapon once they make Stabilized armor penetration actually work with energy weapons. It has same fire rate, slightly higher dps, and is more ammo efficient as long as you craft ultracite plasma cores with 20+ intelligence. You get 350 shots per core that way, instead of 250.
---
Bloodied Gatling Gun is a nice 1 shot option for super mutants / bloated glowing ghouls and scorched. I need at least 3-4 stacks of adrenaline (or a headshot, or 25% damage boosting drug) to get into one shot range though.
---
All of those require power armor to be used effectively though. If you hate power armor, you're best bet is a Handmade or Lever Action. Handmade is a little less dps than .50 Cal on paper, but for sustained dps it's quite bad due to the low clip size.
---
Technical data. I have about 6 now...
---
I was 60  weight, in powder
---
If not Whitesprings, then I suggest the second floor of Rose‚Äôs tower! It‚Äôs a big circular shopping center with plenty of room, and has more of a ‚Äúwasteland‚Äù vibe to it than Whitesprings.
---
You haven't notice the existing MASSIVE sales tax on the current NPC vendors then?  
---
You can mitigate it a bit with charisma and grape mentats, but it still tops out that there's a large difference between selling and buying the exact same item.
---
I've seen the robotics work bench straight copy and pasted from fallout 4 in Appalachia- the robot you protect during back on the beat leaves and returns there during that event.
---
I'd love to see it personally. Robots protecting your base, robots selling items from your base there's all kinds if things that could be put in from fallout 4 potentially
---
This wont work, this would require me to respect perk cards every time I bounce back and forth between the 2 types of play.
---
This has happened since the beginning and I have a couple theories about it.
---
The first, as others have said, is latency.  The same reason your AP bar sometimes lags.  You took damage earlier and the game just now realizes it.
---
The staggers that happen from out of nowhere, though, I'm convinced are explosions happening somewhere nearby.
---
You can cripple her wings with Enforcer and make her land.
---
Glad you enjoyed it, man! We had an absolute blast last night, pun intended. :-) 
---
The HOA does weekly or bi-weekly shows, so we may come back to you when we do another trivia night.
---
My bloody explosive laser does more dmg then a bloody explosive ak. They are better for pvp.
---
I am glad to know it wasn't just me this weekend. I got no 3* items from 2 SBQ kills, too.
---
You could lure insult bot to your camp. As close as will get for now.
---
Yeah you're right - when I stagger someone win assn/sent they just die instantly usually.
---
Honestly if they nerf sent/assn I'd be extremely happy. I don't think they have though.
---
I have a power station camp just above the ridge by Big Bend Tunnel West with another alt. C.A.M.P. smack dab in the middle of it.
---
Handy, too, before we could have radios. Just take over tents that had them. Some have med/chem containers that respawn, so it's a nice supply.
---
Or it's the same bug, but she chose to fly toward Watoga instead of the edge and then got distracted by the robots.
---
I‚Äôve sent you a friend request
---
I did one yesterday and posted here on reddit with my gamer tag and ended up with a great crew that took her down fast.  I also used xbox messaging to ping all the high level players on my server to give them a heads up.  
---
I'm always scanning this reddit for xbox queen runs.
---
If only we could map alternative healing items to the right dpad...
---
I agree that was nice..but since we get 5 cans of Stew and they spoil before you have a chance to use them all, maybe they meant for us to hustle to other players and give them some stew?
---
I know they didn't. And I enjoyed the old aspect of the quest as well. All good here...
---
I had no idea, thanks for the data
---
shit. i was not expecting this post to get so many replies! let alone entire paragraphs! thank you all for your input in telling me about the game and your experiences. glad to see that the games actually bean coming along despite all of the criticism. though i don't think i'll be getting it just yet though. not until i try my hands at the other fallout games and gain some experience in some of the mechanics and all of that. but again, thanks.
---
I had never gotten one until the day I finally decided to take on the nuclear silo. What are the odds I get one there of all places lol
---
I buy nuka grape every time I stop at WS but no one else seems to get why. I‚Äôm glad someone else appreciates the finer things in life :)
---
I just got all of them and removed 1 until I got rid of the one nerfing me most. Was tedious as hell though. Sometimes the game doesn't tell you you just mutated btw. Gotta check it yourself.
---
It aggros non-hostile mobs and doesn't do enough damage to hostile ones to make it worth having.
---
I get a ton of lag/frame rate drops when traveling to my camp or loading in. On PS4.
---
I'm rebuilding my camp (again)  is there any way you can come to me?
---
Used to be the Ash Heap. But since I set up my CAMP in the Mire, I've fallen in love with it. The idea the nature basically gave humanity the finger after the bombs fell and just took over is awesome to me. Plus there's still enemies there that make me run in fear at lvl 70, without feeling like SB bullet sponges.
---
It‚Äôs also perfect if you have nice mutations you want to keep but not the starched genes perk yet. It‚Äôs has never dropped a mutation for me
---
Thank you. I'll be watching for your reply. I'll come see you for either one or both. WhatTheHeck1978
---
liberators drop red star pins
---
If you're actually RPing a Raider, the last thing you want to do is kill people you could be exploiting. Run a racket by charging players cap/ammo in order to leave them alone and offer protection from competing raiders. If a player doesn't cough up the protection caps, then you kill them. Just rolling in to a loners workshop, killing them and taking their setup isn't being a Raider. It's just being a dick.
---
I'm pretty sure in one of the recent patches they undid the fix to make legendaries always drop legendaries. I think this happened when they rolled back the legendary robots insta-exploding.
---
I've had 3 or 4 legendaries drop no legendaries and also 1 flare gun and a drill drop instead of a legendary sense the latest patch.
---
Thanks.
---
Right but the problem is I dont wanna see this become a slippery slope of them being able to justify selling pay to win items.
---
You are. Nobody goes upstairs in whitesprings to buy soda but i will get some soda and try it out. I have 1 lvl of that perk so should actually use it for once.
---
Hi, do you think we can get a response today from our concerns about the direction of the Atomic shop to selling non cosmetic items?  We've all noticed the effective radio silence after that announcement, and we'd really like clarification and more information about intent, purpose and specifics of what is going on.
---
Should be on later tonight, starting arounf 7:45-8:00 Central. I was actually planning on making a post tonight
---
Juice is semi reliable he does put out some info but he also jumps on the hate train without knowing the full story. So if you can tune out the BS then I suppose he is okay.
---
Aren't they like 400c without perk?
---
Oh no. You didnt hear?
---
It was the Fallout name that drew people. The game is nothing like it could and should have been.
---
As I said it's the kind of thing that should transcend personal enjoyment. Defending this kind of behaviour is almost as bad. We should be decrying it as a single community.
---
But that'll never happen because there will always be defenders.
---
Stash boxes are for you overseer boxes are for everyone
---
Oh no buddy
---
So couldn't the lockpick, hacking super duper and other be a permanent skill? So you don't need to go to a menu to equip them every single time that you are in front of a damn safe?
---
The minimum INT requirement is akin to a minimum CHR to share perks.  Im not saying you need to have an INT of 15 to craft legendaries more like an INT of 3 or 4.
---
Seriously, we really want a response.  While we're happy to learn you can actually get the pie from the machine, this is far more critical to talk about.
---
If the dude showed up, kicked down a single wall, and yelled "Gimme yer corn"... I would have laughed and dropped something for him, probably said something like "I will remember you, someday, you will pay".
---
And that would have been it.
---
This was just being a douche.
---
Oh you poor thing
---
But this is really just part of the problem.  You HAVE TO devote a good chunk of your perks to keep your stuff from breaking and/ or making repairs easier.  I'd rather be investing in perks to increase damage or health, or whatever.  
---
You HAVE TO  max out gunsmith for ranged and makeshift warrior for melee to avoid having to constantly repair weapons.   I don't see how it's even possible to play this game with 1 intelligence.   When you when everyone is basically  forced to invest a bare minimum in certain special stats just to make the game  manageable, that is a big problem by itself.
---
Death is a preferable alternative to communism

Dont want to be the one to tell him :/
---
Someone please tell this man...
---
Stand to the side, sometimes they kick! Also you're going to need the Brahmin Pen plan in order to build it.
---
The other people didn‚Äôt tell you so I‚Äôll take it: in last week‚Äôs inside the vault, they revealed that it would be delayed a month to get everything right.
---
it seems to be speaking in some variation of the pandoran bandit language
---
Here's an analogy that explains why some players are really bothered by the introduction of a non cosmetic item in the Atom shop.
---
Think of the Atom Shop as your Anus. The repair kit is the tip of a gigantic dildo bat. Right now Bethesda is saying "  
---
Please!! Just the Tip!?!?" The players feel they know better, and that at some point Bethesda is going to push it further.....
---
And they probably wouldn't be safe from enemy NPCS either... I'm just saying, if someone wanted to grief an immune CAMP, they could probably lead a bunch of enemies there.
---
That's why they need to relax the restrictions on foundation placement, because there will always be some way to destroy a CAMP.
---
AKUUUUUU!
---
That's not a bad idea. I like the rifle. Yeah my 10mm had refill crit meter so that's why I kept it. But the damage is rather poor. Although the ammo is usually pretty cheap 
---
I may switch the charisma but really interested in the share perks for a group event but they aren't really super strong right now.
---
Agree this is really the parents job.
---
Don‚Äôt play with my emotions right now....  what happened?
---
You should just wait back at your CAMP.
---
Welp might have LOST a CHASIS then üò≠üò≠
---
Thank you for this I didn't even know I needed it lol but now I do know.
---
Yes which is why the mob was lvl 15.  Still a 3* lvl 15 legendary should drop level 15 gear IMO.
---
Also Look at your junk that doesn't bulk. I once had a 400 stack of asbestos without knowing it.
---
Well what are the traits?
---
I‚Äôve never seen anyone ever use it. So probably not that much. Maybe 1-2k
---
The vending update was pushed back to May 9.
---
Still kinda disgusting either way
---
I didn't know about this. Thanks for letting me know.
---
Please, a response regarding player base concerns about non cosmetic items in the Atom Shop.  Even if it's 'we're discussing it internally' would be better than the total radio silence we got last week, and now just seemingly like ignoring the question while posting in other threads.
---
i missed the initial surge of allowed feedback posting but please let the team know that the repair kits thing is extremely bad
---
ü§¨
---
F in the chat for us Melee lads.
---
Game chat on pipboy and a message box with fallout 4s companion app would be cool especially if we could trade through the app itself.
---
Probably not. Gamma guns are only good against humans really.
---
See, I disagree.  I think that by locking things and placing traps, you're appealing to their desire to break things.  It shows that you really care about your CAMP, which makes it more irresistible for them to break. 
---
Leaving things open is a sign that you aren't willing to play their game.
---
Nothing we said will change their public plan.  The inside the vault was purposefully lacking in details. This way Bethesda can hear everything pre launch, make changes as they see fit, and then pretend like nothing was changed last minute.
---
Literally this. Your job is to use Enforcer to cripple it, and all the mobs running around. This is one of the most powerful uses of any weapon.
---
Select the cooking pot in your crafting section and then you‚Äôll see an arrow next to it. You can move back and forth through different types of camp items that will let you cook, including the stove.
---
OP hasn't responded. Should someone call for a wellness check at their home?
---
Sweet. Didn't think about that.
---
üëç no problem. The mod part can be a bit confusing but it's best to just use the base stats. Also the energy resistance will not change when the item is repaired to 200% but the ballistic resistance will.
---
Nope. Same thing happened to me with Confederate hats. I "learned" the plan. It's not in there. Got another plan for the hat and it says "learned". It's allegedly something they fixed, my particular issue I mean, but uh... It's still not there.
---
It might be the stove decoration you unlocked and not a useable cooking stove. I fell for that one too
---
Quitting the game and restart it and it will be back in your log

There should be a set of 24 player vending machines at Whitespring so players don't need to risk exposing their CAMP if they don't necessarily want it to be publicly known where it is.  
---
If a player activates their vending machine at their camp, then a corresponding proxy vending machine at Whitespring would be usable.
---
Oh that's why my Brahmin keep taking damage when I go to mill them
---
I can see where you are coming from. I just want to be able to play and not wonder as long. Just pure laziness on my part. But hey it‚Äôs a service and Bethesda should deliver.
---
you can find miby 2 over at the West tek building usually super mutants and over at Roboco research centre
---
Xbox Unfortunately. Sorry mate
---
+karma thank you!
---
Oh. So, maybe I need to find the actual "stove plans", and then this is a skin?
---
With enforcer, while she's in the air, keep firing on her until she does one of two things: goes to her landing animation or hovers in a single spot for a long time. When she hovers, it mean's she's trying to land but can't find a spot. She will usually rarely attack when in this pattern as well. It looks like she's stuck, so you'll know it when you see it. So you've pretty much done all the crippling you can do at this point. It's up to the game to actually get her on the ground. Then focus on the adds and keep them off the heavy gunners and melees. If she takes off again: lather, rinse, repeat. 
---
If you want to practice this, it's the same process for any scorchbeast. If you cripple one from a wooded area where there's no place to land, you can see this pattern in action.
---
Oh you poor thingüò¢
---
But go post on the fallout trading Reddit and someone may give you an offer.  If a player has armor with no radiation protection then these guns are extremely deadly. Because vanguard and bloodied builds do not defend against it at all.
---
*scorched grunt/growl*
---
You can milk the brahmin by walking up to it and the option appears to milk it. 
---
Usually, though... I'm halfway through swinging an axe at it before I see the option, and then it's too late.
---
I think they are trying to tell us white springs is supposed to be the hub. That's why they are adding vendors. But if somehow it could be know to everyone to hang or there for trades that would make trading easier.
---
I have a 1 star explosive cryolator with the crystalizing barrel, and I keep it on hand solely for SBQ runs. As a melee player it's nice to be able to contribute when she's flying around, and I figured that being able to make her freeze in place helps all the people running furious weapons.
---
With the vending being pushed back a month, are they still putting out any updates tomorrow?
---
Thanks great info
---
Well, it‚Äôs not sales tax (no way Wallace the Free States bot pays sales tax). It‚Äôs more like why GameStop charges 54.99 for a used games but will give you 2.99 for the same title.
---
As an aside, have you found a vendor that sells mods for the Gatling Gun?  I found a Bloodied one and it's one of my new favorite weapons, but I don't have any mods available at my workbench.
---
End up stopping by here pretty much every time I'm at WS. Also keeping an eye out for the pesky Deathclaw spawn.
---
same thing happened to me with a VTU jumpsuit. I found the rare plan, learned it, and poof.. gone without the hint of being able to craft the underarmor
---
Oof.
---
Seeing as how the assets exist in FO4 already...
---
Maybe it's an issue of server stability?
---
hey kiddo, calm down, i think its time for your nap, or no going to the zoo later
---
Ive never seen anyone on the internet care about something that happened last week. I mean didnt GOT start? So everyones moved onto that.
---
There are certain spots on the map where they will spawn more likely
---
Wait, you can't?
---
It's not like we're killing innocent people. 
---
Or threatening anyone who is innocent. 
---
It's to remove the greater evil which is the same thing as nuking the institute. 
---
Everyone in the vicinity is dead or safe in a vault. 
---
At the end of the day, these threaten the entire east coast. 
---
So nukes are viable.
---
I didn't know this could actually happen. I'm going to have to start trying this more often.
---
most people dont speak french, imagine that?
---
My day just got a little sadder....
---
This sunday
---
Great idea.
---
Thank you all.
---
Just got a Ghoul Slayers Right arm from a queen so now I have made them match!!
---
Might be worth having some heavy-duty guards there in Survival? Defacto RP friendly ‚ÄúSince 76 has opened, and vendors have moved in, Whitesprings has had to upgrade its security...‚Äù
---
Back to the past
---
I actually didnt notice it, thanks for heads up
---
If you're on PC, I can mod it for you.
---
I think I figured this issue out but it‚Äôs a lengthy explanation. Question, after placing your camp down and building, did you move your green camp box from where you originally placed it?
---
Such is life I suppose
---
I'm down with inside of whisperings being a no weapon zone for trading. Lol you can't trade anyone on survival mode.
---
Do the repair kits repair stuff beyond the point that a regular repair does?  or do you not need to be at a workshop?  or is it just the fact that it saves resources?
---
Shishkebab
---
Nah, they changed it so that now you all share the rare material drop. The weapons are each player but the rare materials are first to loot now
---
They only attack the player who attacked them.  Other players can stand there and talk to them.
---
I know this because I actually helped someone yesterday who got killed by a Whitesprings Mr. Gutsy by repeatedly talking to the Gutsy while he went to get his bag.
---
Bloodied 3*'s can get up to 5k in the right circumstance?
---
I have a mutants 3* with limb dmg, I like to play with in PvP, but the rad dmg doesn't benefit from crit or stealth.
---
Funny to watch people panic when they start taking 155 rads per tick from stealth, but I've only.managed to kill a few noobs with it.
---
That made my day at least a little better
---
No worries, it was a long shot.
---
At least everyone has been nice about it.....
---
There are reputable people on reddit that will mod your item for caps.  I paid 300 caps for the sights.  I will post there name on my next post to you.
---
Good to know, thank you :)
---
Maybe they will let us by rooms to live in like black desserts apartments?
---
Honestly, who cares. This game‚Äôs canon is all pretty weak, going right back to the start. And it‚Äôs always just some basement dwelling dorks arguing over the smallest minutia when it comes up. Ten bucks says than in the next ten years, IF they make two more fallouts in that time frame neither one with have much of anything to do with the previous ones. Just expect the brotherhood to be shoed in somehow. 
---
What this game needs is a total reboot from square one. One guy, a vault, and a blasted wasteland. Sick of hearing about how this-or-that from a one off game 20 years means that such-and-such HAS to be so. It‚Äôs not interesting.
---
Maxson was against it, but Taggerdy wasn't.
---
In a separate holotape Maxson implores Taggerdy to bring outsiders into the ranks and Taggerdy is against it, but he defers to her boots on the ground judgement.
---
It isn't hard to rationalize that if Maxson was in Taggerdy's shoes he would change his mind.
---
I do like the idea especially for earlier lvls once you get high enough all your weapons and armour that you want to keep are starred so you can't scrap them even if you wanted too lol. But I think what you are talking about is a great idea also make it to where if you want to drop something there is a check as well would be great.
---
Don‚Äôt be a douche.
---
That whole neighborhood has an HOA. You cant put up a shack in that area and you didnt even get proper building permits. Class warfare lives on even if the people dont. Thats why i live near a nuclear waste dump.
---
Have you thought about adding animal friend and wasteland whisperer to the build. Its only 6 more points and could help with the shortfall of combat viability by just pacifying everything that wants to hurt you. My 2c on what to use those extra points on.
---
Thanks!  I‚Äôve had so many headaches with just trying to read that page with the constant window popping up, that I‚Äôve lost interest....
---
I guess it was worth the frustration after all...
---
I got a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet a few days ago so yeah
---
By critical do you mean vats critical?
---
I have wasted SO much plastic re-bulking after doing this.  :/
---
Like leading a scorchbeast to a turret base at the Whitesprings Clubhouse.
---
lol
---
Thanks for the concern
---
The big flaring mansion is a good one too
---
I suppose we'll find out tomorrow, but is that change part of tomorrow's update, or part of the future Player Vending update?
---
A free state as a great reason to charge tax. All the profit goes into their pocket without having to invest back into their people.
---
Lol and it was supposed to happen last week right ?
---
People who still grief or to being ‚Äúraiders‚Äù in adventure are just weaklings that can‚Äôt handle survival.
---
Maybe he is more like Krampus Todd...
---
I moved it to mountain near WS gold club
---
Ok so one other option is that you didn‚Äôt buy the functional one, but the non-functional decorative one. I imagine that‚Äôs in floor decorations but I can‚Äôt recall. 
---
This happened to me and I was a little salty that there was a decorative cook stove that does nothing.
---
I know... my day was going good too...
---
I run a bloodied build with 3 pieces that give +25 rad resists, not much, but better than not.
---
 I don't think sentinal affects rad dmg? Might be worth looking into.
---
White springs carpet gives me a headache! Maybe when we get factions each faction will have a hub like raiders will be to of the world!
---
Are you talking about melee swing being broken by the ‚Äúone-shot‚Äù nerf?
---
If you do it Friday-Sunday nights around 9pm-12pm (US any time zone), I've seen the most people on during those times. And there's almost always someone nuking something. Did my first successful one Friday night and then turned around and did it again Saturday night. First one took close to 20 min and the second was in under 5 due to the number of high level players on the server. Grab your loot fast because both times, the server crashed within 5 minutes of the battle ending.
---
He makes nice thumbnails though. Gotta give props on that. I bet he has to server hop for hours to find the right lighting conditions, because as a fellow youtuber, trying to find the right lighting in the right area and get the snapshot just right before it starts raining or something is a real pain. Fallout 4 was so much easier in that regard.
---
That's a good question. I found a zealots explosive black powder rifle last night and killed a level 50 scorched beast in 3 shots, but I'm also a rifle build. I would like to know the answer myself.
---
These are sad times for everyone, friend.
---
I don't know but I have noticed the same thing. Increased legendary spawns, better more two-shot or explosive finds (not together but atleast separately).
---
I'd bet money you were at the whitespring. Forget about that place, man. It's a trap.
---
Seems to be sporadic.  I was on a dry streak for awhile then snagged a furios explosive combat rifle today. Not sure if it's better.
---
I had a watiga robot drop an aa explosive lever action last night, followed by an explosive BP rifle from a mutant so...maybe?
---
I have used these 2 people.  They are awesome.
---
Ign Jchamlin
---
Ign Lady_alissa
---
Send them a friend request and meet up with them.
---
Yep.... hoodwinked
---
No he meant moving the box from before you got kicked, did you move it to experiment with your spawn point? Had the same thing happen to me, tested it and that seems to be the issue
---
If you can, I haven't been able to find the option.
---
I also run revenant. I use 4 pieces of unyielding and 1 autostim piece. The one piece as well as mysterious savior will proc revenant.
---
F
---
You mean clickbait lol
---
Yeah, it gives you +100 energy resist at a cost of -50 energy damage. It's a great mutation for melee and ballistic weapon players at end game because all the turrets and ~50% of the mobs in the silos use energy attacks.
---
Even more so that FO4 has a companion app still available!
---
Definitely. I‚Äôm going to do testing. Maybe look into using gamma gun or radium rifle on human targets and some other gun for power armor targets.  I think these guns have slipped by everyone‚Äôs radar.  I‚Äôve never used them in any fallout game tbh.  
---
Also radium rifles prevent people from spamming stimpaks.  They would have to spam stimpaks and radaway at the same time to survive under this strategy.  Hmm...interesting.
---
Well, tomorrow item renaming is being released, so if you rename everything with a - or something that you want to keep, it should all wind up together in your list, and be harder to scrap at least.
---
Yep.... I‚Äôve been waiting for this since the original push when it should Vendors as an option....
---
Yesssss yessss, let the hate flow through you!
---
Still? LOL. I haven't touched this game since december and they still haven't fixed this yet. Unbelievable.
---
I didnt move the C.A.M.P. device before logging off
---
I have been farming watoga and white springs heavily and noticed much better drops on  weekends. Is it possible the amount of people/high levels on a world increase the drop rate and rolls?
---
Literally happen to me. I thought it was coming out last Tuesday, then to find out it's frickin may.
---
War. War never changes...
---
lol the first day of Survival everyone ran in terror from my Assassin's Gamma gun. It was glorious.
---
I've seen it mentioned that HP buffs reduce your HP by the same amount when they expire, so Well Fed would be potentially dangerous at \~9% HP. I haven't noticed that personally though, and I've been running Bloodied + Rejuvenated recently.
---
Are you using bufftats, or anything that temp increases hp? I stopped using any chems that increase health outside of food for well fed. It's too tedious to monitor more than 1 boost.
---
I'm sure he's talking about the repair kits being added to the atom shop.
---
Sorry brother.... maybe it will just be extra awesome when it does come out....
---
Second this suggestion
---
Frost is an incredible piece of work
---
They should make is so taking the mutation again removes it. like an antidote.
---
Yes that actually happens because of losing the Well Fed buffs.
---
Shotgun is very much bis. Pistols not so much
---
What do you mean, thats not right? Not fair? This is how most people are dealing with this issue, at least. Easy solution.
---
Diseased drop this semi often. But in my case, I think the ‚Äòdiseased‚Äô tag fits because they infect my stash with nocturnal wood armor and crap like that half the time
---
I have +700h in this game they fix her alot but it is still trash... Not worth full price..... Exploits exploits exploits 0 balance most op build in game is vats crit (aimbot bild in pvp dominate ) game of the year looks like beta after 5 or 6 month after release... last dlc piece of crap some side quest are longer than this dlc :)
---
At the end of the day, it is their shit. They can do what they please with it. Nothing is certain until it is in your own hands.
---
I got four legendary items off of a single two star legendary enemy, and all of them were two star drops. 
---
They were all terrible but they were all two star drops. 
---
Then later I got two drops off another legendary. The RNG gods were smiling on me that day.
---
I think it has to do with per shot damage cap in survival mode. A split beam will shot multiple shots each capable of reaching the cap.
---
Supposedly three shots of any weapon is sufficient to take down none sentinel builds. 
---
This makes laser an effective weapon because of its fire rate, magazine capacity, and sights options.
---
Heavy BoS combat armor chest piece give 81/81 at 100% repair and the limbs are 35/45 at 100%
---
What do you expect from a guy whose username is inspired by his love of shoving bananas up his ass.
---
Yeah.
---
No because I‚Äôm taking into consideration things like Game Design. Shit doesn‚Äôt happen in some quantum environment. There‚Äôs such a thing as common sense but it‚Äôs up to you to use it.
---
What I need is auto-rad. 90% of my deaths are from not being able to pull up my quick-wheel and select diluted radaway quickly enough
---
I'm not against that. Especially as that's how it's worked in the other BGS RPG we've all grown up with.
---
But to implement it now would seem...sloppy? I'm not sure I'd care but wouldn't it maybe rub some people the wrong way having chosen those perks (I've gotten lucky this time, all 3 lockpick cards came in packs).
---
I just think a logical in game perk loadout system is a cleaner approach. Have a utility setup with as many crafting/sales/hacking/lockpicking cards as one can suffer &amp; just spend 3 seconds swapping to it.
---
That said, lockpicking is very occasional, as are most crafting/repair jobs. Overall we're talking tiny bits of time spent to move a few cards, pick/craft/repair, then back to the offensive setup. It feels tedious as hell after the thousandth time but it's still miniscule amounts (at least in my experience). But for me the most crafting I do is food, and I don't really need super duper hooking me up with 26 radstag steaks of which I'll eat 4.
---
But I'm spoiled, using PC, of course I've got the loadout manager mod. They should add this feature so all platforms have it. Game changer is a bit heavy of a term but the convenience is undeniable. I still occasionally forget to swap back to offensive after selling/crafting but you notice pretty quickly, and can switch back with relative ease. Can't say it's ever gotten me killed.
---
I considered this, but as it does affect enemies directly, I opted to not include them.  
---
The QoL build is only intended for playing the game without Perk Swap interruptions, and is not intended for engaging any enemies.  We would discourage that as it may have dire consequences.
---
They could repurpose the chair downstairs in the enclave bunker to be some sort of mutation removal surgery area
---
hybrid builds are ineffective in SBQ. Your role should be crippling her wings or killing scorched creatures so heavy guns people can do their job more freely.
---
Gauss isn't useless tho. Bugged for sure.
---
Oh boohoo.
---
As long as it‚Äôs not more than 1000 Atom, it shouldn‚Äôt bother anyone. There is plenty of atom available for free, and new opportunities everyday. 
---
If you buy it in the atom shop, the plan is on every character there after. 
---
Reminds me of mounts from WoW; you can pay if you want, but pretty much no one does
---
OP didn't ask about full price. He specifically mentioned discounts.
---
Also, I think if you can play a game for 700+ hours and still not recommend it to someone - you may have a problem. How many hours are you spending on all of the high quality titles out there?
---
A whole entire questline yes
---
Well... no. I think what he means is that you wouldn't even get a second lockpick perk card until you reached... say... level 25.
---
And then wouldn't get the third until, say, level 50.
---
So you wouldn't even have the option of upgrading a card until you got the next.
---
I know this is an old thread, but for future googlers...
---
Chickens have a chance to spawn at Whitespring, on a little hill just south of the service entrance. There's also a spot by White Powder Winter Sports, on the road just north by a pickup truck. These are both random small animal spawns, so chickens are just one possibility.
---
I understand that but rather than repeat what everyone else has said I thought I would add some additional context. Obviously you would rather have 1 response posts that never rack up karma.
---
They asked for a official response not your opinion.
---
I just favorite them as a workaround, but yeah it would be a whole lot just being able to map different healing items to that button
---
Okay dad.
---
Yeah but I never bought any of them.   I got them all  through doing forbidden knowledge. The plans went from II to IV.
---
Yup. I could deal with my brahmin taking occasional damage, but I had to remove the mutation after my buddy tamed a sloth and I kept aggroing it every time I went too his camp.
---
Survival mode is still in BETA so, hopefully, they will work out some of the kinks. 
---
They do need to do something about spawn points being camped, though. It should have been a no-brainer that people were going to stalk the only marked places on the map where they know that people can fast travel or spawn after death. The only safe place to spawn is your camp, and that's only if it's not in too public of a location. Even then there is always the chance that someone has found it and is there waiting for you to return.
---
I had this happen to me just last night. I was just going back to my camp to unload some junk and fix my weapons while my teammate anchored us at the location we were working on clearing, and there was a guy waiting for me on my roof. He had destroyed my entire camp, save for the roof tile he was sitting on (of course), but this didn't really bother me because it is \*very\* easy to repair a camp and it takes very little of your resources to do so. Anyway, I spawned up the hill from my camp, noticed the damage, and then saw him. I was able to snipe him from up the hill but, of course, he came right back with his teammate and they essentially occupied my camp so I couldn't use it and would just kill me every time I tried to get near it. I called my teammate back and we ended up PvPing them for a good twenty minutes, but they were clearly not going to leave the area now that they knew where both of our camps were (my teammate is also my neighbor - LOL). Additionally, our camps are located very near the Pleasant Valley Station, which we discovered they were also stalking with two additional teammates, so we couldn't use that as a local spawn point, either. We had to server hop to get rid of them.  It's complete BS that a four-man team can essentially block you from your camp as well as any spawn points anywhere near it. And I don't even bother trying to go to the vendors to sell anything in Survival mode, I just hold on to it all until I am encumbered and then switch to Adventure mode to sell it.
---
They could put a protective bubble around spawn points. People would still stalk the outer rim of them, but you would have more of a chance to get away (unless, of course, you're dealing with a 3-4 person team that can cover/stalk more ground).
---
The longest life leaderboard is a joke, as all you need to do to get off the map once you're in the top three is either kill yourself with an explosive or have a teammate kill you (take all your armor off and fast travel to your camp first, of course). I guess if you're going for longest life of the week or something you would care that you've been alive the longest, but I just don't care. I like survival for the added suspense (you don't know where anyone is or what they're going to do when/if you run into them) and the extra XP, not because I need to get on the leaderboards. Until there are challenges that involve the leaderboards, I plan on thoroughly ignoring them. LOL.
---
I do love this game, though, despite what anyone says about it. They have improved Adventure mode a \*great\* deal since BETA and they have actually listened to some of the things that we want and added them. I am hoping that they do the same for Survival.
---
Can we get pre-fabs like in FO4? Even small ones big enough for a workbench or two would be useful to set down to scrap, craft, sleep, store stuff, play a little music etc and then move on.
---
Apparently taking his eggs also raises his ire
---
I've found  better things for sure, maybe it's so people can have more chance with the purveyor?
---
Yeah
---
If you could set it to ‚Äòbuy no more than x bulk steel at y price per bulk‚Äô that would be cool. But I see it mainly working with scrap, ammo, fusion cores, aid, but not really with weapons or armor since legendary effects would make it way more complicated (both in ‚Äòdo you want the piece at all‚Äô and ‚Äòhow much would it be worth if it isn‚Äôt an exact match‚Äô)
---
It doesn't.
---
Your job as a content creator is to entertain your viewers. You have just been given an information about area where you failed to do that to the point they left the video. Do as you wish, I wont watch it now.
---
Sorry you have to speak up I'm wearing a towel
---
Nice!
---
Usually that means it dropped for someone else. I've seen it disappear when the person loots it.
---
I agree with you.  I am just dissapointed they havent fixed it.  I tried 3rd person and i get totaly lost.  I have always played fps for over 30 years and i cannot grasp it.
---
I'd like to know your build.
---
Real talk here - if you aren't making clickbait thumbnails, you aren't going to be successful. It's as simple as that. There are thousands of YouTubers covering every video game and only a few will get clicks. If you want to be one of those few, you need to have the BEST thumbnails and titles. There's nothing wrong with an enticing thumbnail unless the content doesn't deliver.
---
I think you're getting all of mine too. :(
---
Unless you're getting nothing but 1-2* exterminator weapons and lifesaving arms too.
---
I think it's a lot easier to do what I said. Shoot and then aim and you get crosshairs. Stupid we have to do it this way but it does work and I only waste one round before I know exactly where they're going to hit.
---
I don't always remember, but I try to buy one whenever I am in WS and loot one whenever I am at the TNT domes. They are truly great stuff. I save them for the tougher fights and absolute emergencies.
---
Thanks for responding - any update on the situation with repair kits?  
---
Many fans are concerned that it‚Äôs a departure from ‚Äòcosmetic only‚Äô into the world of pay-to-win micro transactions.  We‚Äôd love if you can put our minds at ease with more information.
---
While I understand that, I find that despite my best intentions, enemies often engage me. Maybe its because of my characters design (very punchable face), but Super Mutants seem to go out of there way to try to harm me. Being able to pacify them, or run away home to my pet deathclaw, has been my only saving grace in the wasteland. For others like me who made a little oops when picking their face, I think its a viable addition. Definitely not needed for everyone though.
---
Now you can RP Bender with Chrome Excavator and all the Alcohol from Biv!
---
That's why that one is in a permanent renovation state - still fighting over the permits.
---
You basically described Whitesprings. You know, that golf course you always see filled with players? And shops? And benches? The hub everyone uses before they go online and say how nice a hub would be? Of course, no one speaks to each other. And such it shall always remain.
---
That's a good idea and thought. Hopefully they work around it.
---
Nah no bufftats, they bug out your HP when you have rads and make it a huge pain to stay under 20%.
---
where do you like to farm for 3 stars?
---
i also go to RobCo, Westtek, Watoga, and Harpers Ferry areas
---
+karma thank you again for the trade!
---
Mobile is where it's at. Even without the in-house resources they could contract to any number of development companies to get it done. 
---
Charge atoms for every in app transaction and see how it makes it rain!
---
thats worth a lot
---
Yeah, I thought it might be enough to kill me if I was running Rejuvenated, but without it, 9% seems like a lot. The last time it happened I was at 75% food / water when I used the radaway and boom, still died. I'm starting to wonder if there's a discrepency between my displayed HP and what the server thinks my HP is.
---
I completely agree.  
---
Crafting weapons and armor at endgame serves no purpose other than for certain tasks that reward you Atoms.  And with my luck, I can never find specific Legendary items.  Especially Legendary MG42‚Äôs.
---
It would be great to craft my own MG42‚Äôs and with the tokens we get from the Purveyor I can make them Legendary and add more affects.  I feel it would make the Gun more unique and personal because I crafted it myself and made it my own rather than find it off a Ghoul‚Äôs corpse.
---
Good doer sheep! Baaaah! Baaaaaaaah!
---
If you check the sub though, a lot of the content so far illustrates groups of ordinary folks caught up in awful situations and just trying to cope. Except the gourmands... they‚Äôre flesh eating scum, but hey, folks have gotta eat I s‚Äôpose!
---
That's what I thought. Never had one used against me to know, only used it on others.
---
My friend and I tried to kill each other with Radium rifles. Had some pretty good ones, lvl 50, decent bonuses like furious (we couldn't decide if furious applied to the rad damage...) it was pretty hard to kill each other with a Radium rifle. The rad damage just isn't high enough. And if you've got them in a spot where you can balls out full auto them, they can ususally hit back hard enough to make you second guess the outcome. In the end, you'll get killed by a bloodied explosive something which you could have wrecked with a Gamma gun.
---
Maxson approaches the problem as an idealogue - he has no concept of what's really happening in Appalachia or the consequences it brings.
---
Thanks. :D
---
I got a 1* Flamer from her yesterday.
---
Do you have the mats needed to build it?
---
20 projectiles in a handmade clip. 105 projectiles shot from a 21 ammo laser clip, that‚Äôs a hell of a lot more chance to stagger. Now obviously the handmade will outperform with spamming crits, but no one is talking about that.
---
What we are talking about is whether or not a laser rifle can be effective in PvP and my argument is it can, and the hundreds of people I‚Äôve killed with mine will also agree.
---
15 Perception, 15 luck, points in Charisma for suppressor, maxed out Ironclad and Fireproof, 
---
Basically every rifle damage, pure damage, and vats perk there is, maxed out, plus points in endurance for damage resistance. 
---
Serendipity maxed out is an absolute must-have. 
---
I pretty much have a full crit meter 90% of the time, and I run a Lever Action/Handmade loadout.
---
It's not just pacifist tho, they can't do damage unless you both initiate pvp.
---
What are it's stats?  
---
As rare at it is it should give you something epic, like telekinysis or accurately weighted bobby pins...
---
I hate that the gamma gun is hard to aim. I don't think it even has iron sights on it.
---
I have to say, getting my new monitor which as a built in center dot has been amazing for my .50 Cal and Gatling Gun. Highly recommend.
---
That was beautiful.
---
Most people can at least understand the word 'yes' in French by age 5.  Thanks for the input. Imagine that.
---
The issue seems to be when the C.A.M.P. box itself is moved to an area you couldn‚Äôt originally place your camp. 
---
Let me try to explain...
---
Green colored zone you can place your camp = appropriate build zone. 
---
Red colored zone where it won‚Äôt let you place your camp = no-build zone. 
---
Ok let‚Äôs say you want to build directly north of the WS club house, by the creek. When you go to check where you can place your camp you‚Äôll see south of the creek is a no-build zone whereas most of the grass north of the creek is an appropriate build zone. You place it where it‚Äôs appropriate and start building. 
---
You have your house built but decide to move your green camp box because it‚Äôs out in the open. If you then pick up and move your green camp unit to a different spot within your build zone, it‚Äôll let you. 
---
However (and here‚Äôs the part that causes the error), if you move the camp box to a spot that was initially in the no-build zone, you get that error after logging out and back in. Once you get it, there‚Äôs no way to recover your base (as far as I know).
---
What I would always do now going forward is check if whatever spot you want to move the camp box to is within a safe building zone. This can be done even if you already have a camp setup. Just pull up the pip boy menu, hit L1 (on PS4) to act like you‚Äôre moving camps, and check if the certain spot is a safe build zone or no-build zone. If it‚Äôs safe, you can close out of that menu and safely move your green camp box to that spot. 
---
I hope that makes sense, let me know if you have any questions. I feel this needs to be a PSA because it‚Äôs effecting a lot of people unexpectedly and it‚Äôs definitely preventable. Just not reversible if it‚Äôs already happened.
---
your OK.  Chassis are plentiful in the forest, and you wont be able to mount components on them until L15.
---
recommend Following the ovcerseers questline. 
---
Staying in the forest until L15-20, then go to the toxic valley. 
---
@ 30, western edge of the divide and the ash heap.
---
I find it‚Äôs the exact opposite lol the legendarys have been brutal this whole lost month.
---
I‚Äôve killed the queen about 40 times in the last two weeks and out of 40 it‚Äôs dropped one weapon and the rest have been basic legendary armour nothing special
---
Gunpowder always creeps up on me too.
---
Decent rolls can fetch 3-5k on the trading subs.
---
Merc work eh?
---
My hubby and I set up our latest camps by the overseers camp, with the sole intention to help newbies out. Two assholes just levelled my hubby's camp and repeatedly killed him for no reason at all. Makes me so mad. He can't rebuild until he gets more resources :(
---
What's your price for pestering these knobheads for 5 mins?
---
It happens sometimes. Farm them for lvl 1 legendaries, and pimp out the first vault fresh lvl 2 you see.
---
every second, someone drops a fucking nuke but no building gets harmed or nukes create nuclear winter
---
well, hopefully they straighten out the details by the time it launches in a month
---
Yup me too
---
Fuck what Maxson wanted, the BoS needs to protect the wasteland at any costs. Maxson is 3000 miles away and learning about it through a radio set. We're facing an extinction level event that if it isn't contained will destroy the the rest of the US. The Nuclear Option is the only option. Unlike the Dark Ones the Scorched aren't friendly and there's no moral ambiguity here. We're fighting for our place as apex predator in the wasteland. Entries say the only limit to how quickly they breed is how much room they have. Its us or them. Scorched/Super Mutants/Abominations have no place on this Earth. Kill a Scorched and do your brothers proud.
---
It‚Äôs a pvp gun useful like the radium
---
These posts of mine are generating negativity in this sub, I think largely because of blurred lines between raiders and griefers, but the membership on 76Raiders is going up every day, so hopefully content will pickup soon!
---
100% vendor plans are in the atomic shop. You pay a 1 time atom fee to build the stores
---
Ohhh yeah
---
If the directive of upper management is to make no comment, they will follow said directive. 
---
Unfortunately, this appears to be the case. If not, they would have responded like they have other hot button items in the past...within a 24-48 hour time frame.
---
I don't fight the queen much I do the event at robco and whitesprings run
---
The Institute wasn't evil though. They were at worst morally neutral.
---
If you are on Xbox Live I will put any of the mods you want on it for free. Just give me the supplies if I don't already have them.
---
GT = TEH RED ZMAN
---
It's really more about Bethesda changing their stance on the atom shop's contents. They originally promised it would be cosmetics only. While the repair kits aren't pay to win IMO, they're "pay for convenience" and open the door to other, more blatant P2W items.
---
it's rng - theoretically you can get all 7 one after another or never ;)
---
This is literally the first time someone has mentioned this and is definetley not in the list of topics that have been done to death. Odd no one mentioned it before you.
---
As far as I know they are always hostile. Usually they just hover around you, but 1/5 or so really wants your blood. Their damage is so low that I can easily ignore it, but being constantly in combat neutralizes my healing facter mutation.
---
Put a sticker dot on your screen?
---
Anything said on the topic would reflect the views of the whole company, so it takes time to liaise and discuss the current feedback before they can comment.
---
The effects also stack with Party Boy/Girl I have heard.
---
Why though? Death in this game  pretty much doesn't matter. Just put your junk away and collect resource at the workshop you just PAID to claim. If someone does come along and kill you eventually then just walk away. Honestly don't understand why everyone is so afraid to die in this game.
---
Does Enforcer actually work against her? 
---
It's supposed to be an outright cripple when it happens, but I've never been able to see it through VATS.
---
I work, I make money. It's Great there coming. Give us the upper hand over the kids or adults who don't work (COOL)!!
---
Sorry didn't mean to offend I was only teasing most I've seen are actually good thumbnails
---
The More and Ash heap are probably fave areas.  Ash heap is like hell in earth.
---
And every now and then you can get raw fertiliser as a resource üòÇ
---
Not true, they saw use in a competition versus the auto miners
---
no pvp at all in adventure mode, not even workshops \[ make workshops timed ownership , 2 hour max, must stay on site, increase yields \]
---
If the WS respawns after a nuke, they have a chance to spawn. Almost all of them drop 1 and 2 star level 1s. Really weird.
---
How did you see someone else‚Äôs special?
---
Also once she's on the ground, put a few shells into each limb and she'll be a lot easier to headshot and won't beat up your bloodied melee guys.
---
The big adds are also very vulnerable to Enforcer. Deathclaws, yao guais, mirelurk queens. Not sure if you can do much to the scorpions but shoot them anyway.
---
It‚Äôs perfect for solo imo. Adventure is for teams and trades.
---
Server stability is very suspect. I already get lag and occasional disconnects (not to mention frame rate drops) with a normal, non-nuked Whitespring that has multiple players inside.  I wonder if their servers and my Nvidia card can handle a player "village."
---
Would like to point out an awesome yt-video called Murder Church if you missed it :-)
---
Yeap I do this. Also helpful for double XP weekends.
---
Seriously, if we don‚Äôt eventually get the glass walls from the contraptions workshop dlc I am going to burn down a Taco Bell.
---
What platform is this?
---
If you just want pie there's some on the roof of WestTek.
---
Like everyone else has said, people will definitely show up. One thing that hasn't been mentioned is that after you complete the final task in the silo, the robot announcer says "all systems nominal" and no more robots spawn. 
---
This means you can stand in the launch area for as long as you want, scan the map for high level players, send them a 5 minute "heads up" message (assuming you're on a console), and if you're in a party it gives your teammates time to head back to their camps for repairs and whatnot.
---
yep we can see them at the gree house too
---
Lol. My initial reaction to you was "You're not the boss of me, Dad!" Good luck with being a keyboard dick. You're off to a great start.
---
Cap is on base value only.  Equipment and other effects can be used to raise stats above 15.
---
In a video. Never thought about it at the time cause I was just starting my 1st character and wasn't aware of the lvl 50 special cap. Now i cant find the video in question which is why im asking here.
---
yeah those won't be droppable.
---
Some screens have a dot you can turn on and off.
---
I'm old school and have had a physical dot on my screen since CODMW1.
---
All the regions are nice, although some of the  savage divide area near the cranberry bog is so nice
---
But i didnt move my camp box device doodad
---
Finally a supportive father figure.
---
Nice. I was trying that for about an hour in Watoga a few days ago. no joy! I did get one in f04 though.
---
You were tripping man there is no way to get all specials to 15 unless your talking about seeing a screenshot of someone's pop boy with the specials boosted from unyielding armor.
---
Probably by being in teams. Too bad most people leave. Id love to be in a longer term team and use those perks.
---
ive played with my character after the game released and still havent managed to discover certain thing even when my camp is next to said location
---
FWIW, that spot is fine, but I agree with the top comment on that thread and prefer to put the fissure at the very edge of the drop zone at the 5 o'clock position. That way forward station delta is outside the zone and it leaves much more of the nuke zone inside the boundary of the map so you can gather a lot more violet flux.
---
Same
---
That is an awesome idea!
---
Well we aren't talking about IRL eggs, we're talking about a video game. If you get 99.9999% 1\*s off of 3\* mobs, why the heck not joke about getting 3\*s off of 1\* mobs.
---
If you saw it in the perk card screen you either saw it wrong or they are hacking the hell out of something. 
---
If you saw it on their stats screen in the pipboy, there are a few ways to spike your special stats. Unyielding armor and a low HP will seriously increase all of them except endurance.
---
One of my camps that was set up near Morgantown was always under attack from scorched and scorchbeasts. Moved it near vault 76 and now no problems except the occasional radstag. My guess is its location based
---
Agreed.
---
Ha. Well, it‚Äôs all about the realities of operating street retail. If the vendor buys an item at 100 caps and sells at 100 caps, he won‚Äôt be able to afford rent for 20+ years (even through a nuclear fallout) ;)
---
Its a great little gun for pvp with the right *s. Its not the greatest, but in survival where people are running with less aid Ive gotten a few kills with my suppressors firerate gamma. Would recommend a melee teammate to help though. Goes smoother when they have to worry about radaway and stimpacks.
---
Yeah i know about mules. I never cobsidered making one even tho i'm 600 hours in. As for the prices. Since there's a cap at 25 i've never really considered anything above that. Let alone the fact that nothing in the game is so rare to justify such a huge out of ordinary price.
---
Mothman was explained in game? I missed it.
---
Also, I still don't have a solid explaination for the interloper. Yeah, he's related to the Dunwich Borer and building from Fo3 and 4 and maybe Cabot, but I'm still confused.
---
They murdered people and replaced them with machines. They left morally neutral behind, rushed past criminal and into fully evil the moment they decided they could kill and replace civilians, just because they were living somewhere else.
---
But that ruins the current design paradigm of the perk cards and makes these a confusing exception
---
This reminds me of stuff like [https://imgur.com/q9x2M98](https://imgur.com/q9x2M98)
---
The Grafton monster escaped from WestTec pre war and was spotted. Thus, he's on the magazine and radio.
---
Who's charging rent in a free state? Better question, who's trying to collect it!
---
This is the same thing with trapper armor, but for farming legendary effects, it‚Äôs much better because it only spawns one variant.
---
With other armors, you have to play a much more risky game of chance to get light armor.
---
I personally like trapper because it has very high radiation resistance. I don‚Äôt get too much heat my way in terms of bullets, so the environment is my biggest enemy.
---
Whenever I make the top 3 I always message the other two, letting them know that a hit squad is coming for us and do they want to team up Butch and Sundance style and go out guns blazing together.
---
A piece of rock would be more effective in WV wilds kid. That things projectile travels slower than a snail. And even if it was hitscan, it would only be useful against humans which Appalachia lacks.
---
Out of arguments already? Thats just sad...
---
For real.
---
The big problem with purchasable repair kits is that, from now on, junk, condition, and degradation rates will be accounting decisions as well as game balance decisions.
---
From now on, any time any of those are changed, people will always have to wonder if it was to adjust something game wise, or if the Atom shop was missing its projected income.
---
It will become a trust issue with mechanic adjustment.  In some ways, it might be better if they just straight sold legendary weapons and armor in the shop. (I Am Not actually suggesting that as an idea, but it's happening anyway and Farmers and eBay aren't creating new game content. )
---
May I suggest a mask.  There are several in game that would hide your 'punchable' face.  
---
We here at QoL industries, while concerned about a player's health, are not responsible for their general punchability, tendency to bleed, or accidental death/dismemberment through explosive encounters.  
---
Now get out there and craft some ammo!
---
Unyielding gear with lots of precious life giving radiation is what you're looking for.
---
Same!!!   She's come such a long way.. level 55 now, couldn't be more proud -- she used to only be able to handle more like the old side scrolling game -- fallout 4 was her first actual 3D world, just prepping for this one :)
---
This. Some people already think a level 40 legendary with nice effects is trash. But the base damage difference can be really negligible. So unless you‚Äôre multiplying with various other effects, that couple points difference in base damage may not really bother you.
---
Doesn't mean we shouldn't keep putting pressure on them. And I fully intend to, politely, but with frequency.
---
auto stim procs revenant?
---
No offense taken, it's just a common thing. A lot of people don't understand how damn hard it is to make a good thumbnail. You're trying to tell a story in a single picture that will entice people to watch your video, when your video is next to 20 others covering the exact same thing. And I can tell you, Say what you like about Juicehead's content, but his thumbnails are really damn good. Same goes for MxR, pre 'sKYrIM GoNE SEXSHUAL" content. His Fallout 4 MXR Mods intro was amazing as well. I've learned a lot by example from MXR, Oxhorn, Juicehead, and a few others, when it comes to thumbnails. My content is nothing like theirs though (I do tutorials and regular let's plays). And I stay as far away from sensationalism as possible.
---
NA or EU?
---
I RP as a raider, but I refuse to engage with other players unless they  come at me first. My characterbloves chems and crude weapons but stays to themselves 90% of the time
---
So it's another Gatorclaw. Sad.
---
They are raiders. So we will do it for free. Message me on Xbox gt:LordRazumdar
---
Dude they exposed people to FEV
---
read patch notes, theyve changed how weight works.
---
r/market76
---
Thank you! A mask is just what I needed. I have been trying to pick up the paperbags left on the floor, but there seems to be a bug where they disappear from my inventory before I can equip them.
---
That's why we are giving them ideas so they can make the needed adjustments when it happens. We are the voice of the community.
---
Every comment both positive and negative gives them better clarity.
---
If you didn‚Äôt move it, then yeah, idk. But moving those boxes definitely causes this message, so just keep that in mind in future builds. Getting that error message after you‚Äôve put hours into building a camp sucks!
---
If you can login you aren't banned.
---
There is an absolute weight limit in game of 1500 that makes it so you cannot trade or drop items from that character.
---
Thank God I bought a suppressed one. These numbers are depressing
---
If you are more than 1500 lbs over your non-overencumbered weight, you can no longer transfer or drop items. You have to destroy them. This was from a couple patches ago to hopefully get rid of dupes but non-dupers definitely got caught in it. Just choose what you don‚Äôt need and destroy it.
---
I've not tried it but apparently if you use a NV scope and run a red tac light on PA, it gives you clear view of targets at night. I've not tried it yet.  I have plans for NV scopes, for the weapons I use, might have to do some experimenting.
---
Well, learning how to make the guns also helps you learn to mod them.  You can mod the legendary weapons, so there's good reason to know the plans.  I also use it for crafting stuff for people lower level before they get to 50.  Once at 50, anything dropped with a legendary effect is generally preferred.
---
Looks like Kodak Portra to me. Bet you're excited for the working cameras coming! (I am!)
---
Nope. I‚Äôm the same way
---
just gotta delete stuff until you are below the limit. they nerfed mules patches ago.
---
Thanks dude. Did you skip agi?  I figured that would be crucial for VATS builds. 
---
I wonder if there are any Chance to stagger rifles out there. That might help you with the Sentinels. 
---
I ended up playing a sneaker archer (rifleman) for my first toon, but was a little disappointed. I wasn't very focused with special points and perks, so I think it could be a lot better. 
---
Ended up making a shotgun melee guy that I enjoy a lot more.
---
I agree, I just don't know any other ways to make money.
---
I have the one carry perk for aid weight, that's helped quite a bit.
---
Your max non-overencumbered weight plus 1500 but yeah, this.
---
THIS
---
This is what I thought might be happening. Great information.
---
that could be the wolfenstien cyber pilot VR game we have heard about
---
Crickets,  Mole rats and those freakin Bloodsuckers. Stingwings?
---
Wow. How was I able to get her over the weight? She's sitting at 1726 right now and she literally only has 3* gear...FML
---
Being a cannibal makes you raider scum? Don't tell my brothers of steel about my culinary habits and I won't call you filthy, deal?
---
Possible with an unyielding build, chems, etc.
---
That was funny tbh. What does your build look like?
---
How was it Ultima did it? A daily fee to maintain the vendor and that was that? 
---
So will it be caps per day or atoms per day to run them?
---
&gt; How was I able to get her over the weight?

Too much Salisbury Steak??? :) /s

---
This is when it happened. It‚Äôs not a flat 1500, it‚Äôs your max weight + 1500 so you probably have around 200 as your max weight.
---
Pacifist on for sure. Lob a Molotov or a few if needed. Use a Tesla if possible. Just tag and step aside if other players are around. Don‚Äôt slink around getting headshots in a nuke zone (that‚Äôs silly). If you wanna be a nice player, tag and pass along. Maybe even team up with randoms to share perks. 
---
Of course, if you don‚Äôt want to be a nice player, it sounds like you perfectly described ‚Äòthat annoying guy‚Äô in WS.
---
Ugh, my bad. I have 1 piece of life saving. Not autostim. Life saving does in fact proc revenant and stacks % chance with mysterious savior.
---
Did you move some perk cards around for weapon/armor weight reduction?  Maybe try equipping Excavator armor if you haven't already
---
um, yeah....  i'm a different person than the one you started shit with for no reason
---
i understand, logical thinking is hard, its not for everyone.
---
Isn‚Äôt it in appliances?
---
Not long now until we can trap over encumbered people in our camps...  
---
That was the reason they could be destroyed wasnt it? so people didnt trap other players?
---
If this allows for legendary bone clubs we might just have a new best 2h melee weapon, which would be pretty cool
---
Damn thanks for the answers. Welp I'm done with this game lol. Thx
---
Witcher 3 invented night vision
---
Bless your heart...
---
you just keep telling yourself that kiddo
---
When I found those I imagined someone trying to get in and accidentally flopping themselves off the building.
---
You weigh to much. Start destroying items till you get to weight.
---
So when you have 3 char sitting around 20k caps each... and someone sells something, that you want... are you gonna flex your caps? Absolutely. Why not?
---
we should be able to make nuka grenades where one of the components is putting mentats in it
---
You can carry 1500 + your base weight, jump into some escalator PA and you will be able to push this up slightly .. but you need to be under max weight to transfer anything. So you not banned, but you can't move stuff craft or anything. The idiots at Bethesda thought this was a good idea on how to deal with dupers while affecting the rest of us that are legit overweight. It's a bandaid fix and very frustrating, but it is what it is ..
---
Yep, i fully agree. There is a lot of great potential with that update when it comes, and I'm just hoping that they take it in the right direction. It will be especially helpful, because I'm a self-made vendor in the wastelands, and sometimes it is a pain to have to get around to meet people (I can't fast-travel due to weight). Not to mention, there is probably still a significant amount of players that aren't on any type of online trading forum, so the potential to sell to others should increase exponentially.
---
Imagine if you had to actually use it like you have to eat and drink... game changer!...ha!
---
Done with the game because you don‚Äôt want to delete a couple items? Ok well. Can I have your stuff? üòÇ
---
And what happened with that experiment? The lead scientist fled and is in hiding. The lab is closed up and all their research scrubbed. They clearly knew they were in the wrong, they give you access to the FEV lab after all, it's not like they were trying to hide it. I think Virgil is more complicit then most give him credit for. He can be convinced to kill himself out of guilt. Is that the actions of a misunderstood scientist? What about the Institute trying to organize the Commonwealth Provisional Government? What about Shaun releasing you? What about Shaun setting up Kellog for you to get revenge on him? What about the assassination on the raiders at Libertalia? I'm not arguing they're the good guys. They did more than a few fucked up things before Shaun took over. I'm arguing that an Institute/Minutemen Alliance under the leadership of the General is the best way forward. The Brotherhood wants to genocide people based on speculation they may be a synth, the railroad throws caution to the wind in order to protect synths and has no interest in governing the commonwealth. Yes they did a lot of fucked up things in the name of science but it's the only ending that doesn't doom the future of humanity
---
My guess is that it will be very similar, if not identical to, the Creation Club backpacks from FO4.
---
I had rad roaches for the first time there!
---
Sir, you can at least fill flatwoods/charleston/whitesprings stations so people in need could get them without getting raped by batshit crazy proctectrons and assaultrons
---
And you are a person who starts shit for no reason.
---
Nah they just blocked off certain areas close to landmarks, I doubt anything will be put there, it's lame, last 3 of my camps plus my purifiers and crops because of it. I had it happen at the cliffs at WhiteSpring, Near Camden and Flatwoods ..

In Por Ylem!

In agi I have action boy maxed, and one point in something else that's non-essential. Action boy is 100% necessary.
---
Yeah I was just transferring my fully modded t51 armor because I just powerleveled 2 new toons to 50+ over the double xp weekend. Now I'll need to destroy the whole set I just transferred. I'm pretty much done with the game at this point. Coming up on 900 hrs and this is just utter shit.
---
You can actually take out rad scorpion TAILS with Enforcer. Do this.

Real Skins that should be in the Atom Shop sometime.

Patience grasshopper.

Gonna go stop some muggers with a giant turtle there?
---
Hunter vs Hunted radio. It‚Äôs a way to PvP
---
Yes, higher luck stat increases odds, I got one during the BETA, still sits in my inventory as an emergency ration.
---
So you want to remove empath too huh? Lol
---
How are you liking this build? you were experimenting-- still like it?
---
I'm about to hit level 50, might try this out on my respec. I'm a melee player but want to have the ability to reach out and touch someone too, so this combo of melee and ranged armor-piercing seems good. I also get tired of stressing about fusion cores, so I like going without PA for the most part.
---
If I had to pick a place to live from any video game, it would most likely be the wastelands of fo76 as well! Just love the game!!

For someone who lives in a tiny home. This would be greaaaat
---
So I see this often- why would you think he'd go to survival?  A griefer is not a pvp'er. Pvp'ers are not griefers. 
---
People who want to PvP will go to survival mode. People who want to grief will avoid survival and find people in adv. mode to harass. 
---
It'll get better when Beth extends pacifist mode to CAMPS, they'll still lurk around trying to get newbies who don't know better than to not shoot back, and people with workshops.
---
There are some prebuilt log cabins you can find on the Eastside of the map some of them are unmarked locations where you can set up a camp, my camp used to be and one of them where are you found out about a place in Whitesprings golf course which is a little more defendable and isn't located right next to a super mutant base and has robots defending your home
---
I found the pooch.  cute guy looks sad and lonely .   next to him are two skeletons with a rope for a leach maybe? and a empty dog bowl and a sit down cooking station.

So sad .. would love to have him as a friend.

If you're strong enough to run Uranium Fever you can accumulate enough crap in 10 minutes to wipe out every vendor in the game. Your pricing may vary based on CHA/perks, but for me glowing blood sells for 7 caps, glowing meat steaks sell for 10, combat shotguns, missile launchers, and assault rifles sell for 25-35 depending on condition, double barrels sell for 20-30, etc. I also end up with 40-60 black titanium scrap that I sell to get those last few caps from a vendor when he doesn't have enough to buy any weapons.
---
Note that for this to be less of a pain in the ass it's handy to have at least 300-400lbs of available space in your stash, because you're going to walk out of the mine with 800+ lbs of crap. Having perks you can swap in to reduce weapon weight is also helpful, especially level 3 skeet shooter (-90% shotgun weight), Bear Arms (-90% heavy weapon weight), and Thru hiker (-90% food weight).
---
* Do the event, then walk down the hill and clean out Whitesprings Station (starting with the missile launchers and assault rifles).
---
* Walk down the road to the bunker and clean out Modus, again prioritizing the heaviest stuff. Stash/drop useless crap until you're underweight.
---
* Travel to Harper's Ferry and clean him out.  
---
* Travel to Watoga Station, sell stuff, and grab as much as you can out of your stash while staying underweight. 
---
* Walk up to Phoenix and empty his caps.
---
* Travel to the vault to save money, and from there head to Morgantown Station and Sutton to complete the circuit.
---
I wish there was a way to get more instead of one per server at Whitespring. Let us be able to brew Nukas!!!
---
Nope haven't touched any cards. And cant eat or drink anything. And she's only lvl 15 so cant is excavator. I'm just screwed pretty much.
---
Meh, just server hop to free yourself.
---
Were you in PA when you do the transfer, you can still jump into PA to transfer it back to yourself or do some maintenance, that's what I have to do, I am hovering around 1600-1700 around my main. Dump stuff you don't care about like ammo, aids etc. I also us things like the batteries perk to lower my current weight, carrying a lot of fusion cores .. you just need to watch your weight. I can't even begin to tell you how frustrated I am with this design decision affecting regular players. Clearly the devs don't play the game to have put this in place while restricting stash limits, it's pathetic .. not ready to give up, but it is annoying af

If getting immersed in Fallout 76 is sad, consider me The Cure.

Has anyone found the key to this safe yet?  OR any more info about this safe and note?
---
Done because I've been dealing with bullshit since launch and I just wanted to give my new toon some new gear and I gotta delete it now.
---
Thanks for the replies and advice y'all!
---
Ah. Alright. Thanks so much. Only Just hit level 8. May not participate in this then. Lol
---
Depends on Stars.  Energy guns shred unyielding and sentinel unyielding builds.
---
Not really the point though isit, you could just as easily server hop to be away from someone destroying your CAMP, but its inconvenient
---
Yeah, you're just going to have to shed the heaviest, and least valuable items until your weight is down enough
---
Or at least make the hud in power armor different depending on the type
---
I say we could push the sugestion for bethesda. Like, if you have perk cards that doesn't affect the combat ballance, your caracter might just use it, without spending special points.   
---
The lodout mod seems interesting. I'll look at it.
---
I avoid the traintrack between Watoga and the flooded trainyard because these little bastards spawn there so often.
---
Seriously? The last 2 releases of FO, I figured they were always broken... Never meant to actually give you something... I still went up to every one and clicked it... Now I expect to get one.
---
Nuka cola bottling plant had a special t51 with white &amp; red nuka cola paint and it gave +2 (or +3, i dont remember) and i used it for a while.
---
Getting trapped in a base seems much less likely to happen than getting your base smashed. Seems like a fair tradeoff to me...
---
yep! Personally I think WS is a horrible location for this. that area is laggy as it is, and it will only get worse if everyone on the server is constantly fast traveling, and server hopping to and from the area to do all of their vender selling. There are in game locations with literally nothing happening at all. Most of the upper section of the map comes to mind.
---
I'll try to move some cards or something but looks like I'll have to delete my power armor set.
---
Best/cleanest toilet I've seen was actually at Yellow Sandy's Still of all places. Was shocked so much I came back to find this post.

Ditto to this though it's more like 5-10k for me.

Crucial, insignificant.

Lots of people roleplaying as raiders. üôÑ
---
In seriousness, yeah there's a '76 roleplay subreddit. Not been a lot of interest, but I'd be up for it on XB1.
---
Haha, I‚Äôm level 141 and I don‚Äôt either. The thing is I‚Äôve only ever seen it get up to 2/4. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been in a server where they‚Äôve gotten the full 4 players to make it work.
---
Nope it just says "you can activate it elsewhere" this is the only thing we know ...
---
Not saying I dont agree, just pointing out the the whole reason behind being able to destroy other CAMPs was so they couldnt trap you, it could be as easy as walking into someones house and they close the door on you
---
It seems like the community managers have been told not to engage on this subject. They'll either just go through with it, or they'll address it in a post is my guess.
---
Imagined if they added in factions and it would only feed factions. Not only would the food plant work this way, all ammo and other workshops too.
---
Gotcha! I've sold dozens of these, will have to hold on to the next one I see
---
Mysterious savior + Revenant - why have I not thought of this?!?!
---
Friends, prepare for the KAMIKAZE BUILD!!!!!!
---
You still can. Just pick a few things that aren‚Äôt amazing and delete them. I‚Äôm sure that 1700 lbs isn‚Äôt all stuff that you can‚Äôt bear to get rid of.
---
Put gear into a stash ?
---
All they had to do is give us a universal mission accomplished like they do when you nuke the SBQ. That way people know why they are getting food.
---
HOLY CRAP I ONLY HAD TO DELETE 2 3* GUNS!!! Thank to everyone for commenting.
---
I've done this with a gauss rifle that a friend built and gifted me. Thats a huge waste of scrap since you dont get much back. I think if you favorite an item it should remove it from the scrapping menu. That and bringing back custom weapon naming.
---
Actually, you shouldn't do that.  They're here doing a job, and if they even *know* what the answer to your question might be (and it's likely they don't have that answer), they will be told what they can and can't talk about.
---
You constantly trying to get them to respond to something they're not going to talk about will, at beast, help drive them away.
---
I had to build on a junkpile next to a highway.  They never prepared us for this in the vault.
---
... what exactly about Furious is key here, though? You‚Äôre relying on the 50% crit secondary. Furious isn‚Äôt really doing anything special for you there. Might as well use an Assassin‚Äôs or a Mutant‚Äôs, they‚Äôd have pretty much the same effect.

We need prettier walls!

I'm 30 'kiddo'. FYI calling people kiddo makes you look like a fucktard.
---
I've never found a tse in the wild. Do they even drop anymore?? I half wonder if they stealth nerfed those.
---
Their damage output is insane... they're like flightless cazadors, and you'd think that would make them less scary but really it just means they don't even have wings you can cripple...
---
Is your stash box full? I‚Äôm guessing yes but that could reduce you by 800 pounds
---
Deleted 3 weapons so im good now. Thanks for your help
---
I'm kind of hoping they don't show over outfits. Otherwise my Field Scribe Armor is going to look messed up. 
---
I hope you have an option to turn off the display of the backpack.
---
I'd rather it come down to having to trust your host than having to trust all your visitors.

I imagine that somebody at Bethesda really wants to make them 100% ballistic fiber‚Äîand watch us all run around like idiots trying to make nylon backpacks.

Deleted some stuff and it's fixed now thx for the help

What do you mean? You don't think the robot vendors are going to be able to sell all six of the civil war top hats that I sold them each and every day?

I love Wallace though. I wish he had more dialog because every bit of it is gold.
---
I have great time before they start kiling nuke zones loot i didint care about some issue game crashing etc.. But know pffff.... Fallout is still broken game from the technical side... how you can recomend someone something what is broken and you dont have any more fun from this....
---
Doesn't really matter if you don't see the need for it. They do, so they are.
---
I only look for Power Armor. There are other Datamine's for other items. /u/Heartwork420 is usually pretty quick at uploading anything new from the Atom Shop textures after patches.
---
If you were even a little into building stuff at settlements in FO4, I think it is absolutely worth it. The joy of getting to actually show people around my hard work and have them react in real-time (versus like...posting a youtube tour no one will ever look at) is so gratifying...and the game really lets you get creative if you know what you're doing/how the system works.
---
If you're just in it for the story, the story kinda sucks tbh. The atmosphere and the exploring is great though if that's more your bag!

That's Nuka Dark.

Plus side we get DLC tomorrow

I've figured out it was the fire cracker berries but that right there explains why I can't seem to walk over skeletons ever. Thank you for inadvertantly answering another question of mine
---
They murdered innocent people. 
---
The Brotherhood of Steel doesn't murderer innocent living humans. Let alone even ghouls.
---
They only kill those that are a threat to the human race. 
---
Super mutants, the institute, the railroad who valued synthetic robots before human life. 
---
The institute and railroad disregard human life for the sake of robots.

Gauss is weird, ammo is energy, damage is ballistic

Don‚Äôt make it a safe zone, but make it so that anyone who attacks anyone is immediately incinerated by turrets and guards

Is in not a 10 percent chance to get it with ten luck and you have 7/8 of a pie? I‚Äôm impressed.

wow, i kinda feel sorry for you, so much anger... oh well, my life is great so enjoy your hate filled psuedo-life.  btw, you are now blocked so i wont have the absolute pleasure of reading even more of your profanity laced nonsense.

I agree, but if it's an option that bypasses the bug, then I'm still glad for the suggestion. One of our party members does our locks and hacks, so it wouldn't have been a problem.

I'm just glad this is an option and not the whole game. I have the same type of exhilarating experiences as OP when I play survival but it's so nice to take a breather to tool around in adventure after.

There should be a speed bonus when needing to run to the crapper and perception should be high knowing where to run! Haha!
---
I have even left the silo, went to my base, picked up equipment I forgot and ran back through and made the launch
---
Location, location, location. This is why it‚Äôs essential to build a camp where there is virtually no foot traffic.
---
i use firecracker berries to fast travel with my mule since respawning on a friend is free
---
Looks like a mutated sheep/porcupine..
---
Is that how those stamens end up in my inventory? Huh.
---
No.  Nuka Dark is the three different stat boosts.  And all of the special colas are available on global cooldown per cell load, so if you leave buy them at White Springs, then come back again an hour and half later (I believe the cooldown is still 90 min), there should be more again.
---
man that is just some sad-tier trolling, i'm sure you can come up with something better instead of just repeating what i already said? ill wait right here and make a sandwich while you think about it
---
3star items are supposed to be rare. If 3stars had guaranteed 3star items they would just make spawn less 3star enemies. The outcome would probably be the same. 
---
There are too many "entitled" grinders here who think if you spend a certain amount of time in the game you are entitled to have this and that. They will always complain if they don't get what they want.
---
Yes! 1 pound for a plastic tiny bobble head doesn't make sense. They probably did this for balance reasons but i still think it should be removed.

Todd, if yer reading this....Make it happen !!!
---
Or craft it using that serum and a radaway or something
---
Yeah I know, but time to kill is super low, when players have say 150 health and my build does 300dmg but a bloodied top Tier build does 600dmg it dosnt make a huge difference to me. End result is whoever I'm shooting at likely dies in 1 to 2 shots.
---
There's 2 port-a-diners in Watoga. I make the bot run through there often enough to check 2-20 times. 
---
I have 12 base luck, at 20 with armor bonuses
---
I finally got a gun (lvl 190) that had bullets explode...not a TSE...a black powder rifle lvl 25...im an unarmed build. Thanks i guess after all this time?
---
Load Enforcer 3 and go for the cripple and stagger effects on  the Queen.   If you have an explosive shotgun, run Demo Expert and Grenadier as well, and use those to assist against adds when Queen is airborne.
---
Paladin Merrak and company stand on the side of Maxson with nukes in general. Nukes need to be contained by the Brotherhood and out of the hands of the wastelanders. I don't care if my company and I must set up forward camps at the elevators, preventing their use is important.
---
However, Prime comes with its own caveat...letting the SBs continue to fester will create an incredible danger for the wasteland. Mitigation of this danger is vital to our survival.
---
I blew my friends mind a few weeks ago, she got me playing the game, but didnt know about the soda fountain

No more bird bones for you falling man...

https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b95hq2/to_the_guys_who_obliterated_my_camp_today/?utm_source=reddit-android I was also just thinking about this story I read the other day....
---
Lurker here and I agree. I would love to be able to hop back in and have a great time with the Mrs. But nothing I've seen makes me think that will happen any time soon. I have more money then time right now and have 0 desire to play a game that's artificially grindy to try and squeeze a couple bucks out of me.

I have to discover Bog Town, despite the fact that I have claimed it numerous times and even gotten weekly/daily challenges for doing so

I didn't use either of those, but went with Immersive Gameplay. Synths become god damn terrifying when they actually start using flanking maneuvers.

Yes, I‚Äôve been roleplaying as a shopkeeper for a while now. I spend my days claiming workshops for plans, seeking other plans in various places, and resell them below suggested prices (or for free in many cases). My philosophy is everyone should have an amazing looking camp and I want to help facilitate that.
---
I work in an ever evolving, pig shaped store I‚Äôve perfected over the months, complete with filled up store shelves, a vendor window, decorated bathroom with decon shower, and a back office. It ain‚Äôt much but it‚Äôs honest work. [Here‚Äôs my latest shop showcase](https://youtu.be/t8xWgjxnc0U)
---
Not before destroying half your camp. A lot easier for the overencumbered guy
---
Do you find you run into issues with the typically high energy resist alot of mobs are sporting?
---
I try to venture around and collect everything before I head back. My stash box is of mostly items I want to sell so badly.
---
CAMP radios will play after placing, but need to wait for the next song to sync in the play order.  Usually it takes less than a minute if you come in mid-song.
---
Nicely put sir.
---
The first time we drove to Florida from Wisconsin, we went through Birmingham to meet a few fellow guild-mates (we ran a WoW guild at the time on... I think Fizzcrank. May have been Area 51).    
---
The first place we stopped in Alabama for gas, they had an ice chest of single bud lights, 99c each, with the sign "Take one for the road!".  That was a culture shock lol.
---
Then again, I know of southerners who walked into northern grocery stores (or gas stations now...) and are amazed you can buy hard liquor 7 days a week at a convenience store.
---
When you're at Walmart and tell your 4 year old they can't get a new toy.
---
They're about to implement pay-to-win repair kits.
---
Don't buy it
---
I disagree.  If they can't respond, then that is something their management should know is also not acceptable.  They should be providing *something* as a response, the total absence of response while happily chatting about how people were thrilled to get a pie from a machine is essentially insulting.  That's going to drive **US** away as customers.
---
There is actually a ton of lore in this game- probably double of fallout 4 if you compare apples to oranges in terms of voiced to the text based notes...
---
What they did better in this game is adding the environmental additions- so whatever the story is in a location, there are often little things they‚Äôve added to the space to further show what happened but you gotta look for them
---
I‚Äôm .... 900 hours in I think?  I gotta check again and I still find new things every play through
---
Best advice is just wander because the main quest line moves you with an eye towards level progression not enjoyment of the game
---
Maybe you were milking it wrong...lol (only kidding...)
---
Idk. Never found one. Always found them seperate. But with the upcoming legendary vendor people are going to try and roll their 2-3 star guns into tse's
---
I believe that would be a good idea. Always thought about because of all the other camps and cabins you see in the game.
---
Not just teenagers I saw a guy that was 150 grieving a level 18 and a level 5 Saturday. I heard him talking to his kids in the background. Soon as he finally attacked me I lit him up and disappeared. Screw people like that doesn‚Äôt have the balls to go on pvp.
---
Sure or just make all of them add to carry weight, be upgradeable, and the only difference is aesthetic.
---
No problem!  Glad I could assist.  Firecracker berries contribute some, but sometimes you are nowhere near them and take damage.
---
Ya. Curious to see how that works. I've found lots of two shots, four explosive and never a tse anything in all my travels.
---
"clearly knew they were in the wrong"
---
no, the ONE GUY THEY HAD DOING IT knew it was wrong. FATHER insisted the experiments continue despite zero purpose and progress being made. they shut it down because he trashed the place before leaving and left messages about how wrong it was and they wanted to keep it quiet (Li will be pissed Father kept what happened from everyone), not because "oh shit this is morally bad to do."
---
So they fixed it and then unfixed it.... for reals we had.... 3 weeks where crashes all but disappeared ! It was glorious
---
Ugh...cazadors.....makes me sick
---
They drop. I got a level 35 TSE 50 cal maybe a month ago.
---
ok good. Check out the batteries perk if you carry lots of fashion, fusion cores carried on you go from 3 pounds to 0.3 pounds, I am carrying around 90 on me at the moment .. strong back, tru hiker etc, make a huge difference. My base weight is around 550lbs, so technically I can car round around 2000 lbs, mostly weapons, aids, and ammo .. there is a ammo perk in strength as well. Drop stuff like mini nukes, that grenade ammo, also check how many grenades and mine you carrying, you can manage. Of course if you jump out of your pa, you need to be at a manageable weight to craft as my mains are the main crafters. I have 10 accounts across 2 xboxes, but my other 8 characters I try keep under weight so they can fast travel.
---
Free to play games are beter quality and you dont risk nothing
---
Yeah, waited and waited. Very slowly ticking. At least 3-5 minutes. The timer disappeared and said audio said we (when I did it with a group) didn't complete, but then it completed. It was weird. Yesterday solo, it at least filled up before the timer ran out, but I was curious since everything had been sealed/repaired, I'm not sure what would have happened since there was nothing to actually do. That was with reactor repairs. I had actually restarted it prior to it even saying that it was complete (even though the bar was full).
---
With the cores, at least there isn't a timer attached to it.
---
Pope i love that mod- but it was conflicting  too much with my 150 other mods ( my problem ) that I wound up taking everything they did in that mod and replicated using really base line modding like Mad Gods
---
Always a bittersweet moment...
---
i know this refers to the vampire hunter movie but there‚Äôs also a cheaply made film called abraham lincoln vs. zombies, or something like that, that takes place in savannah georgia and it just fits so well with this idea lol
---
Nice pics, like the T-shirt!
---
I participated in a full game once, like 6/4 or something. It's pretty boring, everyone is picked off one by one until two are left to fight. I got second place though so cool
---
Oooooow I love that mod!!  I used it forever until I had too many conflicts and went with more basic mods but that is an all encompassing wonderful overhaul mod
---
I have only found them alone as one stars. Currently using the best ones as staple weapons until I find a better 2-3 star variant of the same weapon with the legendary combo i need
---
I imagine it'll come eventually, but honestly, if they're as crap as the mobs we fight anything less than the Sentry Bot they'll just be constantly requiring rebuilding.
---
&gt;whats should i expect then
---
Expect that either today or tomorrow a Bethesda employee will publish a blog post outlining the changes being implemented in the patch.  The tweet probably got deleted because it was premature, whether that means that player vending was ultimately pushed back or not we won't know until the patch notes are made public.
---
Which is pretty much how every studio handles updates.
---
Those bunkers don‚Äôt build themselves. Free doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äòfree‚Äô
---
Shear Terror. New quest new mob.
---
It causes it to land way more than normal. On normal scorch beasts it causes them to land and stay down usually.
---
Maybe they finally fixed the Grognak's Axe so you can repair it to 200%. I hope so, but probably not.
---
I think it might be CAMP damage from players not being a thing anymore?
---
A mod did make a post about the whole kit situation. They know we've spoken out about it and therefore know what the community doesn't want in the Shop. If they responded to even a majority of posts about the kits, that's all they'd be talking about right now. That's not ok as they have other concerns to address as well and other people to give time to. We'll see what happens tomorrow.
---
I‚Äôll be so disappointed, player vending is the only feature im really waiting for
---
At least cat eye potions
---
I actually got one the other day after a good 200 hours
---
I poke each one I pass by and eventually got one lol
---
Sheepsquatch questline and vendor boys from all factions with a combined cap pool at white springs resort.
---
Most of the people I met are reporting nice findings from this week. Mine is a cavalier leg.
---
If the CMs aren't involved in the decision making (which they are almost guaranteed not to be), they have no way to know what the thought currently is regarding the feature (or much of anything else).  They're told what they can talk about.  They may know more than that, just from (maybe?) being in physical proximity to the people that will be deciding this.  But that doesn't change their job, leave them out of this.
---
Complain to their handlers (OK, you can ask *them* to complain to their handlers), but there's literally nothing to be gained by hounding the CMs about this.
---
That is awesome! üëçüëç
---
Probably the resources you lose rebuilding everything.
---
What I dont understand is why somebody would destroy your camp?  Do they get XP for it or something?,
---
Bethesda only responds to weight issues if you mail the  actual physical item. Source; bobby-pins
---
How does it work? Do you have pips of the other players on the map or like area circles where they might be?
---
Coming with the Legendary Vendor i presume.
---
It seems to be the result of a whitespring post-nuke normalization.  I‚Äôve had lvl 30ish tread using protectrons there before.  Those guys are no joke!
---
Solved the prob by deleting 3 weapons. It's just weird how the game let me go over the limit. I'm good now though thankfully. Thanks for commenting
---
Sweet roll
---
I love cheesy Zombie Flicks I'll have to look for this
---
Im 1200 pounds over carry limit. Gotta wait until player vending meh
---
I've never thought of doing that. Do the robots in the earlier segments respawn, or is the place completely empty?
---
I wanna die
---
I will do that. Thank you.
---
Do we even know we'll be able to display bobbleheads and magazines and not just junk items?
---
But hey we get repair kits. Best band-aid ever.(Not really)
---
Or the radscorpions.  2x L68s cornered me in the gazebo last week.  Took a while to get out....
---
Mostly to get to me... I'm pretty consistantly in the top 3 due to my tendency to avoid other player like the have the plague. I guess that sweet sweet cap reward is worth the bounty that they get for destroying camp items
---
*cries in 1200pounds overencumbered*
---
I'm slowly trekking my 800 pounds over the limit alt character to whitesprings. Should take a couple hours.
---
Not sure if you read the inside the vault page but they delayed player vending till early may
---
You get a bounty which helps them farm people for caps. It also makes the player who built the camp to get killed trying to stop the dick head.
---
That‚Äôs incredible! Bonus points for Gunship too üôÇ
---
I changed my mind, you can keep those.
---
MarcoPasta add me up boss. I‚Äôm on EST and on around 9pm everyday.
---
Awesome!! Right now you spawn outside the doors. If you could have them change it to the lobby that would be amazing!! And....make it free so the low levels can mingle and purchase goods as well!! üëç
---
Indeed. RIP Mako.
---
I read that. It changes my opinion 0%. People complain because this game isn't what they want it to be; those people should go play another game. That particular person should try Minecraft or some other non violent game.
---
It's as if the kid doesn't realize the Atomic Shop is already very profitable. How can it not be when they charge TWENTY DOLLARS for a power armor paint? Do people not realize some of the stuff in the store costs as much as what the game is worth now? (and nobody give me the bs "you can earn atoms in game" argument. 200-300 atoms a week isn't enough to keep up with new releases to the shop, ESPECIALLY if they're going to start selling 1 time use items to drain people's wallets.)
---
I did read it, thats why i made the post. But i was just wondering why they deleted it
---
i swear i get better and more loot when im in a team of 4 people  as opposed to by myself
---
I think that's next month. The dungeon drops on Apr.16th I believe.
---
I still havent eaten mine
---
I would be happy if the port-a-crapper I just built at my camp didn't come pre-filled.
---
Yes there is.
---
*A response.*
---
They need to know and take back to their handlers that the user base expects a response and not radio silence.  It can not be left to go unanswered.  This breaks the most fundamental promise from day 1 of the game, and those of us who have stuck with them *deserve a response!*
---
It seems to come in spurts....ill get great 3 start stuff for a day...the back to crappy 1 and 2 star even from the queen
---
I'm going to use that for everything that sucks now. "actual buns" XD
---
I don't know how they get in there actually
---
different branch, different rules. Lyons focused more on protecting people from mutants than gathering technology, and Arthur Maxson in FO4 was doing stuff that would make his ancestor Roger roll in his grave. the Mojave branch was so stubborn in their isolationist ways they can potentially die out.
---
Taggerdy knew Roger Maxson wouldn't want to use nukes, but with nearly everyone dead anyway she decided to try so that at least the scorchbeasts would die.
---
honestly, given the holotapes and the personal history with Roger Maxson and Taggerdy, 76 has what i consider the most interesting depiction of the BoS yet. Without the 80 to 200 or so years for Maxson's message and intentions to be warped and misinterpreted, and Taggerdy being a close friend, she tried to uphold his ideals to the letter. just a shame a bunch of giant bat monsters killed almost everyone forcing her to say "sorry roger, we need the nukes."
---
Idk I think you should play however you want.
---
This.
---
Honestly, I thought it'd have been funny if the Nuka Dark recipe requirement included a piece of plastic.  Because I think that'd have been hilarious.
---
Unless someone build a base on top of the substation, killing the spawn point
---
I thought people said it already did? or was it that it will?
---
How have they not added hockey sticks yet? Or have I missed them? I found 1 spear in the game and haven't found another since. I feel like there are some rare drops of random crap out there.
---
One of the first legendary weapons I looted (L20 vampire machete) came from a non-legendary ghoul in WS.
---
 IDK if it was diseased or not - was too busy fighiting to notice :)
---
As long as you aren't hostile, you can fast travel away from my CAMP (in most cases), but I can't "fast travel" my camp without storing it. That's the only argument I have for your given situation.
---
Ah okay
---
It's probably reserved for future content
---
There is no shelf life, its for lack of a better word perfect
---
How long are you loading screens. If they are 1 minute or more you will probably get closer to 20-30 seconds with an SSD.
---
If our loading screens are already 30-40 seconds then its probably not worth the upgrade.
---
But yes if your loading screens are longer than 60 seconds you will notice a difference. If you have between 30-40 seconds thats already pretty good. And upgrading then wouldnt be worth it.
---
The last time you logged in, did you move the camp box item itself? It seems like some people are saying that can cause this.
---
No-ones ever going to ask for their opinion so they have to throw it out online randomly
---
Yea, I noticed this as well and fixed it buy just running ta 30%, problem solved.  I attribute it to lag spikes, I've seen my meters  delay a stimpack 5-15 seconds before so I assume the reverse is true.   Your not gonna do noticeable less damage at 30% and 19%.
---
Datamined.... people seem to think this is all a guarantee. It's not.
---
A response is expected.  The lack of response is .. concerning.  But hey, good to know that Luck impacts your chance to get a pie from the machine!  Amiright????
---
Did you try it?
---
Now that is an idea... What if we could have a system / something to specifically draw out certain enemies?  
---
As you say, we could have a bio-luminescence spotlight or strobe that consumed a resource, but while it's going there is a chance of spawning Mothman.  A beacon antenna you could set up to try to attract a flatwoods monster.   maybe even a scorch beast lure.
---
Everything I drop is way to high level for people that can't get around Watoga.
---
I think they‚Äôre 29 caps for me with hard bargain 3 and charisma of 8
---
Yes. Fuck me.
---
I think one guy said it probably premature or accidental they would most likely make an announcement if it was delayed further
---
Nope if I get the sneak crits pouring in with Gun Fu, don't even have to charge the rifle. For some reason I constantly keep missing Scorched Beasts in VATS though, so I just ignore them.
---
How old are you?
---
Will do.
---
They are probably getting ready for the dungeon update, which I believe is tomorrow.
---
You know, that port-a-diner on the roof in Morgantown is where I got *my* first one too!
---
Congrats, btw
---
I enjoy it but the caps loss is punishing. I hate losing 300 plus caps by getting popped by some jack ass spawn camping.
---
I'm thinking/guessing based upon how the brewing and fermenting benches work, that any items in your vending will still take up space in your stash. I'd be surprised if they gave us more space just for the vending.
---
You don't *deserve* a response.  You may have been promised one, you certainly want one.  But the CMs aren't the ones responsible for it, they're doing their job.  If the handlers want radio silence, that's what the CMs will give, until told otherwise.
---
Take your righteous indignation somewhere where it will do some good.  This isn't the place.
---
Coud just make damage done by another player free to repair
---
That would be amazing! Especially for end game stuff to get resources and better weapons and armor
---
When was the last time you played? It was rolled out with the last update IIRC
---
Weird
---
Have you repaired a decontamination shower? Getting stable flux sucks. On top of that, most players don't want to something again once they put a lot of work into it. Going out to find specific resources is a pain after doing it the first time. All because someone got bored and decided to screw with someone.
---
He‚Äôs absolutely awesome. Him, Graham, Mr Gutsys and more have great dialog. I was doing a Messenger event in the Mire the other day when the messenger bot spotted a Mirelurk Queen and got all aggro. He yelled ‚ÄòFor Queen and country!!!‚Äô And charged right at her as I slowly backed away.  Also fought a Super Mutant who joked that a mole rat hits harder than me. 
---
For a game ‚Äúwithout NPCs‚Äù I sure enjoy the dialogue.
---
I saw an updated slide for wild Appalachia that showed player vending on May 7th. Whether that still stands or not I have no idea
---
Did you read my whole comment? Lmao
---
We are on the same page, dude.
---
my banker character feels you. he is a nightmare to be on because I have to manage inventory all the time and no fast travel. well atleast 90% of my banker stash is 3* so just hoping I can make something good of it when legendary vendor comes.
---
I know it's not technically a region, but I love the flooded Charleston area, the Summerville lake, and the surrounding area. It deserves to be it's own biome.b
---
I didn‚Äôt even think about that... wow, thanks for opening my eyes lol gotta create a mule account then
---
I know you can't brew nuka grape, but I think you can brew nuka dark at the brewing workbench. I haven't unlocked it yet so I could be wrong.
---
Forest by far. Savage divide a distant 2nd.
---
It‚Äôs not a sales tax‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs just the vending price vs the trade value. I can assure you that you‚Äôll get the full value of whatever your list your item as.
---
What have you been buying with those atoms? But they do need to fix this, so many simple challenges that ive done still sit unfinished. Its a small thing but its a very annoying thing.
---
I finally got mine in Watoga over the the weekend. I always use one when I see one and I remember thinking "should I bother going over to that one", as it was slightly out of my way, but I relented and did and gasped when it pick it up. Sucks that you don't unlock a challenge or anything.
---
No they quite informing us. Oh yeah player vending got moved to may....
---
Well i just got too much toxic waste and lead in my inventory
---
That would be awesome! Especially for end game. That way you could get better loot
---
Hopefully, they also delay or nix the repair kits in the atom shop..or at least put out a statement about it rather than just have it as a line item in the patch notes..like a whole paragraph.
---
My gf and I rp privately in setting with OCs through messages, but I haven't done any digging to find actual groups since FO4 and I'm still new to really using discord so that's not been utilized at all.
---
In terms of gaming and rping, I like playing as a Minuteman/First Responder/Mysterious Stranger. I'm not into pvp, but I love jumping in to help someone fight an npc and then continue about my business. Secretly why I keep a flare gun, but I just had a silly idea to make them and give them out despite them not being useful in game to call for help. Mostly I struggle to know how to be effective in pvp, otherwise I'd also love to stop griefers or people playing as raiders from attacking other folks.
---
But the wiki says he was made on Oct. 23...
---
Nevermind, not going there
---
That's insane.
---
Like 4 hours ago.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs a pain. I hope they fix that because it‚Äôs super limiting to basically have to keep that camp box in one place.
---
Sort by new
---
Whaaaat. Thanks for telling me man
---
Only after they fix the Gauss Rifle
---
From a lore perspective, it would seem that the surviving BOS members did the nuclear option, AND it did have a significant impact on future events.
---
 In such that Vault 76 survivors were able to address it, by the path laid out by the BOS Appalachia members and it would appear the scorched are at least contained to WV.
---
Depending on how future events play out, in future fallout RPG games, the scorched should be eradicated. 
---
But who knows how they will 'update' the lore... 
---
I am just hypothesizing...
---
Player vending was confirmed last week as delayed til may 9th
---
I was in the middle of nowhere. Picked it precisely for that reason. Side of a  hill... not in the direct path of any two map locations. Only resource around is wood. 
---
I moved it after this of course... but same conditions apply. out of the way, Can't a draw a direct line through it or near it between any two map locations, and nothing of value nearby.
---
If they could comment they would. Just let it go for now, man. It's a video game. Relax.
---
Yep it was in this previous edition of inside the vault, there will be racks for weapons and display cases for bobbleheads. Magazines weren‚Äôt specifically confirmed but if there‚Äôs weapon racks I would imagine there would be a magazine display rack too, here‚Äôs the link: https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5FHUmuwQCzz21mQ0fKAbKe/inside-the-vault-welcome-to-wild-appalachia
---
I‚Äôm tempted lol
---
Savage Divide is my favorite. Which is a weird choice. But my camp is there and I like the locations within it.
---
I use that mission as a game clock to see my total played time
---
Why not make it obvious that you are not friendly?
---
Who knows if I'm right, I just figured that is the way they would do it. Since you got a while until player vending might as well with the mule!
---
Getting a Legendary out of every Legendary mob is still broken, despite them 'patching' it. I had a similar result last night.
---
Yeah, I know. Sometimes, in conversation... people agree, and that becomes the direction of the conversation. Not every conversation needs to be a debate, dude.
---
I'm hoping for a few versions of the backpack tbh
---
At the base level, adding a 10-20 bonus to carry weight then it can branch out from there.
---
A "heavy duty" of sorts that reduces weapon weight by 50% and adds either +1 to Strength or Perception (player choice) would be a great option for the players that basically run right into the fight. It'd also free up space for other things, like stimpaks. Poor little me with my five cards I'm using to benefit my powerfist can't afford Travelling Pharmacy, so the extra space for stims would be great. Or...
---
A "team medic/support" pack and adds +1 to intelligence or charisma (again, player choice). All chem weight is reduced by 90% carry as many stims, radaways, or whatever as you need. With the added space, they can carry an extra weapon or two and more ammo. 
---
"The Hoarder" reduces junk and ammo weight by 75% and adds +1 to Strength would be perfect for running around and looting or being the ammo carrier for the team.
---
But these are all off the top of my head. Though I talked a lot about team play, I tried to keep all functional both in teams and alone. Some might find extra charisma useful for farming caps, for example. I'm sure whatever they do, you can have more than one backpack and use each to play a different role. That would be fun.
---
Slightly off topic but how do I get it to say Brotherhood by the side of my name?
---
Still broken.
---
Oh sweet!
---
Old enough. What's it matter to you?
---
I guess that makes since. But still, outside of the flux I have zero problems getting mats. I guess I'm just in the minority on this one
---
Just take pvp and put it in survival, I'm sick of losing my claimed workshops to higher and lower levels then i am because no matter what i try they can easily kill me.  If I want to Workshop someone else has I'll just go to a different server
---
You started this, you bring nothing into this discussion, except for pseudo adult language that is supposed to insult me, get lost or proof my original statement wrong... you know this one: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bamk87/how\_fallout\_76\_should\_be\_played/ekdpi4d?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bamk87/how_fallout_76_should_be_played/ekdpi4d?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

Crickets don't strike fear like they did in Fallout 4 survival where they would glance your way and you'd just ragdoll, but they are easily as powerful as a level 91 deathclaw and that's sad for Deathclaws. How far they've fallen since Old Olney..
---
Oh my goodness.  I hardly play now since I've been so busy moving to a new country and wedding planning but when I was playing, I could not for the life of me figure out where I was getting random food from!
---
It was sometimes other foods too.
---
You just solved a huge mystery for me, haha.
---
That means you farm a lot. Most people don't like to play farming simulator
---
Eh... it's another 20% multiplier with Nerd Rage, and I think it's like 20% more on bloodied between 29% vs 19%. The thresholds are at 19%, 29%, 39%, 49%, 59% IIRC. They changed it a bit last patch. Adrenal also helps. To me it's very noticeable. It adds up to like a 40% damage loss. The deaths happen pretty rarely, and dying doesn't really have a huge downside - I lose like 2 mins running to loot and continue the run I was doing. And it's not an issue outside of nuke zones. It only happens in nukes.
---
I for one would like this. Upvoted for that "cabin in the woods" feel.
---
Sounds awesome. And wait- you as a level 9 have a level 99 some stimpacks?  They prob have hundreds. Did they at least give you some purified water or something in return?
---
I love the flare idea! I role played last year as Father Shadow, a preacher that was out to save Appalachia from the sinners and demons.
---
I even started preaching about the 76 commandments whilst spreading the word of the almighty father.
---
I set up a twitter account for the character @father_shadow and I was also featured in Euro gamers article: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.eurogamer.net/amp/2018-12-05-how-fallout-76-players-are-role-playing-in-a-game-that-doesnt-support-it
---
Which was cool. I was kind of hoping after a while more people would be role playing.
---
My camp is a true camp in survival. No walls and I tuck it in some rocks, take stuff out of storage when I need it and that's it.
---
I'd have loved to see some slightly lower level ghouls on my visit with a level 8 scrub.  It took forever killing a level 62 ghoul with a level 5 weapon lol.  Perched on the wall just in front of the train station.
---
&gt;explain why you downvote
---
You whinged about downvotes.
---
When it's inevitable (and with my other strength/melee character) at a workshop, or someone just refuses to relent in their harassment. I usually emote confusion, til they get close... and then power attack that first "retaliation" strike. Advantage goes to me. and they either have to attack and hope for the upper hand, or waste time healing, in which case, I still have the advantage.
---
A heavy sledgehammer power attack does wonders to solve arguments.
---
You're wrong and you're being a bit a of a duck about it. You're concerns and comments are not rude and they are well written and they are also justified. But you are making it seem like these community reps know the information and are getting off on being withholding. 
---
They would obviously respond if they could. You want an answer so bad, contact them via the Bethesda site, or some other means. Commenting on every single community rep comment asking about repair kits isnt going to do anything at all, unfortunately.
---
I've been lucky to avoid getting hit.  Thank marsupial and some AI bugging.  I know they have a shit ton of health, but is their damage that bad?
---
It‚Äôd be cool to modify the signal, to lure certain enemy types. You could use it to farm or just for fun. Have it tied to intelligence and luck or maybe certain crafting materials. Heck, make it summon the traveling super mutant.
---
This is me speculating, but it would make sense if this exact feature is what's pushing back Player Vending.
---
Since about level 60 (107 now), my camp has been in the same spot just outside Watoga.  I have no defenses, no locked anything, a full farm,  multiple water purifiers, all the crafting stations, and a junk generator, all open and free to the public. I have yet to be griefed even once. I think it's because low level players are just happy to have made it so far away from Vault 76 without dying, and most high level players who roam the Cranberry Bog aren't trolls.
---
There is one fireplace that‚Äôs kind of log cabiny, not much though
---
I‚Äôm pretty certain they‚Äôve been preparing for future updates.
---
I agree, I saw someone suggest a diner. I think diner tables/chairs and walls/roofs
---
I recently found a Instigating Crossbow that does double damage (base 75 x 2) on full health targets. Its fun to use it as a way to take out sentries then you can retrieve the bolt after moving in.
---
1 TB SSD is about $150. It will definitely feel faster too. When a SSD dies, all the data will go poof. Make sure you do backups if you don't want to start all over.
---
SSD can help but it depends on the ssd.  Ido how they affect a ps4 but PCs do make a difference on the grade of SSD
---
Lol my wife and I had the exact same thought. This seems like it would be way more difficult to implement and QA than Player Vending. It's gonna be such a game changer for us!
---
Perhaps someone else was also doing the quest, and they completed it? I do that quest on the regular and it's always worked for me.
---
My only issue with it is that I reflexively break the fertilizer bags down as junk :(
---
But that's my own stupidity :)
---
Lucky hole mine is a good spot
---
SBQ isn't bad. I can tank a hit or two from her with my bloodied build while sitting at 19% HP, not a problem. But those Glowing Crickets? They one shot me. And god forbid if you have music playing while you tediously pick the 200-300 raw violet flux from the nuke zone and don't hear them coming, because they will murder you over and over.
---
I laughed at a guy one time when a cricket gibbed him in a nuke zone. "Holy crickets!" I said with a laugh. Then it one shot me too.
---
they made changes to the game to combat duping, if you character is above the newer MAX carry limit you must delete stuff before you can buy/sell/transfer anything. weight reduction perks can help. but if you are at like 900,000 pounds nothing will help. you also cannot accept caps from anyone until the weight issue is resolved
---
the Max carry limit is 1.5K over your unencumbered carry weight. so if you have 300 carry weight, your max is 18K
---
Marsupial crippled to the max
---
I love how a beth employee that most likely has nothing to do with the atomic shop, makes a comment about a new wall style, and they get flooded with replies about the atomic shop repair kits.
---
What buffs does it give?
---
I explained why those weren't possible and then he claims "lag switch" which is just ridiculous. Cry me a river when I say someone's claims are outlandish.
---
or remove lockable doors, but leave lockable objects.
---
Get the brahmin pen. He‚Äôs my dog for now.
---
Go back to the sims

ü§ì
---
It's like the yellowish circles on quests where you have to search an area, indicating where some of the players might be without giving the actual location to you.
---
The brotherhood in 4 is modeled after Germany in the 1930s lmao. A giant Zeppelin, a charismatic leader, blind loyalty and a literal cult following, fashy haircuts, presenting their enemies as less than humans, advocating literal genocide against the synths as well as ghouls, not to mention they invaded land that wasn't theirs in an effort to wipe out an enemy who posed no threat to them. The brotherhood lost its good guy status after Sarah Lyons died. Downvote me all you want, the BoS in 4 aren't the good guys. The only morally good faction is the Minutemen. The best faction to restore the world is The Institute. 
---
My ancestors are smiling at me Imperial, can you say the same?
---
I thought it was weird to. He was at like, 5% health, and I dropped a couple stims, which he picked up, used, and emoted a heart at me for. So I assume he was out.
---
Thank you!! Obviously had to buy one when visiting haha!!
---
Yeah making like a trailer park camp could be really awesome. I also saw like a diner set with tables,chairs, walls and roofs
---
Go into a nuke zone, harvest the appropriate raw flux and other required ingredients and then go to a chemistry workbench. Convert it to pure flux there.
---
Don't wait too long though, otherwise the raw flux will turn to inert flux. Then it becomes useless.
---
10 raw flux + 1 glowing mass + 1 hardened mass + 1 high radiation fluids = 1 stable flux
---
Going to need to launch at least a couple nukes to get all the various colors.
---
Only difficult thing with this is it becomes quite difficult to aim when enemies get up close, and especially dangerous if you are using explosive.
---
Also I've noticed issues where you hit walls or fences you are near even if it looks like it isn't in front of you. Hard to judge in third person. Works fine for open space though.
---
It does but just build in settings on my Fuji xt10 no outside editing :D for sure though!!
---
I've gotten maybe 10 shielded drops, and I got maybe 10-15 initiate paints before they discontinued that (sold a bunch, gave a few away) and now am making my way through the new paints.  I've got all the way through officer's learned.  I've also stopped learning them until I get a second copy to drop so I can have a spare to sell (waiting for my second paladin to drop so I can learn one).  So it looks like its just bad luck.
---
man you seem like a sad person, commenting like this in a video game forum
---
are you always this angry and judgmental? 
---
you might want to talk with your physician at your next check up
---
That‚Äôs pretty cool in theory but as you said, it does sound a bit shallow. A full server doing it could be interesting though.
---
Yea I understand the different multipliers and without this turning into a who has go the biggest "weapon" reply, if your not killing as near effective at 30% than you are at 9% then your doing something wrong.   Other than maybe a Mirlurk  Queen, the damage your putting out at 30% is more than enough IMO.  Again, I don't know your build but I also run a PA and non-PA bloodied build at level 231 and have just adjusted my game to avoid this from happening.  The few times it did happen I was in the BOG and for some reason finding your bag full of raw flux can be a pain in the ass there.  I agree it's an issue, just not a game breaking issue.
---
Suggestion, before doing as the others said:
---
Get all of your non flux items for crafting ready first, then far your raw flux, when you have enough, go craft and don't wait.
---
The kind of guy that kills you out of nowhere with a on oppressor mk2, then instantly goes into passive mode tu3 second you get your oppressor.
---
I love playing the Fallout games, but I would NOT want to live there. Think about it. Think about a radscorpion, or feral ghoul, or deathclaw attacking you IRL. Stimpacks can heal you from the brink of death, but you'd still feel horrendous pain.
---
No air conditioning.
---
No working vehicles.
---
Have to eat radiated, mutated animals to survive.
---
No new TV shows or movies, and no time to watch them.
---
Extremely limited video games (what you can play on your pip boy).
---
Super Mutants that want to literally tear you apart and eat you. That enjoy torturing humans.
---
No. Just no.
---
Are our photo galleries growing? I love taking pictures of the easter eggs - it's a personal quest of mine. But, I'm running out of room. Also, as of now I'm not sure we can share pictures.
---
Yeah but your customizations are limited. I would like to create my own special cabin
---
You need glowing mass, hardened mass and high radiation fluid. Ten of whichever nuked flora you want to make stable. Go to the chemistry and you'll be able to make one stable flux. Rinse and repeat üëç
---
We drove past and I had to turn around and go see what the heck we drove past hahah it was amazing!! I took so many photos there. The line was huge for the food but got some really nice photos at least it's crazy there but so fun!! 
---
I feel you!!
---
Feed the people used to. Everyone would get canned meat or something. There were loads of posts about ghosts giving out food. It was a bug. It got fixed. This probably will too. 
---
I think it made sense with feed the people... if you completed the quest, you literally fed all the people. Seemed clever.
---
there's actually a perma spawn on top of watoga.
---
I have always believed that the Brotherhood would be ready to use the technology we have preserved in the event of a threat to humanity itself. The responsibilities we have saddled ourselves with cut both ways. We say we are preserving this technology to save humanity from itself. I say we must also accept the corollary that we are qualified to use this technology to preserve humanity from an equal or greater threat. I believe that the scorched plague is such a threat, and that Taggerdy's unit exhausted all conventional means of eliminating it.
---
I saw a diner set suggested below. Maybe something like that or white spring sets?
---
Just play adventure mode... lol
---
Yeah I think it is really fitting
---
Surprised they used them- figured maybe they were running a bloodied build.
---
I already sold the combat rifle, and I‚Äôm not interested in selling my TSE handmade
---
Hopefully they‚Äôll make CAMPs invulnerable to player attacks before it drops so we don‚Äôt attract the high level griefers to level our CAMPs
---
Don't forget Green thumb for double yield when harvesting, good with salt so it spoils slower and then switch super duper when crafting.
---
I fixed mine by turning off my tv setting called overscan
---
Finally got the Knight plan. I'm not sure this is really the cause but I started turning in two Technical Data plans at a time. So it was about another 10 runs after I started doing that. Probably pure coincidence though.
---
Dont ignore holotapes or notes. Lore is decent.
---
Cool, don't play it. You do not need to enjoy it for others to enjoy it. Why should their enjoyment be taken away?
---
Everything above level 56 has the same opportunities besides time spent farming for legendaries. Even that can be transferred from an alt account or bought.
---
"Good" build. Everybody thinks they have a good build... That's why they built that way...
---
True, the reason I liked mine so much easier because it had a Commit Wacker inside of it
---
I am on the PC and would love a BOS shielded plan.
---
of course, why haven't I thought of this?! :P I even have the rank3 of butcher's bounty but always forgotten about it and just server-hopped instead :P
---
beat me to it. LOL!
---
üé∂ Almost heaven. Wood log cabin. üé∂
---
Present evidence of your claims that father had knowledge and tried to cover it up outside of what Virgil tells you? They readily give you access to it, wouldn't they hide it if they were ashamed of it? Also they made lots of progress including a fucking cure for it. The super Mutants in the Commonwealth all originate from the institutes experiments, how is that not progress? LITERALLY the only cure for FEV in the Fallout universe was made by the Institute. I'm not arguing it's moral, I'm arguing it was ultimately beneficial. They had the resources to cure FEV and instead of taking it over the brotherhood chose to destroy it out of their own misplaced sense of justice and genocidal lusts.
---
I‚Äôve gotten 5 of the shielded plans, multiples of all the outfits, and one Initiate paint.  I received the Initiate paint several months ago and not gotten any additional paint plans.
---
It increases and decreases as people leave , look at the sign and walk backwards you‚Äôll see if flip to 0
---
That‚Äôs the whole point, it‚Äôs just a facetious post. It‚Äôs absurd that 3* legendaries don‚Äôt drop 3* items, so why not flip it around? It‚Äôs just as absurd.
---
Hes running a bloodied build that's why his health was low, probably. But still rude that was good of you to at least think about it and try to help him out.
---
Exactly this! We didn't even have this feature in Fallout 4, you had to mod it in. 
---
Imagine having to measure exactly how much bullshit people will want to fill their C.A.M.P. with (myself included), and then measure how much that strains the engine, and then have to figure out how that scales if everyone builds their C.A.M.P.s as close together as possible. 
---
QA is alllll about stress testing and defeating the nastiest of bugs under the worst circumstances possible. Fallout 76 is a ludicrous game as part of its darkly satirical tone, so people (myself included) want to do ludicrous things in this weird, rated-R playground.
---
Remember the cheese wheels?
---
An extra month of fine-tuning makes a lot of sense, though I'm unsure if it bodes well or not. A well-timed delay can get you a product on par with Resident Evil 2, my favorite sequel. 
---
A well-timed delay can also be the equivalent of an extra ten minutes of doing CPR, with no effect, long after resuscitation had become impossible. Like a Daikatana, or Duke Nukem Forever.
---
I'm guessing it'll be closer to RE2 than DNF. I'm more concerned about the Repair Kits at the moment.
---
you have one post in this forum... the rest are all in fuckboy forums. 
---
Piss off, troll.
---
Last time I checked you can even drop your camp at Vault 51 but that will probably get changed soon enough. Surprised to see it wasn‚Äôt earmarked as unusable already
---
It‚Äôs your character. I‚Äôve been there for nearly a month farming. It climbs up the more who are there. The highest I‚Äôve seen it go is 11 after a SBQ battle. 
---
My question is how are there 900+ bots there? I can kill around 20-25 in one street run. Where are the others.
---
Sounds like you got fucked hard. Go back to care bear mode and never come back.
---
Define good build, a good PVE build won't be good for PVP. And your level doesn't mean anything. I am level 60 in survival and I tear people apart. I don't go on survival with my PVE guy and expect to win. We prepare and we spec our build right for PVP and we deserve to kill everyone that comes in unprepared. I love how all you can conclude is people buying duped weapons online. Ever heard of trade discord and subreddits? Maybe if you didn't have your head so far up your ass you might stand a chance.
---
I have a SSD on my PC but that thing is a hand me down dinosaur so I dont game on it. Going on 10 years old from when I got it and my brother used it before that.
---
It was already nerfed from 90% to 60%. I don't think they're planning another nerf.
---
Blue log cabin, Shenandoah log cabin
---
P2w is largely subjective as a result the arbitrary line has to be drawn somewhere for consumer clarity, and after battlefront2 that line was made abundantly clear. ANYTHING this isn't purely cosmetic is pay to win. Accept no compromises.
---
On my first encounter I wasted all my shotgun ammo and died a couple of times. Later I found out they are pretty easy to deal with using melee weapons. Ranged weapons require good aim and that‚Äôs nearly impossible with those jumpy fickers.
---
I've got the Nuka Dark recipe, you can definitely brew it.
---
Like have them weigh less when on display? Or just weigh nothing when on display, that would actually make more sense.
---
oh :(
---
Also they did try to form the Commonwealth Provisional Government but it ultimately failed out of mistrust. Something a Minuteman/Institute Alliance would fix
---
Change your flair on the homepage.
---
Awesome!!
---
It is unbalanced but it's the mode I play most now, only found a few unkillables
---
If your on ps4 I randomly run around and drop care packages for new players but it's hard to get them to accept because thier always running and hiding like thier about to be killed,which is understandable since it happens a lot.
---
Great idea üëç
---
I like this system. No PVP at workshops and two hour exclusive use. After 2 hours anyone can take over workshop - or you can team up. Like the idea of increased yield for staying in workshop. I recommended something similar on another thread.
---
They have a perk for destroying camps...
---
I think people sell stuff and never inspect the items. I found a troubleshooters sentinel chest piece at the bot in Watoga as well.
---
I agree with your diagnosis, but as long as it doesn't consume too many development resources for PvP to exist, I don't object to it existing as a separate mode.   
---
The Assassin legendary effect is silly. Meaningless trash for PvE and overly powerful treasure for PvP. It's not balanced for either mode.
---
I still think you prefer the nice conflict free experience the sims has to offer
---
I agree with this üíØ. I enjoy survival mode but the top 3 for longest alive is a bad mechanic. Almost all other encounters I have are fun, you win some, you lose some. Sometimes they see legit awesome battles. However when your number is up might as well suicide because some twinkee out lvl 200 is coming for you with laser focus and super op gear.
---
Yeah no worries! I did the same thing until I read someone else‚Äôs comment here a couple weeks back.
---
Have you ever heard the tragedy of mama dolces food processing plant?
---
I have a spot just outside Watoga as well. been there about 3 weeks I think. I've had a couple of "your base is under attack" pop-ups but they I think it was from people who were using my stuff and mob spawned(it's right next to a location with enemies) and hurt a couple things. each time i jump over there to check on it only a fence or a single turret were damaged and nothing else.
---
But I did have a group of 3 dickweeds, levels 100+, who showed up in full power armor while I was crafting. I gave little wave and then they just started destroying everything. I just ignored them and continued crafting. Then when I was done, I repaired everything, gave them a wave and logged off.
---
Logs are old there, older than the trees.
---
I am a shotgunner and I do just that, I shoot her wings to make her land and then I will help keep her on the ground by shooting her while there. I also take care of crowd control on the ground to keep the "adds" off the tanks who are Melee hitting her....
---
Sounds like you need a junk alt. ;)
---
I totally get where they're coming from though.  It's like when you steal your friends' fries--they always taste better that way.
---
There was a talking coat in New Vegas aswell, i'd like these too.
---
Yea a poster did a very nice and comprehensive comparison and found out leather is the best. And animal skins are everywhere so it‚Äôs really a great performer at low maintenance.
---
That's why I come back.
---
Pistols are a waste....
---
Sound like you'd like a easy mode where theres no pvp at all, no degradation, and no hunger/thirst. I'd prefer they came out with a mode like that instead of dumbing down the current game. People who complain about this game constantly really should just stick to fallout 4.
---
I‚Äôd be super into it if the characters were exclusive to survival mode (no more mode hopping!)
---
It takes time to farm those mats. Some of us play this game for an hour here or there, and don't get a lot of time with everything else going on for us. Put yourself in those shoes for a while. You spend your few hours a week, collecting mats. Then, next week, you spend a couple hours building... only to have some shitstain troll with no job, no friends, and no social life, that can dedicate 8 hours a night and 18 a day on weekends, destroy it all in seconds.
---
to you, it's a click and a fix. 
---
To others, like me, it's hours, and quite frankly, it's not fun.
---
American flag? More like the BoS flag!
---
I don't like stealth boys on all the time because they ruin a real stealth build. It actually negates all your stealth perks I noticed and you get about the same stealth as a naked chameleon. So you can see a guy using a stealthboy with high perception. You won't see my crouched character without berry mentats.
---
Gonna open up a bar once player vending goes live, Nuka Dark should be a good seller.  Just need to craft a ton more of those, my bottleneck at this point is Nuka Cola itself.  Takes 2 of them to craft one Nuka Dark, I've just about burned through my stash.  Need to find a good place to farm them.
---
I noticed some rooftop caps stashes in the area that had over 100 caps in them as well, on a different server.  I have no idea what's up with that.  I think I only have maybe 7 luck, and I typically only get maybe 15-20 caps per stash.
---
Yeah, I call bullshit too. Green cotton duck is NOT a rare resource.
---
&gt; You can't target what you can't see and people in Assassin's Sent/Cav or spamming stealth boys are much harder to kill.
---
Not wearing power armor changes this... how exactly?  All you're doing is pointing out that a build has disadvantages in certain circumstances.    That's true of every build in the game.   
---
Nothing you said changes the fact that you don't get max damage with heavy weapons if you aren't wearing power armor.
---
This would be great!
---
Responder (general) - Chems and food
---
Responder (firebreather) - Chems  and weapons (fire axe yo)
---
Free States - food and ammo
---
Raider - weapons and ammo; bonus gormet pack = food and weapons
---
Enclave - energy weapon ammo and chems
---
And I still think you type out your responses on reddit with your dick in one hand.
---
Whatever gets you off, son. You do you.
---
Those bloodied Ass/Sent players may think they're invulnerable, but then I hit them with my assassin's gamma gun and watch their last sliver of health turn to rads faster than they can cure themselves. 
---
Pretty much every build in the game can be countered if you know what you're up against.
---
"readily give you access to it" no, it was locked behind a door. you needed to either hack their way in or go through the back rooms. you know, the ones with laser turrets and an assaultron keeping you out?
---
and the evidence they covered it up, again, is Li. during the quest where you recruit her back to the brotherhood, you give her virgil's holotape about his escape plan, and she will be furious because father told her (and presumably everyone else not on the high council or whatever it's called) that virgil died in an accident. they lied about what really happened. also known as covering it up.
---
Free States backpack would only let you carry more tin foil hats so probably not worth it
---
Yup, I bought a lvl 45 3 star legendary cryolator that someone sold it for 275 caps.  I check it all the time now, lol.
---
A "raider" would RAID: get something out of the attack. Chems, water, food, caps, slaves, etc...If you want to roleplay as a raider, expending time and ammo for nothing just to be a nuisance is pointless. This person wasn't a raider, they were a griefer. And anyone tries that shit, just immediately log off. You have almost nothing to re-build, and they have a bounty other players will soon take out of their dead hide and their dropped scrap.
---
I haven't eaten mine yet, but I have to say I was completely surprised too.  I've been poking those machines for the past couple of weeks any time I see one, but only once.  This time I turned away to look in the other containers on that roof, and when I looked back, I noticed the pie was gone, so I checked the pickup slot to see if I had won.
---
NA
---
I think if they ranked the top three players that killed other players it would be ok. They need to remove the map markers for the top three and replace them with those map search circles they have on quests. It's just too easy to pin point locations right now and takes some of the mystery out of the search.
---
Having everyone lose their level times two in caps sucks as well. It's just a punishment for high level players. They should cap it at like 150.
---
Maybe I'm the wrong guy for this convo. I'd prefer lockable perks with the option to respec at every 50 levels. A "pick it and stick with it" system, similar to previous BethFO games.
---
I find the whole perk card thing makes "builds" irrelevant.
---
Almost heaven...
---
Agreed, I‚Äôve been trying to tell some of my friends that. If you‚Äôre the type that reads notes and combs through terminals you‚Äôll find plenty! It‚Äôs just not spoon fed to you through exposition
---
I'd like that!
---
If you're on xbox I'll sell you all the flux you need to build one for 30 caps each.
---
I find that the "move camp" option works great. 
---
*click*, and you're both standing in a field, while one of you is blowing their wad with no results.
---
Why almost?
---
I am suffering many crashes , when I use my pipboy or when I am in the queen's event I'm already tired
---
Isn‚Äôt WS the only place that has a bottle per server? I buy it from time to time, really wish there‚Äôs a wholesale place somewhere.
---
I frequent the establishment any time I visit the resort. My character has the perk to increase Nuka Cola's effectiveness. Works better than purified water for me.
---
Nothing worse than getting level 10 or 20 3 star legendaries.
---
Wall papers too! I'm tired of looking at plain wooden stuff.
---
TSE gatling gunner here. The lack of sight is annoying but unless you are at medium range or less the TS portion of it make it almost impossible to hit and is still far more preferable to use a Lever Action Rifle. Range of course is dependent on the size of what you are shooting at. 
---
I've got pretty good at learning where shots are going without the sight. Plus the steady stream of glowing bullets help. Since 5mm ammo is so abundant and it's fairly conservative on how much it shoots you can keep a steady stream going for quite some time
---
You know what? I'm really glad you said something! I hadn't thought I was removing my finger, but I caught it happening again, and your comment made me actually stop and think about what I was doing. 
---
Turns out, I actually do remove my finger, as if I'm burst firing to maintain accuracy! I tried firing off 250 rounds continuously after that, and sure enough, my gun fired every time! 
---
Thanks friend, I guess I can consider this issue solved! Or at least the mystery behind what was happening. :)
---
Also a lurker, also agree. I'm also the one in my social circle who 'knows what games are good', and we're on Division 2 as well. Smooth launch, acceptable lag, 2 crashes in 80 hours of gameplay, and the cosmetic shop is FOR COSMETICS. You can also pick up the very same cosmetics right in game. My opinion of "Fallout 76 sucks" is a death knell for 15 game sales. That actually does matter.
---
&gt;My question is how are there 900+ bots there?
---
Nano-bots crawling in your ears.
---
I like to lock my doors
---
It was supposed to be a Country Roads reference. XD
---
Those are vastly inflated numbers, probably stacking bobbleheads before that was fixed (and obviously before TSE was nerfed) to be honest. Bloodied IS very powerful, but those numbers are just stupid.
---
Oh. Lol. I'm dumb.
---
You can pick one perk card OR move one special point per level up.
---
Yes to both. At level 50 you can either pick a perk, or move 1 special
---
Seems fair
---
Nah, I "got ants in my pants". ;)
---
Pro tip for next time. Go to the control room, and then head out the door marked "Security." In the security office you'll find a keycard that gets you into the hazmat storage area as well as a terminal that you can use to create plant security credentials. Once you have the credentials you don't have to hack any of the terminals, you just log in and override the lock down to open the doors.
---
Id love to have the elevators from the contraption's workshop (Fallout 4) back. 2, 3 and 4 floor versions. also fix the segmenting floor buttons on it.. or just add new ones
---
After level 50, each level you can choose to either unlock another perk card OR move one special point around.
---
So you can re-disperse your SPECIAL points, at a rate of one point per level.
---
I think the majority of people on this sub making these suggestions are kids who just want Bethesda to give them free shit or they‚Äôll start complaining what an asshole Todd Howard is for not incorporating every little suggestion made.
---
I use it on my Bloodidd Rifle build and it helped me a lot.
---
I was under the impression anti-armor doesn't work on energy damage?
---
Level 130 here played since the beta. After level 50, every level up, you are given an option to either pick a new perk card, or move a single perk point.
---
I loved the music in that video :) awesome job.
---
Woah amazing shop dude. Love the ceiling fan flying platform too. So sexy.
---
Go make a post on /r/fo76bazaar and start unloading crap now.
---
So true.
---
But when they are removed workshops in adventure mode will be useless again.
---
They're spokespeople for the game.
---
If they don't like the fact they're being asked questions about the game and concerns the paying player base has, then .. maybe they're in the wrong line of work?
---
Shhhhh, don't say anything, they'll need it and then it will be a PITA to make super stimpals.
---
what we need is a lock on favorite weapons and armor so we dont accidentally drop it, and yes a log cabin would be super cool
---
I don't use the sights on any of my heavy guns, simply because they just don't work. I get more hits on target with all three heavy gun perks and stabilized perk then trying to get the sights to work.
---
Message sent. 
---
I'd love to see a screenshot of anyone nuking these wankers. 
---
Ta x
---
We do not need anything that doesn't currently exist.  So much still needs to be worked on before the game expands.
---
Didn't realize that but it makes sense.
---
In that case, I'm guessing it was what panickedthumb was referring to unless as others have stated it's in anticipation of tomorrow's  update.
---
definitely. one person built it that it would detect when they spawn in one of the rooms and start shooting. they didnt even have to do anything
---
That's funny. I was thinking the whole time "weird, they usually put in ways you can do quests but not have certain skills."
---
That's my guess, but it'd be nice to get a solid answer.  
---
Suppose our answer will be when it either is or isn't there come the patch tomorrow.
---
I'm sorry to provide the unpopular opinion on this, but your sample size is just way too small.  6 enemies.... "Almost always"? No.
---
I farm pretty much exclusively West-Tek. I can do a run in 3 or less min, and I nearly always find at least one 3* enemy.
---
At least one third of these drop 3* items. They're usually crap, but they DO drop them.
---
You mad bro?
---
Yes, but make it look like Lincoln Logs.
---
It was the only way to have mutually agreed PvP prior to survival mode. I played a few times in the early days, but it's kind of pointless now because anyone who wants to hunt players can log into survival and have 20+ targets to hunt.
---
That's more like it!
---
Have an updoot for being a good sport about it.
---
They fixed this in the last patch, it was in the patch notes....OH WAIT GUESS NOT
---
I've had one since I first started, I didn't know how rare they were so I just threw it in my stash
---
Yeah , that we need and a respec option.
---
Maybe it could house different type of Mole Miners?
---
I'm in.
---
Ha glad to be helpful! When I first got hold of a gatling in the game I thought I could shoot it like a rifle and burst a few shots whenever I want, turned out I missed a lot of shots because quite often when I removed my finger then immediately re-engaged, the gun didn‚Äôt go boom as I expected. It‚Äôs as if the action/animation had to kick in again which isn‚Äôt instant. After I realized that I just spray and pray and that worked beautifully üòÇ
---
Sometimes --SOMEtimes-- the mob will drop their legendary item into the game world. It's very rare but it can happen. So in that case search with your eyeballs around where he dropped and there may be a cool bit of legendary gear.
---
That 200 bounty better be in Survival...And I'm guessing someone put it on you because you blocked yourself into a place that is impossible to enter, thereby breaking how the game is supposed to work and pissing people off...
---
I want THAT Mothman statue in game!!!
---
That's pretty beast. What ingredients are required/where'd you get the recipe?
---
Exactly what I mean, like mole miner guards that stay near the queen, or a fallout new vegas thing like baby miners that if killed the queen goes on a killing frenzie and attacks and living NPC
---
FO4 Survivor is pretty tough early on, especially if you make the mistake of exploring te north east portion of the map early on(the number of Yaogui, DC's, Rad Scorpions and occasional Mire Lurk Queens can be painful, even with PA).  However, once you get into the 30's, depending on your build, you can start to level up pretty fast against human enemies and even Super Mutants if you can kill suiciders before they get to you.
---
I will say that with the recent nerf in 76 to food spoilage, hunger and thirst, it is a lot more challenging in that regard than Survivor in FO4.  The diseases are also far more frequent in 76, but that could just be because the bonus disease resist from END seems to be broken in 76.
---
I think my time to clear the story + Far Harbor + Automatron and all locations in Boston and The Island was 84 hours or so.  Managed to get to level 112 without ever dying, though I was close on many occasions.  I tried doing Nuka World on Survivor, cleared out most of the areas there as well, but I could stand having to sit through the monorail ride back into Nuka World every time, so I eventually had to switch to Very Hard.
---
Anyway, good luck and have fun.
---
Send a party invite
---
I don't remember what level I was, but a few months ago I was at the Overseer's CAMP in the Forest to drop off a few goodies in the Overseer's stash box for others. A trio came along, and the highest level of them started attacking me. I think with a melee weapon. I was basically able to constantly stay behind him as he spun, never being able to actually face me to get an attack off. It was actually pretty funny (to me). Something you might try if it happens again.
---
If the community feels negative about it then that is what should be seen all day every day.
---
This would make the current player base happy while making income to keep the game going. Doen't seem too bad also more income means more money to fix the problems. Seems like a win-win
---
That's where they're coming from.... Lol
---
Yeah it's me and my wife.
---
I'm glad we can post stuff like this.
---
I have been using ultracite ammo.  I just dont see 'Why' we have to adjust for something that is not working properly.
---
i mean 98% of the mobs are pretty dang easy now. The true fighting was levels 10-30, After that its gets progressively easier. But considering how the only thing to actually work for is  C.A.M.P. it would be a good side thing to do to keep players interested and work a little more to get and to maintain. Thats just me though, I just want more to the camp and not just re skins of the things already in place. But actually true features with a purpose.
---
Some items are
---
Maxed
---
Lvl at 45
---
[Perfectly Balanced](https://i.redd.it/a3ev8nfn5j911.jpg)
---
You still have some utility perks you have a lot of perception dedicated to lockpicking. The endurance perks for eating/drinking and  swimming could be swapped out for lifegiver during pvp, it'll give an extra 45 life which is equal to 9 endurance.  For charisma get tenderizer for the extra 5-7% damage and only swap in hard bargain when needed. 
---
What mutations are you running?  Class freak is really useful for getting some bonus special. It costs 3 luck though so you would need to swap in points. Either pulling from perception or intelligence would be my recommendation. If you have the perception just for the accuracy boost getting class freak and getting mutations could net more special bonuses. 
---
With bird bones, eagle eye, and marsupial yoi trade 2 str and 1 int, for 4 agility  (40ap) 4 perception, and 20 carry weight, big jumps, and less fall damage and +25% critical damage.  
---
You have some vats abilities but very low max AP. You'll want to boost it with mutations, legendary armor and/or underarmor.
---
Some Weapons come in increments of 5, some 10, and some 15. So some will come in through 5-50, some will come from 10-50 and some come 15-45
---
Why not do both? Multiple types, each with a few tiers.
---
When you looking to go? Psn is same u/ as here
---
Or since the new legendary vendor is friendly we could get a sorta mole miner city?
---
I notice this after the nuke fades away. Especially in the whitesprings club house. I seem to find level 1 diseased eyebots there. lol. Dropping a ton of level 1 legendaries. I pick them all up and scan the map for low levels to gift these to.
---
I wasn't sure if I could, but I ran out of shotgun ammo and didn't want to go to camp after the launch and I don't think I was attacked running back through, but I honestly don't remember (about 20 launches ago). I know all the doors were still open and the turrets were disabled or shot out and if there were any left in command, I never saw them. I have been killed before and had to run back through hostile robots, and that doesn't kick you from the quest, but that was the only time I ever FT'ed away and came back into the silo after completing the quest for prep.  My worse fear was some other player would come in and be able to use their key and launch before I got back.
---
People often have an emotional connection to their CAMP. Especially if they built something really unique. To see another person come up to the thing you worked hard on and take a giant crap all over it just because they‚Äôre bored doesn‚Äôt feel good. 
---
If it‚Äôs in Survival, I don‚Äôt think anybody cares. You know what you‚Äôre signing up for when you jump in there. In Adventure, the only reason to do it is to make people miserable.
---
Because he tried to prevent widespread panic that one of his scientists went off the rails? People in positions of leadership have to make those decisions. Again I'm not arguing they're moral, just that they're not evil if you side with them and blowing up the Institute is a travesty. The Institute can provide peace, security and technology capable of rebuilding humanity. Destroying it because your faction of choice views them as evil is ignorant and a detriment to human's rebuilding. Again Virgil isn't a reliable source and neither is Father. Virgil can claim whatever he wants in his own terminal entires. They unlock the side door and allow you in to the facility so you can bypass the security in the hostile takeover quest. There's a terminal on the other end of the FEV lab you can access as a fail safe if you're not able to talk them down and they allude to it.
---
Yeah, they should totally remove game chat too. Nip that shit in the bud.
---
Just play in adventure mode, I surround myself with the finest and most caring of bears üêª
---
Guess rifle does physical damage. It's a [rail gun] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railgun).
---
Yeah, Just a idea with a feature i wish was added that they have already implemented before. They just have to give it a Appalachia spin. To me the camp and trading is the only thing keeping the game alive for me. So this would be amazing.
---
Having this issue on my alt character. Didn't even any problems with this on my main character.
---
If you dont mind continuing submitting 2 at a time I would be really interested in what your results are. I was dropping them approx 1 every 20 submissions.
---
Bloodbugs has acid as well, i used to find them useless unless its a legendary until i actually scrapped one of them bloodbug probiotics and what do you know, acid. And there's a ton of them suckers everywhere.
---
And a possible Mole Miner rebellion were we can side with the queen and get bonuses in the city and they are friendly and can be companions, or side with the rebels and get companions and bonuses from them, and where could that City be, none other than in Thurmond, or maybe underneath Thurmond, they are Mole Miners, two things that stay heavy times under ground
---
"We're only going to rub the outside, no penetration" - Pete Hines
---
And that was a lie
---
Haha, true. I know everytime I go by one of those machines I give it a whirl. I've gotten 3 slices between FO4 and 76. And that's THOUSANDS of hours lol
---
Next time just aggro them and run towards the front door. The sentry bots and Mr Handys will make short work of them for you.
---
Maybe a little op though?
---
Destiny has a similar app, I would love it if we could have such a feature
---
Would be nice to check when the server is going down for maintenance so I don't waste an hour taking workshops and building defences only to get a measly 20? minute shutdown warning
---
If bet money they are under a "don't talk about it" order until the higher ups decide what to do about the situation.
---
I'm working on a Bloodied build with my low level character, and he has Serendipity maxed out, and I must say it has saved my skin a few times. I'm also looking for a Bloodied build that's geared more towards solo and one-handed play as the build I'm using is geared more toward team and two-handed play. I had somebody helping me, but they just stopped, so anyone have amy advisr on that, I'd be greatful.
---
I have max luck, and still haven't managed to get one.
---
Yes sir, I would say that confirms it, good luck on the hunt.
---
Seems like you guys are the mad ones that got handed in PvP and come on reddit crying.
---
This has been bugging me since day one of the beta!
---
The reward should be 7600 atoms, end of.
---
Ok bud. Not sure what the tone of this comment is supposed to bet I'll give you the benefit of doubt. First, the bounty WAS from survival but it was placed on me because I wiped out a group of 4 people camping the charleston trainststion and they could handle not being able to gang up and bully everyone. Second, I didnt use any glitch or exploit to make make base impenetrable. All I did was find an existing structure with a small enough entrance to be blocked with a foundation. The base is legit as far as game mechanics go and the only reason anyone would be angry about it would be if they were a troll who wanted to go around destroying camps and I don't really care what people like that think anyway.
---
i mean. i don't like survival mode. know what i do? not play it.
---
i jumped in for like 30 minutes to win Medical Malpractice, and that was it.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/FO76Builds/
---
Yes! But I would actually like it even more if we could have paintable walls! I wish they would add more paints like the do for the floors in the atom shop.
---
Yeah, I mean, just an idea being thrown out there.
---
I don't think they'd ever go that crazy with it, but you could always stack on some kind of thing like you can only shoot while standing still with it, or it throws off your aim by a huge amount or something.
---
The Forest. It's pretty. I like it.
---
Where is this exactly?
---
Sounds like a plan now if only someone listens
---
Super cool! Love the shirt!
---
If it's any consolation you are not alone, lots of players are having real shitty luck with paint.
---
I'm not saying that it shouldn't be fixed but more of what I found when using it.
---
With the right perks it can be an amazing PvP weapon, especially against people running the bloodied meta.
---
In the giant tables, on the outskirts of Watoga.
---
At least make it a go pick up your food misc quest or something.
---
Sentinel/assassin TSE/AAE players are the only challenging thing in this game. They are all huge pay to win assholes who simply bought into power, but I still enjoy fighting them.
---
Play styles make a huge difference in PVP interactions. The best aim down sights builds are the sentinel explosive stuff. Vats centric playstyles are one of the better counters to this. They should revert one shot protection so the critical aspect of damage can circumvent the damage cap. That makes it so high base damage weapons have actual value in PVP. Keep it so non vats shots cannot instant kill, but critical hits can.
---
GT is Davolicious. I'll jump back on shortly.
---
Cool info, that's like my favorite song in 76! I actually didn't even know it was the Inkspots...
---
My handmade holds 85 I believe.
---
I think I may have accidently have made the plans for a new DLC or a possible Mod that will come out when Private servers are here
---
I would like to see a log fort set up like Camp Venture.
---
But that's only it, you cant even deal damage with that weapon to 95% of the game
---
One of my favorite things to do is defend new players against the "raiders"
---
Nuked Whitesprings for hardened masses and glowing masses and high radiation fluids.
---
Nuked Whitesprings for some cobalt, some crimson, mostly yellowcake and fluorescent flux.
---
Nuked Cranberry Bog for violet flux.
---
As a fellow melee user, I've found that the best way to contribute is with a cryolator. If you hit her in the air she'll hover in place and make it easier for the folks with Furious weapons to stack hits, and if you hit her on the ground it'll keep her motionless for at least 30 seconds so that you and the other melee people can wail on her without getting stomped.
---
I agree with you.  Just venting on this issue.  Its pretty big and i have been playing since Beta.
---
Yeah. But the version in the beta was definitely different. I think the way they did it in 76 was combine the Johnny Long Version and the ink spots Version??? Something like that. Or like I said it could updates the ink spots Version all together.
---
Or run around 18%. The well fed buff thing happens quite a bit in a bloodied build. You'll lose around half and be at 9 when it happens.
---
Well raiders are cowards by nature, so it all sounds about right.
---
for the doors you can make it 2 way. it has 2 wire connection points, though one is hidden. The annoying thing is that the keypad is on the inside, and the keypad connection point is on the outside, so you have to reverse your door. More annoying on the brick since the white wall will be facing outside. Most people have generators inside their house.
---
Anyway the way to connect goes like this, Connect a main power line to the door as normal. The logic of that switch is to be off until the correct pin is entered. Then it will turn on for a few seconds. (Technically anything connected from that switch will also be powered. Some people connect rad showers, sirens, or lights as a notification someone opened the door. It will be turned off when the door closes)
---
Next you put a seperate switch on the door. Connect another main wire to that switch. Then connect a wire from that switch and aim it over the door in the middle. You should see it connect. This hidden connection directly powers the door itself. Flip that switch and the doors will open until you close it.
---
Crying? What does that even mean in a text forum? PVP is Ok for some not for others, stop thinking you are some elite gamer dude, it‚Äôs just a game üôÇ 
---
Pew pew!
---
 **Have you ever dropped BOS T-60 Paint after dropping the BOS Shielded Plan?** 
---
yes.  i got two initiate's paint, then shielded then another paint (corporal or maybe sgt, i'm not home to check)
---
Yeah it would be pretty nice in larger numbers
---
That's strange cause for me it appears everyone is roleplaying as Responders or helpful organizations.
---
AKUUUU
---
The Overseer? 
---
It‚Äôs also a woman in vault 76...
---
that was just this weekend ace, i, along with my group of other 3 friends all grind together every night after work, and on the weekend,  we all have done "thousands" of runs through westek, robco, watoga, harpers ferry, whitesprings
---
we all agree that 3*'s hardly ever drop actual 3*'s
---
and you just verified and restated what ive already posted, 3* enemies hardly ever drop actual 3* items,it sounds like your 1/3 of the time is much better percentages than what we and most of the posting people on reddit have encountered
---
but we are all so happy for you that you get them consistently
---
Locking Picking and hacking should not have any restrictions and even without the perks you should be able to attempt a level 3 pick or hack. The Perk cards instead would make the process easier by giving a bigger sweet spot, stronger bobby pins, more chances and reduces hacking reset time if you fail it.
---
My buddy and I were 14 and 16, and I'm doing a Medic/Explosion build. This level like 116 came by and we took him out. Realizing that he would probably want vengeance, we went into the Penitentiary. When we walked in, I dropped a Frag Mine at the entrance. My friend got on his pip boy to do some leveling, and the 116 had walked in the back door with an LMG. Unfortunately for my friend who was on his pip boy...got gunned down immediately. I was squatting in the next room. When 116 ran to collect the paper bag, the mine started to go off, and I had already thrown a couple grenades his way. He went down AGAIN! So I ran, collected his stuff and went back to my camp to deposit the loot. He came back a third time and gunned me down. Realizing that we would no longer be able to get the upper hand, my friend and I fast traveled to my friend's camp. End of story!
---
Love that even with about 100 level difference, you can still hold your own sometimes. Just need to get the jump!
---
An unreachable base is an exploit, and I wouldn't go showing that around. Good way to get banned or the method patched. I was about to comment on the cool base location until I saw that.
---
It sounds like you‚Äôre wearing the x01 over other armor and expecting the non-power armor effects to still help. They don‚Äôt. If you‚Äôre wearing power armor you may as well not have any other armor equipped. 
---
It‚Äôs pretty widely known by now that power armor is not good for PvP because the legendary effects from non-power armor are so much better for it. 
---
Explosive is still a good legendary effect but it doesn‚Äôt dominate like it did before the nerf. There are much better effects now like bloodied, which is most likely what you‚Äôve been seeing.
---
IGN is same as name here - Puckseason...Go ahead and add me.
---
Unless you take a workshop...
---
but why?  why make it just as absurd when having them drop what they are not only makes the most sense but also makes the legendary grind less random?
---
I got it from Biv in one of the daily quests. I'm not sure of the exact recipe quantities (not at my PC), but it's boiled water, Nuka Cola, snaptail reed, and wood.
---
That's exactly what I was thinking.  That Creation Club backpack was one of the best deals that was offered after the Home Defense pack.
---
oh right
---
My family also.
---
Same. I don‚Äôt see how there that many around.
---
bobbleheads
---
Rustic furniture set, the older wooden desks, wood stove, cooking stove to name a few
---
Weapons
---
Well you can just replace walls, but its  one at a time. Also I use different walls in my camps. Warehouse and metal for outer barrier walls (sometimes wood, depending on the look i want). Brick and barn for actual buildings. Brick accent walls work inside, also sometimes I want red walls. Looks good in contrast to the brown inside the barn walls have.
---
I wonder if this is why the vending got delayed. Along with the vendors being in Whitesprings, etc. Hopefully they get it all rolling smoothly. 
---
I was going to build a trading post this weekend but I'm holding off until the camps become indestructible.
---
Feeling cute, might give you a 1 star drill later.
---
Carrying way to many weapons and armor that I‚Äôm saving for the legendary vendor. Also lots of aid items
---
Biv got loose again
---
Send in the Brotherhood
---
I just don't pick it up...
---
RAD-X Syringe shots.  Disables all mutations temp. Something to consider
---
If you need a supplier. I got you.
---
One time I was being hunted by the number 3, it was apparent he was after me because I was able to watch his map marker beeline towards me. I won, woohoo, wait, now he isn't one the map and &gt;90% he is coming to kill me again, dammit. It's such a tough penalty, If there was some more complex scoring, like 1 per minute, +50 for an npc kill, +1000 for a player, so you racking up a high score actually was based on something other than not dying.
---
Like, if you want to top the scoreboard just go somewhere people can't kill you and wait in a corner. That kind of feels like a waste.
---
Aid items for me too. I spam the button when I loot enemies resulting in me picking up meat and other things without realizing it. Quite often, I find myself dropping 20-30 spoiled meats and glowing meat/blood. Those surprise missiles from completing events also get me too.
---
So I was actually mistaken on how exactly this works. i was thinking that you would have a chance for each of the extra things to drop. However you will have aid and ammo both drop as seperate drops then it has a drop for the BoS Specific quest rewards. Under that list the first item is the shielded under armor which can only drop if you have all the other under armors for BoS. This will replace any chance at other rewards. After that or if you dont have the other under armors is goes through the list of clothes that the quest can drop. Army Fatigues, Engineer's Uniform, Bomber Jacket, Field Scribe's Uniform, Science Scribe's Uniform, Brotherhood Scribe Outfit. if all those checks fail it then does a check to see if you get a paint and as far as i can tell you are able to obtain the paints in any order. I can show you the info from the data files if you like.
---
There is no exploit so I'm not worried about getting banned. If you can sight where Bethesda has said "any base that is safe from player attack is an exploit or bannable offense" I may digress. You are simply assuming this because most camps are vulnerable and Bethesda didnt put in a single sure fire way to make your base in Invulnerble. People have bases under that map which actually is an exploit and they are all doing just fine. You have the right to believe what you want but this does not break the Terms of Service and so I know I wont be getting banned.
---
If I took off travelling pharmacy, I'd have well over 1000lbs of weight
---
This would help save so much time and frustration in trying to transfer items between characters!
---
Yeah I know you can, and I sometimes do the same with different wall types. I was just suggesting for ease of doing them all at the same time.
---
Eh........I never bought the game, so that part of your post is pretty funny. But Bethesda did in fact lie many times about this game so I sympathize with people that got scammed by them.

2500 Emcc ammo for the Gauss weighing in at 2500 lbs unless I run batteries included üëé

I will never run without 3* serendipity. Doesn't matter what build I'm running, but especially with a bloodied build.

3* serendipity fully protected me from a fall off of a monorail tower with 19% health.

Mitigation is king, for low health builds.

what floor? ive been looking for this
---
Remember, survival is in beta.   Probably best to stay away for the first month or so.   When you suddenly see guys spewing rage on here about how their build has been nerfed, then it might be worth checking out. 
---
And I promise you it's coming because the developers said so in a recent interview.  He said that their whole reason for allowing existing charters in the mode was to see how badly they could break the game with extreme build and legendary gear so that it could be fixed.
---
That or introduce a robot NPC who operates a ‚Äúbank‚Äù for characters on your account
---
Ever since the last patch when Bethesda foolishly put a limiter on first-hit damage to "Prevent one-shots" (Which did NOTHING but make slow, high-damage weapons completely nonviable in PVP) it kind of ruined 2H melee weapons. Everyone is using things that hit really fast now to get around that. Which is why you are barking up the wrong tree till they realize it hurt weapon and build diversity really bad and fix it. Sorry, man. It just isn't going to be viable to 2h melee right now. :(
---
I just log out. I even have pvp gear, but normally don't wear it. I don't have the time for such nonsense.
---
What? 
---
The version in Fallout 76 now is not the Ink Spots version.  It's the [Johnny Long version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlzE-GJxFbA), isn't it?
---
It all depends on your gear buddy. I have a instigating super sledge with swing speed and weight reduction, most stuff dies in 1 or 2 hits...
---
I spent a week gathering elements to build ammo I had over 1000 units of gunpowder equivalent to close to 50 lbs or more idk
---
That's a good solution, too. At least on Adventure mode.
---
Yup.  I can't wait!  
---
Until then it's simple platform living for me at camp.  I refuse to build anything complex until camp immunity is implemented.
---
i heard that you can find a holotape implying she got injured and is dying, but i never found it so i don't know if it's true. even if it is, "dying" doesn't mean "died", so she could still be out there somewhere.
---
bethesda did say they're going to add a "new main quest" in the fall update season, so. who knows.
---
I don't know if this map has nearly as man "banks" as FO4 Boston did, but if it's close I don't see why they shouldn't be used for something more like this. And did you know all Red Rockets also have stash access?
---
This is really cool that every different kind of player has a special job to do when it comes time to fight the SBQ! That‚Äôs awesome teamwork! 
---
I have yet to do this however, and I am a stealth/sniper build. Are those kinds helpful at all when it comes time for the angry queen or not really?
---
If you follow the advise here in these replies to your post, you will be a marvelous edition to a SBQ event.  So many new players these past few weeks are only interested in running around looting the weapons and sponging xp.  Nothing terribly wrong with that in itself, but they aren't really participating in what the quest is really about.  Killing the bitch and being an active participant in helping the big iron gunners and properly equipped melee players do the job is a great feeling. I also suggest you get an Endangerol syringer and keep darting her every chance you get.  That actually helps more than you know.
---
I paid $80 for the game, and I‚Äôve played a couple hundred hours so far.  That‚Äôs a great return on my  financial investment, so I can live with some mistakes the developers have made and some errors they have not fixed.  
---
If they want to gradually introduce more features or items into the Atomic Shop, so be it.  It will be my option not to purchase those items.  If they eventually go full pay-to-win, I‚Äôll either drop the game or treat it as a single-player game, which for much of the game is quite easy to do.
---
People seem to forget that Bethesda is a business - they need to make money to continue.  If new DLC is free, they need an alternate ongoing revenue source.  Other MMO‚Äôs have similar priced initial packs plus subscription plus optional store items plus expansion packs that cost as much as the initial content.
---
If we ‚Äúdecry it as a single community‚Äù, what purpose will that serve?  Further, we cannot be a single community.  Some players want 3 star legendary weapons to drop from every mob.  Others are power-levelled through the content then complain when there‚Äôs little to do in the game or no challenge, demanding new content.
---
Some twinks last night were using it to draw people in. 1 guy sat hidden in #1 rank and then the tse using full sentinel wearing dude was just destroying everyone that came looking for him
---
Glowing meat/blood, I sell that to vendors. Mainly because I pick up so many of them + hard bargain perk + grape mentats = easy money.
---
What platform are you on?
---
legendary items that are too trash to sell to players. gonna cram em into a vendor
---
This is a damn good list!!
---
The limits, stash and caps kills this game, hitting the cap limit basically removes a major portion of the game if your someone who has and likes doing a daily vendor run, once you hit that cap it‚Äôs kinda over, why would I sell for 0?   I bought a 20k cap gun to fix this short-term, and I‚Äôm now lazier with my cap runs. So it still effects me.  
---
And  everyone plays different because of the stash limit. And the delay of player vendor and the legendary vendor being so far out does not help.  If we had some real space and sub-containers it would really help in the inventory management sub-game, being able to rename will help, but I still don‚Äôt have the space to build up multiple armor types while still using one.
---
85 projectiles in a handmade drum mag which is what most people use on their handmades. That handmade will not only outperform on critical hits but also overall DPS which bring me back to my original point of them not being able to compete with meta weapons. As I have said any weapon can be effective in the right hands regardless of what others are using, which is why you are able to get kills with yours, but in any scenario with players of the same skill level, similar builds, going to head to head the handmade will outperform and out DPS a laser rifle any day. Your point was whether or not a laser rifle is effective in PvP, while mine is that they are garbage compared to guns like a handmade.
---
Where upstairs?
---
I believe so. That version you shared does sound familiar with the actual game but I think it was ink spots still. Because in the full release when they sing it‚Äôs more quiet and little bit off tune.
---
I am starting to believe my character is just an underachiever and can‚Äôt rise above the rank of Initiate.
---
Just remember nuka-world junk yard doesn't count. ;)
---
because people inventory is full of legendaries, and they suck at scavenging materials that they dont have enough to repair. It takes so little materials to repair that it isnt a big deal.
---
Without needing workshops, I know good places to loot a lot of metal, concrete, wood, copper, aluminum, And launching a nuke aint that hard neither if the rad shower breaks too.
---
Ah, just figured Bethesda lumped it in with energy because it's shiny
---
I make my own Nuka Dark.
---
It's not worth the effort, but I make them anyways.
---
Oh I don't know. I think the scorched are pretty on the spot with the heroin addicts and the other druggies.
---
Other than the blood stain and holotape I don't think anything has been found of her.  No remains, no more tapes, etc.  She could be dead or alive or something else.  She could be reunited with the people pf Vault 76 in her human for, or she could be reunited 'changed' in some way, or maybe a pile of bones.  I hope she is a part of the story to come in some way.
---
heating coil is the only one. if you want mod ability use a normal sledge
---
I don't think people are out to get your C.A.M.P...It's the person in it that can't be fought. They already came down hard on people using the C.A.M.P to get under terrain where you were unreachable, like you said, so their position on doing things like that is clear. I'm guessing they make foundations destructible sooner or later. Better enjoy your exploit while you can.
---
Yes, this! I totally forgot about that. Wonder why they ommited (rather than added) a bunch of stuff from FO4?
---
I tried with and without, and I think it's worth it
---
It definitely does increase the dmg. From memory listed in pip boy, my Tesla Gun does like 600, and my beam splitter Laser Rifle does like 230. Tesla gun can not one shot a lvl 68 super mutie, yet the laser rifle can easily can. Since they both deal energy damage this suggests to me the beam splitter is actually bugged and doing full damage for each beam.
---
Also when I aim down the barrel (using reflex sight) there is literally no spread, every shot hits with pin point accuracy at maximum range. Does not work like this from hip fire though, and not sure about VATS.
---
Since the durability decreases so damn rapidly with this attachment it further convinces me it's actually counting it as 4-5 shots per trigger pull. I can literally only get about 50 shots from 200% with gunsmith where it's probably five times that without beam splitter.
---
Either the mod is bugged or the name is bugged. Should be renamed "Beam multiplier".
---
Red rockets  that I knew, banks could be ‚Äúbuilt‚Äù and placed into the world kinda like how I feel the frat houses did, unless they were always there and just was oblivious to it? Either way definitely would like a shared account stash system, low on weight capacity but something simple to transfer amongst characters
---
The good old days of Old Olney *has a flashback of running from 5 Deathclaws that are right behind me*
---
id also like the garden plots from said workshop DLC. they can fit  enough plants to make them worth the investment. and allows for protecting them against mole rats on a foundation (or just to have crops on a flat surface)
---
Hey thanks for taking the time to share that man. I actually didnt think about that at all. Guess its still a workaround more than anything, but for the meantime Ill give it a try. Thanks
---
Literally every game that has asymmetrical PvP without flagging or separate PvE servers turns out like this. It's the most predictable pattern in the world.
---
Almost like... there IS some skill involved...
---
GAhhh! That makes me so mad. 50 is a much better number then 45. :)
---
Yeah, could I get your name
---
Pretty sure that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs there for.
---
They havent banned anyone for making camos underground man. They didnt "come down hard" on anything but duplicating. That's just a made up claim. Again it's not an exploit but I'm getting tired of talking to you now as you are one of those people who doesnt know what an exploit is and just keeps repeating false information over and over. I will enjoy my totally legit camp that has broken the ToS in any way and if they do make foundations destructible then so be it, its hidden enough as is. Enjoy screeching "cheater" on the internet all day.
---
Now that I did not know, cheers!
---
As a support gunner, I tend to have a lot of weight tied up in guns. One gatling gun (-90% weight on it, great for me) and two gating plasmas each weighing 24-31 pounds.  And stimpacks i have quite a few. Running traveling pharmacy for that one. 
---
For hidden costs ore, its always is misc and if you pick up and ton and forget to smelt it, it really adds a good bit of weight, also gunpowder.
---
Yes, I've noticed it since FO4 but try to not to look at it lol
---
The other choice for death penalties could be a reversal of any progress/loot since last ‚Äòsaving‚Äô which could be visiting a train station, camp or similar location. Not sure how realistic this would be though.
---
For longer runs/search for raw flux, equip ‚Äògood with salt‚Äô
---
A "Rise of the Molemen" questline would fit right in with Fallout's goofiness
---
Fair enough, and a failure to read on my part.
---
What is the base damage on the weapon? Instigating is really good in PvE. Lets you one shot tons of stuff. 
---
I use a level 50 one star vampires walking cane. I only have 30% damage bonus from perks and I can still one shot level 50 protects, and most scorched. Super mutants take a few more hit. 
---
Are you sprinting when attacking? That doubles damage.
---
THE UNDERMINER
---
[IB] *Drill appears in middle of watoga*
---
I got quite a lot for the $60 I spent. The game has a lot of hours worth of stuff. They owe me nothing. It's fixed mostly how and working well.
---
I learned the joy of taking my xbox controller with me to my home computer and using the streaming feature to play remotely. The OneCast app also allows me to play on my ipad.
---
Just a tip for parents that can let kids watch via TV and still be able to play.
---
I hate that the xbox party chat blocks out in-game area chat. so by using the xbox app, I'll join xbox group and keep my xbox headset on with the iphone earpiece to not miss out on what's going on in the world.
---
Additionally to what's been said here, you continue to get perk packs every 5 levels after 50 as well
---
theres Atoms to be sold, Bethedas is all about the *caps*. speaking of, *why* are caps a currency in this game? like, the lore and timeline for other games fit, but this is chronologically the first game. Wuddup wit da kapz?
---
The perk card loadout mod on PC is amazing, it truly makes the park card system they have work and make sense.  In the current non-modded game, you just can‚Äôt swap back and forth between 2 really different builds. All the changes and things to remember, let alone just the time to do it with the controls available,   Great example is a PA build and non-pa, the amount of swaps you have to do for that, you can never just walk around and when trouble strikes kick out your PA and jump in, the perks you have to change out to do it well will have you in-menu for another 5 minutes. 
---
Getting a ‚Äúdeck‚Äù every 50 levels would be a great way to add it to the game for everyone.  
---
If this is removed in an update I will stop playing, there is no way to go back, it is clealy a better system for their current game mechanics.
---
Shhh.
---
Oh yeah i mean for adventure
---
Can you make it work OK against people without god-tier rare armor and weapons? Sure! Is it competitive against someone with .....? Not so much.
---
So if another player ambushes you and kills you and takes your junk, your attitude is ‚ÄúOh well I can get more‚Äù?
---
Whitesprings is nice in that you can initiate trades through the many trashcans they have around in that area.
---
I burn bobbles and mags when I pick the up. And gunpowder I keep a stock of 200 and use what I find automatically.
---
I picked up this weird mod for a sledge ive never seen before. Searing heavy spiked rocketed. 
---
Ive never seen searing on a heavy before. Now I need to find a proper sledge to put it on. Might be a good sub for all rise
---
True. Always thought it would be cool to put them on my roof, or bring back some greenhouse wall plans etc.
---
Just curious, do you notice better/more 3* legendary items with that much luck?
---
My first two characters I found the hunting rifles, handmades, and all sorts of stuff. The next two characters with 97 combined levels, I have seen 0 legendary rifles of any kind.
---
Added you, thanks.
---
there's 1 in the high school as well, not a bad stop if you need plastic
---
I got you beat with my collection of 10 =)
---
My aide is mostly chems I can‚Äôt use and nuka cola I can‚Äôt seem to ever drink.
---
Agreed. Huntington is the second largest city in West Virginia and it‚Äôs nonexistent on the map.
---
Same with mini nukes. Meat mainly SB and glowing always get me.
---
Sure.
---
It'll be fun until you get to the endgame. Or run across an unfixed bug that literally crashes the game every 5 minits. And then you'll get salty and leave the game.
---
FO76 is a dumpster fire.
---
Play it only if you like getting burned.
---
the trick is to try the same one multiple times. I've gotten 10 pies so far from machines, and every single time it was 2nd or third attempt with 11luck
---
That why I stopped using the gauss rifle. I couldn‚Äôt manage the weight
---
I took out the SBQ 4 times on Sunday. my first time being there. I got the loot open On the SBQ but all of the sudden all item just disappeared. I noted this 3 times. It was other player taking them. It Happen a few time other loot containers when I was with other groups. It not we don't get anything it other that takes it all. It happened with the Festival 2 weeks ago as the Sloth at the end I wouldn't get anything and I did shoot at it so to for SBQ. I think there is a glitch.
---
Doesn't that perk say workshops?  I'm not on to check but its moot.  The community has overwhelming embraced no slap and no camp damage.  Things evolve.
---
It‚Äôs tough out in these wastelands.
---
Then your using the inferior drum mag versus the penetration mag that has 20% more dmg after the armor penetration.
---
Git gud
---
What is your definition of griefing?
---
Yes! I also have so many stupid  random * legendary things that I can‚Äôt wait to get rid of!!! I‚Äôve been hoarding them off for this new vendor. They really could do some cool shit with this guy! Wether or not your cashing in legendary items or not, it would be cool if he had a unique inventory of randomly generated legendary items as well. You might check his inventory and find some real gems! Idk... but the suspense is killing me!
---
Ore and gunpowder seem to always get me at a point. Usually around 20-30 pounds. But aide is always at healthy 50 for me.
---
Exterminator perk = dead cricket.
---
Why I‚Äôm selling mine now too lol
---
Is that for a regular sledge or super sledge?
---
Think of the cola as stashed money
---
Just let him keep trying.
---
I just picked up Cola Nut..and even regular nuka colas seem pretty nuts. I think this is a legitimate perk to take.
---
It's be awesome if you could easily tell in the menu what level the armor is. I can never tell the difference between sturdy and light leather unless I equip it and take my outfit off.
---
My rad shower stays stored until needed. Not risking leaving it out and it getting destroyed. Too Expensive to fix.
---
For people who like to leave theirs out this is a good idea
---
This kid is onto something.  Perhaps just have a small fleet of cargobots leave Mama Dolce's, dropping off boxes around Appalachia similar to the US Govt. Supply Requisition holotapes.
---
You done?
---
No, go away
---
Regular cola yeah. But cherry, grape, orange, and quantum are good at any time.
---
Limiting a server to a random set of 24 players makes building a sense of lasting community tough.
---
They made a lot of areas where this sort of thing was going on "unbuildable". Those bases under Seneca Rocks aren't something you see any more, are they? They'll get to the other types of inaccessible bases sooner or later.  They won't ban you outright because what you are doing isn't in the terms of service, but they will figure out a way to stop you from continuing to abuse the system. Tick-tock.
---
I guess I misinterpreted the stuff at WestTec lab. I thought he got out earlier.
---
If your using the drum mag then that just shows your lack of knowledge. The drum mag sports no armor penetration. The perforating magazine adds roughly 40% armor penetration which ends up equating to 20% more dmg.
---
You really expect me to believe you know anything when you don‚Äôt even know the simplest of things like how to mod your gun to be most effective? Lol.
---
Regardless of your ignorance, the laser rifle is better at range, when you‚Äôre outside of vats range yet still need that overwhelming stagger, to down a sentinel armor opponent, when you can‚Äôt vats to crit them.
---
This is more of a general energy weapon thing on top of the anemic ammo count of the weapon plus the mod designed to give it more "usability" given its purposefully inherent issue.
---
The game feels like they were afraid of certain weapon types becoming dominant so they tactically nuked them before launch. Add that on top of the bad design and bugs, and you have the current F76. None of this is new, it just sucks that any patches are either anemic, ineffective, or outright nonexistant outside of the rare few weapons with ok base damages.
---
Bethesda is not, in any way, struggling for money.
---
Apps introduce vulnerabilities and are SIGNIFICANT to create for programs that were not built with the intention of one day having another application utilize it.  How would a trade between two players not logged into the game, but logged into mobile, even work?  Where's the data being held and verified?  A disaster in the making, likely the biggest reason we'll never see it.
---
This is likely to never happen because the cost is not worth the benefits, the second reason why it won't exist.  Why do you think mobile apps for already small but dedicated playerbases make money.  You think they're going to charge for this app, to trade in game, and not face a PR backlash again?
---
You clearly didn't think much of this out.  It will not generate a penny of additional income and will cost at least six digits of development and testing.  It will make the game less stable and more vulnerable to exploits.  The people still playing 76 aren't going anywhere.  The people that left or aren't playing yet don't care about being able to play remotely.  People who can't manage inventories just cry for more space constantly.  Giving them the ability to do it remotely with a tiny screen and no keyboard or mouse will in no way help this make-believe problem.
---
No actual benefits to be found with this suggestion.  It'll never happen.
---
I always forget that I have that card

Photo nerd status: Confirmed. 
---
Hello, member.
---
No
---
Hence 'internal discussions are ongoing' response being completely valid.  Silence isn't.
---
Sometimes legendaries don't show up when I'm looting and then like half an hour later when I'm still camp cooking they will all pop up one after another, clogging my entire screen for 30 seconds.
---
Nope. Sh*t luck for RNG drops...
---
I have 4 in my stash, I wish they offered a special bonus to stats or something.
---
Considering how PVP has basically been gutted for adventure mode, and can be done anywhere in survival, this suggestion makes absolutely no sense.
---
But Nuclear Winter is coming. Someone posted that the Nuclear Winter came after 76 opened up, and there is a new mode confirmed to be coming titled Nuclear Winter. Just a gimmick mode with different rules like Survival
---
Nothing currently ingame reduce energy resistance.
---
Have you seen the sheepsquatch? That thing looks to be the size of a deathclaw
---
\^\^\^ The above :)
---
i run mutations and wouldnt run a character without them.  that being said i feel this item isn't necessary.  one of the negatives of having them i think is the inconvenience they have, and should stay as a negative.  
---
theres more than enough people selling serums for 200 caps which is negligible if you have to start over.
---
You know what griefing isn‚Äôt the right word. 
---
Just general bad karma gameplay would probably be the better way to look at it. 
---
That way if you were playing as a raider you would be getting loot from players but would also expect that someone RPing as a bounty hunter would be claiming some caps from your dead body. 
---
This actually would be so much fun to play.
---
Press F to doubt. I guess they will just remove foundations from the game then? This is my last reply to you as it's a waste if time. 1. It isn't an exploit, 2. Seneca Rocks camps and other like it are still abundant and you can still build under the map to this day.
---
It‚Äôs at the mountainside bed and breakfast and is titled Overseer‚Äôs log - Mountainside
---
My GT is vivalosbanditos! Im usually on between 4pm and 11pm est.
---
Throw me a message
---
Agreed. They could have figured out a lore friendly way to have made it at the buddist temple. Lots of space, cool setting, nothing else going on. Gives people a reason to visit. 
---
Maybe they are saving it for future DLC but it seems like a great spot for a "village."
---
The second star is always limb dmg and the third always reduced weight or agi. Same as the railway. In both cases the second and third stars don't really do much on those guns. So... You could probably get a pretty penny from someone who doesn't really know that.
---
I‚Äôve killed at least a dozen people by throwing a plasma grenade above where they are hiding and shooting it. 
---
If all of your PvP situations take only a few seconds then you aren‚Äôt employing any strategy at all, and likely getting the floor wiped with your toons blood.
---
Problem is you can't even get any items from the SBQ as it bugged so the first person to loot it gets it all. I sat on Sunday (Xbox One ) 4 times helping kill the SBQ and got nothing to show for it. One thing you do get is the Quest item that pop up at the end which sucks but you cant loot the Queen as other take it all. There is a glitch that is happening.
---
I'm suprised that its not common knowledge. EW in F76 aren't used because they are unusable.
---
This game is much more enjoyable if you don't try to make sense of the 'lore'.
---
Instigating is very good in PvE for lots of weapons that deal high single shot damage, since on enemies that take 2 hits to kill, become 1 and 3 hits become 2. Cutting your kill time by 50% or 33% respectively.  
---
I feel like we need to recontextualize how we talk about damage buffs. Does the buff actually lower kill time in most endgame gameplay farming or battles. Because for instance if you have a melee that one shots an enemy at +30% perk bonus damage and two shots another. And at 60% perk bonus damage it still one shots the first enemy but leaves the second one barely alive thus requiring a second attack, they are functionally identical.  And the damage bonus would only be noticable against big enemies. But even then a few extra hits on an enemy already taking 10+ isn't thhat big of a disadvantage.
---
I believe, and please someone correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, the SBQ focuses her attacks on whoever is either doing or has done the most damage.  
---
So your biggest issue is going to be that you can‚Äôt take hits, but with all your bonuses your going to be a huge damage dealer, if not leader, as soon as you hit her.   As the other person noted you might want to try ‚Äúescape artist‚Äù to disappear from her so you can do sneak damage, and then ‚Äúcovert operative‚Äù to increase that damage.
---
Actually, nuclear winter occurred right after the bombs flashed. And that mode will be survival but a little different if you ask me.
---
Happens to me. I think it's the home defense perk causing this.
---
let's hope it's the size of a behemoth
---
I'm hoping increased difficulty with more loot, like survival is increased pvp with more loot
---
Soon. 
---
Sooon... lol
---
Why is gunpowder not considered junk? Lol
---
I'm aware.
---
yeaaah, i kinda got that. first game in the timeline but has the most advanced stuff. like cmon, ultracite PA and scorch plague? aint like WV is far from the Capital Wastelands...
---
If she's not dead, she's getting my boot in her ass when we meet.
---
I'll take random damage in my camp sometimes, never alot but probably at least once a day while playing. Fully fed and full of purified water, away from my windows. I think it's just a random bug.
---
Both are easy AF; and the harder level 3 terminals are easier to hack than level 1.
---
Was thinking more about the casuals, not on reddit. It dosen't even have to be a recipe, it could just be a pick up item.
---
No canvas, u will get nylon and u will love it!
---
The Free States were right though
---
Its ballistic, Gauss shoots a magnetically propelled object instead of straight energy, it uses energy ammo to help power it
---
Happened to me. Never could find a workaround, but when I finally moved my camp recently, I got the consumed slots back. Goofy shit. 
---
One thing recommended but not tested is to make sure you always build turrets on top of other workshop items, so you can scrap the item it's on and hopefully recover the slot. Not helpful now, but for future reference...
---
I don't get why they didn't go the ESO route, honestly. A duel system, in the PvE world, with a dedicated PvP area.
---
Hell, wouldnt it be nice if map was covered in snow and people burned through hunger and thirst 3x faster while food spawns are limited to 25% in map? Goddamn that would make the greatest RP potential in long times.
---
Keep in mind they are cannibals so they‚Äôre not the best of sources.
---
I got ton of food aid and chems; I could streamline what I carry.
---
they can make a food item that isn't worth the effort.
---
I used to leave mine out and had it in the bathroom as mentioned. Since then, it‚Äôs been destroyed three times, and I hate grinding nuked zones. So never again, it‚Äôs only coming out when needed now
---
Rifles

May 9
---
It's including the resting shells of all the ones you've killed that day.
---
You just have to use your imagination. My characher's parents were talented engineers. Often contracted by vaultech and government. They were working on the enclave bunker when the bombs dropped. My character was raised around enclave and tech and is super smart. (That connects with my awesome skills in building camps.)
---
Recieved combat training as well, and spent time fixing up robots in the bunker and around white springs. One day sent on an undercover mission to the responders because they were working on something for the scorched to become immune. I was to help with that. 
---
After some time, my character was going back to the bunker to turn in her report. Everyone was dead including her parents. A big accident. My character went back to the responders. As they were dwindling down, she managed to survive by keeping on the move. Her home can actually fly. So she moved around for a bit to keep out the way of the scorched hoards. Her combat training could easily take out anything that attacked her.
---
She noticed people coming out of vault 76. She found a pipboy and a CAMP device on a dead dweller. Camp device had a cool feature to store and move around the structures of her home. She helped some of the dwellers who after a long journey, all gathered to take down the scorchbeast queen.

After some time she got a beacon of the B.O.S recruiting. (Yes I actually joined a B.O.S discord group). it being very similar to the enclaved she was raised in, she felt at home. They were rebuilding after the huge failure at the glass cavern.
---
ohh just read that, dang.
---
That's what I though too but when my team mate checked there was no legendary for sale at the same vendor and then I check standing next to him and I see them. 8/ Not sure if it's lvl capped he was lvl50+ I'm lvl 150+?
---
Exactly... why say durability and condition? Why not just say condition If it isn't effecting the drop. Durability and condition could easily mean weapon level and/or perks.. so yes it would effect the quality of the item you get.
---
What do you think they mean by durability and condition?
---
Can't come soon enough. I'm glad they're making this change. You could tell from the video docs with Todd and the devs they really loved the idea of pvp and the way characters wouldn't know if someone was "hostile" and how in play testing it was such a rush.... play testing with folks from the same office who were unlikely to be dicks for dicks sake exposes one of the cardinal flaws of 76, no thorough quality control. They played builds internally which is great, but with little experience from the battlecry devs you can see the glaring issues.
---
I'm just glad they're addressing it
---
Flatwoods monster *is* supposed to be an alien irl. Same as the Hopkinsville Goblin.
---
Like, do you remember the aliens from Romani Ranch in Majora‚Äôs Mask? Literally based on descriptions of the Flatwoods Monster.
---
That's the main problem with "raider" characters. They try to act too similar to, well, raiders, and just be assholes for the fun of it.
---
Freedom to do dumb shit is a given, until it affects how much fun others are having.
---
If you can‚Äôt wake up feeling ready for the new day, you don‚Äôt have enough goals in your life.

Okay you were sort of right [this is the actual song that plays but it‚Äôs only the vinyl version.](https://youtu.be/A9-sW8JDr2w)
---
31 luck here, she‚Äôs right, I get them out of maybe 1 in 5 tries.
---
The nice thing about the sims is nobody mean will disrupt your play!
---
do you need to launch a nuke first before you can get it? i know she leaves a holotape for you if you nuke a non-fissure site, so if it is meant to be her dying, it shouldn't be there until you get the others.
---
regular sledge. That one has all the cool mods.
---
I noticed my camp swallowed 5 water purifiers when I moved it....
---
That's for a normal Sledgehammer, not the Super Sledge.
---
No because that removes the drawbacks for you for awhile. Which is useful.
---
No for Mountainside you do not need to launch any nukes it‚Äôs just there.
---
You‚Äôre a fucking liar.
---
I was hoping the durability and (slight) damage buff to (heavy) energy weapons would make them more competitive. Now it feels like armor piercing/anti-armor effects not changing anything compared to ballistic weapons might the reason why they still are quite bad.
---
The piano sounds different at different intelligence levels. Don't know if that's the case for other instruments.
---
I won something from a port-a-potty, might have been pie once upon a time...
---
Except taking it again already serves a purpose. It removes the drawback for a time like a buff.
---
It's your choice.
---
Ah cool I didn‚Äôt know that. I‚Äôll change it. 
---
Usually tho I just shoot everything with the TSE shotgun cause aiming gets boring.
---
Mines stored too since a jerk decided to destroy it the day I got it before I even used it.
---
To be fair they weren't even that scary in Old Olney (looks at dart gun).
---
So armor piercing/anti-armor effects truely are useless to have on energy weapons? Thats sad.. If it stays that way than Bethesda shouldn't allow legendary energy weapons to even drop with an Anti-Armor effect.
---
For what it's worth, I do use my imagination--and I feel like someone that's exploring the relic that is Appalachia, and less someone that lives there.  
---
'cause nothing I do is "living" there. I exist in a shack on the periphery. I go from ruin to ruin, exploring what is left behind. I find relics. I catalogue them. I shoot the native wild life that is attempting to prevent me from continuing my exploration.   
---
The people that "lived" there show their proof of living in the relics they leave behind. In their stories involving people.
---
You have to find 10000 canvas to male it, buts a rare resource

Out of curiosity what platform are you on?

does Chemist affect these as well?

Lincoln logs to build with!

The community has already made its voice heard. The community managers or whoever that post here have to wait until they hear from higher ups to respond; if they‚Äôre ever allowed to, anyway. Badgering them will not get you a response. Once the higher ups deliberate amongst themselves and potentially talk to investors about how to proceed with the best interests of the game and community from a financial standpoint we will have our answers. That can take days. 
---
The best thing to do is proceed with a measured patience. Just wait. It hasn‚Äôt been nearly long enough to start going off the rails again.
---
This happened to a friend of mine just a few days ago. She was a level 10 and when a guy or chick wanted to trade, she declined,then they proceeded to destroy all her stuff. I felt bad because she had to use all her scraps of junk just to fix everything,I also helped out too. Why do these jerks do this to others who just want to build their campsites and be in peace? The person who trashed her camp never became wanted and had some explosive rifle ammo from the looks of it smh.
---
I like it but I would level gate everything the same as the perks.  I.E. the level you would normally get the perk is the level you can pick that level of lock or hack that level of terminal.  Every Fallout game has had locks and later terminals level gated so players don't get items that are overpowered for them at the time.
---
&gt; is this something Bethesda did intentional or a known bug? 
---
The game balance is so thoughtless that there's not really a distinction. I imagine it'll be patched if it ever hits Bethesda's priority list, but then it took months for them to make energy weapons halfway usable, so I wouldn't get your hopes up.
---
Wierd. You checked your graphics drivers are up to date ?
---
I hear tell of a nuka shiner living in the mire at the far edge of the map. He may swell you a Nuka shine or drink one with you. He‚Äôs on Xbox though.
---
3* armor I'll never use, but hold onto for the Legendary vendor.
---
Also melee weapons for the same reason, which benefit from Martial Artist's weight reduction on-person, but not in-stash.
---
I have never used that. Seems too expensive to reapply mutations for a negative effect to be suppressed. Class freak 3 is there for a reason but I guess if thats what people are into then ok.

i think the vendor bot chad at camden park

I've been looking for groups to do SBQ, if you find or start one let me know. I heard no one plays on the subreddit discord though.

Flag poles at camp where we can put our camp name or American flag on it. It would be nice to walk out and see it every time

then im gonna assume she doesn't die from the injuries in that tape since you can find it launch a 'bad' nuke and find the other tape afterward.
---
Yeah, this sounds right.

I want a hug emote to use when I see this glorious mess.

That's a bullshit commie maneuver!

So they can say they got wood :)

Damn, would love to see that Chrome/Silver paint on the T-51 and X-01 as well.
---
That's because the Scorched made it impossible to live there. Even those who tried were slowly but surely destroyed. That's the point. It's all Lose-Lose.
---
Gatling Lasers can already have 1000-shot capacity and are almost stable enough to put a scope on. A belt feed backpack for most ballistic HWs wouldn't be too oppressive in comparison (except maybe the MG42).
---
the unmarked vendors in camden park and grafton sell the plans, i think you can find mods on the vendors in welch and pleasant valley ski resort (not the station). there‚Äôs also a barrel behind big b‚Äôs rest stop next to the power armor station that always spawns an excavator mod, i found one of my calibrated shocks there
---
In F4 I run a mile from them. Still too many bad memories to engage in Appalachia. Saw a cricket horde event the other day - that would be hellish
---
I know you lose a bunch of aid items in survival. That's why I made a second caharacter so I didn't lose items from the character I cared about. But I went from 80 purified water to like 50 when I wasn't even using my main character.
---
Their lack of response is likely an order.  Don't give them (too much) crap for doing what they're told.  They don't run the company, and the people that do are the ones you are waiting on answers from.
---
It's also entirely possible they don't have an answer to give you, keep that in mind.

People will try really hard to justify an unfair advantage as "legal", instead of asking the question "is this fair/equitable?". Games aren't real life, and are SUPPOSED to have balanced rules to make them worth playing. Much of what is wrong with our society today can be boiled down to that "What/how much can I get away with without punishment?" attitude. Let's say I killed you and took all your shit in an ambush, then made myself invulnerable and sat there taunting you from a place you couldn't reach? I'm sure you would change your tune right fucking quick then, wouldn't you? It's great to be the troll, until it happens to you. Your motives are selfish, your sense of game design is broken, and being called out pisses you off because it's embarrassing and makes you look cowardly and small. And it should.
---
How have I not found this?
---
Anti Armor Explosive Gatlin w/ 5k rounds of 5mm.
---
If you guys happen to be on Xbox, I'd like a take on some of this action.
---
I hope so, but I don't think I am. I had 80 some odd ourified waters and when I went back to my.main character it was at 50 something . I'm too scared to even try it out to find out for sure. I had like 130 simpaks, 100 purified water and like 25 canned dog food before I tried survival mode for the first time and 3 deaths later most of it was completely gone.
---
Because the post isn't a real suggestion.  It's an attempt to introduce humor into a frustrating situation.
---
\[Starts Claptrap's explanation of humor\]
---
That's the paradox. We're fed up of real life so we come to Appalachia or the Commonwealth to escape but in the end we can escape the horror and heartbreak we've seen and escape back to real life...
---
I have learned from the great Captain Noob that you can use "enforcer" to cripple the wongs of a Scorchbeast. Which forces them to land and makes them much easier to dispatch of.
---
I keep an auto-Tesla on me for fighting low-level ghouls or anything knee-high, and Crickets are definitely the worst of those.
---
Once you have the recipes its pretty cheap to make them.  If you're buying them thats why. 
---
Its good for certain ones that class freak doesn't seem to work with or work as intended with. Like empath, plague walker, speed demon, carnivore/herbivore, twisted muscle because the accuracy penalty is potent.

I'm on Xbox, gamertag dashsixteen.  I've got a small stockpile of Nuka Dark now, ready to mass produce it once I have a good source of Nuka Cola.
---
Also if things can't see you they can't hit you even with aoe. It's possible to sneak attack sbq in the face and remain hidden with the right gear.
---
What a rollercoaster
---
Condition = current level of damage to the item
---
Durability = max condition when fully repaired
---
ok.
---
Sounds like your buttcheeks are flapping in the wind...
---
nice try, this post and many others like it are suggestions and are just absurd, I understand not wanting a 3 star to drop a one star but I don't understand why a one star would ever drop a 3 star, just, as I have said, make them drop what they are, 3 star for 3 star, 2 for 2, and so on...
---
I found the mods twice at harpers ferry
---
I, for one, fully share your "righteous indignation" and I'm happy to share in the downvotes to say so.  I believe that the playerbase of any MMO, particularly those like FO76 where the game is a skeleton at release and gets fleshed out gradually over time with the help of continued funding through microtransactions, is *entitled* to regular communication from the development team about the state of the game and upcoming changes or additions, and also *entitled* to a response on controversial topics that a significant portion of the largest player communities have become vocal about.  
---
This doesn't mean that I think every random little shit is entitled to a CM response when they ask for NCR Ranger armor to be added to the Atom shop, but I truly don't think it's unreasonable for players to expect the game's community management to address the most popular issues among the game's... community.  I've read that this is childish entitlement, and that the developers are making their own game and I can go play something else if I don't like it.  I don't really believe that though.  I think players want a game and the game studio wants players, and it's not unnatural to expect some level of negotiation and compromise on controversial topics.  This begins with communication, and I don't understand why so many of you don't believe the community deserves that.
---
Plans are at Camden Park and Grafton for \~6k, and you'll need 5 violet flux to craft each of them. The mods also show up at Camden Park, plus Harper's Ferry and some others. Keep an eye out for PA mods that don't have a particular PA suit in the name.

OMFG yes. I'd give this like a million upvotes if I could. This would be even better than what I suggested.

This is how you pvp. Drink Quantum and become Immortal with the Dodgy perk.

I'm on pc and have a huge base. I have never had trouble. I hate to say it but I think the maturity of some console gamers may be lower and as a result there is more juvenile behavior.
---
how old are you?
---
Not PS4, but on PC, but this might help. I first installed the game to my regular hard drive. Was very disappointed in performance. Decided to reinstall on my SSD and what a tremendous difference it made. Anytime you move and it causes the game to load in assets that weren't previously loaded, it hits the hard drive. So before installing on SSD, it would stutter a lot just while walking. That's been completely eliminated now.
---
Broaden your imagination.
---
Example. My camp is at white springs. Personal duty there is to keep the golf club area clear of people that build camps to farm it. (Those Turret crap camps.) As long as im on the server, any camp like that gets destroyed. to keep farming there fair for everyone. Thats my proof of living there.
---
My BoS discord also gives us missions to do where we actually rank up. One such for this week is to patrole ash heap. Have to travel on foot from Fort Defiance to various locations in the ash heap and clear all the locations. We have to take workshops and build outpost there. Absolutly no fast travel. This means I have to make sure I am prepared for the journy or scavenge well on the way.
---
I also trade and give supplies to any of the vault 76 residents coming by.
---
Not myself personally, no. But a friend of mine is. He does claim he gets a crit like other second shot he takes, which I could see being really helpful. I'm just shocked by its lack of aptitude I suppose.
---
Don‚Äôt play with my emotions here, are you being legit?
---
You seem to be missing weapon perks.
---
I'll quote an RPG line: "The best status effect is dead".
---
Ammo. 
---
Thanks to Bear Hands, I'm a walking arsenal with VE/BE/AAE versions of the LMG, Gatling Gun, Plasma Gatling, and 50. cal, as well as various harpoons, missile launchers, TSE heavies, and a two shot fatman. Even though most are weightless due to bear hands and 3\* perk, the ammo. Oh god, the ammo. Even with Bandolier and Batteries Included.
---
I tell myself I'm gearing up for the next PvE update, but I'm starting to think I have a problem.
---
*offers a Vampire Gatling Laser* Sorry I'm not good at talking
---
Yes! this game needs more pistols
---
You are the enforcer, now cripple those limbs!
---
Try logging off of Bethesda and log back in that might help ya
---
We should be able to make it from vast amounts of cloth. Kevlar is made from nylon fabric after all. Fuck, I'd settle for 50 cloth to craft 1 ballistic fibre, and I'm sure many others would be happy with that since cloth is so common and rarely used after you've created and scrapped armour to get mod plans
---
Nope. I really look forward to the times I get to play.
---
I thought not. It's not a story the Enclave would tell you.

Me and my gf were playing a few days ago, she was a level 18, and I'm a 93. She was hanging out in her camp, just trying to build, when along comes a level 81 using a desthclaw gauntlet and very little health (clearly a mutation build). He wanders into the camp and starts attacking my gf, most likely hoping to extort some caps out of an unsuspecting low level player.
---
Her and I have our TVs right next to each other, so i saw this and decided to port over to her camp. The dude sees me and acts like he's going to run off somewhere, so she goes back to building. He then starts tearing down her camp from the outside, so i pop him in the head. Unfortunately, he didn't learn his lesson, and continued trying to grief her camp. So I killed him again and again and again. Sure we could have just packed up and moved servers, but why should we have to do that just because of some asshole who probably has a chip on his shoulder from getting his shit wrecked in survival? I repaired her structures (for minimal resources) every time he did this for about an hour, until he finally had enough of the beating and left. I kill those people every chance I get, and tbh it's what makes the game so fun for me. I get enjoyment from stomping them and protecting newer players.
---
The fact that you think the perforating magazine adds 40% more armor penetration shows me and anyone reading this that you‚Äôre really going the extra mile to blow smoke out of your ass lol, it adds 10%, read that again, 10%, which really equates to nothing especially since most people PvPing using handmades are using AA ones, which makes the need for a 10% boost irrelevant.   Btw AA laser/energies weapons are completely broken atm, which even Bethesda has acknowledged.
---
‚ÄúLaser Rifle is better at range‚Äù at this point I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre trolling or just don‚Äôt own neither a handmade nor laser rifle lol, in every shape and form with the max accuracy and range based mods attached the handmade has 46 more range than my laser rifle, I‚Äôm looking at both right now lol. You can sit here and call it ignorance all you want but you‚Äôve either been seriously misinformed, are just trolling, or are just plain stupid. I don‚Äôt expect you to believe anything I just find it funny how far you are going(now making false statements with incorrect information) just to prove s mute point which was established with the first comment lol
---
This!
---
Fully superior to leather.
---
I assume the grafton station right??
---
Unless the target was bloodied, the current "feature" whit the tesla rifle if that you get hit by a bounced arc of the tesla, it deals more damage for some strange reason.
---
I'd love to see a golf bag for melee ala Casey Jones
---
Tell you what if you‚Äôre on PS4 you can come PvP me and we‚Äôll see which rifle does better ;)
---
I wasn't sure what weapon I should go with. Plus if I went with a weapon perk, I'd need to drop something somewhere else, and I don't know what to drop
---
One day I was making a trade and I had recently got one of these then this dude in trading with requests it and says and I quote "I will give you 1k caps for the perfectly preserved pie" not being one to turn down 1k caps I take it and I've felt bad ever since
---
This is how the designers can gate the level of lock you can pick (computers you can hack) by your player level.  For the other perks that you talk about once the card is unlocked you can choose that card on subsequent level ups and have it maxed out in a few levels. Since the lockpick/hacker perks are only one star and each one unlocks at different player levels it allows the designers to not let players under a certain player level hack/pick higher level locks.
---
I would play it if they didn't penalize me for surviving
---
Thanks jchamlin.  Much appreciated.
---
I had a live ghoul in a trashcan once, looked like it was trying to win a sack race... the finish line was my face. I put him out of his misery and he shot out of the garbage bin like a cannon.
---
To be fair... Bethesda cant even handle putting food on plates so... ghouls and robots in a trashcan is just right the f out.
---
Its just as powerful as any other 3 star legendary, except those with amazing combos. All the abilities are in game and you could probably roll a similar one. Its just the medic prefix. 
---
Medic guns aren't good if you don't focus on vats and crits.
---
Recently found out that armor with weight reduction as an attribute seems to go to a max of 90% when combined with perk cards. 
---
Traveling Pharmacy rank 3 + 3 gear pieces with aid weight reduction is useless. Dropped to rank 1 of pharmacy and put in the ammo weight perk. Poof, reduced the weight being carried by 40 pounds, and my stimpacks are still at 0.10 weight. 
---
Finding that out yesterday was huge. Wish I knew it a couple weeks ago. Lol
---
Plans that i want to sell/trade take up most of what is on hand at any point. 250+ stimpacks even at 0.10 is a close second.
---
Oh man, never encountered that bot. Probably would've sniped it if I had ever seen it
---
I was thinking shotgun for close up battles, but heavy weapons for long distance,  in addition to grenades
---
thank you for the data. and thank you for the startling imagery that is your screen name.
---
I specialize in energy weapons. Here is my advice "don't "
---
I feel that, People don‚Äôt understand that raiders are apart of the game, it sucks but it has to do with how nice everyone is in this community, and that‚Äôs  not a bad thing, people are more than willing to just give the workshop, but if I take it I‚Äôm a griefers, I don‚Äôt want you to give it to me, I just wanna shoot you in the face because your base took my spot and you have a workshop that I want, (:
---
You're not missing anything, was kinda disappointing for me. Unless there's a quest in there I haven't found
---
What actually happened is that he tried to trade someone, requested the armor off their back, and weapon from their hand. They declined. He got mad and tried to destroy their camp. He got killed and kept coming back. He placed his camp for an easy respawn and in turn got his camp destroyed by artillery, and killed again.
---
So he came to reddit with a BS story to make himself feel good.
---
Nope. Was fighting it, it was making the mechanical sound, head briefly flipped over for a moment ... really weird.   
---
Never had anotehr one flip open like that, but, I've only fought two. (Run into about five, but three ran off almost as soon as spotted.)
---
Yeah so I am starting to see. Perhaps I'll just dump it onto my alt and wait for the market price to raise up on it. I'm sure they won't sell for much now but in a few months when nobody can find one, I bet I can get a good price for it.
---
Wow, I wonder if you were there saying:
---
**"Why we should not abandon Bethesda or Fallout 76 over the fake canvas aka nylon bags"**
---
This is pay for advantage...
---
..or quit the game and respawn nearest virtual spot
---
I had one like that a few hours ago doing uranium fever. Two 1* legendaries and one 3*. Saddly the 3* had nothing
---
Sweet.  My gt is UnsettledPuppy. Not in the business of buying, but I've got _some_ Nuka stockpiled if you want it.
---
No.
---
You need to do your research, you are absolutely wrong, it is 40%, this has been determined by various tests in this community, argue with them if you want, but you are definitely wrong.
---
I own 2 be handmades and a junkie explosive laser rifle. The stat sheets on weapons never truly reflect their actual performance, again something you SHOULD KNOW, for someone that seems to think they are knowledgeable, when in fact their just some noob that I‚Äôve downed several times on PS4, you are the ‚ÄòDiversionist_‚Äô on PS4 right? Cause I‚Äôm positive I‚Äôve killed you a few times.
---
ic stuff ... lots of CAMP thins, a few costumes, etc. With teh past few weeks being nothing but guzzling booze challenges, I've just run out of Atom. Now I'm hunting desperately for ways to finish old Challenges to try and get some again.  
---
Like, now I'm hunting robots with black powder weapons. Ugh.
---
If your on xbox I'll buy for 700 caps but nothing more really
---
Thanks man!  In spite of the disappointment concerning the lack of vending I will be doing, today has been alright
---
It was thursty
---
It really sucks since I find the Gatling Plasma one of the coolest heavy weapons which would go well with my PA build as it uses plasma cores as opposed to the fusion cores the Gatling Laser uses.
---
Either way, I am definitely not getting my hopes up since the only way to really get Bethesda's attention here is if something is either really good (TSE) in which case they will just nerf it into the ground or completely broken/unusable in which case they will slightly buff it and forget about it afterwards thinking its fine now (aka current energy weapons situation).
---
And in the end we all die too...
---
Lose-lose-lose ‚òπÔ∏è
---
You just described like 90% of the human population. I don't think "goals" are the issue.
---
Guess they'll have to drop their excess crap in my camp, then. Oh well.
---
Hey at least in 76 it‚Äôs lighter
---
I was hoping a map like that existed, thank you! Also, Biv's quests have been keeping me coming back daily (got my first duplicate the other day so it'll take longer than I thought to get all the recipes) and with all the updates lined up I'll be busy for a while I'm sure.
---
The "raiders" will get their just rewards like the dead ones you find everywhere; slumped over in the corner, lying over the railing, face down, face up....wait.......that could just be a great Friday night!  ok nvm
---
I‚Äôll check this out when I get a sec.  
---
And yes, Juice head does put out some quality info for sure.
---
There‚Äôs 8 billion people on this planet, not my fault the vast majority are content with being useless sacks of shit.
---
Welp, you rock you. You‚Äôre whining that you can‚Äôt get 3* items, but are not patient enough to go above a sample size of 6. 
---
FYI if you look about on the forum you‚Äôll find a thread listing the 3* drop rate at about 43%. Also based on a small sample size but better than ‚Äúsix‚Äù.
---
But hey! You all agreed so everything else is bollocks :)
---
Given that no one really answered I would be willing to start one, however we would need to also coordinate/do the nuke launching as well so if you are down for all that I can start one up this evening.
---
I've got a furious plasma rifle with the flamer mod on it. Fuck bugs in this game lol melt them with nuclear fire
---
Careful what you wish for.  
---
"New atom store item: Mutation Annulment Serums" 
---
But yes, we need these in our lives.
---
I'd use them exclusively for healing if not for their cost.
---
What I really want is Nuka-Cola crafting.
---
well we wont be finding out anytime soon...

Bloodied build? Shocker.
---
They should of just called it Malpractice.
---
There's no incentive to be otherwise. Can't blame us.
---
No, inside the actual city is a bus station of sorts, it has another Responder Vendor bot inside that sells the plans for Excavator mods.  Different than the Grafton Station bot.
---
**there are too many lemmings who will attack you for dating to question the parasite they feed**
---
Need I remind everyone the "canvas bag" debacle?
---
This game flopped, and a AAA game is resorting to microtranny crap like a free mobile game
---
It's very sad, but thank you for making this post.
---
Shills incoming!
---
I'm a bloodied build so I have to stay filthy with rads. I haven't even made a decon shower and I'm level 167.
---
Itll be easy money as long as Beth doesn't overprice it
---
Nice that it's a pie 'n all but what if it were a lvl 5 Legendary item instead?   THAT would get my attention :)
---
*I stopped playing that shit*
---
First and last game I will ever pre order
---
Well to be honest I think Bethesda is fixing some bugs with Vending so that they don't get a huge backlash for all the bugs and missing caps that could have happened. But we are still getting new content.
---
I'm guessing repair kits will go on as planned. The most valuable feedback won't be until after the community has had a chance to see how they work in game. This false outrage over "pay-to-win" and "cosmetic items only" means jack shit until there's actual gameplay to judge the utility of these new utility items.
---
**shillbag alert**
---
Didn't know that.... thank you
---
On PC, I can make you a set - you supply the materials.
---
Perhaps you can‚Äôt read but you seem to still not understand what we‚Äôre discussing. 
---
I‚Äôll repeat it one last time for your ignorant brain.
---
We‚Äôre discussing if the laser rifle can be effective in PvP. And I‚Äôve provided reasons and examples of how and why it can be effective. 
---
All you keep saying is ‚Äúbut muh handmade!‚Äù. No shit you scrub, it doesn‚Äôt take a genius to realize the handmade is the most op gun in the game, probably why you crutch on it exclusively and also why you die when you can‚Äôt vats and have to free aim.
---
Everyone move to new Vegas to show Bethesda what the consumers want not what some game journalist wants!
---
Hit the enclave bunker. Not the military wing one but the other one. He usually sells 3 at a time
---
They all sound kind of beginner standard to me to be honest, with not much else to do in the vault I guess we all dabbled a bit with the instruments provided in the music room if there was one... ?
---
Fallout 3 üëÄ
---
That map is *severely* undermapped - it's a small representation of what's out there (I can name a dozen similar but more minor locations within a short run from my camp).  There are a *ton* more like that.
---
Also, https://fo76map.com/ for more major places like towns and static drops (though I think there have been a number of changes to the world that aren't reflected on that yet...I've noticed a few inaccuracies)
---
I‚Äôd happily have a little delay and better content than bugs and fires
---
Nice work.  Was fun.  Thx for posting.
---
I've heard the Excavator PA is Fire Breathers paint, but I can definitely imagine firefighters using PA. Maybe not for anything other than ground floor burning buildings or you'd fall through. Not exactly commercial but I still can't imagine garages having power armour stations for common civilian PA
---
Lmao you say that but all it takes is going through my post history and looking for my username in trading posts, if you can find one single post that highlights(with proof) it‚Äôs 40% I‚Äôll GIVE you an AA handmade lol, you are literally making things up at this point it‚Äôs kind of embarrassing for you, the BASE stats of a weapon are affected by various things such as perk cards, chems etc. I shouldn‚Äôt have to explain this to you, again it is all irrelevant when it comes to AA‚Äôs effect on Both the handmade and laser rifle. I have yet to receive a friend request by the way, I would for you to try to kill me even once :) what‚Äôs your psn? I‚Äôm too lazy to dig through your post history(if you‚Äôre not too much of a pansy to post it publicly that is)
---
Amen brother
---
As mentioned elsewhere in the thread, Nuka Dark is potentially the best alcohol in the game when you stack Cola Nut and Alcohol perks
---
The Scorchbeast queen disappears and respawns when a new nuke hits the fissure if she isn't dead according to my sources...
---
That sounds like an excuse Bethesda would make
---
And if you really wanna pvp me again, don‚Äôt worry, there‚Äôs only like 3 survival lobbies on PS4, you‚Äôll see me eventually, I‚Äôll be the guy with the most kills in one life on the weekly board.
---
Not particularly useless.  Inert flux is a great water source and has a disease resistance property.  If you can spare the weight.  I usually survive for a few days on flux and ionized meat after an event.  Has a pretty good resale value too.
---
At least its a lil delay instead of a 6 month delay
---
No prob, can do! Still new to reddit, so I figured it was like a traditional forum where *any* reply to the main topic would invoke an alert for the OP. Good to know it's not that way! :P
---
The requirement for mandatory relieving of one's self is in future dlc.
---
That‚Äôs a good suggestion. What did you name yours?
---
Something very similar happened to me the other day. Was building on the way south of whitsprings- well outside of any nuke danger. Just wanted a nice little place for weary travelers to rest and and a nice point to fast travel to drop my stuff.
---
These guys show up and hang out and one random fourth guy starts breaking up my stuff while everyone looks angry. So I shot him in the face, killed him and got a nice cap bounty. Then was immediately set up by the rest with sledgehammers. Turns out it was a trap. They just hung out destroying my stuff until I fast traveled to a random guy I invited to a team so they couldn‚Äôt follow me. 
---
When I messaged and asked why one just said, ‚Äúcus we can‚Äù ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
**The shillboys defending this tripe is just beyond hilarious**
---
The canvas bag debacle. Enough said
---
Don‚Äôt worry, our great lord, the mothman will protect you!
---
That makes sense, since it‚Äôs an event. I‚Äôd rather one Queen than three anyway. Thanks!
---
I craft 5.56 in bulk in one session using loads of gunpowder, saves stashing acid and cloth.
---
Always thought that you get switched to another world whenever you log out so never knew this. Good shit though
---
If it was that long, I would just burn everything in my inventory because I don‚Äôt know how much longer I could keep holding onto some of this stuff.
---
Sure, use an axe to chop down trees, then use concrete as the chinking short on concrete, mud mixed with grass and leaves will work also. ü§†
---
No problem!
---
I always put mine in the bathroom.
---
That mothman face scared the hell out of me. That smile should not be allowed
---
If you hit a button accidentally, you'll still drop something you didn't mean to.  
---
On PC, R (drop) is right next to T (perks).  I've hit the wrong one multiple times, and probably lost more than a couple weapons as a result.
---
Scrapping isn't as easy to do by mistake (though I'm sure it happens).
---
It is not irrelevant, especially in PvP, and fine I‚Äôll find the post, but I don‚Äôt need your scrub handmade, I‚Äôve got several better versions.
---
And there‚Äôs no need to add you so you can‚Äôt jump in my lobby unexpectedly and pull some noob shit. There‚Äôs usually only 3 survival lobbies on PS4, again something you should know seeing as how you seem to think you‚Äôre experienced and all. You‚Äôll eventually find me on one of them, I‚Äôll be the guy with the most kills in one life on the weekly board.
---
Also I know I have killed you a few times, before survival even came out, I took your workshop from you.
---
I have a two shot explosive laser rifle and I hate it because it shoots 30 shots then it‚Äôs broke
---
I'd rather it's be a plan for 500pts versus 10pts per.
---
Player vending gives another place duping can come in, so they probably have to test the hell out of it.
---
Lol you got me!!
---
No for the millionth time that I‚Äôve had to try and get it through your dense ass head we are discussing whether Laser Rifles can compete with meta weapons such as the AA handmade, as I have said 3 times now any weapon is effective in the right hands, are you illiterate? Can you not read where that was mentioned(twice) before you went on a tangent about made up stats and affects you created in your mind lol. I‚Äôll still beat you with a laser rifle though, notice this whole time you‚Äôre getting offended because your argument got shut down with facts that I‚Äôll keep my cool and not insulted you, you might not want to wear your heart on your sleeve like that, this is the wasteland and people like me prey on people like you :)
---
Yeah FO76 seems to be filled with those
---
I want some damn Brotherhood of Steel flags/insignias, I was so surprised there were none in-game
---
Thank you!! :D
---
Here ya go scrub, argue the data, please I beg you.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asouq3/psa_anti_armor_is_actually_always_better_than_two/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
At least in this wasteland you can do something about the issues you face. Giant monster comes invading your camp? Blast it away with the force of a thousand TSE shots. Out of mats for your gear? You can go raid a dungeon and grab all you need.
---
Out in the real wasteland, you're stuck to the same boring shit and there's rarely if ever an opportunity to have this much of an impact on it
---
Take the amount that you kill per day and multiply it by how many players there are per server.
---
Energy wepons should cut through armor by default tbh.
---
It‚Äôs very heavy on utility perks and light in combat perks. Keep in mind that you only rarely need lockpick/hacking skills and you can swap them in whenever you need them. That opens up your build for more.
---
Make another tab in our stash that is on the far right, so it syncs all over instead of just at our camps. It could be 100 or 200 pounds.
---
Lmao it‚Äôs a lot of talk for someone is too much of a bitch to provide their psn. But if I had to put myself in your shoes I wouldn‚Äôt want to get embarrassed either, when your nuts drop or you start to grow a pair send that friend request I‚Äôd love to demonstrate everything mentioned here today ;)
---
Why does everyone say you need wasteland whisperer to tame them then? (Asking bc I'm doing research before I tame something because I don't wanna waste the levels)
---
I normally just run up and download my "known" stuff at ppls feet. My list lists could really help my new characters though
---
I missed my dart gun... until I found the Enforcer 3 perk.  When deathclaws fall after losing both legs, you can safely beat them down from behind.
---
Yeah a plan would be great but 500 is steep need to make it avalable to all players
---
You could put in a ticket with bethesda but I wouldnt expect anything to come from it.
---
I didn't even think about that. I sometimes forget you can swap perks in and out.
---
Maybe backpacks is a rework for weight reducing perk cards? You can't use them on your character now but backpack has slots for them and you can upgrade it up to 6 slots and use whatever weight reducing perks you want with it
---
I think I have 8 or 9 of the mk 3 on xbox.
---
This comparison is between TS and AA prefix and had absolutely nothing to do with perforating magazines... I‚Äôm starting to question whether you learned to read as a child or if you‚Äôre still a child lol
---
I have this happen all the time too.  Unspecified random damage.  Weirdest was I once had a tick on me for nearly 5 minutes one day.  Could not figure out why I was losing that much health.  Finally got out of my power armor and started swinging my axe around and finally killed it.  Was able to loot it's invisible body too.  Never had it happen again like that.  I was paranoid the little suckers could actually attach to you, but more likely it attacked just as I was clamming back up and glitched into my suit with me.  Weird goings on in the Wasteland for sure.
---
Ppl will always find a way to exploit but I don't think that the rest of us should have to go without
---
Same thing happened to me on free states questline, I tried unsuccessfully to get Bethesda support to help me out,  but only got bot responses. Ended up redoing everything...
---
My first post was laser rifles can be effective in PvP, that‚Äôs what all these comments stem from.
---
You tried to make it about whether they can compete with the meta but that argument is a waste of time, why?
---
Because if something is the meta then by definition it‚Äôs the best and most effective and nothing else can compete. 
---
Stick to the original point or make your own original comment.
---
Nice lol. It's cool to see Camden park on here every now and then. I live like 20 mins away from there so it's still crazy to think it's in the game
---
Okay so I was a lvl 15 and thus was like in December and I was on my way to the fitebreathers place and I find 3 glowing cave crickets........well guess I'll die
---
No plans for it, should be available immediately. Like Borderlands 2.
---
My rad shower is right in front of my doorway to my camp. It has been there for the last 100 levels nobody including creatures has destroyed it.
---
That happens when you exceed the max weight limit, the game will allow you to pick up an item that puts you over the limit, but then you cannot drop or trade anything until you are under the Max limit.
---
Try Teaming with your Mule, and sharing a weight reduction perk, then reduce their weight, and watch it closely moving forward.
---
Did we forget the fallout 1/2 powerhouse? In fallout 1 it was arguably the strongest energy weapon in the game...you could out-DPS it with the turbo plasma rifle, and a specialized build with the gatling laser could do more, but considering that you can (and I was once lucky enough to do so in a few hundred hours of playing) find it immediately after leaving the vault, it is quite ridiculous. You spend most of the game trying to rack up enough damage to hit double digits, and the alien blaster can wipe out a mutant squad in a single turn.
---
Then in fallout 2, it became even more overpowered with the increased perk potential. Better criticals + sniper led to eye criticals easily surpassing 200 damage even against the enclave, and a fast shot build with BRoF and jet could shoot as much as seven times per turn.
---
My psn is my username you dumb fool, anyone can find me.
---
Like I said, PS4, only 3 survival lobbies, you‚Äôll see me again, and I‚Äôll crush you yet again.
---
I am level 130, played since BETA, and am experiencing the most horrendous drops yet. I got zero 3* drops the entire weekend of play. That includes the SBQ, twice. So, no, I dont think odds were set higher.
---
I've tried to 'lead' before and I'm not great at it... lol
---
I do well when an effort has been setup and I can easily contribute to it though! Evident by this, since I already play *("grind" for loot, these days)* quite a lot, so for me it's not really that much more of an effort to document findings. :) *(If only Reddit's markdown was more powerful and user-friendly, it would make it easier to format the collected information in the main post.)*
---
I have a laptop that functions as my "second monitor" and I use MouseWithoutBorders which lets me use either computer's KB and Mouse to control the other system. As such, all I have to do is open up the map or my Pip to free the mouse, then hold CTRL to drag it to the other screen over the network. Easier than keeping notes on a piece of paper and *then* transcribing it into a post heh
---
Cost isn't that bad, it's the scarcity that's the limiting factor.
---
my 19LB handmade and the 27LBs of ammo if you wanna count them together, my rifles not even that good of a legend for the weight cost
---
I don‚Äôt take workshops in survival as I usually don‚Äôt have a need to respawn and thats what a mobile camp is for whenever I‚Äôm in a certain AO. Lol again it‚Äôs all talk from a keyboard gangster who won‚Äôt even provide his psn, no need to ambush you, Hell you can even bring some of your friends along for the ride! I‚Äôm literally giving you an open invitation and calling you out and you are still hiding. This is entertaining ü§£ Also the fact that you think there are only 3 survival servers active at one time for the entire PS4 community shows how much of a dumbass you are lmao
---
i have them for 1k caps
---
Watched 3 drop on pc last night, server was fine for me
---
Yet again you didn‚Äôt read, why am I not surprised.
---
Lol good job, you made him delete.
---
Gamertag is same as display. Got your caps
---
Please hold.

got two this month. didn't expect anything, I always klick them if I see one.

Re read my post and respond. No point in responding to you if you don‚Äôt even bother reading what I type.
---
NoRespawns. Every time.
---
I do it a little but I'm honestly not much of a youtuber. Just when I get a bit of time at home to make a new build and record it.
---
Lol I have no problems with asas/cav/sent builds just head snipe them with a crit and they all die
---
That bar does not even come close to the bar I built (in fallout 4).
---
i love the plasma flamer mod.  everything turns to goo.
---
one moment ill invite
---
This happened to me. I killed 3 legendaries (2 unnamed and 1 3*) But I picked them up too quickly and they were all regular weapons, no legendary effects. One dropped a lvl45 Minigun which I‚Äôve been looking for üò©
---
I was about to sell one on PC. only got one though.
---
Players will probably disagree with me , but I'm just curious as to what the community thinks of this recommendation .
---
Mine use to be in front of the door. In some of my camps, i would make a clinic and put it there with the chem station. I only lost my rad shower both times by my camp not being able to be places. Once before the "search for new server" feature came, and once where the some new no build areas were claimed.
---
Doin thd lord's work
---
Clearly you‚Äôre the troll. 
---
I provided the evidence and you‚Äôre just ignoring it. Hardly a competent argument.
---
Ah norespawns is great, I used to love his f4 builds. Thank you!
---
Somebody would bitch it's pay to win.
---
I don't make food, I just use the perk to search lunch pails and survive off the cram and stuff I find lying about in the world.
---
I know some craftables have bonii, but it's too much of a hassle
---
JuiceHead by far
---
I just jump servers, sign out and back in. Saves a lot of b.s.
---
ooo Top of the World would suck for so many reason. And yeah I‚Äôve also seen three launched within 5-10 minutes of each other, but never at the exact same time. Thanks!
---
Savage divide
---
I'll take refrigerated any day of the week
---
Have you considered that the weight might also represent general encumberance? I mean... how many Funko Pops can you carry at once, really? They're light as hell, right? Still can't put more than about 24 in a backpack.
---
I actually think the slap system for opting into PvP on-the-fly is pretty clever, but:
---
1. It should apply to CAMPs as well.
---
1. It should be literally impossible to kill someone (or wreck their stuff) who hasn't slapped back, not merely difficult.
---
They responded today to multiple threads today, yet ignore this.  Corporate hoping we forget
---
We very very much so agree.  At least a good chunk of everyone I play with does.  It needs to happen.
---
Once everyone has spent all their atoms on repair kits theyll get put in the atomic shop. For $5-10... So that people will actually start buying atoms.
---
Really? I should send them a propane tank.
---
Sucks for bloodied/adrenal builds
---
Nah survive would die if they implemented this and ifc you stay away from ther big fight areas and go after the other players you will mostly always get caps
---
I like Rifle Gaming and Captainoob. Rifle gives lots of useful information, Captainoob demonstrates weapons and shows you to correctly perk to use them and what mods.
---
No kidding right? Not only would I like to see that back, I'd like to see other events also provide server benefit (powering-up is a good example). I'd like to see something like ... horde event completion gives a reduction in costs to fast travel in a region or a small discount at related vendors (or even better, an increase in caps available at vendors in that region ... 250 maybe) ... etc.
---
That one usually checkpoints. I remember I had it stuck on "leave the mine" for a while because I'd fast-travelled out rather than leaving by the door. The mission tracking code is very glitchy though. I regularly get a broken list of missions at login, and recently I've had a couple of quests advance without being touched. My friend managed to skip the whole DMV questline.
---
The respawn's normally caused by someone else entering the area. It's very common at Blackwater because of everyone popping into Whitesprings for their daily caps.
---
Juicehead is great! Thank you!
---
they could go back to splitting energy weapons off as a separate perk from rifleman/gunslinger etc.  make it a choice if you don't want them to be op
---
Its not pay to win.... Its Digiorno!
---
It sort of already is in a lot of ways,but only for higher level players. No point in dropping plans for most of those in the that one vendor area with all the workbenches when they already probably have them already, but lots of people drop junk they can't sell or 2-3 star legendaries they can't sell
---
I mean, we don't know if we're buying single use or the plan yet soo....
---
Right? I'm only keeping it to sell later once rarity on it raises up. Other than that it's kinda useless outside medics builds
---
Let's wait for tomorrow, shall we?
---
Haha I'm just spending the last of my caps before entering again. No junk or aid either. I'm no mug.
---
Perfect! Thank you!
---
I think I have the build some where in this account. I havnt played in a while now but it used only a heavy gun Bobble Head (20%) and was before TSE and Explosive nurf. Build relied on 105% from Bloodied +100% Explosive +  60% Weapon class + bloody mess 15% then MULTIPLY that by 25% then add 50% from Revenant I think it was called. End total was insane mainly due to the multiplier and then the added 50% I believe there‚Äôs other post explaining he math behind buff stacking.
---
*Smashes door with axe*
---
RIFLE GAMING HERE
---
What location is the mire lurk king that you tamed? Also which perk card does that one require to tame it, pretty sure it's animal friend for that one right?
---
I mean you're right but I still do love scavving together like say 100 rounds of the ammo from visitng the vault and then whipping it out during an event like Faschnacht with lots of people and bask in the wonder  ( that I spent the time to scav that much ammo,lol )
---
Is the Bloodied still available
---
Aww poor Rose must've been quaking in her Med-X'd motivators.
---
I can give you a hand as well, I collect almost everything on sight, but yeah, if you want I can periodically trade with you when I have a respectable amount?
---
Sweeeeeet. 
---
Thanks
---
Lol... Come on. If they werent single use what would stop me from making a shit ton and just repairing all of my friends stuff. I cant drop a kit but they can drop their armor.
---
Does it drop at 50, even if you're not that level?
---
Yeah, I'm actually a bit peeved at the mods here for removing other posts and having one pretty small "megathread", a lot easier for the community people to ignore one thread than an entire front page full.
---
It's a midwestern/farming community symbol called the [barnstar.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnstar)
---
From what I've seen it seems to be an off and on issue. Sometimes it happens and sometimes it doesn't.  It crashed me out all day one day then a couple days later I went back and it was fine.
---
Nothing worse than farming for muts, I was 2 away from my final build and I got herd mentality .... /sigh
---
Oh man I remember that intro from his borderlands videos, I think I have to go back on a rifle gaming binge
---
Drops in this game are shit 90 % of the time. Killed a lvl 60 ish super mutant and saw bloodied plasma rifle got soooooo excited nope 1* . Not justifying it by any means but I see why people started duping not something I have done or would do but desperate people do desperate things. Here‚Äôs hoping Bethesda does some drop balancing across the board on legendary drop rates.
---
Does it actually work better? Always thought Overly Generous was melee rad damage only.
---
Is this in the theater?
---
I've updated the cards based on the feedback. Click [here](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=d794995&amp;d=sa2sv3ie2id2cr0e72au2a72ei1ee2c52at1ah0p00ln0p53pj0l11l62ig2sx2s22&amp;w=i30ia0i50if2el0pa0p80p90l92lj2l71ic4p10p30p40&amp;n=TotallyNotPhil's&amp;m=fc9) for the new one. Thank you everyone, for the quick feedback
---
Spoiler Alert :  highly likely to be covered in the patch notes coming or the next Inside the Vault and they ain't gonna say shit to contradict it
---
Yeah it's not a big deal... Junk is literally everywhere
---
There are apparently plans to implement them in some form, but this recent controversy regarding the repair kits has people worried that they will be tied to the Atom Shop through more than just looks.
---
Even if you‚Äôd just crafted 10 stable flux?
---
It wouldn't have.  I've had to go back and reinitiate that part and fix the pipes to launch.  Now I just bypass the reactor part.  Turn left and hug the wall when you come into the reactor room. The first locked door you come to will be lvl. 3 .  Pick it and go into the room and turn right and go into the adjoining room.  There is a console to hack and you can cancel the fusion reactor shutdown from there. This will open the door next to the console and off you go.  Saves time and ammo/damage.  Unless you are a completionist. I've had the cores lag for me from time to time also.  Also have had minimal robots spawn, no turrets,  overwhelming robot spawning and lock pick cards being one off, so you couldn't pick any of the locks even with all the cards equipped. Glitchey little exercise there sometimes, Nuking Appalachia.
---
(u/Traveling_Chef) saw a super mutant behemoth!
---
This just got me excited, refrigerated sounds amazing, considering i have the speed demon perk i need to store all the food i can
---
Anyone else notice that the accuracy in fallout76/nukaworld was.....76
---
did you even read what i said? the "sample size" was just for me this weekend, but we have done this thousands of times, with the same results...
---
you are focusing too hard on a part of the post, not the whole thing
---
but, i think you know that and just want to fight on the internet.  life is too short for people like you.  i kinda feel sorry for you, i hoep your life gets better so you dont have to feel "better" by being an asshole on the internet.
---
im going to block you now, i only surround myself with positive people, and you just want to fight for no reason.  good luck! i hoep you can turn yourself around
---
Main/side quests give gear respective to your level? I didnt know that, I have a level 35 black diamond and its doing wonders at 50ish
---
Or don‚Äôt buy a repair kit period ;)
---
Well, I guess it's nice to see that Bethesda is not dead, considering that none of the threads about the atom shop were even acknowledged.
---
Enjoy!üòÅ
---
Thats not evidence though that‚Äôs a comparison between Anti Armor and Two shot weapons, which read when it was originally posted and does not talk about perforating or any of the other armor piercing magazines. I seriously think you are illiterate, anyhoo if you ever stop being a bitch and want to get melted in PvP go ahead and add me, I won‚Äôt make up stories about killing you, I‚Äôll actually kill you ü§£
---
I think it's just not time for alien blaster yet. We'll probably see more powerful version after falling space station vault DLC
---
Sounds cool, I understand that Beth is gonna alter it to suit their wants but I'll accept anything as long as we get SOME way to transfer items
---
Are you sure they‚Äôve not been destroyed? Have you tried going into build and seeing if they show up?
---
Murder is its own reward.
---
Why am I walking around with 10 stable flux and a hardened mass? That might by why my answer is different than yours I dont leave valuables in my inventory for very long
---
True. And mole rats are definitely the most annoying..
---
I server hopped West Tek all weekend. I get quite a few 2* and 3* legendary super mutants there. And the xp gains farming west tek seem to be a lot higher than farming white spring and the loot was better too for me. 
---
That being said, most of the time I would get 1* or 2* items. Rarely 3*. What I did get was still decent on average though.
---
Good post.  Unfortunately, as I have mentioned before, the new social Fallout does provide a fantasy playground for bullies and borderline sociopaths.
---
THATS IT! yeah it‚Äôs my favorite quest in shelter
---
I. Hate. Drills! Todd really must have got a good laugh when they added Drills to the legendary weapon table
---
I agree but farming flux is super boring. Can see the appeal of it. Killing stuff in a nuke zone is fun. Running around in a radiation soaked enviroment picking flowers with about two worth while enemies isnt.
---
You‚Äôre killed at a chem bench as you‚Äôre crafting it. 
---
Would that piss you off?
---
I don‚Äôt think it should be nerfed to be honest, it‚Äôs one of the only things which counters tse and AAE weapons. And as for bloodied/unyeilding builds that‚Äôs another story. One shot of a bloodied can still kill me straight up.
---
I'm hoping this new dungeon is loaded with new stuff. Hopefully they are fun and have lots of replay value. I would love to see all kinds of new collectible cosmetics to grind for as well.
---
If we are talking about the same thing, I've been using my explosive shotty to destroy the cores since my first launch (25 or so solo now).  Never had any problem, just bounce it off the floor or center consoles to get maximum splash damage. I can usually take all the cores off each console with 2 shots max.
---
I... don‚Äôt think anyone who‚Äôs seriously talking about damage buffs ignores that aspect. Why do you think you see so many unarmed users now? It‚Äôs similar damage output to a 2h, but attacks faster. 
---
What still surprises me is the amount of people making arguments and purchase decisions without actually understanding the mechanics. Anti-armor melee weapons? That‚Äôs almost the worst legendary effect for a melee weapon. Furious sniper rifles? Like.... what?
---
When you level up it prompts picking a single perk card or moving a single special point
---
They're single-use. Search your feelings, you know this to be true.
---
this i can agree to if they are going the plan route, years of maple has definitely taught me that a higher priced permanent is better than a cheap temporary.
---
I think you're right, and it's pretty fucking sad. 
---
It kinda reminds me of how Rumsfeld just evades the question and refuses to say "yes" or "no" when you ask him directly if he's a lizard person.
---
It'll be in the ATOM shop for $60-$80 soon enough.
---
your still getting 20% over Adventure....
---
Tech data turn ins. The dirty Army fatigues are commonly thought of when ppl ask. Almost 700 hrs in and only seen one Army fatigue, not dirty, drop from a tech doc turn in.
---
They'll be single use items. We all know they will.
---
We?
---
Haha I hope that legendary vendor will be worth it. Many people (myself included) are having stash and overencumbered problems holding on to those useless legendary.
---
Or maybe a dialysis machine to filter out radiation?
---
I regularly watch Battlestation but hes on Twitch.
---
No! That's impossible!
---
I'm down to try and use the reddit discord for the SBQ, I get outta class at 6 PST. I also have a keycard.
---
Just go into photo mode.
---
Me and my people I play with.  Is that more clear for you?
---
Are the metal legs and arms different? The leather ones are all the same i think
---
Given that plasma does half energy, half ballistic damage, it's not identical to a normal plasma rifle, but it's not as good as, say, an AA hunting rifle compared to a normal hunting rifle.
---
I take it from your faction tag you don‚Äôt agree, and I‚Äôm pretty sure I know why.
---
That's right around the corner fron my camp. Love popping up there and launching a few now and then
---
When I first tried to make Nukashine for the life of me I couldn't find a Nuka Quantum so I gave in and bought one from this soda fountain. 5/5 service.
---
It's a huge cap sink right now. I lose 300 plus caps every time I die. It makes me actively avoid pvp. I like playing it but its too dang spendy. 
---
There is always some dude who spots you quicker and then it's over. I die 3 times and it's 1000 caps. I avoided survival all weekend because I don't really need more experience. It just costs me money to level up. I've only been playing to get the legendary rewards right now, then hop back on to adventure mode.
---
I think maybe they need to "cap" it at 150 caps each time you die. Or maybe change the way the leader board works.
---
Ammo and chems; I carry way more at any given time than I should.
---
Yup, thanks Gajatu, the theory has been thoroughly disproved. Which is great news in one way. However for those who have not dropped paint yet its further proof of their terrible, terrible luck.
---
I‚Äôm sure you don‚Äôt.
---
Many thank! Mousewithoutborders, will need to check that out.
---
Sometimes in the silo\`s you will find army fatigues but not "clean" or "new"
---
Why would it die?  It would help level the playing field and weed out the idiots and trolls who are using the system.
---
And if I player loses his caps to someone else and keeping pvping you when he has zero then what?
---
‚ÄúMutation **Annulment** Serum‚Äù
---
So can this also remove a specific ex?
---
I don't recall where I saw the list but certain weapon mods increase and decrease ap cost per shot. The Only one I do recall is long barrel increases cost.
---
Other then that want extra agility for ap or perception for accuracy though a vats hit chance would probably work better with crackshot for minimum 53%. I would personally go with agility armour.
---
As for a weapon vats hit chance with reduce vats cost with prefix of choice. Though a nice executioners with vats critical damage and vats increase rate would be a great find.
---
Never saw the harm in this as the stew spoils anyway. It's not like you can store a huge surplus of it to keep overtime.
---
Even if you could put down more than 1 marker it would work. It should give you like 10 different color ones to choose from.
---
I really hope they don't make camps immune ‚Ä¶ it is part of the fun of the game and one of the things you can't control... sh&amp;% happens IRL that is unfortunate and unfair and I like that it can happen in 76 too...
---
Surprising no one... **Bethesda did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the apparent reversal.**   [https://kotaku.com/bethesda-plans-to-sell-fallout-76-repair-kits-for-real-1833893961](https://kotaku.com/bethesda-plans-to-sell-fallout-76-repair-kits-for-real-1833893961)
---
Well then please, by all means tell me.  I‚Äôve played in survival every day since it launched, so I‚Äôve come across every kind of player and team and observed their tactics.  Nothing I haven‚Äôt seen so try me.
---
I feel the same way, and I think this article sums up the feeling rather nicely: https://unwinnable.com/2019/04/01/alone-at-the-end-of-the-world/
---
Or cap limit at 50
---
Untz untz untz untz, oooo, check me out!
---
Cause those are the idiots who play survival and make up a large part of it..again it just wouldn‚Äôt last..again just stay away from the heavy fight zones and you can make a decent bit of caps I pull a couple thousand a day and then none other days
---
Awesome thanks for a quick response üëçüèº

How to be past lvl 50

---
Before I started getting Drills! I got 3 star rolling pins every SBQ event and the explosive vent plan for ultracite PA. LOL
---
I got it too since I'm trying to collect all the survival mode rewards. And yes, the medics effect isn't that great. Vampire is way more powerful since you get the health on every hit. I'm keeping mine for nostalgia or future trade.
---
Holy shit you can craft nuka dark?!? How do I learn this power?
---
I wonder what the limit is for exactly. Is it a server stability issue? 
---
I've never had more than 3,500 caps. Most of the time I have just around 1,500. Prices on some of these items are pretty insane but people are willing to pay it so it's fair.
---
Starting at level 51 you can choose to move one point instead of selecting a perk card.
---
Feels strange taking the word of a *raider*
---
Wow..Level-headed and Reasonable! What level til can take *those* perk cards?
---
Does anyone even need them? I love how it went for something interesting like player vending to... repair kits for the next update. Big whoop.
---
Single-use repair kits for real money, and probably another silent nerf of weapon and armor durability to "encourage" you to buy them.
---
I agree with this , it is becoming too costly . I like to see reward but at the same time draining people of their caps using the current method seems like a deterrent.
---
Don‚Äôt talk back if you want to keep your caps
---
Launch yourself from one of them!  I'm really afraid to think those skeletons weren't actually skeletons when the raiders were actually using them though.
---
No, no you haven‚Äôt. Telling you my play style will mean nothing as you would just you‚Äôve seen it. Your reply will also deny this notion.
---
I like Oxhorn
---
Um.... What?
---
Like I said the other guy, I‚Äôve played every day since launch.  And they actually don‚Äôt make up a large part of it, they‚Äôre the minority.  I could name a list of 20-30 players who pop up in same servers all the time and use the system.  It‚Äôs the same dudes, not the majority.  And when they get butt hurt and taken down, they leave the servers and try a new one.  Happened about 6 times last night with my team.
---
Be greatful for what we already have.
---
This also makes me wonder how many players (ignoring the current limit) you could stuff into White Springs before it crashed the server. I find stuff like this really interesting for some reason.
---
I had someone interfere with an event I was doing, running between myself and the super mutants I was fighting.  Then I have no idea what was going on but I think they started throwing grenades at the cars which then exploded and killed me.  I just ignored them, respawned and finished the event.  Then I messaged them and called them out on their behavior, saying there was no need to pull malarkey like that, that they could have at least helped with the event and then tried to PVP me.  They immediately apologized and I said that if they needed anything that all they had to do was ask, and what they asked for, you can't even get from killing someone.  I had extra of what they needed so I called them back to where I was and gave them the items and we parted ways a few minutes later.  My hope was that I taught them that needlessly killing someone resulted in nothing (especially since I'd just dumped my junk at home), but that just talking to someone got them a reward.
---
It could be, it probably is but it could be a idea from Bethesda knowing that a market would form thus forcing people to interact, which if you remember was a big desire of there's before and during launch. 
---
If it was that it worked :)
---
See my other post about time available to many players, and what kind of time investment it takes to farm and build/rebuild.
---
I'm surprised there are so many people who choose the the Savage Divide as their favorite, to each their own
---
Its a random recipe given out as a reward for Biv's daily:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Biv
---
Took a while to unlock for me, I've been visiting Big every single day since that update dropped and I just got Nuka Dark recipe last week.  Quests and rewards are random tho, possibly weighted to favor recipes you haven't gotten yet, but I've gotten a few duplicate recipes.
---
Sounds like a very fair way to handle the posts to me.
---
Good point
---
Either Forest or the Ash Heap.
---
its since the last 2 patches for myself that and crashing soon as a event completes robbing me off any credit =/
---
This. The caps and aid are just a bonus.
---
My fav place in fallout 76 cus my name is Camden XD
---
/u/TheGeminaii always posts stuff without crediting anyone just for karma
---
GT is the same as my reddit name I'll be on for a bit around 4:30 pacific (2 hours from now), and then again sometime around 9-12pm.
---
The vault would be a great place for this.
---
Thanks eckserah, Everything tracks except the last part, everyone who has dropped the paint has dropped them rank order, and only after learning the previous rank. I myself dropped 2 sets of the same rank before learning 1 after which the next level started to drop. For that to happen by chance would be very low, for multiple to do it in that way as well, well thats lottery level chance.  Would love to see the data. I'm not sure I'd understand it, but after living this for a few weeks I'd be interested in the data behind it.
---
Took a video of me and three others fighting her inside Watoga last week. We took her down and got the regular loot. Only reason I fought her was because she was in Watoga, which was cool, otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt have wasted all that ammo. I think she ended up there after a failed Scorched Earth event.
---
Preech.
---
Everyone says this because a lot of sources say you need both, as they never tested it one without the other.... wasteland whisper is yes, for certain creatures, but you can still tame snallygasters, death claws, radtoads, and megasloths with only animal friend. (From my expierences)
---
It punishes high levels.
---
I posted this somewhere else. If they upped the value on gold.....say like 5 caps per piece of gold scrap and reduced the weight to bobby pin levels we could effectively trade caps for gold. Then the gold could be traded for high tier items. Basically then you could carry 125,000 caps on you.
---
They could even do the same for silver scrap. Just have in game vendors pay 2:1 on it. 
---
This would make those workshops with these mines awfully good too.
---
On a side note, do you have any links to guides or tips on what to sell? I'm around level 20 right now so I'm still questing but if there are any items I should keep my eye peeled for I'd love to know. I've heard chems are good to sell.
---
They should just make negative caps possible, so you go into debt and caps pay it off till you reach the threshold again.
---
Also, being broke in this mode is a big penalty.  I was trying to do the physical exam quest in Charleston when someone killed me and took the last of my caps.  My camp was way up by the ammo factory.  
---
Now I have a choice:  Do I go back home, restock and repair, and spend some time grinding caps to afford the trip back to Charleston in an hour to get back on my quest, or go to 76 and hope nobody is ganking vaulties and I can maybe make it back in 10 minutes and hope the killer moved on?
---
Going broke in this mode is easy and you have to deal with some harsh consequences.  Everybody needs to stop bitching about how their murder didn't get them caps and go find richer prey.
---
And the 40MM Grenades...had over 500 on me.
---
I just started playing a few weeks ago and am having a blast. The game is just getting better and the community is really great!
---
I'm fairly certain Taggerdy had every intention of nuking the Scorch Beasts, and it's no small wonder; they represent an extinction level event that makes the Great War look like an outbreak of flu. Radiation will subside over the years. A population of zombie-making hellbats? Not so much.
---
There‚Äôs a few uncommon items like that, yeah. First ones that come to mind are the golf club mace and the bone club. No hockey sticks I‚Äôm aware of though, sadly. I could see it as a skin for something like the spear though
---
Im about to hunt scorched with a crossbow and i have no bow or arrows i never use or keep this weapon.
---
I literally would say I‚Äôve seen it because I have.  There‚Äôs basically only 3 or 4 meta play styles so you‚Äôve got to be one of them.  Why is everyone so dumb on here and not actually up to have a conversation?
---
Is this hard to do? (No shade here) I got one on my first try during BETA but I often see it posted here
---
Um, no, no he's not.
---
She is a a loopy old bitch.  Gets lost sometimes and gets aggro on the robots. They were have supposed to have patched that, but it still happens sometimes.
---
Now that you mention it, I'm not sure. It feels like they take rads faster, but you're right that the card only mentions melee attacks.  I'll have to find a willing participant and test it :)
---
Why's that? I think it has the best views and I like the mix of trees/rockyness. Mines also close to everything I need too
---
From what I can tell animal friend is more for like normal animals like wolves, stuff like that and wasteland whisperer is more for like strange creatures like snallygasters for example! 
---
:) anyways thanks for the response
---
Definately keep me posted.
---
Repair kits. Get your wallets!
---
press your transfer button when looting the body and then click inspect. you're welcome.
---
It is the best when not modded
---
Learned something new! Thanks!
---
I can hope...I'd love a log cabin.
---
We're still on a crash course with the pay-to-win iceberg, as far as I know.
---
Nuka-Grape and Nuka-Dark both are absurd. Cola Nut lyfe.
---
Pretty much. Thank God for alt stashing lol
---
Sounds like you might prefer /r/fo76filthycasuals?
---
not yet...
---
:( :( :(
---
ya,apprently that's where cap trading originated from
---
What?
---
&gt; i spend so many resources keeping it from falling apart,
---
How much white knight do you have?  Did you fix it good?
---
Savage divide. It reminds me of when I had to go hunting for silt beans to make into soup cause I literally had no food. I still prefer to live there even after the main quest as it's a great central fast travel point. Personally, I hate the mire. Pretty much every enemy there is level 50+, features the rare creature known as the invincible scorched gulper, and for gods sake, defending any location there is borderline impossible.
---
Wouldn't know, I'm a lvl 80. I've heard it only drops as a 50 though
---
Miz Tracey has some great general content, especially when she shows off unique CAMPs.
---
I sent a friend request bitchboy ;) please accept so I can come put a couple 5.56 in your noggin. Only 3 survival servers for the entire PS4 community? LOL you are straight retarded.
---
There's even a Lake that others have said is a guaranteed spawn!
---

---
Building pieces as well would be nice like metal with designs similar to how USO had institute build set or even like slocum joe brick walls, etc.
---
So you think everyone uses one of these ‚Äú3 or 4‚Äù meta play styles? I called your bluff and you have now proved me right, because I don‚Äôt use one of the ‚Äú3 or 4‚Äù meta play styles. If I‚Äôm not wrong, this technically is a conversation.
---
Good Doggy + Can Do for life!
---
I would like to mention that in PA I have serviced hits with a TSE shotgun.  Although not every time but Fireproof perk almost mitigates the explosive damage of the TSE. That with Born survivor I have been able to survive many onslaughts.
---
AVR medical, in the lab where you get inoculated. Above Dr. Hudson‚Äôs terminal. When I saw it I felt a bit sad, cause all the Responders characters were so happy, unaware of their doom.
---
Yes this. Survival is fun but you have to stay on edge. Then coming back to adventure and having a blast relaxing.
---
I've run into an issue where my character stops swinging and I can't open my pip boy i just have to run away till i can do something again.  Uranium fever wasn't fun last night
---
Downvoted because you won't go away.
---
Agree with you. It was annoying af with all the repair kit posts just recently, and previously all the posts about pink parts and falling through the map. A lot of the posters just needed to scroll through the recent posts of the day and they would see they weren't the only one having issues. 
---
Sometimes I  just think it's people just wanting someone else to fix their problems, which is less likely if you're the 17th person to reply to an issue post.
---
From what I‚Äôm reading in the most popular posts I don‚Äôt think many people think it‚Äôs very game altering.
---
The biggest issue seems to be Bethesda breaking the promise they made in documentaries, tweets, interviews, and at E3. And people are afraid if they‚Äôre making a reversal on this decision, that future atom shop updates might have more of an impact.
---
Level 50 is the max for all armor and weapons
---
If you have every looked at a mole miner gauntlet it is HUGH...and the colors are eerily similar to the default E.P.A. Why wouldn't the mining gauntlet be able to  be used with this P.A.

---
It WK level 3 got "nerfed" from 90% (which was ridiculous) to 60% (which is stll pretty op).
---
There aren't any armor pieces or weapons that go above 50. Everything increases by tens, so if something is level 45 then it's max level.
---
Level 50 is the cap. Marine max level is 45, and Combat armor is 50
---
Omg thank you.
---
I think an interesting way to handle it would be to charge admission. Something like 5X your level, so a level 10 would pay 50 caps, level 100 would pay 500. That would be good for a day, with a clock reset at a set time‚Äîso you‚Äôre not paying again if/when you get server kicked. 
---
Award 25 caps per player kill but those caps don‚Äôt come out of anyone‚Äôs pocket. Players could still place bounties as well, which they would pay for as they do now. 
---
The game needs a cap sink at this point and really I don‚Äôt think most players are doing PvP for the caps anyway. 
---
Obviously those are just off the top of my head numbers, but it would solve the bankrupt player problem, the high level losing everything problem and the nothing to spend our caps on problem.
---
How is that not available to all players?
---
Its kind of hidden in the up stairs area. I believe the second floor.
---
What you do now is try to find the pieces with the best possible legendary effects.
---
Yes it's normal.  The humanoid mobs can spawn inside your camp building sometimes too.  I moved my reactor upstairs and have had no humanoid spawns inside every since.  Not too sure that's a thing, just a theory I tried out since they always went for the reactor first, or me if I was inside.
---
Well, it has attacks set up for shooting the quills, and afaik might also have kicks. It's also not a singular enemy you'll only fight once, as evidenced by the fact they can attack workshops, etc.
---
Its hidden around a corner on the second floor. Dont remember exactly where
---
I use all weightless ammo.  But ugh chems. I never seem to get rid of enough
---
Jug does camp builds
---
Dont play it. Especially if you are on old Fallout fan. This game is nothing like the old ones. An empty shell of what it could have been. Thats why see so many frustration over the internet or here.
---
Another reason why you shouldn't be allowed to go back and forth freely
---
I believe its on the second floor. Kind of hidden around a corner in an unimportant area
---
I can imagine! Fortunately I haven't run into that issue. *knocks on wood*
---
Lighter weight would be nice though I am already hoarding these items.  My main concern is over how much build budget they will consume.
---
I've only gotten like one or two slices in Fallout 4, legend has it if you got one you're a fucking GOD!
---
Always up for playing with new people . Gt is KindaTrash412
---
They aren't even real raiders. Raiders could take your weapons, chems, equipment, your flux...stuff that matters. All these people can do is take your crops and trash your stuff. They're just assholes.
---
I have possums crawling by my camp a good amount and my turrets don‚Äôt shoot at it. I think they only activate if an enemy is attacking you
---
Same here, my other world is wrecked but it's my home. Sometimes it does get lonely tho. I put my son to bed I'm no longer drinking cranberry juice I'm poppin radaway and killing scorched.
---
If you don‚Äôt agree with this you‚Äôre an exploiter and suck at pvp keep living in the dirt boys
---
ive had an issue this patch of legendary critters dropping their legendary weapons on the ground, god help you if you use explosives.
---
Ehhh....I tend to agree it's not very game altering and from what I've read utility items have a presence in ESO already, so this move isn't unprecedented. But I fail to buy into the doom and gloom crowd, as they've been trying to bury this game from day 0.
---
I think there are two categories of players. 
---
If you use out-of-game trading resources -- reddit, chatrooms, etc. -- then you can be an effective trader and make a lot of caps.
---
If you restrict yourself to only in-game resources, which amount to randomly bumping into people with voice chat or building up a friends list, then you can't really be a trader and you're restricted to the caps you find and the limit from vendors each day.
---
From an economy point of view, these two player bases are worlds apart. There's nothing wrong with either approach, but they might as well be playing two different games.
---
It will be interesting to see how in-game vending affects this gap.
---
It's worth considering that Gauss ammo only needs steel and lead. No gunpowder necessary!
---
I thought the Whitesprings Resort WAS the capital city hub or whatever?
---
I'm subbed to both, I enjoy the criticism here I just don't understand how filling this sub with repeat posts changes anything.
---
You have a mic? I will just give you ammo
---
Yeah, I  hear you. Not long ago I had some douche bag come and kill me and my friend for no reason. He chased us and then acted friendly, then proceeded to kill us again. What is wrong with people?
---
I would love to be able to have my camp in Charleston, lol I'd even pay atoms for it
---
i didn't even think they were real. I have close to 200 hours in game and haven't received one 3 star. Feelssuperbad
---
Check the metacritic score if you don't believe the critics:   [https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/fallout-76](https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/fallout-76) 
---
I think that answers your question :)
---
I do yes. I'm on right now
---
Nothing from the Atomic Shop can be traded.  Never has been.  It‚Äôs also stated in the info on the repair kits from Inside the Vault, which I assume you still haven‚Äôt read based on your consistent level of barely understanding the basics of what‚Äôs going on.  I‚Äôm sorry, but I don‚Äôt know how many times I have to explain ‚Äúrepair kit use‚Äù for you to understand it!  And if you don‚Äôt understand a basic concept like that, you sure as hell won‚Äôt understand the effect repair kits will have on interlinked pvp and pve combat systems...
---
Sorry, "Bethesda" ran off all of the quality people a month in :(
---
Buildable planters were one of the very first mod items added to Fallout 4. How they werent and still arent available to us in 76 is unfathomable.
---
I mean i agree and i'm all for my features/convenience stuff but they need to get the game in a better place before do anything like that in my opinion.
---
So why didn't you just log out? Instead sitting there and letting it happen? You can just jump servers, bro.

Except i play games that have literally the same things. And nobody complains. So you can lose the unwarranted hostility. I understand the concept VERY clearly.
---
Thank you all!
---
It always has a drab brown asthetics, but not in the cool way like in the Ash Heap, but the views and large pinewood forests are nice
---
It could be. West Virginia is supposed to be uninhabitable by Fallout 3, so that give Bethesda a lot of leeway in terms of messing with canon in 76. They can always say any changes were region specific and got wiped out by the "modern" era.
---
I would have no objection to them selling plans for community suggested items like repair kits for atoms. Honestly that‚Äôs kind of a fair trade off and it would give them an incentive to listen to our ideas. 
---
It takes time and money to make the things we ask for and those things weren‚Äôt planned into the finances of the game‚Äîso selling plans for them is fair game, at least to me. 
---
Turning then into potentially game changing consumables that gobble up our atoms and eventually money is an entirely different matter.
---
As long as it doesn't contain Atom Shop items or a fermenter, you can attempt to place it.  Successful placement is not guaranteed though.
---
This is addressed in my containers / utility opportunity feedback item for Inside the vault Jan 1 feedback.
---
An ideal design would be the ability for players to create a clan or faction, which has a type of container buildable to enable sharing of items in a stash like item but that more than one character can access. WHo has access is determined by the members of the Unit. You could think of the word guild here when looking at online role playing gaming on the whole. Whether it was one or a few people who were very industrious or a much bigger group (especially if they have varying schedules and see each other in game much less than every day).
---
My feedback was aimed at explaining the biggest opportunities that are currently under utilized and unfinished in the game, with just a couple of broad areas, combined together into the different ways those areas can be finished and realized.
---
It will kind of disappoint me if they add something for just my own poor lonely characters on my single account, without thinking about the broader utility of having a unit of multiple characters, of which yourself and your own characters can be part with the option for others.. in your Multi Player online game.
---
ooo that's a very interesting idea. I like the thought of having gold and silver being worth more. It would also create a a few more areas of contention like you said.
---
What bluff are you calling haha?  I asked you to elaborate and now you won‚Äôt.  And yes in survival it‚Äôs basically 3 or 4 builds.  TSE handmades and rifles, shotgunners, vats crit this or that, bloodied this or that too, heavy gunner in power armor mowing people down with mini guns, melee with PA.  And a lot of these people use stealth.  Going back to the original point of why people don‚Äôt want to come in with caps and take everyone else‚Äôs I‚Äôm going to assume since you‚Äôre a ‚Äúraider‚Äù you like to take things and not lose them.  Or you have a level 3 off to the side collecting caps and dumping them like OP said and people are starting to figure out that‚Äôs what people are doing.  Or you come in with a 5 cap bounty.  Or maybe you spawn camp and wait the 10 seconds and mow someone down from afar hiding in stealth in the bushes.  OR maybe you legitimately obtain caps by hunting the top 3 people really well or collecting bounties and no one can kill you cause you‚Äôre sooooo god roll and amazing like everyone thinks they are in there.  The possibilities are endless!
---
Add in assasin and you will barely take any damage. Unless they know how to counter the effects of courseüòâ
---
People will just wait outside the perimeter. I swear this place WANTS to be trolled just so they have something to bitch about it. 
---
If I recognize any of your usernames from here, I would absolutely wait for you to leave the area.
---
Ah well good to know, sorry for the link issues, maybe it was because this was my first post on imgur
---
I'd wait a few weeks and see how the whole "repair kits = pay-to-win" thing works out.
---
What about some clean white walls for the inside?
---
How do you counter with melee?
---
Is there a chart somewhere with each masks rarity?
---
The horror of going inside the Tanagra Town tree scarred me. Switching on my headlamp and seeing all those crickets start hopping toward me scared the shit out of me the first time I visited the spot.
---
Your welcome, but I should have said not particularly useful either.  Lol. It's twice the weight of purified water, I usually drop off some of it around Flatwoods for the newbies.
---
Don't forget to add lone wanderer, assassins and consumables that give damage reduction buffs as well üòÄ. It is all multiplicative though, so they still take some damage. Also a crit or stagger cuts through it all
---
Is there actually Dross Toss there?
---
They also said the Atomic Shop would be for cosmetics only. Bethesda lies.
---
Stagger and vats crit
---
Can I get fries with that order?
---
It‚Äôs 15 dollars for good reason. You might end up liking it, some people do, but enough people don‚Äôt that a 60 dollar game is selling for 15 dollars in less than six months
---
Last night, I was running around Whitesprings with a friend and we found a three-star ghoul. Killed it and saw four or five pieces of legendary gear on its corpse. Couldn't believe it until my friend started freaking out, too.
---
Unfortunately, none of the pieces were that great, but it was still a shock seeing so many * pieces on one body. The whole system is unbalanced, but there's some weird good in with the truly bad.
---
Already drop it?
---
What about the fact that you can mine gold and thus flood the game with caps and thus devaluing caps and gold as trading currency.
---
I'm guessing you don't want caps for the furious pump? If so, how much?
---
I used to get majorly pissed at this stuff too.  Now, I enjoy it.  I NEVER initiate anything.  I only fight back.  Above all, know that you can simply move your camp and you get everything back.  Nothing to repair.  Second, defenses, if built high end, actually hurt them.  With tomorrow's patch, it'll seriously hurt them.  I used to have pacifist mode on.  Now I leave it off and fight back.  I actually enjoy watching someone high level head towards my camp and wait for them to attack.  It took me quite a while to figure out those secrets, but once you do there's really no harm.  I've never lost a fight that someone initiated, simply because you have such a massive upper hand.  Avoid the obvious setups and just server hop.  Then it becomes a lot more fun and less worrisome.
---
Well I've only griefed once and that was because they were blocking a unique spawn area but other than that idk why people attack others bases I mean it makes sense in the lore cause they are acting out as Raiders but I guess we need some sorta bad guy that makes us scared. (And yes I understand how it feels to be griefed)
---
This + wallpaper or drywall. I hate the interior of all the walls
---
Vendor them until the bots run out of caps, then leave them in the nearest container for someone else to enjoy/profit off of.
---
And make the mod require anything else but cloth  to make the "canvas" bag. You know, for realism.
---
Preach üôè
---
I like my AA Prime Gatling Plasma. It actually lasts most of the fight after the buff!
---
Why not just go the the animation factory??
---
Krampus Todd
---
I don‚Äôt regret subbing to filthy a couple months ago. It was a welcome change from this tumor of a sub.
---
Are there any stagger increase perks for melee? Does VATS crit negate armor effects, perks and armor dr?
---
I still like my TSE Gauss, honesty.
---
Now imagine what you're missing since they didn't implement the free unicorn policy with survival.
---
I took Cola Nut and Party Girl so this spot is essential for me. I usually buy out the whole stock as the grape removes an absurd amount of rads compared to RadAway, the orange is like Diet Nuka Quantum, and Nuka Dark coupled with Bufftats take my strength from 4 to 15.
---
Can we get the original spoilage rate and not buy refridgerators. Apparently I cant make a steak that lasts a day but I can cure an F'ing ham at home and make it last a year.
---
Atoms can be earned free, sure, but they can also be bought.  That‚Äôs the key thing here.  If Atoms were ONLY earnable in-game, then Bethesda wouldn‚Äôt be catching hardly any flak for adding non-cosmetic items, I‚Äôd imagine.  That someone can BUY thousands and thousands of Atoms if they so choose, and then turn around and buy items that directly affect combat, is why people are complaining that this is a P2W decision.
---
As for the other hypothetical stuff like (Atom-based) fridges or mailing junk to your camp, those DO STILL effect gameplay, albeit indirectly.  If you can stockpile stuff like deathclaw, gulper, radstag, or mirelurk meats, then you basically have access to and endless supply of +1 or +2 to STR, END, PER, etc.  while not a huge boost, it does add up and make a difference to how much you can kill, how quickly you can do it, and how much you can (literally) run off with afterwards.  Add to that a potential ability to send carryweight back means someone could grind for a LOT longer without interruption.
---
If this stuff is just implemented in the game as a lootable plan or unlockable ability, then awesome!  I love those ideas too!!  But if it‚Äôs an AS purchase, it‚Äôs a measurable advantage that can be bought with real-world money;  that‚Äôs what people mean when they say ‚ÄúPay to Win‚Äù
---
Had one a long time ago but I was never one for energy weapons so I never used it.
---
Your bluff was assuming I play a meta build.
---
What would you recommend if I'm trying a melee/shotgun build? I'm at 15 str and I use poweexcessiver armor so that seems
---
Vats crit ignites armor and you can stagger them with power armor
---
Forgot about lone wanderer. So, if I did my math right, it's a 81.5% damage reduction not including armor dr...
---
I am going to upvote you because I wrote up a post on this previously and got downvoted for it.
---
I must just be lucky, two good splats from my hammer and they give up that sweet meat.
---
That's really the only downside. However if the dev's put a limit on extractors to say like 10 gold per hour or something it could be mitigated. 
---
You can also find gold and silver watches, and table wear scattered all over. This would allow "pacifists" to make some money as well by scavenging.
---
Again this would make the mine sites, ore nodes, and workshops valuable. Just like in real life.
---
Worth no more than 409 atoms to me, that goes for any wall sets, and white brick should be free.
---
Right. Hehe :)
---
They've said in the past that you flag items in stash for sale to make them show up in the vendor.  So yeah, I expect it will be similar to the fermenter.
---
I legit have a phobia to crikets irl. The mere sight of one freezes me for a second and makes me gasp lol. Im only level 32 and encountered a group of them recently, never had i dropped so many grenades.
---
Bethesda said it would be cosmetic-only, which is why so many people are in an uproar.  Your argument has nothing to do with that.
---
Just collect all the plastic you see and then bulk up your materials. The only way vendors in game buy them is if they are bulked.  You can make good money selling wood, steel, etc. All very common items.
---
I am getting on now if you‚Äôre interested. I‚Äôll be at vault 76
---
That's the thing - Raiders are weaklings.
---
You can get a 1000 caps for a 1\* bloodied item as long as the base weapon is a commonly used one. I sold a 1\* Bloodied Grognak for 1.5k on PC.
---
At level 20 it will be a bit hard to make huge amounts as weapons and armour sell for the most but weapon and armour drops are levelled so you will only get things around your level.
---
Legendary weapons are the main things to look out for. even a level 25 weapon if it is 3* with really good effects it will sell. 
---
The other issue is that players at your level tend not to have a lot of caps (there are exceptions of course)
---
But everything is worth something to someone:
---
Disease cure : 15-25 caps each
---
Super Stimpacks: 30-40 caps each 
---
Treasure maps: 10-20 caps each (to the right person)
---
X cell: 35-45 caps
---
Stimpacks : 25-35 (unless you can fam them, keep them)
---
Stealth boys: 45 caps 
---
Healing salve: 10 caps each (easy to make lots of)
---
Plans: 10-150 caps depending what they are 
---
now ammo sells!
---
5.56mm ammo is always in demand, unusually goes from half a cap to 1 cap each. Some big traders may buy it for less and sell it for less but in general Half a cap is a good price.
---
45 also sells
---
all ammo is about the same apart from 5mm as you can make thousands with relative ease 
---
Missiles and mini nukes don't really sell, their heavy and you can find them all over.
---
When you get down to it anything will sell if somone wants it, I stock most things including junk as some higher levels don't really want to spend a lot of time farming for materials when they have 25k caps and it's easier to buy.
---
hope that helps
---
Price
---
Just started using it today for a little. Gotta get the perk cards up but it‚Äôs pretty sweet so far
---
Ya, this should really help out both groups of players. The hard core traders will have more exposure and the in game traders will finally get some exposure. Should be a win/win.
---
Technically you could be put over your weight limit if you're on the cusp. Once I was running from a couple of beefy Yao Guais and that fucking prize bot gave me 100 Pre-War Money, which pushed me over and forced me to stop sprinting.
---
Not saying it's likely, but it could technically happen at an inopportune time.
---
Thanks! I appreciate it!
---
Does crit it ignore both armor dr and legendary effects?
---
Right?  It‚Äôs the guys who come in with no caps downvoting ü§£
---
If you equip cola nut, drink, then remove, does it keep the added effects?
---
Man, after all the chaos that working with public is, who doesn't like to see. World set ablaze and be a bit loner?
---
That doesn't matter. I used to be a maxed gunslinger rifleman combo with a medics pipe bolt action. Medics still sucks.
---
I understand that. But everybody hates the game anyway. All people want to do is bring bethesda down. Theyve definitely had their fuck ups. But the game is going in the right direction. If people are this angry I don‚Äôt see how the game has such a large consistent player base. Seems like reddit is the minority.
---
But I digress. You‚Äôre absolutely entitled to your opinion, positive or negative, as is everybody else. No sense in bickering about it.
---
Ditch action boy and the only charisma perk you should run is lone wanderer. Starched genes and all crit perks (four leaf, better crit, grim reaper) plus bloody mess. Remove serendipity. You should have 15 percerption, 14 agility, and 14 luck. Use dodgy in agility as well as covert operative, adrenaline, and gun fu. Strength should be ignored. I run blocker there, rank 1. Obviously rifleman, (normal, expert ,and master) as well as tank killer and concentrated fire. Endurance you only need for fireproof. Intelligence, you want demolition expert maxed as well as nerd rage. Yes it is bloodied build. Required for maximum possible damage output.
---
Now you pick either gauss rifle, or Dragon. Bloodied with secondary explosive stat. This is the maximum possible damage rifle build weapons.
---
Mutations that are important is just adrenal reaction. I use speed demon and marsupial too as well as eagle eyes for more perception. ( You can see other players in pvp long before they see you, if not hidden.)
---
For the icing, you can run sentinel assassin armor set and be unstoppable at range lol. Pop a stealth boy, and you are literally unkillable. Because they cannot vats your head.
---
This is my build, and what I am confident, is the highest damage outputting rifleman build possible. I would like to be shown otherwise, as I am always wanting knowledge.
---
In game, one can send a heart emoji to someone and not get fired for sexual harassment
---
&gt;So Bethesda, how about balancing it out and allowing the loot pool for 1\* enemies to randomly include 3\* loot?  
---
&gt;its only right!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
how is this humor?
---
Really ain't worth it you make the ammo you loose defending the workshop. That's why I really never use workshops only for fusion cores but I only make fusion cores for queen but the queen loot not worth the ammo :(
---
Not that I'm aware of  it's kinda glitchy I've noticed. Putting wrong marker on top 3 players or showing different mb smes to my teammate. I know ppl can atleast see me as I'm hunted alot once I'm in the top 3
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I was thinking. Someone said they wanted cabins for their camp because they have a clan and I immediately thought of camp venture
---
What explain to me again
---
bro you're supposed to delete posts when you're done trading, or at least its common courtesy
---
LOL I like the way you think!
---
They'll be adding it to the Atomic Shop for just $199.99! What a deal! One day only!
---
PREACH MY BROTHER!!!!! PREACH!
---
Yeah. Sorry

Here's a link to the resource I use. Don't want to take credit for someone else's work.

---
Okay one sentence answer even though I explained myself.
---
I don't think it's a terrible idea. I'm curious what ideas Bethesda has. I like survival but right now (like my earlier post stated) it's way to costly for me. Also it's silly to put a bulls eye on the people who stay alive the longest. I think it should be ranked by player kills with a large search area on the map for people in 1st, 2nd, 3rd. 
---
Right now there is no real reward for this mode. The top three should get more experience or atoms or something. idk
---
Yes!  Thank you!!
---
Seeing their corpses laying about and then seeing them smiling...Bethesda does great world-building.
---
I was thinking like white spring walls? I would totally make a casino
---
.... and two pieces of plastic ....
---
Vault 51.
---
Maybe one free fast travel per day?
---
I sure hope so
---
Nice. For PC right now the best is a NvMe M.2 harddrive that plugs into PCI
---
I use a pressure plate on the inside that activates the power.  Step on it, open the door, walk out, door closes.  Took me forever to figure out how to connect it all properly.  My light OCD HATES having to reverse the door though.  Seriously bethesda, you couldn't make a simple door like this?  The fact that it's so convoluted seems like it would be even more difficult to program.
---
I keep telling myself this. I really hope they have something planned for both the alien blaster and the space station
---
Or Lincoln logs
---
***COMPLETELY OFF-TOPIC POST***
---
It's not an official Microsoft app, but is made by an employee, so you gain the benefit of knowing it's safe along with knowing it'll be flaky at times lol It also provides a quality of life to emulate multi-screen that lets you copy and paste stuff across the network. Great for text, but it only works on single files (not folders), so making an archive first is ideal. Even then it has a size limitation and for larger stuff you're better off using the built-in explorer network transfer feature.
---
Though be aware that with Windows 8 (and thus, Win10), they ruined gaming on multi-monitor systems. Any full-screen program technically, but that mainly comes down to games. At any rate, the issue is that now the games will minimize if you move the mouse to another screen (or in this case, the other 'computer' with this program). 
---
***BUT*** that's only be default due to what the program does, which is "hide the mouse cursor off-screen" to better simulate that you've switched monitors.
---
There is a work-around, albeit not as elegant or functionally useful, either. In the "Other Options" tab you'll find  *"Hide mouse at screen edge"*, and so just make sure that's unchecked.
---
For reference, I have mine configured as such, listing only what's Checked, some of which are defaults:

---

---
------------
---
Easy Mouse is just the ability to let you freely drag the mouse across windows. If disabled you have to hold CTRL while dragging beyond the edge of your screen. The logic here being that it's problematic while gaming to have your mouse suddenly drift screens lol
---
**NOTE:** With Fallout games, since Win10 now is annoying and doesn't let you hide mouse at screen edge... If you use the Pip Boy to unlock your mouse and you're on your AID menu, there's a chance of consuming something since the click is still processed on the originating system :\ If viewing the map all it does is create a way-point marker, so no big deal there, just 'tab' is easier to press. heh
---
I like how it's good art, but not overly sexualized.
---
Or increase the effectiveness of travel agent so cross map travel is maxed out at 10
---
Thank you for your response.  Sorry this is not a poor me question but trying to understand the psychology behind this new young community.  People transferred their emotional state into adulthood, stemming from adolescence.  It would appear that young people have a new medium in which to transfer their aggression and state of mind.  Before this new medium there was no real way to let that aggression out.  Is this a new way for some to let their aggression out or a step closer to letting it out in the real world.
---
Ok fine I‚Äôll point you to it since you can‚Äôt read. It‚Äôs at the very bottom of the post. Congrats you‚Äôre illiterate and a dumbass.
---
Stories aren‚Äôt made up, I remember seeing you have a workshop and taking it, then killing you a few times as you tried to retake it. I‚Äôm not surprised you don‚Äôt remember, hell you can‚Äôt even properly read evidence you requested I provide, so you repressing bad memories of me whooping that ass is again no surprise.
---
Because claiming the workshop costs me 25 caps for 20 atoms, while dying  costs 173 caps and all junk. (My level is 173)
---
yes I agree.
---
I was gutted to hear they put it back till May, in fact I put a post on about it and it was not well recieved haha.
---
After reading some sources apparently Bethesda had not included an option to view stats on legendary weapons. and since the decision to buy a legendary weapon is largely based on stats it makes sense to be able to see what they are. So in order to include it they have had to delay it.
---
It will be very interesting to see what effect that has. 
---
I suppose it depends how they work. Will it have it's own weight limit (which if low would kinda suck, but could potentially free up stash box space) or will it link directly to what you have in your stash like the fermenter station does.
---
Personally I hope it links to your stash. If so it will completely change the trading landscape.
---
I don't really advertise weapons on Reddit much bit I do post when I am online sometimes and set up a nice Trading post too. I have a decent amount of people who rountinly come by but just imagine allvthose wounderfull and powerful legendary weapons out there fro. people who don't care about trading and just stick them in their vending machine for a few caps. It will certainly disrupt things for a little bit.
---
I know I will be looking for every camp I can possibly find for a few weeks
---
I keep _hoping_ it's like the poster for the Brewing. It's in the store, but anyone gets it.
---
Not holding my breath. But if that's the case the whole thing will be one of the world's greatest overreactions.
---
I get this - and would suggest moving your camp to a location that no one goes to - I have had 2 semi-permanent camp locations that are remote and have only had my camp messed with once... location selection is everything... and there are plenty of good spots.  
---
That being said, If I came home and my base was destroyed I would either 'move' my camp and repair everything for a handful of caps, or make that night's adventure gathering mats for a repair... just like it would be in a real wasteland if that happened.  
---
The 1 time I was in camp and someone messed with me, there were 2 choices - run or defend my camp.  just like it would be IRL... I ended up falling back to the tree line and killing the guy with my sniper rifle, he came back and I killed him again - he was 50+ levels higher than me and although this was unplanned it was one of the most gratifying moments I have had in the game... which is why I don't want them to make CAMPs immune - just my opinion of course, I know many disagree... 
---
I like 76 to be a post-apocalyptic simulation as much as possible... and post-apocalyptic wastelands are not conducive to permanent homesteads hahah - sometimes you have to cut bait and start over somewhere else...
---
Funny how different playstyles result in different deficits...
---
I'm always hunting lead, plastic, and screws. I always have more steel than i know what to do with, and sooo much gunpowder, it causes weight issues
---
I can sell you some
---
I agree with this. The risk and fast travel hassle was worth the reward at double. I had way more fun in survival this weekend. It definitely made it fun with so many people leveling new characters. I only ran into two or three dupers with crazy gear. Would be great to see a mode with no existing characters and double xp. Finding perfect armor takes weeks without the duped market available. Really levels the field.
---
Basically anyone apart from juice head or polar bear igloo
---
I think they changed the caps limit around the same time they were cracking down on dupers. I think it was part of the solution to prevent people from accumulating mass amounts of caps from these items... not sure if they‚Äôd increase it again if they aren‚Äôt 100% confident they‚Äôve fixed the issues. I‚Äôd guess they haven‚Äôt because those banned players are still waiting to be invited back
---
And it would be awesome to identify a medic for ur group before u ask them too dont u think? The hoarder its a great idea too
---
Anytime. Don't forget that since people whether own builds and requirements it's hard to gauge prices for most things. 
---
The only thing you can be sure of is that if you happen to come across a Two shot level 50 exploding amour piercing handmade rifle you are rich!! as I will give you good caps for it haha
---
Corner stairs are so much needed.
---
I can‚Äôt get my turrets to attack hostile creatures. The bunnies and squirrels should be just fine
---
Easily abused though
---
FT to camp
---
FT to location
---
FT back to camp
---
Log out &amp; back in
---
Would need a cooldown, but it‚Äôs a swell idea
---
Better yet... free travel to train stations. Because why is this still not a thing
---
No ATOMs, just DLC or added to the base game.
---
Maybe even make it a mailbox for your camp that you can use to 'mail' items to your other characters.
---
A lot of generalization throughout this thread, which is pretty lame. I agree those raider RPers are asshats but that is not everyone. People doing that stuff miss the whole point of raiders (or just don't give a shit and want to rudely shit on people) in RP which is that Raiders don't want to destroy everything, they want to take it. They aren't there to destroy everything good, they are just crazy people who want a better or more fun life and are willing to kill to get it. RPing is meant to be fun for both parties though but there aren't any systems in the game to allow for a raider RP to be anything other than murdering people/camps/workshops and this is where the problems arise. At the moment the only way to play a non griefing raider is to be a creepy good boy raider, who stalks and spooks players sometimes leaving little gifts. For example, I once saw these two fire breather lookin dudes exploring the ski resort, so I figured out where they were heading and got in their path. Waited around a corner for the one in front and when they entered the door I advanced towards them with my black overalls, sack hood, and pole hook. The dude freaked out and fired a shell in my face then after their panic subsided we gave thumbs up and moved on. This is what Raider RP should be, keeping the game world tense and spooky while also adding to others' playthrough. Murder hobos are not raider RPers, just asshats.
---
You restated your point from before and then added crap you thought was relevant to me because my Reddit handle says, ‚ÄúRaider‚Äù.
---
Nahh, it's fine as it is. Look at it this way, if you spend 250c each session on FO76 then you have to earn it back to stay flush with caps. So this 'encouragement' brings you into more events, more interacting with certain enemies that drop caps , ie supermutants, this keeps you active on the server longer. Hell, if you're a cheapskate and find fast travel abhorrent, then walk, you never know what you'll run into out in Appalachia.
---
Wait... I thought rad-x hindered the mutations.
---
Thank you for this. Saves me a ton of time.  Haha. I agree. 
---
I run bloodied however with radiation filled up and healing factor on so I would get clacked maybe. I like to turn on radicol and get that extra strength.
---
Ha will do! 
---
Things should be even easier (presumably) once player vending is in the game.
---
Agree with who?
---
You could be right. I understand what you mean but it's so easy to have a mule account or multiple accounts it doesn't really stop people from having as many caps as they can get. 
---
They must have as I have seen Sentinel armour going for 100k on here before now.
---
When mixing PVP with a game heavily about roleplay goes wrong. lol.
---
Ya I live the aesthetic of the area
---
Trying there now for the daily

I hope so. I love being a trader but I can't wait to get back to playing it full time and not having to fast travel back to my shop when somebody walks in.
---
I had a player today that tried to enter PvP with me because I had my base where this person base was supposed to be (plus being in that world for a few hours by then). Kind of made me feel like there not but one server to play on when he was trying to pick a fight. I really don‚Äôt know why people do that. Also only play in adventure mode to begin with. Plus a few day ago in a nuke zone there were high levels going around killing all the low level players. If your really that bad at a really PvP mode that you need to go back to adventure to get kills. You really need to rethink your build or something, to really pry on low levels trying to farm one of there first few nukes in adventure mode is pathetic to me. 
---
Sorry for my rant that just really pissed me off. I will end it there.
---
Well, like they say, automation runs West Virginia... So why not automate your shop!
---
You on now?
---
I think it‚Äôs an inflation thing. Allowing too much in circulation would devalue it. And with the inherent nature of players relentlessly finding unintended exploits and cap farming methods, it would make sense to limit how much someone can have. Like you said, it‚Äôs market stability.
---
Lol everything you‚Äôve said here is made up, including that, you can say all you‚Äôd like about me taking a workshop but you‚Äôve still yet to accept the friend request, you are the definition of all bark and no bite, and you‚Äôre not a very good bullshitter, I‚Äôm honestly laughing because anyone else reading this/will read this knows exactly how much of a dumbass you are, and the downvotes you‚Äôre getting prove that. I‚Äôm hoping you‚Äôll grow a pair today and accept the friend request so I can melt you with a round from my drum mag üòÇ
---
I‚Äôll hop on gt lil bewp
---
I get they want to encourage walking. But it'd be great if things you know, actually happened while you were. Too many long stretches of nothing but nice looking landscape.
---
Didn't want a nature hike, I wanted mutants :/
---
I will say though, if your farming the right stuff to sell, it's kind of a moot point. Especially as my cap stash is steadily growing &amp; I'm out of things I care to buy (at least regarding vendors). But even if my fast travel cost is 25 caps to get from CAMP to Watoga, that's basically one Sharpshooter Assault Rifle &amp; I won't really even notice the difference in caps earned.
---
No way in hell is 25 caps worth the actual time to walk there.
---
I see we have mutual friends :) better hope you aren‚Äôt hiding on one of their servers(more than 3 btw)lmfao
---
Found this to be real helpful
---
https://wvtourism.com/fallout76/fallout76-interactive-map/
---
I think we'd be better off using bobby pins in that case. Harder to farm mass amounts.
---
Imagine if we could build our own vendor bot! or several of them. It could take a super amount of junk or flux or somthing to do it so the servers wouldn't become too slow.
---
I would love to have a robot walking around my shop.
---
Maybe if corpses could be looted for weapons &amp; armor, sure, but Bethesda already fucks the CAMP/Settlement players enough as it is by making us pay through the nose for unique assets that fund everything else in the game that non-construction players get for free.
---
It only produces at the rate of one of them, the others just act as storage. The youtuber JUG did a test on this
---
I cant, im over encumbered and cant destroy the camp
---
It would make sense if 1 was defending &amp; 2 separate parties just happened to attack around the same time.
---
Just seems the game has no way to differentiate between friendly &amp; hostile workshop behavior.
---
Yeah i dont like the perfectness of the barn and i dont like the holes in the wood. This would be a perfect wood texture workaround
---
the other major frustration I had with camp was that once I accidentally built from a blueprint before I stored all of the components from my previous CAMP - INSTANTLY I lost most of my important materials including Steel, springs, screws, aluminum, adhesive, etc... So I did not get griefed, but I lost a huge amount of materials all the same - so I can relate to the feeling.  I was quite frustrated, but played it like a role-play that I got robbed etc... I made up my mind to go recover the materials.  Luckily, I ran across an friendly player who had way too much junk and was GIVING away huge quantities... he replenished everything I was missing and I made a new friend...  Wasn't what I planned to do that session, but was another great experience in FO76
---
Well having your tag be ‚Äúraider‚Äù opens up the assumptions dude.   Have a nice lovely spring day!
---
Because it's in the middle üòè
---
Thank you so I should let them fill up but it seems like it's taking days for them to fill up
---
To many players foot traffic is there not to do it and the place is big enough as is to fit more stuff
---
And honestly it should've been feature. Too many times Bethesda just removes all the fun from the game. This quest. Workshop factories being almost pointless...
---
I agree!!
---
News to me. Will enjoy wandering the area looking for it tonight.
---
cool.
---
It's a good spot to grind depending on who you ask, pulls in a lot of attention from that.
---
Its technically in a lower level section of the map as well. Can train there at low levels if your lucky enough to get it solo.
---
indeed.
---
They could also introduce something in game that cost a lot of caps to help keep they amount down, but that was unlikely or not possible to trade. Like a mega mutation or something that was worth 25k maybe something to help combat some of these God builds you see about but are hard to replicate as the items are so extremely rare.
---
It's also in the middle of ugly laggin. :'(
---
That would be awesome! 
---
Maybe you could even plot a route for it. It would be awesome to customize its look as well.
---
Holy shit. What‚Äôre you doing with all that luck? Is that an actual build? Are you made of wet paper? I have so many questions
---
I agree. Must be lag from having to load up all those French windows lol
---
I've noticed that for about a week that my ironsight damage is much lower than my VATS damage, even at the same distance. I don't have anything that would add bonus VATS damage either.
---
I'd argue that with bloodied builds though... they also die in one shot, so it's risk vs. reward. I wish they weren't a thing to be honest. I don't enjoy the play style all that much, but I have no choice really.
---
Improved repair kits will be drop-only by the sound of it.  Normal repair kits seem to be craftable, as they used the term ‚Äúunlockable‚Äù in Inside the Vault, but the wording of things in FO76 has been known to be wonky or misleading before...
---
Hell yeah k'nex ruled, those bendy connectables and snowflake looking things was the shit
---
I have 5500 fusion cells I'm looking to drop. Interested?
---
This is pretty much exactly how I'm doing my pvp build as well, same as small hidden camp out of the way.
---
Next time, don‚Äôt.
---
You can sell some junk without it being bulk, Gold and silver can be sold individually along with fiberglass spool frommscrapping laser weapons, ballistic fiver etc. 
---
If you have junk you never use stick the hard bargin perk on, load it up and see what the vendor will buy :)
---
You‚Äôre a cruel or mistaken person, and I‚Äôm not sure which. It remains perfectly preserved... forever. Unlike how you‚Äôll be after you trick someone into eating their rare, invincible pie.
---
If you hang onto some for now I'll be on in a bit to try and trade for them mate :)
---
Your welcome.
---
People have said you can transfer items to a world container to get them off without destroying them. Not sure if it works tho
---
Yeh, have a roving vendor bot. 
---
The game would just be hundreds of vendor bots walking about eventually haha. Would be pretty funny to see.
---
I recall playing Everquest years ago and the player-honoured Loot-and-Scoot policy.
---
If you were killed by another player, you were allowed to grab your stuff, but then you were expected to leave the area.
---
If someone didn‚Äôt let you grab your stuff, everyone in the area would come down hard on the Player griefing you.
---
If you grabbed your stuff and remained in the area, that player was free to kill you again, and again, until you left the area.  Other players would support that player, not you.
---
Times like these, FO76 really needs a Loot-and-Scoot policy.
---
I can confirm this, his name is Chad.
---
You cant SELL communist paraphernalia... You have to throw it at people and yell loudly till they put it on!
---
You must be joining a server a friend is on or you are correct it is random!
---
People will always find a way.  You can‚Äôt really do anything about mules so they‚Äôve at least made it inconvenient ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Thanks, I'm ftenftenften in game. I'll add you tonight.
---
Go see Biv...
---
What is the harm in allowing a free jump out? And why is it worse than the free jump to camp we get now?
---
I would gladly host an erotica radio channel purely for reading fallout fanfics.
---
For me its aid, have like a good +30 Nuka Cola quantums saved for the ‚Äúright moment‚Äù and just a hoard of Nuka Cola and Nuka Cola Cherry, but also weapons. My character is a Rifle user, yet my STASH is riddled with Heavy guns and melee, so I carry like 4 Rifles with me, and I still question how a fully-modded Handmade weighs more than a broadsider
---
Not necessarily think of them as a fuel tank they increase the capacity that you can hold while you're gone but they don't increase how fast they fill. I have found 3 industrial are plenty to hold everything that's generated while I'm out doing things and very rarely come back to all of them maxed. You'll have to find the right amount for your play style
---
Because of two reasons. First, the robots are there acting as bodyguards. When a deal goes sour they are there to step in. 
---
Second, when the vendor of Captain Kids says "welcome to Captain Kids" in a pirate voice it's the best thing going.
---
Couldn‚Äôt find you
---
You basically just used the ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt like this country, then leave!‚Äù line when someone complains of corruption or inadequacies in the government...
---
Hey you are really there still!    
---
If you guys aren't allowed to comment on the repair kit disaster can you at least say so?  ("We are unable to comment at this time, thanks for all the patience")  
---
I hope your higher ups realize how much of a "slap in the face" silence is at these times.
---
It's incredible how acurrate is the game from reality
---
Y?
---
Usually when that occurs when a drill or a syringer has replaced the legendary loot drop. Although in saying that I have rarely (more rare than getting 3 star loot) Had nothing drop. It makes me wonder if that's supposed to occur?
---
What‚Äôs your gt
---
Also, it's nice to be able to loop back for easy resupplies if you need to.
---
David Icke reference on FO76 reddit. I'm more of a Drunvalo Melchizedek guy myself.
---
He licked his motha. It was life or death.
---
And when you send that nuke in its funny to see them scatter like ants
---
I didn‚Äôt like that
---
Out-and-back free fast travel followed by a server hop would be mechanic abuse but free fast travel between train stations wouldn't?
---
Just edited to say why I'm thanking him. My bad!
---
How?   Aliens. That‚Äôs how. 
---
Same I‚Äôm the same way. I‚Äôm a rifle main and I have a few heavies, like 10 laser and plasma guns. And like 150  quantum‚Äôs just for that one day.
---
True True My first mule started out as just that but as I had my Mrs working the mule so it was quicker she decided she liked the game and started playing it for herself so maybe Bethesda realised that might happen haha
---
MODUS builds Enclave patrol robots at the Bot Stop. This is where we should be able to build our own robots as well.
---
I‚Äôve had two experiences so far where it was t KoS. One guy I just stood there and was gonna let him kill me since I didn‚Äôt have my PvP gear on, but he just emoted and walked away.
---
The other was when I stumbled on someone in the dark alleys of Watoga, both of us hunting a wanted man. I admit I found him chameleon‚Äôd in the dark first and opened fire, but he just emoted so I stopped and we hunted the guy down. 
---
I think this will happen more often, especially if there are more PvE incentives in Survival that promote OPTIONS for PvP, and not mandatory death matches.
---
It's all random encounters so it shouldn't really matter. Where I found mine was just a little bit north of Abby's bunker. Its a little area with a chain link fence and a small shack that's overgrown with a lot of big roots.
---
And yes for the mirelurk king all you need is animal friend and to be at least level 60. I don't believe they spawn under level 30
---
that guy is a lair and scammer. dont listen to it. its desperate and lonely.
---
That would be fun. Even if it only had a small carry weight or was linked to your stash.
---
Even if it did nothing it would still be cool
---
Has West Tek populated by level 5 super mutant outside multiple times recently. Inside was fresh and correct level.
---
Lol. OP finally clarified, anyway. My sad attempt at humor is crushed.
---
In the Wastelanders Season, the last silhouette looks like a sentry bot. Possibly a companion??
---
I do not appreciate lickage
---
For I am the M√ñTH
---
Are you suggesting video games cause real-wold violence?
---
I‚Äôd REALLY love to see this implemented!!!
---
Won't be on for a few hrs but my game tag is balmer84.
---
I'd be cool with that too. At the end of the day, I just want the game to be more user friendly and less of a chore sometimes.
---
Theory: The alien blaster from fallout 76 is just a toy, and the ammunition are just regular batteries
---
Whitesprings, Prison below the water park, or Watoga. 
---
Smash through those places while mixing in a few events.
---
Nvm I found it
---
Depends.
---
Because sh*t happens.
---
Can a regular sledge do more damage after it has been modded or is the super always better?
---
Who is?
---
Try inv me, I left my team. Says you‚Äôre not accepting invs
---
More cap sinks would be a great idea to counter raising the cap limit. Maybe they could start listing some cosmetic items in the atom shop for cap values also.
---
You have to hit back for them to be able to kill you, you initiated pvp
---
We should be able to choose whether they show over outfits or not
---
There is a perfect example of this in the real world right now.  Paper bills litter the streets of Venezuela, while the cost of clothing has skyrocketed due to insane inflation rates.
---
I like the idea of a motorcycle as I've thought for a while it'd be nice to fice up some of the pre war cars as an alternative to fast travelling
---
People are so angry because so many of us are such huge fans of the FO word.  I‚Äôve been playing since junior high on my whopping 2Gb hard drive laptop, and have played literally every fallout game since.
---
And Bethesda has improved a lot in the game.  Some aspects of it are hardly recognizable since release, in a good way.  But there‚Äôs still a lot that is in extremely poor shape, and then to have the looming threat of P2W show up (perceived or otherwise) sets a lot of us off.  We WANT this game to succeed.  We - or most of the ‚Äúwe‚Äù in this conversation, at least - don‚Äôt love to hate the game.  If anything, we might hate how much we love it.  It‚Äôs the same feeling I get whenever I hear there‚Äôs yet another Star Wars movie in the works: hopefully, but worried what might get weirdly messed with this time.  I still love Star Wars, and watch and enjoy most of the movie, even if I rag on certain parts of it.
---
Except the Han Solo movie.  That was a flaming pile of rotten bantha shit from the opening Title Non-Scroll.
---
Bethesda has confirmed that they are unable to do this because of server and engine limitations.  It is similar to the scorched queen fights.  Pretty much a side effect of their outdated engine and architecture not meant for large scale online worlds.
---
I mean, nobody wants them to respond to a majority of posts, we just want a response to one of them - at least.
---
My advice is finish either melee or shotgun perks. Set up your special points so you can swap builds once you have all the cards. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything wrong with having 15 str as 9 points minimum goes towards shotgun or melee perks.
---
Look up a build planner so you don‚Äôt waste levels.
---
memelord
---
I‚Äôm just hoping the other ‚Äúspecialized‚Äù vendors aren‚Äôt replaced by the faction vendors. 
---
I realize that most of us probably don‚Äôt exactly go shopping for kids toys at that store or buy clothing at the wardrobe store but I really like having the option. 
---
Plus, The Vendor that sells plans for WS ‚Äúantique reproductions‚Äù is someone I got to know pretty well considering I literally bought every single plan he had (over the course of several weeks, obv). He was always my first stop when I hit cap limit and needed to go on a spending spree. Unfortunately, no new plans have been added to him so no reason to go anymore. 
---
The toy and other vendors would be much more useful if we could actually place the items as decorations in our camps, but I know that has been discussed ad nauseum already.
---
You can. Scrap and sell bulk cloth.
---
yup I like this idea.
---
20% isn‚Äôt worth the dying, loss of stuff, and the long run backs. 100% is most of the time as long a I don‚Äôt accidentally pick a busy area.
---
thank god for you, they might have missed it otherwise
---
Because then people would then just jump back to their camp before travelling anywhere? That'd be the same as making fast travel completely free.
---
I'm confused
---
Oh that guy yeah I know he's bs's
---
It's pretty assinine that a multiplayer game has zero text chat.
---
I've heard the reasoning for it, but it's still bullshit.
---
I have like 5-10k I think sitting around.
---
Oh. Whoops. Sry
---
How much for 3000?
---
Power Armor joints don't bend as much as our knees, so you can't kneel in a Power Armor.
---
Think goat werewolf. Sort of like baphomet.
---
I can respect that. I‚Äôm personally just okay with anything they add, to a point. I just enjoy the game. I can play it with my pals regardless of gamebreaking bugs. Pay to win schemes. Extremely grindy gameplay (which im actually a fan of, but besides the point).
---
It‚Äôs honestly just disheartening to see SO MANY PEOPLE hate on bethesda
---
Whatever you typically pay I don‚Äôt really care.
---
If you really want to ‚Äúget‚Äù someone messing around with your base, build a hidden floor underneath a half wall filled with radiation traps linked to a switch.  Causes environmental damage that is outside of pvp consideration (for now, at least) and wrecks havoc on all those bloody/unyielding builds people love to run :)
---
I'm actually pissed deathclaws are crap in 76...  I get more challenge from a bear!
---
One of my favouritest things to do üëçüòä
---
Nuka Cherry upsets my stomach but the orange is really good. Goes great with Yao Guai ribs!
---
I got 1200 for 200. Are you on now?
---
No, they're popular on their own merit.
---
Mods are a nice way to extend the game and add a lot of replay-ability, but most players experience them without mods.
---
How did that end?
---
And it would be a super easy and convenient way to move your camp around because they are small enough to fit in most places. No more need to worry about your house blueprint not fitting or resorting to physics defying towers of doom (if you don't want to).
---
But then again, that adds an aspect of realism.
---
I like i like
---
It still seems like a fairly negligible advantage. Everything is so easy to get in this game, I don't see this making or breaking a scenario and leading to pay to win situation. I still don't understand why any of it is considered "winning". And I know we're supposed to blindly hate anything even remotely considered P2W, but in reality, why does it matter if other people are able to do some things slightly better? In a competitive game of course it matters, but the PVP is optional in this and these things won't make a difference in a fight.
---
Do we know anything about how we find the it or it abilites I predict it will be like the gatorclaw from fallout 4 nuka world, pretty much a deathclaw reskin
---
Okay there ü§£ so serious, it‚Äôs a video game man.
---
oh yeah then yea same thing with me.
---
I started doing it to make enough to sell to vendors to make 1400 caps a day.
---
These days that happens in about 5 weeks
---
You had me at ‚Äúcreatures fucked‚Äù
---
I will need a display case to show off my mini models.
---
Side note, do you know how hard it is NOT accidentally scrapping those?
---
Do you think Bethesda is stupid? Then just one person will buy the plan, and everyone can go to them, give them their stuff and have it repaired and take back their stuff. Bethesda is a lot of things; but not financially incompetent.
---
I am up to 4 slices.
---
Also, how hard is it to turn off camp damage from adventure players entirely? That'd solve the problem right there. It'd be hilarious when your missile turrets start going off, and are unkillable, so the attacker bolts.
---
right on the d pad is a stimpack, left switches weapons, down is emotes, up is favorite wheel, that is where you can map aid to...
---
It's not subjective at all. Does paying money, in any fashion, give you an advantage over someone who didn't pay money? The answer with repair kits is yes. This makes it pay to win like some garbage freemium game
---
I can be. Gt Jagerfish
---
We had *exactly* this in vanilla FO4, mods just made static decor. Nothing like bumping a shelf full of bottles or grabbing a foundation by accident...
---
oh
---
I wish the cards were more explanatory, I had no idea nuka cola could do all that
---
My two favorite. Steady stream of content as well
---
Truth be told, I do not think the Community Managers really care.  All I ever see them respond to are non-suggestion threads, like CAMP reveals, and only suggestions THEY particularly like.  The Log Cabin tileset for CAMPS was the only suggestion I saw that had a response from a Community Manager and that suggestion only appeared in the past few days.  I have seen many of the same suggestions and not a peep from a Community Manager.
---
Oh yeah, and the mass-animation might even make their game laggy, or if nothing else give a huge splash of yellow-green light with explosion-y sound effects that might freak them out &gt;.&lt;
---
Honestly, dumb weapons. Like all the rolling pins .....
---
It's a carry over mechanic from Fallout 4.
---
Whyon earth would you want to ruin that first few seconds where you run up on Squach in the mire and soil your X-01?!
---
Lol those Fallout physics get ya every now and then. I killed a scorchbeast with a gatling plasma couple days ago while still airborne. Turned into goo and went flying off. Me and another guy searched for ages. Up and down. No go, no goo!
---
You can do this in fo4 with the automatron DLC + the settlement system so it's definitely not much of a stretch.
---
Exactly. Hard to feel like survival is worth it at this point.
---
I got 1100 caps
---
It's not your system.  I'm running an Intel Core i7 7820X, an EVGA GeForce GTX 970 OC (only one monitor so more then enough), and 64GB of ram and I'm having the same issue off and on since the last patch or two.
---
Past the bar there's a pink room with a chandelier (and some weird black walls that look like spawn points or something) and off to the other side of the room is the little area with the soda fountain vendor.
---
If you're asking why you can't sell something, the answer will always be it's because Bethesda thinks it will break the economy.
---
Yes but beth blacklisted kotaku years ago so thats not surprising
---
Yep, from the vending machine.
---
I did as well and it has worked quite well to supplement my income. Also nothing beats handing a level 2 a stack of purified water and watching them get excited.
---
Nah. Grounded negatively affects Gauss damage. Trust me. I just removed 3 mutations to get rid of Grounded and my damage went from 139 back to 224.
---
Or just tag items to be excluded from any scrapping suggestions. I hate that the chess set robots in my stash keep coming up to be scrapped when I'm modding arms &amp; armor or building CAMP items. It's driving me insane.
---
You selling any more?
---
Nah fam gatorclaws were scary and in fo4 you had cito helpin you in fo76 you might have to face one alone like that will creep me out running around doin the questline while there is a giant goat-claw stalking me
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter ahah
---
So buying the chrome
---
I didn't say it was an MMO or RPG but was using it for comparison
---
I just want to make a place of worship, is that so much to ask Bethesda!!?!.
---
In seriousness I need these.
---
I imagine the frames would be horrible just trying to fit 24 players into the shop zone alone. XD
---
I doubt they would replace any vendors. 
---
That said, I'm going to be even more annoyed if they put the new vendors \*inside\* Whitesprings. I've always disliked having vendors in an area that require a loading screen, an unavoidable rubber band upon entry, and a useless run through an interior that completely breaks my apocalypse immersion.
---
It's safe to say I'm not a fan of Whitesprings in general, but the interior is by far the worst place in this entire game. If they go with that I'm going to have a shit. :-p
---
That's true too. It is ballistic though. Try shooting at a target with higher dr than er and vice versa. You'll see what I mean. By all rights I agree it makes no sense and is totally unintuitive but it's affected by dr. It's just a wonky gun in 76
---
Same has happened to me. The other day, I was trapped in a small room at WS with a legendary ghoul and a diseased ghoul and couldn't swing my axes for a long time. I couldn't find the door to run away (it was a tiny space and they had me blocked in. Stimpaked a lot and maybe my armor stimmed me too. I finally was able to switch to my lever action and finally kill them.
---
I've had it happen while fighting SB and the SBQ, especially when they land on top of me.
---
By buddy sent me a pic. It's pretty gnarly.
---
It's a central location, there are tons of locked doors that can be opened to make a new area, and the robots are a pretty good way to "encourage" people to behave as if you even scratch a bot everything will be hostile towards you.  It needs some optimization and maybe better carpets but it's the best place for it.
---
You mean, when a deal goes sour they're there to lag out everyone and crash the server? xD
---
I will say that I enjoy pirates. That's almost enough to make me forget how much I dislike the interior of Whitesprings... almost...
---
I think that FO76 has engaged a whole different audience than was playing the previous games before.  I have found that the core fanbase by and large are the pacifist/adventurer crowd that is more interested in co-op and roleplay and/or socialization.  The younger fanbase grew up on action/FPS games and multiplayers like Quake, TFC, Counter-Strike, etc.  They have completely different expectations of what Fallout really is. 
---
Unfortunately Bethesda chose to throw us all in the same pot, which was initially a bad decision IMHO.  They've only recently started to separate the two fan bases into Adventure and Survival.  But it is the "Adventure" crowd that is in it for the long haul.  I think the FPS shooter peeps will get bored (quickly) and move on.  They have a really short attention span from my observations.
---
I have pretty much avoided PVP altogether aside from a couple of incidents.  One where some thugs was harassing a fan made group event and we PWNED them for a while.  The other was where I was one-shotted over and over and over at a workshop.  That was complete and utter B.S.  Proof positive that PVP is severely unbalanced and that overpowered weapons, perk card stacking and bobble heads have no place whatsoever in a PVP environment.  There is no way possible that a level 20 can go up against a level 250 character and survive.  Utter ridiculousness.  PVP in workkshops even needs to be removed in workshops on adventure servers.  They have no place in a co-op environment.  Not only that, but it goes against the core message of the game's intro where we see the vault dwellers leaving to rebuild hand in hand.  Not against each other.
---
Yes, that is a possibility, but that wasn't the question. The question was why can't prewar money be sold? Dishrags, and hell even toilet paper, can be sold to vendors without scraping them, both of which also scrap for 1 piece of cloth, just like prewar money. So, why can't prewar money, with a monetary value of 1 piece of cloth (or 1 cap) be sold without scrapping it? They were able to be sold straight to vendors in previous FO games, so what changed?
---
If you have a buddy, get power leveled in whitesprings. If you dont, then spam events as much as you can. I would recommend rushing through enclave quest to get the events from them too.
---
Anno im probs goin to die of a fatal heart attack when it stumbles upon me
---
Add me on psn: purpleduke_15 
---
I'll be on tomorrow
---
I remember seeing them outside nukaworld in fo4. I usually just ran.
---
Now that I have marsupial and explosive shot shotgun I jump and roast them alive.
---
VENGEANCE FOR RUINING MY NUKAWORLD EXPERIENCE.
---
They had thus feature last patch took it out probably by accident. It needs to be fixed before player vending.
---
It's where a lot of players spend time (other than Watoga, and that's not welcoming to low-level characters). Like any good business robots, they're going to where the customers are. Location, location, location.
---
I‚Äôll be on later I can sell 3k more then
---
Still have yet to get one.
---
Lmao that‚Äôs the horrible truth of it, if cryptids are really running around the WV Hills, I want to be scared the bejesus out of when I turn around to see Squatch. First time I saw Mothy in the mire is one of those moments in Fallout I‚Äôll never forget
---
Ants too!!! Hate the bastards
---
Some decent points are being made. Even still, it's the least apocalyptic place in an apocalyptic game... Megaton and Diamond City are spinning in their graves. xD
---
It happens to me too. Seems if you are in a party/team some of the loot and drops are shared. It's hit or miss. I've been searching for plans and mods and when my buddy picks them up they disappear. So now when farming, I prefer to do it solo now.
---
Some of the posts that hit hot are clear circlejerks and karmafarms.  I can't stand browsing hot sometimes because it feels like a bunch of spambots
---
Don't you find it in a pool of toxic sludge? Could that not have eaten some of the mighty AB's effectiveness?
---
Im not a pistol build, but I feel like they could use some love in a future update.
---
That's not a bad idea but considering that's currently the only additional income they have I doubt they would.
---
Their reversal was the exact polar opposite of what people actually wanted "give us npcs?..... how about pay to win items in the cash store" how do they get it so wrong..
---
Why Executioners?
---
There are tossing booths, but nothing with that theme. (Then again, I haven't been there in 20 years.)
---
Beta ended didn‚Äôt it
---
Still broken!
---
ATOM locked Silver chest timers.
---
Im the same with the grafton monster toke it down at level 7 I was so proud and thought I was a natural then a few levels later I visited whitesprings...
---
Can you show a picture of the prisons location I cant find it
---
I love that actually
---
Looks like that guy that asked for the fire breathers skin is getting what he wanted, hell yeah
---
Yeh I had loads defending my vault :) But considering that the servers struggle as it is I doubt they could handle an additional 20 or so robots on each server once everyone had them.
---
They could of course just get rid of scorched beasts to make room on the servers for them haha their pretty pointless creatures as far as the game goes I feel
---
Ha ha! Good point.
---
No survival mode is definitely still in beta. The game itself isn't though.
---
As long as it kills.
---
This would be a much better fix. QoL cards need a boost sometimes.
---
I think they most likely respond to suggestions that actually make sense. I have been in this subreddit before the game was released and community managers definitely respond quite actively. Obviously they are not going to respond to suggestions that are quite impossible for the game now, like suggestions that basically calls for an entire new DLC.
---
If I had the room I would max it out but unfortunately I'm capped with 2* for that card.
---
I can remember running up on Grafty at the Charleston Train Station as a level 8 with a baby hunting rifle and using 90% of my .308 to take it down lol, I was so damn proud...took a selfie with it, oh damn...just little wasteland babies
---
It is a bit out of place but it doesn't look like Appilatchia got hit very hard if at all.  The only possible hit I've seen is near Huntersville and given the FEV experiments they did there it could be "friendly" fire or a cover up attempt during the great war.
---
The feels ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Stacking executioners with vats critical bonus should allow one to 1 hit crit any bloodied build if in PvP. In pve though I would just suggest anti armor or Vampire but that just my thoughts.
---
the change I would like to see is them not taking caps from the player that died at all, and just rewarding the killer caps, then it wouldn't matter and the killer still gets rewarded, but don't make it based on level, cos all levels after 50 are equal.
---
I just fast travel to nearest event to where I want to go. Once event is done, I earn some caps back, then make another cheap hop. If event is bugged, or over, at most I'm out a minute and a cap.
---
How does posting anything change anything then if that's your way of looking at it.
---
Where I work, if our forums were flooded with a single topic, our social media managers would be quickly alerted, who would ask for a bullet point briefing, and work to determine A) what we can do about it and B) what our response would be in the interm.
---
Change comes over time from user input. 
---
If your userbase is so passionate about a change you plan  to your product that they are actually spamming threads everywhere about it, then that is more likely to make someone sit up and pay attention than a single thread or two that is forgotten in a few hours/days.
---
So my counter point to yours is simply  - visability.
---
Thats exactly what I did too same location with a huntin rifle and a couple of frags and then took a selfie
---
Full set of unyielding armor, one piece with +1 luck
---
Haven't seen it myself, but Baphomet with no titties right? Just tryna work the visual haha
---
To be honest I feel like they will have put a lot of effort into it as it's going to be the first big one so I wouldn't be Supprised of a few of your suggestion will be in already.
---
Bethesda have made a big point of how good it is going to be so hopefully It will live up To the hype.
---
my only worry is that at first it is going to be so over crowded like it was when the BETA came out and you have about 10 people all waiting to interact with the same quest marker.
---
Lvl 200. Got about 20 2shots.. 4 ultracite pistols... And about 5 explosives, never together.
---
I don't think the so called "doom and gloom" crowd is the same people that are trying to bury the game. In fact, these players are the one that have supported the game since B.E.T.A (like me) because they trusted Bethesda. That's why everyone is so disappointed that Bethesda broke their promise, because they also broke our trust.
---
That nocturnal wood left arm was all I needed.
---
Never underestimate how important picking off the adds are.
---
I have not seen this sixer of eggs you speak of..and what asshole buys eggs without opening the carton first? Thats like asking for a drill to drop out the 3* 's ass.
---
It would be nice if it was a "safe-zone" in the Survival mode.
---
Because it's laying around everywhere. Maybe it emphasises the point that it's truly worthless or maybe because no one honors the government that led them to nuclear hell. From a technical point economy reasons.
---
I want to know why "raiders" try to scam players 40 or more lvls under and when a +200 player aproach the run, teleport or disconect like hell. Anyway, that kind of people fear survival, and with next updates they'll have no reason for play the game. I think they will turn back to fornite and similars...
---
Xbox. I shall add you.
---
Makes trading with players impossible.
---
Oh really because that post says at the bottom that the perforating magazine gives 40% armor penetration, which equates to 20% more dmg.
---
Downvotes? You mean the ones from just you lmao.
---
You‚Äôre just some scrub that thinks he‚Äôs good, seen it a million times, don‚Äôt worry kiddo I‚Äôll kill you eventually, but we both know adding someone out to get you as a friend is an ignorant move, yet at the same time I‚Äôm not surprised you suggested it, because you are a complete moron.
---
Yep he hides in the middle. We kill him daily
---
I was super bummed about that too. I am excited for the dungeons and the possibilities it adds to the game and the trading landscape though. It should be a nice distraction!  
---
I would guess the machine will link to your stash's weight since apparently that's a big issue for server stability. It will be interesting to see if you will actually put items in the machine or not. That may be what they are trying to figure out right now. 
---
I'm interested to see how the whitesprings vendoring and the player vending machines will coexist. I want people to visit my shop but I also want the convenience of going to one place to shop. It would be amazing if they give you two machines. One at your camp and one at whitesprings. Both linked.
---
I avoid anywhere that has more than 5 players like the plague.  I‚Äôll hop if I see more than 10 because it will lag the whole server.
---
How'd you mess up your character?
---
Lol no one is worried about your scrub ass and your drum magazine that gimps your gun.
---
Yeah I somehow never wandered over to the lake and its wasnt until one surged the whitespring that I found out they were in-game.
---
You know, I shot at a guy with a wanted level in adventure mode after my teammate had already initiated pvp, I shot him with a bloodied .50 Cal, he shot back at me with a shot gun. Then I switched to a gamma gun cause he took no damage from my .50 Cal, and then he took no damage from my gamma gun.
---
I‚Äôve had things disappear but they were really there just totally destroyed and needed repair.  Like somebody said go into build mode and point to where they were and you‚Äôll be asked if you want to repair them.
---
It'sAGundam +)
---
Cant I just disable one. Drag it back to my camp, fix and reprogram it. I want it to have a sassy woman persona. Like oh no you didn't. Serious about eveything except the persona :P
---
Less than 18 but JARRRRIO is my psn
---
Elysian chests?? LOL!!
---
that's my point, and you most certainly can buy half a dozen eggs, but yeah, I don't think a one star should drop from a 3 star, but I also don't think a 3 star should drop from a one star, the weapon should match the enemy
---
OMG having a vending machine at whitesprings would be awesome.
---
My shops is just opposite Whitesprings train station so I get a great deal of foot traffic in general.
---
https://fo76map.com?locationIds=1181
---
Nah, it's similar in it's animation to electrical discharge. You see tendrils of electricity pulsing out to enemies
---
It isn‚Äôt to much camping  :/
---
do you have spotlights set up for your turrets? I recently found out if you dont they don't hit anything, get the monitor too, when you hook up the spotlight to it you can program it to target enemies. lvl 60 and I just found this out, hope it helps
---
Two of the main ones I'd like to see are a wall between adventure mode and survival mode characters and the removal of the longest survived map marker mechanic.
---
If they fix the explosion that happens immediately it will be fine. Cause melee kills suck when dealing with that.
---
Broken since beta
---
I wonder if it will be instanced? Then maybe you can choose to do it solo, with a pre-built team, or rando's. Otherwise it might turn into a huge cluster. I can't imagine more than four people will be able to do a run at a time.
---
After loosing several items, including my BOS jumpsuit (which I have been trying to farm again for the last 50+levels), I now count this mod as one the few "must haves" for this game. [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/148](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/148). Please make it so...
---
wow . nice info
---
thanks
---
Woosh
---
You play on XBox?
---
&gt; Remove serendipity.
---
No. It has a 45% chance of making any attack miss. It Proc‚Äôs constantly. This is horrible advice.
---
On the Fallout 76 forums.
---
Got to say, when I made that post, I never thought in a million years that it would end up being the highest upvoted post ever for this sub.
---
I remember it being a big request at the beginning of the games life they wanted new vegas type repair kit
---
I like the idea of shields, handmade out of found objects and riot ones for end game, that's a cool idea
---
Great, another way for me to get Rick rolled.
---
I dont like it anymore than the next guy..but i also dont mind it. Its booty gettin a 1* from a 3* but at the same time...when you do end up getting tbat 3* it give it a little more value. If there were as many 3* weapons out there as there were 3*s that ive killed..they wouldnt be wprth squat
---
I have my camp near top of the world right now but I was thinking of rebuilding in the forest so low levels can get there easier. I also like collecting low level gear for new players. 
---
Definitely looking forward to it!
---
The terminal isn't useful though. They default to target-enemies. The terminal just allows to switch them to target-you and back
---
I said Nuka-Cola crafting, not alcohol crafting.
---
Why do you need the flux?  I run T60 and non prime receivers.  I only use flux for rare items that repair kits don‚Äôt matter for.
---
brutal
---
Literally loled. ;)
---
I‚Äôm made a base on a critter spawn and they do indeed attack cats.
---
Best atmosphere: Toxic Valley
---
Best gameplay potential: Savage Divide
---
Best enemies: Mire
---
Heck even if they put terminals at whitesprings that show you what all the people are selling at their shop/machine. That would be great too.
---
in the Bethesda Days livestream they said they thought about this but ultimately performance was the issue.
---
Sorry, missed this one, once you have completed the Forbidden Knowledge quest, the technical data becomes a quest item, you can't drop or trade the data.
---
That would be awesome. If not the camp name, maybe a choice of various flag designs to choose from.
---
Ahh, I see. We‚Äôve got no one to blame but ourselves then, it seems
---
Thanks. I thought there were something else vats related that I was not aware off
---
that sucks but at the same time im glad to hear its not my system hopefully bethesda knows about this issue sucks i cant do sbq fights thats the only reason i can find to play
---
but my way is way less grindy, and makes the most sense, def more sense than a 3 star dropping from a one star...
---
No problem good luck out there.
---
Then don‚Äôt play the mode? Those are our current options.
---
You just have to be careful..ever walk down the isle at walmart and see a shit ton of duct tape and in your head you spammin? Thats the day i hax to take a break
---
Thanks man, will check it out.
---
You know the new dungeon is going to be full of these little bastards. With a giant cricket boss. Lol
---
this game needs a town section where players can build next to each other
---
I cant remember if they were a community mod or offical dlc? If community, might be why its not in here. Technically they dont own the right to have it as part of the game, as it belongs to someone else etc.
---
It was funny cause youtubers are all over the subject and they show mabey a month ago and are like " see no one asked for your garbage Bethesda" but in reality its farther than that i like repair kits and the ones you get from drops are sick but i wouldnt spend atoms on them 150% for free is better than 100% for some pocket change
---
I hope they saved Huntington for DLC.  Maybe we can find the settlement of "Mars Hall."
---
Or MAYBE they have to make max amount of caps for player's head. I don't want to lose 860 caps each time some sentinel tse guy is flexing on me
---
#roast
---
It really does suck.  I still do sbq fights but it's always a risk.  I've been lucky and not had a crash when it's happened but I always worry about it.
---
Serendipity is unnecessary once you have Sentinel and assassin effects stacking, the dodgy perks constant, guaranteed, proc is far more useful. My advice is for if you want maximum damage output.
---
They're clearly based on the real-life camel crickets which are frankly just as terrifying (though far less dangerous) than their in-game counterparts. 
---
Just be thankful the in-game ones don't jump wildly in random directions like their real-life brethren.
---
Cats are anything but harmless. Those furry little bastards are just waiting for you to go to sleep so they can sneak in and chew your face off. Or steal your snacks. Or both. There's a reason those little fuckers are red and VATSable and you can't fast travel when they're around.
---

---
I believe that was tried over on the Anthem subreddit, but I have yet to see a solid response or any changes after that boycott.
---
Other people dont play the game much anyway, I am one of those.
---
What does seem to work and get the developers attention is bringing it up over and over and over üòä
---
I do think this confirms that its easier to drop paint if you have not learned the other BOS armor as it'll skip the first check. ALthough without knowing the drop chance though it'll be difficult to determine by how much.
---
 Top work eckserah, really, many thanks for this.
---
fallout 3 alien blaster was epic
---
Yeah sometimes things go walkies. Try logging out and back in
---
Do not move to warm climates.  When I lived in southern GA the crickets and grasshoppers were huge.
---
Cranberry bog. Its red, and there is a lot of adhesive and cranberry. Also watoga and prime are nearby
---
Actually, the ability to free travel is in the game. All you have to do is send team invites to the general area that you want to go to, and wait until someone accepts. Hopefully they're not trying the same deal, and you eventually get to where you want to be.
---
Don‚Äôt use turrets.  They are pretty worthless overall and still consume a good percentage of budget.  
---
Haven‚Äôt used them in two months and only lose some tatos or corn every now and then.
---
Love the Filthy. Mods stated not to bring the repair kit bitching there and it was great, very few did.
---
It was limited sadly :(
---
Bring back Blackbird tho
---
Now that would be neat. Like a big workshop  where several take over little plots like in sanctuary hills.
---
that 45% chance is just wonderful it can allow you to no-sell some dudes hunting rifle shots while you run into shotgun range and unload the trusty pump action into their face.
---
But it really shines when someone turns a minigun or something on you as it works on best on averages so dropping nearly half the damage (not even apply it to DR just have it count as a miss entirely) from an auto weapon is great if your going to be shot at with any regularity
---
I have yet to find another cosmetic outfit that yields stats. The vault jumpsuit and such mentioned are under armor and not cosmetic outfits.
---
I'm not sure if this was official or just a post on hear but I think I read something about your vending machine showing up on the map? 
---
Maybe they could out in a setting where if you wanted to you could advertise the location of your vending machine on the map.
---
It would probably lead to griefing and base attacks though
---
Apparently not very well for OP
---
Now that there are PvP servers that allow people to do this intentionally, they should just remove slap damage and PvP from Adventure mode.   End the trolling.
---
Bit new to the game. Is your BoS discord joinable? I'd love to play with a group.
---
Yeah I've had a couple quest chains go back when I got dc or crashed. Last server save I guess. Pretty annoying when you're one step away from completion!
---
Ooooo what about .....ranger armor?
---
Prime recievers ultricite ammo diffrent armor types. I run with a pretty large group so we help each other farm diffrent items. We got one guy that basically does all the repairs. You may not need it but lots of other players need it regularly and its not at all easy to get. 10 flux makes one stable flux and it deteriorates quickly. I dont really need it that much for my own character.
---
It's terrible
---
Ya, they are rolling out the indestructible camp option soon. Probably with this update.
---
I do not
---
All the three larger samples that has been made has shown that 3\* enemies drop 3\* items in 40-42% of the cases. Of course it will feel like less since most of it is in the end useless stuff with bad ability-combos on a wooden leg armor that quickly gets dropped, but that is what every larger study poinst to. I don't remember the exact distribution between 1\* and 2\* items, but they should be somewhere around 30% each, making 3\* items still be best odds from a 3\* enemy. If you search this reddit there are some impressive summaries of hundreds of collected 3\* enemies giving a good sampling.
---
However, worth pointing out is of course that statistics is almost impossible to apply to the individual case.
---
except not.
---
Perfect!
---
The ‚Äòtickle duster‚Äô, nicknamed the Alien Blaster, was included in boxes of cereal for kids to play ‚ÄòAlien and Cowboys‚Äô with.  
---
A fairly safe toy for the time with minimal lead paint compared to other toys produced during the same period.
---
Also Grim reaper is for ap, not crit.
---
Rather take an exploding robot. Not like those super mutants running away..
---
Max amount of caps for player's head. There is no reason to lose more than 100-150 caps for death
---
 Well that's a missed oportunity
---
Just rember that they are human and they are working by submission number so for example if they finish #98 and you are ticket #110 they would do #99, #100, #101, #102, #103, etc
---
West Tek on survival.
---
Xo1 does
---
they have said it is a case of a token system.. i hope that he has a drop box you can ONLY sell too in order to get tokens if the merchant is busy with another player
---
i got two star fix it, and i just got white knight, as i didnt need it till now.
---
I am do not pvp or participate in survival. Back in November I would go through the whitespring blast zone glowing ghouls trying to level up fast but not pick up the loot. The players whom launched the nuke saw me do this and spoke to me on mic telling me  this was their blast zone and to leave. I continued hitting ghouls and the players jump in front of my swings so they would get hit and then they pvp'd me. **I believe these players obsess exploiting the particular piece of a broken game and the fun for them stops after it's patched.**
---
i can ask them
---
Oh Dear. Maybe you should put a support ticket in :)
---
I have beaucoup .308. Will you be on at about 7am Eastern?
---
LOL üòÇ
---
Think you will need a bit more than that I'm afraid. I have seen several jetpacks go for around 4000 caps
---
This build is still going to be really, really light on damage. You need to pick a weapon (and it looks like you are going with heavy guns?) and commit to maximizing damage. This build is all utility and resistances. 
---
* You don't need any of the crafting perks slotted except when you are actively crafting. 
---
* You don't need all of the weight reduction perks you're taking. I run a 1 STR non-PA build and it is fine most of the time with minimal weight reduction perks.
---
* Two points in Grim Reaper's Sprint doesn't make much sense unless you are going a lot deeper into a VATS build. Either fully commit or stay away. (I have no idea if a heavy gun/VATS build is viable, but it seems unlikely.)
---
* Lock and Load is a much less effective DPS buff and a direct damage increase. These three points would be much better spent as one star in all three Heavy Gunner skills. 
---
* Travel Agent and Hard Bargain don't need to be slotted except when you are traveling or buying/selling. Four points in Lone Wanderer or three in Inspirational is a much better overall investment.
---
* Three points in Iron Stomach is not a great investment. You rarely need to eat food that will give you a disease. Rejuvenated is a straight buff to HP and AP if you are well-fed and well-hydrated.
---
* Light Footed is of limited use. Traps are very rarely a source of serious damage. 
---
* Action Boy is of limited use unless you are using a ton of AP (especially in a VATS build).
---
* White Knight does not apply to power armor. You're 9-12 points invested in PA perks, so either commit to PA or standard armor. Adrenaline is probably a good investment.
---
* Super Duper is better than scrounger. You're better off crafting the specific ammo you need than hoping to loot it in sufficient quantities. Bloody Mess is the optimal spend in Luck; a 15% boost in base damage is hard to beat. 
---
Honestly, I would rethink this build from the start with a focus on damage, then survivability, and then utility.
---
I just want fucking instruments
---
Steak house
---
Yeah maybe that'll work lol
---
Sorry, just to confirm, Aid and Ammo always drop? I think I need to almost completely redo the loot section of the post :) Which is genuinely awesome, the point of the thread was to try and ascertain what exactly is happening, and I think we are close, if not totally there, I just need to spend some to re-edit this and I can call this one done.
---
Lol OK
---
No bonus damage for sneak attack? Is that confirmed? 
---
My biggest disappointment was sniping so far has been the range. Seems like the bullets practically disintegrate at a hundred yards and I'm doing no damage. I've lined up some really sweet shots on the cargo bot from long range but no hit markers.
---
I got a bunch of tech data on my survival character. I can trade it to someone who can try turning in 1 and 2 and we can see what we end up getting. If you have discord you can get in touch with me at Eckserah#0001
---
It‚Äôs been mentioned a lot.  
---
We just stopped because they didn‚Äôt listen and it was pointless to keep talking about it.
---
Same here on PC. I have all the required materials but cannot craft the item. Weirdly it worked fine with my second character, but not with my first one.
---
When you see workshop defence event you go there look for the owner after you see him you hold v to start contesting workshop that makes owner red for you and you shoot him for caps junk and fun? Unfortunately it's intentional mechanics according to Bethesda.
---
Don't talk bad about the Crickets!  A lovely glowing legendary cave cricket dropped a anti-armor the Dragon for me the other day so now they are my best friends.
---
He's a level 156 it takes forever to level up and I just generally did things poorly and it would be easier to make a new one rather than fix it and so far it has been
---
Depends what power armour it's on I suppose but it takes a lot of caps to make so most will be on a decent chest piece.
---
I thought they removed slap damage in adventure when survival was launched. To the player at least.
---
I think the fact that you can be at end game and not need flux, and sorry if this is an assumption but you probably still kick hella ass, is a testament to how unbalanced this game is. Id prefer to see them focusing on that, rather adding ways to make a game with little challenge easier. The first time i fought the scorchebeast queen I was level 17. Think i died once.
---
Well, yes. If I‚Äôm going to PvE I won‚Äôt. But you missed the point. OP states they like the 100% bonus, it incentivized them to play. Commenter says, more or less, 20% is enough incentivization. I post that I didn‚Äôt think 20% was enough.
---
We all caught up now? Ok good. 
---
So then you post saying don‚Äôt play the mode. Do you now see why the comment was not helpful and does not contribute in any way to the discussion? Good. Try again. Use your words. :p
---
I agree it is the one perk I wish I had room for. I am running Bloody mess, GRS, Better crits, four leaf clover, and starched genes. What would I remove? I have wondered. Bloody mess and starched genes are staples, so if I remove any of the others, my critical capability starts to fall apart. I don't rely on criticals, but I am certain they will be necessary to achieve max dps on say, the new dungeon coming, or SBQ.
---
Exactly. They're role playing. 
---
A raider wouldn't roll up to a group of heavily armed Brotherhood troops and start a fight, they would choose a humble settler tending to his crops. 
---
Griefers don't like Survival because it takes too long to find prey.
---
I guess I don't know the word for base damage, is that a different word?
---
That would be pretty sick. Dont like to get my hopes up though, but I did notice the other day on the loading screen, the "TIPs" section mentioned the alien blaster, so seems like it might have a future place in the game.
---
I use perks to repair to 200%. Have perks to keep them from breaking too fast. Then carry 3 big guns to the SBQ fight with a handmade for backup which I have never needed. One broken big gun was the most i ever had. And that took over 7000 rounds to break.
---
Well, I got that wrong. Grim Reaper‚Äôs not bad. 
---
Honestly, I don‚Äôt run the Sentinel Assassin TSE Jumping build because it‚Äôs bullshit. 
---
It‚Äôs massively overpowered, and when you‚Äôre watching someone use it it literally looks like a hack. I‚Äôm expecting a massive nerf, so I‚Äôm not wasting my time on a build that I don‚Äôt really like and will probably not be viable too long into the future.
---
Oh not just walmart, my friend.
---
Legendary perks are your best friend. White Knight lv3 and Fix it good lv 3 helps.
---
That is brilliant! I love the idea of griefing a griefer like that.
---
I‚Äôm lvl 189 and I can switch between Heavy Guns to Shotguns and Melee if need be but build your first one then upgrade the other cards when you get enough levels
---
The top 4 players location is what is mainly is stopping me from trying it out
---
I can confirm Shielded Raider from Uranium Fever.  Just had it drop.  For the record, I don't have Protective unlocked.
---
I'd like a full width staircase I can use indoors.
---
Interesting observation but the gamer in general I believe is in high school or college which would make them all a melting pot of on line survivalists.  The question is who are these young people and how is this new medium impacting their minds?  How is this burst of virtual reality aggression gonna translate into reality?
---
They could make it a no damage zone to prevent camping on it.
---
I'll take your 308 tomorrow after 5p Eastern if you still have it. Wanna try out a new weapon before I decide to sell it. Just don't feel like crafting 308s.

The post
---
I've been able to loot legendaries lately, so they fixed that much.  They were falling off the map or disappearing for the past few weeks, now I can at least find out they had nothing.
---
Why do legendary deathclaws eat drills?
---
I‚Äôll take all the monies you don‚Äôt want
---
I believe slap damage refers to the ‚Äú10%‚Äù  damage a player would receive from another player until he retaliated. From what I understand your base and structures have always taken full damage regardless of retaliation. I could be wrong though.
---
This made me chuckle, but yeah very true!
---
You probably shouldn‚Äôt be in survival if you die too much and lose all your caps lol
---
It's not you. I've had similar problems with an Intel Core i7 6800K 6core, NVIDIA GTX 1070, 16GB ram, and a hard-wired FIOS connection. If I wait, sometimes the game recovers. I don't always have to use the task manager, but it's not a fun experience.   
---
I contacted Bethesda tech support about the issue. At their suggestion I tried running the game as administrator, but that created a new error at launch. I have tried to scan and repair the game. My drivers are fully updated. They haven't come up with any further helpful suggestions.   
---
I'd suggest putting in a help ticket. Even if they aren't helpful, at least they can count how many tickets there are.
---
THANK YOU
---
Better question is, will there be a ‚Äúdaily‚Äù sales limit like that shit they pulled with not vendors. 
---
Also, do you have to buy player vending machine plans from atom store, lol.
---
I did not start anything I am being totally honest with you.  I was shot at and killed as I was starting to go into the area behind the gazebo
---
Enclave Officer Uniform + Enclave Officer Hat counts
---
So I would like a log cabin building set. This could include walls and new roofs because we have one standard green tin roof. In fo4 we had so many roofs now we have one. I would also like the option for a wall that maybe has a closet stash built in? I think maybe more fireplaces as well would be awesome as well as some other cabin themed items. I think these really fit the West Virginia vibe
---
You won‚Äôt need to buy the lower-grade repair kits from the atomic ship.  You can get the superior model in-game from quests.
---
I agree with this , it would be interesting to see
---
That is what survival is for.  You have your griefing platform, stop whining.
---
Just got this from Uranium Fever, don't have Protected Raider unlocked.  Seems to be rare af because I've done sooo many Uranium Fever events.
---
just rename it when they add that feature to Trash Curated Garbage because thats what they have been giving out for survival rewards so far..
---
So like log walls or wood table maybe even a fireplace right ?
---
Not to pick nits, but you often lose your sneak damage that way. You essentially nerf yourself.
---
Username checks out
---
What do you mean? They have a ranger outfit which includes a hat and a full body outer suit that provides no defense or anything. If you mean ranger themed armor I need elaborated more on it to understand.
---
I would happily wreck you in pvp a number of times but if you don‚Äôt have caps you‚Äôre not worth my time
---
You don‚Äôt speak for everyone.
---
No no no like the ncr ranger thingy the new Vegas armor it‚Äôs cool
---
They are running a spec build that offers only minimal advantages when you look at farm and repair costs.  That‚Äôs why I stopped using them.  The total cost in time and upkeep wasn‚Äôt worth the added bonus.  
---
Too few people look at the big picture and only look at immediate stats.  
---
I offered a guy 40 cobalt flux for free the other day because I didn‚Äôt have the glowing mass to convert it.  I don‚Äôt need it beyond PA mods for others.  
---
My Ultracite armor is about to be given away.  It‚Äôs just taking up space.  
---
2 star shared Rad Sponge and I almost don‚Äôt have a use for PA in a nuke zone.  
---
But I know, it‚Äôs all about squeezing that 10% out of everything.  
---
Needless to say, I have zero use for a repair kit.  
---
A fridge?  Yup.  Good with salt is meh.
---
Thumbs up for the powersuit who rolled in.  Got the gamer tag?
---
Nope! That's the point with anything really! Books, movies, video games. Take your mind off the real world for a bit.
---
Obvs obvs , but if I‚Äôm doing a long ass quest to find the fucker I atleast want a challenging fight at the end
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say instantly.  Mods like soj had were still viable up until I quit a year back.
---
Still have a stash of twenty or so that are worth a fortune...o nvm.
---
All of those and more. I feel like the West Virginia vibe isn‚Äôt there really. When I think of West Virginia I think of log cabins and rivers. Not brick buildings or metal cages
---
I have never once griefed anyone‚Äôs camp - or any player - sorry I should have clarified that...
---
Why? If this is true then you're saying why does x thing not happen in this game when x thing happens in **totally unrelated** games. Not even all of those unrelated games, just some of them. 
---
That made your already weak argument even weaker. I don't disagree, btw, I also want ticking numbers and damage meters, but we can extrapolate the 2nd with the first. I'm just baffled by of all the good ways to present this argument you went with this.
---
lmfao
---
There's a decent chance of them spawning in the TNT domes as well.
---
I would have to disagree, since I got the monitor hooked up to the spotlight I'm not having any damage at home and I get a lot more xp increase popping up while I'm away which has to be my turrets killing one thing or another. regardless without spotlights turrets never hit anything lol
---
Oh that! I did like that, that could be cool
---
Just message my gt and I'll respond if on
---
Am not suggesting that at all.  I am not qualified to make that kind of determination but as an older educated person watching from the outside in their is a pattern of who can be doing this and why?  It‚Äôs more a question then a statement and then what appears to be my findings.
---
Need to find someone with similar needs (Wants: .45 ammo, I have lots of .45) and recipes for trade on PC. Thanks for letting people know for the PS4!
---
I see you managed to successfully get that arc look to your CAMP. Looks sweet!!
---
It'd make the most sense as we already have one handed melee weapons in the game. There's a whole hand just not doin' much of anything.
---
&gt;I'd use them exclusively for healing if not for their cost.
---
They're cheaper than stimpacks. Unfortunately they're stupidly rare.
---
Except you're wrong. They could have just responded to one of them and then that response would get linked over and over by the community every time the topic gets brought up. Instead it's been radio silence. Your whole comment is silly because that means any time some big issue gets brought up they'd basically never be able to talk.
---
This.  Shut up.  
---
Lol sureeee
---
I never built a real camp since I started because of this reason. Just wasn't worth my time to build something elaborate just to have it smashed. Now I'm level 150+ now and I still have the exact same camp and in the same place since I reached 20 or around there. All the stations were made for me by other people as well as the generators, lights, and bed. I think the only thing I crafted was the BIV quest fermenter and still. 
---
Now I'm just busier running around killing stuff to worry about building. Maybe once the patch comes out I may dabble in changing my camp but I doubt it.
---
It was down by the ‚ÄòRaider Arena ‚Äò where there is normally a set of partial raider power armor in the center of an ‚Äòarena ‚Äò. It wasn‚Äôt inside there, but very close to there. I go by there very often, and that was the first and only time I have ever gotten any bos plan. It was for the combat armor chest piece. And it changes any combat armor chest piece you have into bos along with a stat boost. Hope this helps.
---
A mod commented like a week or so ago that the issue was being looked at. That is the first and only official word I've seen on AA not working for energy weapons.
---
I like the tension and challenge. Sometimes I give as good as I get. I won't get any better at it if I don't practice.
---
And half my deaths were of the "crackle crackle respawn" variety.
---
Howd you go? I just need 2 more cobalt and I'm done :)
---
Nonsense standard price for a jetpack is 2k and 1k for shocks per leg, assuming you speaking of X01.
---
Anybody have any tips for finding camp items and what events/workshops
---
&gt;Ladder : Not sure if this is even possible (I dont even think there are functional ladders on FO?), but a ladder would be super cool.
---
My understanding is ladders aren't supported or possible in the engine, or are too much of a pain to get working.  Anywhere you see a ladder in the game that actually leads to somewhere has a trap door that functions like a regular door and loads a new area, with no transition animation on the ladder itself.  How about instead of ladders we get elevators?  They could function like the ones in Whitespring bunker or the monorail, and just teleport you to the other side after a short loading screen.
---
I understand its hard to attain the armor set mentioned, but my build is nowhere near reliant on it. I am not seen 90% of the time. My armor is a failsafe for the other 10% when theres a shootout.
---
Yeah I can tell you live in the dirt
---
Blink twice if you're not allowed to talk about repair kits! ;)
---
Not really, I never fucking bought it cause of all the backlash, I was thinking that blades looked fun but now that looks like it‚Äôs gone to hell to. More backlash=less players. Y‚Äôall just gotta quite so the atomic market sales go down
---
Aw man ur lucky I need four more and then I‚Äôm done but I doesn‚Äôt seem anyone is gonna nuke anytime soon:(
---
Question: what is that white/blue door? Is it just in metal doors? Any special plan?
---
I remember in Fallout 4, I liked collecting a full set of pool balls and setting them up on a pool table. Looking forward to doing that again.
---
&gt;  at beast, help drive them away.
---
Lol? This is their **job** so unless they quit or had wildly stupid expectations about how their job was going to go this won't have any sort of effect. They're not children, you do not have to baby them in fear of them leaving to "go to the store" and never coming back...
---
Nothing we do or say is going to drive them away, it may, however, make them feel more of how the community feels. If they can pass that severe and long lasting sentiment along more accurately perhaps awful corporate driven decisions like we're facing now can be prevented or perhaps revoked.
---
It's so random. I scrapped 4 total and got long barrel and hardened reciever.
---
I can craft a T-60 Jet pack for you if you bring me materials :)
---
Cool I think that will be cool more building kits like bar tables and stuff like that will be cool
---
Grinded hard last night. Two blast zones but I crashed while at one at Whitesprings so that was unlucky :(
---
All robots do this. Shoot off the hands from a fucktron
---
Yeah we don‚Äôt actually have a legit bar, most people just use the shelf‚Äôs
---
Oh yes. I have bought one of each kind of nuka cola..woukd be nice if we got recipes from them too
---
Google 'perverse incentive' and you have your answer.
---
Yea had to put like 20 them together
---
Taking workshops is agreeing to PvP. Just like going to the survival server.
---
I thought you needed to personally land damage in order to get CP from defense kills?
---
Yeah and some asshats will destroy it just because of that!
---
To be entirely fair, I have poor impulse control and frequently make microtransactions, even though I know I shouldn't...but I'm not a whale, because I'm poor. I can't even *scratch* whale tier. My poor impulse control and bad decisions will never bring me to whale tier because ultimately what makes people whales isn't whether or not they have impulse control - it's how much money they have to burn.
---
So it's better to focus on what makes the real distinction between whales and other players - large amounts of disposable income - than blaming people with poor impulse control, who are ultimately victims of the practice. Most of us won't ever see whale tier because it takes a lot more than poor spending decisions to get there; it takes an obscene amount of filthy lucre.
---
(And maybe I'm just speaking for myself here, but...people who genuinely have poor impulse control often don't have a lot of money unless they fell into it. Kind of goes with the territory. We're rarely profitable individually, only as a group. They may only get one squeeze of the teat out of each of us, but when you've got an entire barn full of idiot cows you can fill the pail just fine.)
---
It's been mentioned since the beginning of  the game. However, I have never seen Bethesda comment on this issue
---
I mean... no.  No one, even on here, asked for it to be an atom purchase.
---
We wanted repair kits in general, as in found in the world or crafted because they're useful.
---
Oh no, I know your build is viable without that, but I‚Äôm sure you know the strat I‚Äôm talking about. 
---
Invisible jumping up and down with Marsupial. It‚Äôs totally broken. 
---
Seriously though, respect to your build, it‚Äôs very good and probably has higher pure damage output than mine tbh. I‚Äôm just really not a fan of running bloodied.
---
&gt; Complain to their handlers (OK, you can ask them to complain to their handlers), but there's literally nothing to be gained by hounding the CMs about this.
---
Umm, please don't contradict yourself. You're not going to get them to rock the boat so to speak on the communities behalf unless it's **wildly** obvious we are against something. Our best bet to keep fo76's future p2w free is to constantly remind the CM's in a pleasant manner that we as a community do not want these items in the atom shop. We don't want anything except cosmetics in the atom shop. We want bethesda to stick to its promises instead of becoming EA. I see a future with loot boxes and paid mods if we as a community don't put our foot down now.
---
My problem with this event is it doesn't spawn nearly as often as others.  I only see it every couple days.  Trying to get Corpse Seed Juice to make my cocktails!
---
Lol idk why I thought the wiki would list all possible recipes to be learnt..lol wishful thinking I guess
---
Damn straight. The decisions I made in that game eventually started to revolve around getting more ammo. Blow up the citadel? Don‚Äôt mind if I do!
---
Sneak does work just not on pvp you can't get sneak dmg boosters in sniping players only in sniping mobs 
---
And bullets do have a Max range of about 125 meters
