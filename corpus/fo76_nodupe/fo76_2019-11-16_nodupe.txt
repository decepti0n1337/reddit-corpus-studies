Well it's stupid, I tried it when I was low lvl with my first character, a heavy gunner, and got completely obliterated. Haven't tried it again since. Even though it would probably be peanuts for this character. But I was actually planning on doing it this weekend, since launching a nuke is part of a weekly challenge.

Copper; Landview Lighthouse and Blackwater Mine

Crystal: Appalachian Antiques, Helvetia Restaurant, Morgantown High School

That explains why I didn't get mine.
---
That makes more sense

and you sound like someone who has never actually played a Fallout game.   Or at least paid any attention to the "lore" you're railed on about in other comments.  Fact of the matter is, Fallout is the perfect setting for a PvP game.  Because that's the entirety of the story since it was called Wasteland.  People vs. People.
---
WELL FREAKING DONE! This is incredibly impressive.
---
Sometimes players spawn before the garage door closes or even appears though. Meaning they can still get in.
---
Always fire rate
---
You can run your wire through the side of the garage door where the electrode is. Haven't tried this, but I could see this working. If you put your switches on each side of the door, you might can pass the wire through the door between the switches, and pass the wire through the switch inside the door to the electrode, and wire the electrode on the outside of the door to the electrode. 
---
You might have to have one of the pass-through conduits near the outside switch to pass power to that switch to power the switch on the outside however. 
---
You've got me curious if this will work, and I might have to try it when I log in.

---
What build do you have, if I may ask?
---
Crops and water are their own things and are on a set respawn rate. However many per hour it shows when you build them is the regrowth rate for all crops. And they are shared loot. So if you clean out someone's camp, they will be gone until they regrow. As an example, if the rate is 10 an hour and you build 10 corn. You will get one corn stalk to regrow every 6 minutes. Not that each corn stalk will regrow every 6 minutes. All crops are treated as one item. Same with water purifiers. Building additional purifiers doesn't increase the regen rate, only the holding capacity.
---
So yes, you are stealing from them, but most people don't care and it doesn't flag you as wanted. I don't care if people take them. That's why I put them out there. I have every type growing so people can take enough to grow their garden from scratch if they want.
---
Drop another bullet and everything in the area gets moved into the new one.
---
Likely, Bethesda doesn't make minor mistakes.
---
Faster fire rate
---
uh... that aint possible
---
I agree with this. You can definitely build a bloodied build and not be a glass canon. I run a bloodied vats commando, and rarely die. Mirelurk queen acid squirt used to be my only real struggle, until I added 2 pieces of armor with poison resistance. Between that and a dense mod on my chest piece, I only die at the encrypted event and when Im a little bit too careless. 
---
But yes, Bloodied build is the strongest, and its also one of the few actual “builds” in the game that has synergies across many aspects. Perks, armor, weapons, etc...
---
Still haven't seen everything. I play almost every day, super fun
---
I couldn’t. All the ammo I was dropping was in the bag along with the 75K 5.56.
---
"Engine" is a misleading term, frequently misused by trolls who like to complain about bugs. An engine is a framework of independent components. Bethesda uses the Creation Engine. You could compare an engine to McDonald's. When someone complains about how broken Bethesda's engine is, saying something like "Bethesda has used the same engine for years! It's time for something new!"...... this is comparable to someone saying, "McDonald's has been selling burgers for years! It's time for something new!" The ignorance is obvious in that light. McDonald's has been selling burgers for years, but that doesn't mean nothing has changed. The menu, the business practices, the ingredients, etc have all evolved over time, yet we still call it McDonald's. The same is true with an engine. Aspects of it will change and evolve over time, but we still call it the Creation Engine. 
---
Bethesda uses the Creation Engine because of how incredibly flexible it is. It's amazing at creating immersive worlds, but it's also horrificly prone to bugs. Fallout 4 and Fallout 76 both use the Creation Engine, but Fallout 4 doesn't have the same lighting, renderer, or multi-player components, to name a few.
---
As long as people want these immersive, Fallout-style worlds, there is no replacing the engine as a whole. Not yet.
---
Macdonalds
---
Lol, yes. Shouldn't there be is a question you can ask about 1000 times in this game
---

The nurse outfits are a very unique spawn. It's way more complicated than any of the other spawns in the game. Here's how it works:
---
Three possible spawn points in Fort Defiance, third floor. Each spot has  an 80% chance NOT to spawn anything at all. Then it has a 33% chance to  spawn a weathered, a white dirty, or something from a list of rare  outfits. If it picks the rare outfit list, it then picks outfits in this  order:  white &gt; brown &gt; green &gt; blue &gt; pink &gt;yellow &gt;  forest  &gt;red. The white through yellow then have a 50% chance to  spawn or not to  spawn. If it doesn't spawn, it moves to the next color  in the list and does another 50/50 chance. It only stops when it rolls a  spawn and that's the one that gets picked. If nothing spawns, when it  gets to forest, forest has a 90% chance to spawn. If forest doesn't  spawn (only a 10% chance not to), then it 100% spawns a red in. The  forest is the gatekeeper keeping the red extra rare. So it breaks down  to .01041666% chance to get a red.  So a 1 in 10,000  chance.
---
Try exploring every cabin and the tower. Also kill all ghouls in the area.
---
i'll sell you 50k cola's that you can open as you need caps. 100 usd/
---
ok and what about the short freezes for having 100+ friends on ps4?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
after over a decade of gaming i have ove 400 friends whih wouldnt be feasible to remove them one at time.
---
If the guys wearing dense, it negates the explosive
---
I just hope they decide in-house development is too much hassle next time.
---
I get that it's simpler for accounting, but it's always so painful on all sides.
---
Collision Course seems to be where it’s at at the moment.
---
A lot of people did, but it wasn't the most effective method. It had a higher failure rate than some other methods, hence all of the complaints when the event ended early. They weren't complaining because their method was so effective that they completed the challenge with days to spare.
---
Do not script it.
---
It deals double radiation damage as two shot does not reduce the rads it deals.
---
Upgrade it with a better dish and deal up to 250 rads with a single shot.
---
I use it to activate unyielding to max out charisma when trading with NPCs. Its probably good for pvp as well.
---
That is bad ass!
---
I couldn’t believe my luck when it popped up.  It blew my mind!
---
Yeah near garahm mining HQ, up on the monorail at the end
---
I started playing late last month on PS4 and I really enjoy it. Of course it can be frustrating, but my overall experience is very fun.
---
Yes
---
Deep south in the world
---
Garranmining HQ
---
There is a monorail station near there
---
Get on top of the monorail tracks
---
Follow the tracks along to the East until you find the Fatman
---
Anything, even a piece of junk
---
It is literally on the wiki; 
---
'On top of a monorail pylon near Garrahan Mining Headquarters. Climb the Monorail Staircase east of the Garrahan building, jump atop the station itself and run along the top of the monorail until you arrive at the fourth pylon.'
---
u probably got that canvas bag from the dude that has been banned for reporting bugs
---
I literally had nothing. Was going to transfer the ammo from my mule to my main so it just had 75K ammo and some random ammo I didn’t need and dropped.
---
Caps are necessary to keep some balance. I think people do not understand how inflation works. I live in Argentina, believe me. This cap might be a problem, but no cap would be worse. A mess, in fact.
---
If you look up online for a guide there’s one balanced on top of a monorail down near the mining area of the map, near Garahan estate, there’s a monorail station you climb on top of it and onto the rail and walk along it and eventually it’s on top of one of the ring-structures. Search it online or on YouTube though and it walks you through it! Bizarre location
---
 u probably got that second canvas bag instead of the dude that has been banned for reporting bugs
---
Nah. Not at all.
---
Like everyone else already said, unfortunately they did not, although they are running a bonus XP weekend.
---
Going into the events disappointed about it greatly amplified my excitement when the hat dropped.
---
I walked out of the airport feeling like it was the best Reclamation Day ever!
---
I like using it. There are always plenty of enemies to eat and you will also heal, so less use for healing items.
---
I only wish the higher ranks had some more perks, like being able to eat other things too like cryptids or harvest meat.
---
You don't catch diseases with the5 Cannibal Perk.
---
Have an upvote to full the pain ...
---
My perception cards are normally threee ranks of  each rifleman card, 3 tank killer and 3 in concentrated fire.
---
FFR is likely the best, I also have a JE 10mm SMG and it fucks shit up just as fast. Not sure on PvP, i heard people using energy weapons. My Laser and Plasma rifles are fun but I usually use the SMG
---
exactly cause of modding, needing 5 differernt holsters cause your pistol has 5 different sized barrels would be a pain.
---
I have. It’s a problem with the game’s “social” feature. What has worked for us before was to have the invitee log out of their Xbox account (and close FO76), log back in, open the game and get invited again. Bottom line: if you don’t see your friend on your social list (for inviter and invitee) you won’t be able to join the same server - even the “private” one.

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:

&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
It is only useful for Short/Stub barrels. There's no incentive to use these barrels, so there is no incentive to use Long Shot.
---
Nah. My main is a commando with no bloodied, unyielding superstitions. He does great. 
---
You can do everything with every build. Bloodied mutated unyielding is God mode.
---
How did you manage the mast and rigging look?
---
Whatever they're paying you to stalk this subreddit and spam this now tired and boring crap.
---
Add a gift box at peoples camps that works like the punch bowl and we are ready!!
---
yeah that's what I do as well.. was just making sure I don't piss anyone off.  thanks for taking the time to explain this for me.  you the man!
---
I appreciate it. I invited her through the list. I am going to have her log out and quit the game completely and retry it. Thanks for the input
---
This^
---
It'll still be there if you pick something up and return, drop it. You can even fast travel away and come back. Test it out.
---
Aaww man, that's so cute. I love clever use of roofs like that o/
---
This is only true when you have good accuracy and get direct hits.  The radiation damage has an area of effect, so if you hit the ground nearby, they will be healed.
---
Regardless, I think the point is that gamma guns are weak against ghouls in general, so it's pointless for them to drop with the Ghoul Slayer's effect.
---
I mean I want the Nuka Cola Workshop to happen still. 
---
There is always Bubbles that sells all the Nuka's and if you only look for the plain ones she sells about 6 at the time and server hoping resets that number? If you also run Nuka Nut you shouldn't need much as it will hydrate you for 45%. 
---
You do know that the Gourmands were cannibals right?
---
Holy shit I can just imagine an all out war with the SQB just screeching to attract more Scorched you get your snipers, PA users, heavies and so on that must've been an epic fight
---
Nope
---
That is brilliant.
---
What?  You let him get up before you deliver bad news.  You don't let him 'rest' a little longer, stay down, then tell him it's even worse than he thought when he finally thinks he's ready to try to stand up.  Way to kill the guy.
---
My favorite was the wild Appalachia one, can barely remember it now...
---
Exactly
---
It’s been a few hours. Doubt it’s still there. Thanks for the heads up though.
---
Say it with your chest little fella ^
---
I tried gamma guns, tested it everywhere, there is some bug with them, they don't hit as hard as they say. My super gunslinger was a better player killer with his silenced 10mm.
---
When I quit it was 25k, so they've upped it.  Super aggressively.
---
New Patch probably still this decade. New major update? They pushed it until next decade.
---
r/woooosh it's ok if you didn't get it
---
My food build is one less Riflemang rank so I can have green thumb
---
Bethesda actually replied. OP said the magic words by mentioning it was affecting private servers.
---
Yeah I lost track of how many 2* combat legs with +1 strength I've sent to the forge.
---
Apples are apples, cars are cars.  GTA and Fallout are both video games.
---
Make the Nuka plant a workshop, that creates Nuka's.
---
In hundreds of hours it has not been an issue, with the machines off they are not likely to be there in time.
---
making game playable
---
They cant. It's the engine.
---
😳
---
It had Helvetia, that shitty looking wood structure on a hill, and then I can't remember after that
---
Dont. Pick up outer worlds or something else actually worth your money. People for the most part agree that for a while after launch the game actually had less bugs than it does now.
---
I remember seeing the Nukashine vending machine door
---
Oh, my apologies.
---
Dont count on a response. The only reason they responded to this is because OP said it affects the private servers.
---
Patience and lots of wood :P
---
Also, when you remove floor pieces with connectors on them, the overhanging connectors stay, so that's how you get the masts.
---
Megasloths are cryptids *and* animals, so Butcher's Bounty works on them. Snallygasters are mutated humans, so it doesn't.
---
Wooo! \\o
---
bro if you want nuka-cola all you had to do was ask, add me on psn: Owl_No
---
Are you talking about the power armor glitch?
---
Well obviously its possible. But it's not probable. And we're talking about probability. If I told you there's a 99% chance if you put 10 dollars into this slot machine you will win 100 dollars, and 10 tries and $100 later you still haven't won, what's the conclusion you'll draw? That you just have bad luck? Quantum mechanics just decided to screw you personally? Or that I'm lying and the machine is at best broken.
---
That’s really inventive. Thumbs up from me
---
Considering the amount of people with this issue and assuming most have different hardware they are working with (different PC builds and such) in my opinion it is safe to bet on the engine.
---
I think they said it was coming back with Patch 15
---
I could see discussing what should have been in first, but a lot of them went pure chickenhead when it was announced. There's some legit complaints to be had but guys like youtuber yong dingaling have Bethesda derangement syndrome (down), use that for clicks to make money from gullible voyeurs. I still do the dailies for atoms, there's a few rare plans missing. Still need ranks in nw. It's fun and always liked fo anyway.
---
I hope you get better man.
---
Haven't seen that glitch in awhile, it'll probably come back at some point.
---
That would be nice.
---
Completely irrelevant side note but the LoL client recently went to shit too. So many DCs and bug splats from people in my games.
---
Theres a reason why I always skipped her useless bullet sponge ass.
---
Loves me some r/fo76filthycasuals
---
Or wake up in Skyrim once again
---
What's the initial 7.99 for? And where is that I can't find it in the atom shop but I'd like that
---
How is that even possible?
---
It's useful for shooting down cargobots. That's about it.
---
It is back I’ve seen my friends with it, just get in and out of power armor till u have that look honestly..
---
Dataminer here, I know others have pointed out that they are mutated humans, but I'll add that every animal that works with Butcher's Bounty has been deliberately given the keyword "ActorTypeForButchersBountyPerk" and the snallygaster does not have it.
---
They have never been janky for me and I've always ran my games from HDD. Never on an optimal computer either.
---
Fairy nuff. I stand corrected
---
She's a beaut!
---
TSFFR tape gun.
---
It's usually a console issue, PC tends to handle them better. But Bethesda games are Bethesda games and sometimes shit happens.
---
People have been asking for a LFG tool since day 1. But has Bethesda implemented it? No.
---
 Just another way FO76 fails in comparison with other MMOs.
---
Np.. Yeah it probably reset by now.
---
Yes, i have pics of people with it last few days
---
I am an active day 1 player, and I’ve ran the gambit.  I have all 5 characters past 80 and have beaten the ‘game’ thus far on all as well.
---
You can play full health, or really any style and do very well.  If you want to utterly destroy monsters running bloodied is not required.  
---
To those who support bloodied, ..  make sure you have the gear available to accommodate such a build.  I feel that most bloodied supporters are seasoned veterans with a stock of gear to lean on.  
---
Bottom line, have fun.  Don’t let anyone tell you any particular way is the only way.  If you want to go bloodied, spend the time on a non-bloodied to get the gear first for sure.
---
It is back baby!
---
Happy cake day :)
---
Ha that would be handy, but fair enough.
---
Hitting with my un-modded baseball bat hits harder than my 3-star missile launcher.  They are pretty much useless.
---
Yeah i saw someone in the past 2 weeks with it.
---
This is why I don't use missile launchers -- plus the fact that missiles way a lot. It's too bad, since the targeting computer mod makes shooting scorchbeasts fun.
---
Ooohh what level?
---
Yeah my first run I was totally clueless, ran out of ammo, stims, weapons broke, got completely lost and just said fork it, and fast traveled to my camp. Lol
---
Congrats, sounds like fun.
---
Happy cake day
---
I'm surprised this isn't a thing as mmos have had this type of system in for years and wow's actually doing the same come next patch. Y'all would make some money off of lead I tell ya hwat.
---
And please name me any other weapon that heals it's main target,  I mean it that shit is hilarious to me.
---
My 2h melee cripples them with an enforcer shotgun. They land and that's it. You can also try any crippling combo.
---
2 second freezes like every minute or so it seems, very annoying.
---
I like playing my alt this weekend as actually being scared of mobs is something that hasn't happened in over 100 levels on my main, and playing on private servers is a bit OP in some cases, but overall I still hate the super slow rate this game gets updates. I'm still super surprised perks haven't gotten an overhaul to fix useless ones and not just nerf whatever folks are having fun with this month.
---
Urban Scout armor is hard to get? I think I've had a mask in my stash for months.
---
Hmm, this might explain why I've had some issues on my alt since I have to switch to whatever has ammo at any given time.
---
Use 1 star of the pistol perks
---
You only lose 30% damage and save 6 stars in agility
---
Vats builds are good with automatics, as they take very little AP to fire
---
Crits hit harder than they should on auto fire, no idea why, but is handy
---
Silence the pistol if possible, detection radius is tiny on pistols, you get a lot of sneak shots off before anyone looks at you
---
What's been happening since the last patch is weapon textures and/or models aren't being loaded until you look at them closely, such as when examining an item in inventory or equipping that gun. Visit a vendor who has a weapon you aren't carrying or using, and hit the examine button. It'll pause while it loads in the model.
---
I am, but I'm also allowed to call Bethesda's bullshit and laugh at cash cows
---
You just have to get in and out until it glitches.  It’s random.
---
I think it is a misery loves company kind of thing and the fo series has a lot of dark themes. I don’t know what kind of charities Bethesda involves itself in but I would suggest they support suicide prevention as well as animal shelters.  Imagine selling Dogmeat in the atom shop with half of the proceeds (dare I dream 80%) going to the Humane Society nationwide.  On that note I am really surprised they haven’t had a charity based sale week in the AS yet.  Maybe I missed it.
---
You used to be able to pass a wire through anything by putting one of the simple power point on a mat, connecting the wire out in the open then moving he mat around a little. Now the wire will pass through anything. Not sure it still works.
---
Myself and a tone of other people
---
Doing this tonight!
---
I feel unduly slighted.
---
He could scrap some desk fans
---
Yup all the time really lags the game and I constantly think is this bitch gonna crash?
---
There should be lots of things.
---
Nah, I'll just keep forcing workshop pvp
---
Well she does at least drop a lot of plans
---
I wouldn't mind if they rotated or were random each time I loaded into the game to keep it interesting.
---
Lore...does s'mores.....lol
---
It will go through the side of the garage door with the electrode- no trick required, I've got that at my camp currently. I do the trick where you replace the wall with the door and pass the wire through, and change it back. But, I can't get a wire to just go directly through any other walls; aside from the Steel walls with the grated windows. 
---
Haven't heard the trick with the mat.
---
Correct.
---
Haha, sounds familiar.
---
Can’t put flux in it
---
Fridge was a disappointment
---
Can’t assign vendor items from it
---
Only -50% decay
---
Can only put 15 items (individually at a time) in it
---
I'm on PlayStation 4,also built my own pirate ship with broadsiders sticking out on the side,
---
They are in a toxic relationship with Bethesda, and like many people in a toxic relationship, they can't get away by themselves.
---
I sure can, ill go do it in builder on nukesdragons and then just notate armor here. Gonna take me a few minutes though
---
Damn, you have a prospectus and everything.
---
Ah, good point
---
I forget about that, should work!
---
No, but I get that delayed stimpak bug
---
It looks like metal support beams and a bunch of conduits wired to look like ropes. Totally awesome!
---
I see but with gunsmith my shotguns still degrade faster than any other rifles.
---
No reefs0, thank you so much &gt;:)
---
What’s your record time? Haha
---
I don't think you can damage your own CAMP stuff? But I could be wrong.
---
Useless for me. I've ate nothing but Halloween candy basically since release.
---
I only woke up there one time and I didn't put a lot of hours into it because I hate watching how to play video games or reading how to play video games I want to do it myself but that game was too much for me I felt I had to essentially cheat and find out where to go and what to do but I was a bit impaired when I was trying it I might go back to it at some point
---
lol... upvoted
---
You could see the bag but the contents were hidden interesting
---
People are retarded, just let people waste their money and laugh at what a joke this game and Bethesda have become depressingly knowing that you bought this garbage
---
Just because the company as a whole isn't producing every request or fixing the game according to various standards doesn't mean they're not listening.
---
I think we've seen plenty of responses that indicate they are indeed taking in feedback and (sometimes) using it. Wastelanders was a huge indication they listened to the demand for NPCs because it's a pretty major undertaking, and even by pushing it back one could argue they are listening because they're trying to ensure it's as polished and meaty as we expect it to be. I'd also say the return of the Halloween event is another indication they're listening, as well as less recent additions like the display cases, player vending, and legendary scrip (kind of two birds with that one, gave a bit more reward for endgame which was a major complaint, and gave a way to recycle poop gear, also addressing a major complaint).
---
I also think there's plenty of room for nuance concerning FO1st. They did bring private worlds and expanded storage with it, two major requests, and while you're right to point out they're part of a package that requires money, I think being thorough in your opinions necessitates that we acknowledge that everything in that 1st bundle is basically a bonus for just buying atoms. That's really what the deal is because it's the same discount as buying 2k atoms, you're just required to pay a bit less up front. 
---
Every other sub-based game I've played either gave no bonuses (WoW is a great example), or gave bonuses that were much less than the value of the sub payment, proving that you really were paying for the sub itself. In the case of 1st, you get the same discount for spending $13 USD on 1650 atoms that you'd get buying 2000 atoms. And then it unlocks access to all the rest (obviously temporary for the servers). 
---
I don't think the servers are very good right now, mind you, and I definitely think they fumbled the release. But I'm not sure why so many people are presenting this as just paying $13 for servers. You would only be doing that if you didn't ever plan to spend the atoms. 
---
At the end of the day I'm not trying to claim Bethesda are benevolent or unmotivated by cash. I just don't think the argument that they're not listening holds weight.  They could be listening but incapable or negligent or have higher priorities set by self-interested suits, or as I've pointed out, in some cases they could be listening and actually delivering or trying to create compromises. I've definitely felt like they don't care a few times (most recent was the lame double XP weekend for Reclamation Day), but I don't think the entire company doesn't care, ever. That would be a bit much.
---
**TLDR**: There are many people at Bethesda and at least some of them are listening, even now. We have seen examples of this and it's an oversimplification to suggest otherwise.
---
Man they nailed it. This game has been and still is a disaster internally and externally. They fucked up bad, which is a shame because it had such good potential.
---
Wastelanders hopefully will save it, but based on trends it was delayed only because it is even more broken than live.
---
Very true. The one year anniversary for sea of thieves? Added fishing, competitive mode, a story to follow, and more.
---
Fo76? Double xp and a paid subscription.
---
I don't know if Bethesda cares about consistency in the lore
---
Well it states -55%. I was just trying to be helpful.
---
76 has become sort of a destress and chill out game. It's kind of meditative moving around the map, doing the fissure site circuit, and farming scorchbeasts. My character is purpose-built to one shot scorchbeasts with massive single-target burst DPS, so there isn't really any challenge left for me. Hoping Wastelanders adds something new.
---
Wow, sorry for that
---
I can give u some if u want if ur on ps4, otherwise take hemlock holes workshop it has both or just go there with excavator armor and get ore and acid, acid to refine the ore....let me know if ur on ps4 i can throw u 50 of each
---
After a break of several months, I came back today for the double XP weekend, and I was sad to see this game is still awful. It isn’t just the minor glitches, which I experienced immediately. 
---
The game is just downright boring. Quests where I have to go collect beer bottles or kill some flies or collect different meats or collect temperature data just aren’t fun. I love Fallout, but I really have no idea why anyone still plays this game.
---
"Throw in the damn towel!"
---
I've run a guerilla toon and it's fun, 10mm quadruple is your goal, with drugs they get nasty. The problem is you run out of ammo fast. You can make laser and plasma auto too and combine them with the 10mm to take different kinds of enemies. Also, the pipes are cheap, use 38 and usually people don't take them into consideration  so you can find great legendary ones easily (remember every time Mmrgh has given you a 'shit' pipe pistol...).

For me, I follow 76 looking for any updates. I enjoy the fallout franchise. Played every game since fallout 3 was released. I look forward to new dlc. I would even pay for additional content like new missions or extensions of the map. Except all fallout has been doing is the royal rumble trash. I enjoyed the little missions like the sheep sqautch.
---
Honestly I don't care.
---
 The game is loads of fun and I love it.
---
Nah. It's going to be too easy for us higher levels to speed through it. I mean remember when you had to make friends with a deathclaw? It was terrifying for a lower level but now im a deathclaw hunter :/
---
Naw thier at 1c no worries there.
---
Good in emergencies
---
Your words will be read with offended eyes, the truth offends people around here, trying to pull people out of the "Bethesda Bubble of Happiness" is an impossibility....thumbs will only point downward.

But what mechanic is exploited when people dupe? Why would there be a mechanic which makes a duplicate of some item?
---
Food is too plentiful for it to be useful.
---
Flux is debateable as you get it if you need it then use it, not stockpile it
---
i completely forgot about the vault raids did they ever fix that shit
---
Damn it stop making good ship camps until I finish mine on my third character.
---
Netcode.  On the server those ghouls aren't sleeping and third can beer proven by playing with ppl. Not everyone gets that bug.
---
Duping I'm not sure of.
---
you can make multiple fridges
---
Definitely, I one shot most enemies aside from the heavyweight 68s
---
What!?!?!  I checked and it was just some dirty water and a hat. You’ve wronged me for the last time!!!!
---
 Mine works and is cheap. There was a lot of speculation about how much one might cost and $10 a month was kinda what most people though was fair.
---
 Perhaps you missed that.
---
If it’s cocaine to you then why isn’t it already installed?
---
Bet
---
Automatic server crashes
---
just because they are both games doesn't mean that they function the same. Eve-online does not work the same as Wasteland 2
---
They are not obtainable yet
---
okay thanks, that’s what i was thinking
---
Can you post that build?
---
I feel this pain. I keep a level 5 character to pvp with and occasionally I delete him and remake him when he hits level 10. I only go for high level characters so he usually is making quite a bit of caps.
---
 So one day he hits level 10 and I transfer everything as usual to another character, delete him, and then oh fuck..... I forgot to transfer the 17k caps he had on him, im an idiot.
---
Moral of the story: when you think you have it bad, someone, somewhere, has it worse. My condolences to your caps.
---
I have the problem of my free stuff just sitting there.  I usually end up dumping it at a train station in a box
---
Now there, you should add some of the Pirate of the Future! Atleast one of you should use Broadsider as a weapon!
---
I do that sometimes... With my Pirate hat and Pirate costume.
---
Okay. Just figure out a better analogy. I don't give a shit.
---
I have paid for well over 20 cards and only gotten one fixer plan from it 🤷🏻‍♂️ lots of hats though lol

Bethesda is stupid but man, you can't seriously think ONE guy getting a second bag = Bethesda being incapable of proper postage?

Oh, I see
---
Perhaps it wasn't in reference to you, then
---
I want a mod for the Boxing Glove that lets you duct-tape combat knives to them
---
Then I want to be able to duel-weild boxing gloves with knives on them
---
And voila, it's Dead Rising 2!
---
But you'd use the palms of your hand, the claws extend past the palms, you could also use your elbow.
---
im ok with it especially since we already can with armor (raid reward)
---
That ruins the point a bit eh?
---
Automatic broadsider or black powder rifle
---
No it happens regardless of the weapon I use,
---
Well you probably have to scrap legendary items just to craft that Item in the first place
---
They're just there for gameplay variety rather than because they're retconning the lore
---
Like let's it, how cool is it to kill people by impaling them with railway spikes? Or by freezing them with a freeze ray/snowball launcher?
---
You can play video games with your child. I play with my son. I play the games he likes and let him teach me stuff about them and it's great. Not only are you showing interest  and doing something they enjoy, it does wonders for their self esteem. No different than playing a board game with them. Playing and interacting with your children is not limited to just taking them a playground or reading to them.  :)
---
To get the effect I mean
---
Calm down it’s just a game...
---
JFK did you not see the /s before posting all that.  Fucking woosh!
---
It's not just the reload speed - the hip fire accuracy is affected on semi-auto rifles, too.
---
Notice how the crosshair get bigger when the perk card is unequipped: https://youtu.be/8uhU6pD4Xr0
---
If you’re level 30, maybe the Mire isn’t the best spot. Somewhere in the forest is good- when I was around that level, I hung out around Charleston because it was near some workshops (if that’s your thing), power plant is nearby for good farming, and pretty easy access to the coal mining area (forget the name rn) which is well suited for the mid-levels
---
Man that combat rifle skin looks low effort... couldn’t add an entirely new model.
---
I have 2 Strix 2080Ti's. This game doesn't like SLI :(
---
Best bug ever. We all thought it was intentional. Still can't believe they "fixed" that one.
---
Wow I did not expect such a fast response, thank you so much. I think I will wait until I am a higher level to move to the mire, and I will look into the area you suggested. Thanks again.
---
It's not the nature of humans.
---
It's the nature of that player's choice.
---
Given the opportunity, you can choose whether to be an asshole or to be kind.
---
It's a choice.
---
Hell yes. I won't play vault raids until matchmaking or an overhaul, just not worth it.
---
Very nice.
---
I use  a Sentinel Chest piece.
---
And 4 unyielding Limbs.
---
I find it hard to let go of good Armour.I still have a fully Modded Cavalier Chest piece in my Stash Box with 120 + damage resistance.Back from when i was struggling finding decent Armour
---
I am virtually immortal now..
---
Unfortunately, no. Still not worth your time. Total resource sink with little reward.
---
For the last few weeks we have been getting the odd queen that isn't even legendary. As said above it's a hell of a fight and uses loads of resources so it should always be legendary.
---
Guerrilla cards + concentrated fire + adrenaline. I can get my BE 10mm to hit for 800 doing that combo.
---
I use 10mm in PvP as well. I use QFFR and AAFFR 10mm for that.
---
Yeah now that I’ve completed all the main quest stuff other than doing the events that pop up there’s not much to do
---
Oh, they missed on the fridge.
---
Appreciate the pep talk? Haha
---
Really? Could have swore otherwise
---
Idk why you’re being downvoted. An instanced camp does sound like a premium feature
---
I gasped out loud. Thank you for this.
---
That would kill the game instantly. Endgame is little more than that.
---
It would be nice to get past the 3-star rng.
---
As a solo player I basically have to get lucky and find something half way decent at a vendor. I occasionally use the market place here but most are willing to pay more than I either have or want. 
---
I scored that piece from the purveyor.
---
u/valseek u/ladydevann - can either of you confirm the validity of the support answer provided?
---
I want a gauntlet that can retract and draw, while it's retracted you can wield another weapon
---
Yep even when I am solo it makes my screen freeze all the time....
---
It's not just an arbitrary 30k limit that is so stupid here.  It's that the game lets you receive an amount in excess of your  limit in a trade and some where in the code there's a comment that says //shrug...I guess the rest of those caps will just spill over into the aether.  A game that was competently done would not allow the trade to occur or at least give you a warning first.  I'm sure that's somewhere on their todo list...probably entry #3872.
---
That is definitely the way to go in future.
---
Hang on to a couple of decent weapons for your big trades.I think even those that grind/farm prefer these types of trades in big deals.
---
I hung on to an Assassins Explosive Shotgun and Explosive 308 Sniper Rifle exactly for this reason.
---
I had the explosive Shotgun for about 6 months,and have only just done a straight swap for calibrated Shocks plan for the Ultracite power armour.
---
The Sniper Rifle i used in a straight swap for explosive 556 Automatic Rifle.
---
And this is why I don't spend a dime in the atom shop.
---
Like they have any issues with this game to worry about (sarcasm)
---
The combat rifle comes with multiple skins, but it's not really the cool part. :p
---
Absolutely!
---
That's wicked, all 5* of adrenaline?
---
No.
---
After you kill one, every few minutes, that same scorchbeast will drop... Sometimes it's right on top of you.
---
You'll be trucking along and hear something. If you investigate the sound, you'll sometimes find them dangling off of a roof, in trees, rolling down a hill, or draped over a highway divider like it was in a porno.
---
Here is a screenshot of my response:

Sickening.I feel your pain.
---
All i ever score from the Purveyor is Rolling Pins, and Pool Cues. Dont think she likes me.
---
or a shield
---
Cool,  I have seen the pics if the garand with a box magazine, and seen the flash hider for both the garand and carbine IRL, and the 308 garand... just not the sight or comp.   
---
Thx!
---
no
---
re-rolling the existing stars for scrip or another type of scrip.. maybe
---
Introduced them to doom 1 and 2 first, then minecraft. Now they go off and play whatever but have no interest in FO
---
Yeah. This much is obvious. So much so that it didn't need to be said at all.
---
Oh btw, do you know that water can make things wet? I felt that some people need to hear this.
---
Yeah because you can’t make clickbait videos about red dead, you’ll get flamed
---
This is why you will find dumped Missiles [everywhere.Plus](https://everywhere.Plus) they are heavy.
---
Literally no one uses them.
---
If you get dropped a legendary Missile launcher you literally have to give it away or just scrip it.
---
The Mini Nukes are just as bad.
---
Is that real?
---
Ummmm... now you are making me go to the way way back machine!
---
Only if i was released as bonus material at the end of his other early stuff, not as separate chapters like the green mile was.
---
Yeah. Level 30 is a bit low for the Mire.  I had my CAMP on the lake near Thunder Mountain and I had the occasional mobs shots up, nothing too bad for players above level 50. 
---
My CAMP at around level 30 was between Top of the World and Silo Alpha.  There is a nice stream that runs through there and it's close to the Top of the World area.  I used to run this all the time for XP and to sell weapons.  I didn't have to worry about resources much, but I was mostly a sniper/melee build and neither uses much ammo.
---
I've been feeling the same way, but I will give them one last chance for the wastelander. If they're fucking it up again... well... there are a lot of new upcoming games in 2020 that I've been waiting; Cyberpunk 2077, FF7 Remake, Dying Light 2. Even now I'm not really celebrating 1 year double exp weekend, just playing death stranding and the new pokemon sword shield.
---
in order to cancel your membership status for Xbox you need to go to [https://account.microsoft.com/services/](https://account.microsoft.com/services/)
---
Theres no way they would add this to the game. Especially if its supposed to clip into the ground and you are able to walk around in it
---
You probably can.  
---
It may be Like the fusion generator Plan - many players get it by powering up a power plant - I got it by buying it from Grahm.
---
now let's wait a year and see if the game is still a buggy mess then.
---
OK boomer
---
That much on a melee weapon takes chunks out of her, must be the explosive resistances she has!
---
damn I felt that on the east coast
---
There is a less known one in a vat at West-Tek. Bring a rad suit.
---
should? yes. but that would instantly kill the game because grind is the only end game there is.
---
top game design right there.
---
There’s a couple of copper  veins between WS station and blackwater mine.  light bulbs and fuses have copper.  Crystal decanter in Helvetia, or over 200 at lucky hole mine
---
Yeah, if your character is muscular you'll look like Ben swolo
---
Yes, but only if it's tied in to the looting system. Right now crafting is so pointless when it comes to weapons/armor.
---
Hey at least you waited till after they patched the bug that kicks out half your party making the entire struggle pointless.
---
Maybe?  Would be nice to be able to mod existing effects anyway. Perhaps another Purveyor optional mod that lets you reroll a single primary, secondary or tertiary effect while keeping the others static?  Would still cost scrip to buy it, but it’d be a little less RNG grindy. 
---
But, as others have said, it would radically change the endgame. Maybe something to add once the content has expanded sufficiently.
---
What bug did that?
---
Problems with fo76 were wide spread.
---
Your pc problems for rdr2 is not the shared by everyoneplaying ther game
---
Yao Guai might have hard skin, they get shredded by a Bloodied Meat Hook.
---
Actually come to think of it the Bloodied Meat Hook is super lethal compared to nearly everything.I Pop a Psycho Pill,and diluted Rad X, stand at the Door of Whitespring Club House and Shred all the Ghouls before they can  get one foot through it.
---
If A scorched Lands 2/3 swipes and that to is dead.
---
Trying to get the same damage output with anything else is near on impossible.For instance i have a 50 Caliber Bloodied Sniper Rifle,i can get the damage out put to 600 + Basic..With covert operative/Mr Sandman x 3 at night..Yet it still takes about 20 shots to bring down a level 50 Scorched Beast.They are not really worth the ammunition.
---
Weapons damage in Fallout 76 badly needs an overhaul.
---
Around the time of launch there was a serious bug that made the nuke nearly impossible for some people, me and some buddies had to try around six times before all four of us could go through the whole thing without someone being kicked at random.
---
Yeah I think you’re right as far as future dealings go
---
Lol the negative comments get 10+ upvotes the positive ones from people who still play &amp; enjoy get downvoted.. this sub is dead it’s run by the krill army now😂
---
I see. "An item". But you reported more than one item in your ticket right? In any case, I am sure one of the community mods will be able to answer this with certainty. 
---
The short of it is that text can be changed. Whether you purposely are trying to cover your own ass or sincerely are the victim of dupers (PC is the only place these items have been stolen from the dev room iirc) trying to be funny and stacking dev items in the Queen's corpse.. doesn't matter in the end of it all.
---
You get downvoted for liking the game😂 Jesus this sub is pathetic nowadays
---
So what your saying is I give up on those outfits.
---
I’ve gotten some half way decent stuff honestly. I like to strike when she’s giving out sales but I’ve heard a lot of people sayin it’s rigged to give out garbage during those sales haha
---
People need to see her as a boss that gives a 3* roll on everyone, not on just yourself.
---
Who else are you going to buy them from? the amount of recipes left over from the SBQ must be tiny by now, and the only other option is buying from dupers. Why would i want to reward a cheat with my hard earned caps?. So yes i buy from MODUS. Like a good Enclave General.
---
They can't make 3 star enemies guarantee 3 star drops. People will start ignoring everything except 3 star enemies.
---
Yes. It shouldn’t be easy, but there should be a mechanic to do so.
---
It’s not a free-for-all.
---
Hi,
---
Could you tell if it (hunter's hood) protects you from environmentsl hazards (like a gas mask for example) or it is just purely cosmetic?
---
I find having to equip the Skill Cards Lock /Hacking/Ammo/Gunsmith/Fix it Good/Hard Bargain Cards constantly irritating.
---
Once you earn those Perks there should be no need to keep equipping/reequipping them.
---
There is no in game advantage to be had from simply permanently enabling those skills once  you have earned them.
---
That sounds god awful,we just went in when my mate was level 28 and we hadn't deciphered the 8 silo codes.so we got bodied and had to leave anyway
---
I was just looking back at my messages and decided to be a little snarky
---
Ya I get that, not trying to deceive. I get that it’s just my word and all. Just trying to make sense of it myself.
---
Saw him twice within two hours yesterday.  Saved me from a hoarse of Ghouls the first time, hammered them flat.  On Hwy 62 by the Fissure.
---
That would be interesting to see giant black balls killing people
---
Just cosmetic i think, not 100% sure tho
---
I love the 10mm auto pistol with silencer.  The sneak perks and how quiet it is is a lot of fun.  It seems like you point at an enemy and they fall down.
---
The scrip and caps limit needs to not be a thing.
---
Looks like CC purchasers will be paying for the privilege to beta test for Wastelanders.
---
Dude, the only thing they care about is profit, and the people who don't follow this subreddit or get into the community more than just playing the game don't understand this.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.
---
yep, this subreddit is filled with delusional shills
---
That just means you haven't played or looted world spawns much over that month. Just loot more, and you'll get your daily respawns. I actually think this system is reasonable.
---
One of the best camps I've seen - nice job Captain!
---
A small detail I appreciate about 76 is that there isnt jet anywhere in the game (that Im aware of at le.ast). It seems like they heard the criticism from the pre war jet fiasco with Fallout 4.
---
This place has always been pathetic.
---
I’m just back from a month away after the FO1st debacle. I still love the game. I’ve been playing since a few weeks after launch and am at L75. Glad I’ve taken it slow, because there are times I get a little bored and looking forward to some new content, but there are whole areas of the map I’m yet to see (heading to Sal’s Grinders for the first time tonight). 
---
The world makes sense to me. I played OuterWorlds for the last month, and while it’s a fine game, I don’t feel like I’m part of the game’s world like I do with Fallout. 
---
I really hope Bethesda/Zenimax don’t turn FO76 into Fortnight and its P2W model. Aside from the money (my youngest son just dropped $600 on Fortnight’s in-game purchases last month without me knowing – but that’s a whole other story), It just seems it would be a disservice to the game and it’s fans, and Fortnight already does Fortnight perfectly!
---
I love the grind for weapons and armour. I love that I sometimes have to spend a 3-4 hour session on inventory, crafting, camp repairs, weapons and armour repairs, trading and apparel without firing a single shot. I love heading out to find a crafting ingredient and end up not seeing my camp for a week.
---
You can carry a max of 30k. Anyone who even talks about prices over that for anything,  I want nothing to do with them.   Giving half to one character and half to a mule or however it works... you know what? Fuck that.  Frankly, I wan't pay more than 10k for anything.   The most I've charged for anything is 3k.
---
At level 30 you're going to get your ass handed to you in the mire unless you are in one of the few remote areas that I think of. Im a level 120 and I regularly grind from Freddies house of scares down to Tanagra. It all depends on where you go. But be careful, a lot of those areas where there happens to be nothing, there is "Queen of the hunt" cryptids and mirelurk queens. 
---
If I had to pick a spot at level 30, I'd go south east od the hidden church and yes south east of the power pylon and be about as close to the boundary as possible, follow it down until you have to jump down and then you'll be near water and relatively safe.
---
When I first came to the mire I was a level 30 too and found myself in the middle of two scorchbeasts fighting a mirelurk queen...
---
I thought after a year this game was going to be sick. But now, a year later, I don’t have any hope left.
---
Yeah, exactly.  I use the blue suitcases at the Whitespring and Berkeley stations, as they get the most traffic.
---
like in the select difficulty waiting room? if so these are the 2 issues my team experienced and how we fixed it
---
&gt; if wearing PA
---
enter without PA on, put it on in waiting room
---
&gt; if plants are super dark color
---
wait about 30 sec-1 min to let it finish, dont press anything loading
---
No, but I think a weapon could become legendary through a ranking challenge system.  Say a system that rewards like challenges, kill 76 scorch beasts and you get a rank up and perk against them. Letting them stack up so that the weapons become legendary on their own. Not true legendary, but powerful personal, yet sell able, legendary weapons.
---
FYI, you don't loot the Fixer plans, it's a reward for finishing the event. If you don't get to loot the Imposter, then all you miss out on is some scrap, an assaultron head and a legendary item.
---
You expect them to include features?
---
Automatic ski sword
---
I like seeing the positive stories about encounters they’ve had with community members &amp; such now we just get this shit lol. If you hate the game so much make another sub so we don’t have to abandon a good sub 🤷🏽‍♂️ that’s my thoughts on it. We get it, you hate 76 but plenty of us don’t so go do something with your life😂
---
1 star meat hooks for me, should have kept them to show how many
---
The Red Dead sub reddit has been flooded with complaints just the same way this one gets...
---
That's correct. You also lose the ability to place the survival camp
---
This scene reminded me of my absolute hatred of scorchbeasts as a low level getting wrecked and finding out a mission I had to do involved a scorchbeast 
---
https://youtu.be/W9spwDEcz5I
---
This never even crossed my mind.  It’d be perfect.  I haven’t seen anyone participate in Project Paradise in weeks and it saddens me.
---
&gt; The game is just downright boring.
---
You're not wrong. 
---
I just want to launch my nuke, finish the main quest, and go on to the next game.
---
Bladed tracking top hat
---
Big oof
---
Thank you
---
Eeyup
---
I think they might roll that out on private servers
---
I know it does, that's why I wanted to start a explosive bloodied to see how it was and I'm just disappointed honestly!! Spent a whole build to find out that it was pointless. Yes it can kill alot of things but the real test is a sbq
---
So you don't have it anymore or you do but just cant move it?
---
There's still quite a few in Market76, definitely not dupers.
---
That film is hilarious.
---
I think the most I've had wad in the 12000 range, and only on a higher character where I had bought all the stuff I wanted (and had learned on others whay not to bother buying)
---
Good question.  I assume it will be gone.
---
Same.
---
They suck at everything man. At least the fat man one shots things, the missile launcher can barely do that to even low level enemies, has a long fire rare and a small explosion radius, not to even mention the fact of how quickly it breaks. Even a [bloodied one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaOFpvG5zLM) sucks
---
As a laser gat user I have to use the power plants to farm fusion cores. on public server if I take all three I feel a little bad for hogging them all. also I am not build for pvp. Also the private servers are much more stable and less likely to crash. so for me the private servers are great for when I am really low on fusion cores and need to get restocked as fast as possible. I have been stockpiling about 100 or 150 fusion cores in private then i go to public. instead of just burning through my stash I still keep one power plant running on public while I am out killing etc and it just extends the amount of time till I go back to private to restock. 
---
All that usefullness aside. I don't like actually being on the private server. no shops to go look at no rando conversations etc. needs to have my people watchin. :P
---
Nothing.
---
Thanks to this game I realized how fucked up Bethesda is.
---
And you didn’t have awesome weapons yet because, Bethesda just likes snakes and sparklers?
---
Knife tipped shoes
---
I stopped playing after one month. This is what killed it for me. I spent all night grinding for a new, making sure the server was populated, and put my mic on for gamechat. Not one person recieved loot from what an otherwise epic battle.
---
Before people ask me to leave, I'm still subbed incase this issue is fixed, and it only hurts to see it still isn't. I'm also sorry for those of you who grind it out only to receive nothing. I hope your game time is much more rewarding than mine was.
---
Absolute crap right now I’m still getting my perk cards ranked up since I didn’t think to build them up from the start. So just shot gunner, expert shot gunner, and skeet shooter right now but I’m still putting out 205 base damage on my quad double barrel
---
Timeless, you are 100% true. Want to watch another timeless one ( it’s probably more funny now because of how wrong it is.) watch “Airplane” anyone is fine but I suggest the first one
---
I meant in the media; yes, both subs get flooded with complaints but only FO76 got trashed in the press (at launch)
---
Instead of Netflix and chill, Fallout and grind.
---
Boomerang dildos
---
What are you ps4 and do you have Ultracite calibrated shocks?!
---
It is a fucking game, not a religion.
---
You were so right there until the end :/
---
Lol, people just make 100 characters and transfer money between them.
---
We know, and?
---
That's because RDR2 only has technical issues with the PC port where as 76 had technical issues across all three platforms, plus game design issues, plus company relations issues, plus lack of content issues. Not to mention Rockstar seem to be working towards actually fixing things where as 76 took ages to release minor patches and is still fucked to this day.
---
It is, a lot of other perks that a good pistol build will need are there also.  They should have put it in Perception like rifles.
---
With a two shot and max perks I get 3365 damage out of a two shot fat man
---
The funs come from the sandbox and customization in my opinion.
---
I’ll keep my unlimited junk box thanks.
---
Which you have to pay loads of money to truly experience.
---
Two-shot explosive anal bead cannon
---
Here's my issue with that... Of the last 10 Queen fights I have randomly joined, half of them last more than a minute. 
---
I don't know what the hell is doing it but something is pretty much insta killing this event. When this happens too quickly people aren't getting rewarded for the event and some are getting hits on the queen but not able to loot. 
---
THEN we have the glitch which I still  see going on to this day where people are getting through the silos in less than five minutes. So couple that with the 2 minute queen kills and see where that gets us? How about we fix whatever is doing both of these things first so this event is rewarding and difficult and not some damn farm??
---
Flame throwing nipple mods
---
I made a post about how fallout 1st is bad and scummy and everyone was defending the $100 a year subscription service for a game with "free dlc".
---
I hope so. I don't want to be responsible for ruining people's camp spawn because of a tent I can't remove.
---
We don't need a third stash/scrap/junk box, just increase the stash size ffs.
---
Electrified assassin's synthetic vagina
---
I pretty much use it just like you are. Never below 50 cores now haha. Free ammo.
---
They're listening, they're just not acknowledging a lot of it.

Untrue. I would still kill 1 stars for the scrip.
---
Haha they’ll get 4 stars
---
You don't have it anymore. Which is a bummer but that's a perk for having first
---
Ya’ll seriously need to chill out. All these posts PRIOR to basically a re-release of their game (NPC’s, reputation system, dialogue system, companions, new weapons, armors, enemies, a brand new main quest line, need I go on...) is getting old. Either uninstall and stop complaint or just patiently wait like the rest of us. 
---
End rant.
---
Or they do understand this but really just dont care
---
Honestly.
---
Red dead on pc has ad issues for less than half the players. 
---
That’s on one system.
---
76 has had issues on ALL platforms for nearly ALL users. I’ve personally played though the story until after the SBQ on both XBone and PS4 and had multiple issues on both, not to mention the PS4 version looks like a PS3 game.
---
76 has earned its critics. It enjoy the game, but to try and compare any or it’s issues to another game is just reaching at this point. I can’t remember any game having this many problems.
---
They've been irradiated, so they are much bigger in size now. Radroaches, Radants, Radscorpions, you get the picture.
---
Surprisingly, fallout 76 is one of my favorite games, granted I am disappointed in Bethesda for their recent behavior, but the game is still fun
---
Faraz I know, no. They were taken from a Dev room.
---
There's also some lootable containers in those vats of neutralized FEV.
---
I tried to be positive, but i work full time and I never fuckin play it anymore, esp with Outer Worlds, and I just got GTA V for the first time lol
---
Correct. Cannot be used in PA
---
I have. You don't even have to be hostile to them. If you have the option to revive them, you also have the option to "execute" them. Choosing the latter will have you eat them.
---
I've gone numerous times and not a single thing I could loot from the dead body. Lately I'll just event hop just to get 1 reward for joining which is usually a 1 or 2 star armor. It's good for scripts. 🤷
---
...folks cheating somehow maybe? 
---
That's crazy though. How the hell are people taking down a queen that fast? I know it's been like 2 months since I played last but I didn't think they'ed nerfed certain monsters THAT hard in updates.
---
This is incorrect. Both rings have full rad damage. 
---
The rads from a Radium rifle are also doubled with the TS effect even though ballistic damage is not.
---
Totally agree. I put up with all the flaws of this game and played almost nothing else for the last year, but I'm pretty much over it. And it's mainly due to the infuriating lack of care that Bethesda is showing towards the fanbase. I used to think all the "hate" against Bethesda was just a bandwagon edgy trend driven by clickbaiting youtubers and people who had never even touched the game. But now I can't stand with Bethesda anymore, they deserve all the hate they are getting.
---
What you are seeing is queen killing teams.
---
You can go all the way through a solo, put in the code and not launch. A team will all solo each silo, then launch one. They kill the queen, one of them goes to a primed silo which has no enemies and has all the steps completed, then launches the second nuke. 
---
They are all pretty much spec’d for max damage with a specific bloodied build. I have seen someone 2 hit kill the queen. Something like 24k damage each hit.
---
No
---
Sounds like your probably just really bad at the game lol. 
---
I get upset when I'm bad at things to sometimes.
---
Literally no one cares though. Fallout 1st purchasers will continue to buy Fallout 1st. Bethesda will continue to be Bethesda. And the world will continue spinning. As Benny said, you’re just crying in the rain.
---
Bethesda is reminding me an awful lot of like twitter accounts and Facebook groups. You subscribe to them because you like their content and then all of a sudden they sell their account and you start getting crap content/spam. 
---
I have been a Beth fan since Morrowind. But their antics lately have made me change from “Hell yeah I am preordering the next Elder Scrolls” to “Ehhh I will wait a couple of months to see reviews on whether it’s worth it or not”. It’s sad to see your fave studio fall so far.
---
Some aspects of the story are pretty good. Some of the holotapes are fantastic as well as a few side quests.
---
If you're in it thinking it's an online multiplayer looter/shooter, forget about it. There are better, more stable options out there.
---

---
People already payed for the game so they can't give a shit about players. They don't even care about ruining the name bethesda
---
Sir, the real problem is that you bought an incomplete game. So I welcome you to the club of people that Bethesda has completely screwed over. Not that you've been successfully bent over a barrel, I'd like to direct your attention to the atomic shop. There you will continue to be screwed over. Please enjoy
---
# SIGH!
---
not totally free. you have the cap fee for the shop. if you just build a fusion generator the shop never has the nuclear waste and if you are like me and actually preferr to sefend them you always have to spend some oil and gears by the time you get to 20 turrets. I have one blue print of 4 level 2 turrens on a 1x1 building. i throw 5 out first thing. after the first defense I start making the resource extractors etc. but yeah still very ammo efficent overall.
---
Yea I wasn’t rubber banding while doing most things, it was mainly only when I tried to swim or go up stairs in certain places
---
I'm all in man, gt: apneac
---
No, they are only on PC because they were taken from a dev room if you get one on PC and scrap it you know the plan and can craft them.  No plan is available.
---
I’ll help out, my gt is DarkRepulserXB1
---
honestly I think this is hopeful and wishful thinking....
---
I don’t know a lot about the atomic shop, but by your description it sounds like something that would activate my fight or flight
---
Nah thats not up my ally, I watch mainly horror films sometimes ill watch something funny.
---
[removed]
---
It’s coming back for patch 15
---
The story is interesting, and the side stuff you can find is really neat.
---
Comparing a actual Storygame with f76 lol
---
B.E.T.A. age issue they made worse with a poorly executed nerf to all Explosive effects (perks etc).... 
---
Weight vs Damage etc the Missile launcher and Fatman are comically bad.
---
I remember when right after launch she was so buggy that 50% of the time she didn't even drop a legendary stuff only meat
---
If the queens body isn’t dropping anything that means that you didn’t do enough damage to her. The threshold is ~1000 damage and she should drop her normal stuff. I’ve noticed my low level characters almost always can get any drops from her ever but all of my setup builds never have an issue getting drops at all
---
I got my money out of it at least. Now I'm knee deep in RDR2 and not looking back. 
---
Wastelanders was going to pull me back but at this rate...
---
That doesn't make any sense. Why make it a challenge if it's just supposed to be an hour counter. A playtime counter is a feature exists in most games to where the challenge aspect if that all its needed for makes no sense. And twenty atoms for actually doing that is still a stupid reward. For anyone willing to complete that they should most definitely be getting something worth the effort
---
Yeah you're not wrong. I stuck with it in hopes it would become something great but nah, guess not. Thanks Todd!!!
---
I and many friends of mine are vendors. I'll spread the word for ya. Are you on Xb1?
---
Yeah,it keeps you moving around the world and not just farming a single spot. Good design i think.
---
Debbie downer (reality check), bethesda is a business. And businesses have employees.  They need a liveable wage. Health insurance, time off for children, Illness, a mental health day for goodness sake! Why, why on earth should they simply GIVE us anything? Fallout 4 with all the DLC'S paid at full price was $120!! And still buggy... all games are buggy. What is it you people want? I will tell you, you want it all for free because you feel like they owe you something.  They don't! Not only that, but Bethesda has another company with money invested in the game and its REASONABLE to assume that they are calling some of the shots when it comes to all things FO76. Stop with the bitching. Play the game, don't... but just stop! This entire reddit is nothing but children saying I want I want... grow up. And PLEASE, DOWNVOTE ME TO OBLIVIAN. It will only prove my point. I am counting on it.
---
Doesn’t your laser gat melt people often? They have nuke waste in them! Haha. Make sure to use contractor as well

The word 'Gourmand' simply refers to a person who takes great pleasure and interest in consuming good food and drink. It's hardly MY fault that the word was co-opted by a group of raiders.

I mean, if people complaining about it don’t have a life, the people complaining about the people complaining about it definitely don’t.
---
Because you can hop to public world's, no, you shouldn't be able to.thatwould ruin any sort of economy the game has.
---
Spot on answer buddy...
---
Nice one👍🏼 go back to the ocean krill
---
Go back to swallowing Daddy Todd’s load paying $12.99 for the pleasure
---
It is sick. Just the normal definition instead of the fun one.
---
You’re probably a real treat at parties (although you’ve likely never been invited to one) shows in your attitude 🥰
---
I bet you try to bring Fallout 76 to parties and then they lock you out and do something fun instead 
---
Then you ask if you can pay $12.99 to get in
---
I have not SEEN with my own eyes the player glitch through the silo I've watched the silo like a hawk when this happens and there aren''t teammates waiting but even if that isn't happening and these are actually teams (I can't stress how much I highly doubt this) the queen is still dying in seconds giving no one loot or rewards.. I mean, after not getting shit the first few times they take her out to fast why continue to waste the entire event for everyone? That's thee only end game we got and most time it's fucked. If I'm not freezing up randomly (eating/consumables is better! not freezing me up) it's these players wasting the event in seconds.
---
Same joke twice🥱 try again
---
I mean Fallout 76 is such a big joke I can just say “$12.99” and it still stings your little heart
---
Yup. My little heart is stinging alright.. you’ve got me pal. Go on &amp; tell your mommy about it🥱
---
It may not be the game for you. It's not a game for everyone. RD2 is a great game by every metric games are measured by but I just cannot bring myself to give a shit about being a cowboy. its just not the game for me.
---
   The social aspects of the game are clunky as fuck. a lot of people don't like it and the game has a ton of bad mouthing aimed at it. the teaming up is awkward, adding to friend list is awkward, joining friends on other servers is awkward. for me the vibe is what makes me play. I don't give a shit if my friends play. I feel like if you cant connect with some of the holotapes you find in flatwoods and you can't just geek out at the environmental story telling,  rusted old timey cars, and super mutants. it just may be the wrong game for you. 
---
if you're getting pvped by someone you are probably choosing to do pvp by accidentally filling the requirements to go into said pvp. 
---
I still get the occasional glitch but the amount of bugs in this game has been dramatically reduced. 
---
Theres so many fun aspects you're probably missing out on but everyone describes fun in a different way and what may be fun for me may not be for you.
---
No we need to keep speaking up so if in the slight chance they start giving a shit again then they can change for the better.
---
No, they just made the interior of the airport harder, and moved those quests to a terminal outside...
---
Go tell your mommy to top off the bank account she set up for you so you can get some Fallout FuckYou™️
---
This was inevitable, I mean think about it. They’ve finally stopped reselling Skyrim so they’re only source of revenue is FO76 and ESO, so they’re going to milk as much as possible out of it in this period that their main games such as Starfield and ES6 are in development, and and while ESO has had its issues I think it’s mostly improved and can be enjoyable to play, it also sports loads of microtransactions.
---
I think most people expected FO76 to turn out something like that but the fact that the Atom Shop is always being updated and maintained more than the game itself is just shows that this game has been a cash grab since day 1, and I get it, some people enjoy this game (I have no idea why but they do) but that doesn’t make it a good game, and imo anyone defending FO76 at this point might as well be a whale, but I might be a little harsh as imo FO76 should have been dead on arrival.
---
I know this might ruffle some feathers as my experience with this subreddit has been mostly fanboys defending this game but the time to give Bethesda the benefit of the doubt has long passed.
---
🥱🥱🥱 you either make the same worn out joke or repeat after me. I guess I know who’s a follower 🙇🏻‍♂️
---
And it breaks after like 4 shots
---
But it's worth it!
---
i defended the game up until wastelanders was pushed back
---
They do give a shit. They do. Y'all just aren't seeing past the fact that they are a business and TOUGH sometimes downright shitty decisions have to be made to stay in the green. Period. They have to look at the long run, and the current state of all things the world, everyone wants what they want right this second. Enough.
---
Maybe the follower is the person who pays $12.99 for basic content promised day one, then goes on Reddit to complain people are being mean to your favowite grifter company 
---
Hate to tell you this, but the game sucks, you suck, and going on Reddit to defend a rich company that openly pisses in your mouth makes you a dunce, LOL
---
Oh, the in-game community is just superb. My experience came when I found myself looking for a one downright sneeky-deeky terminal in the DMV building for over an hour. Another player walked in (scared the shit put of me too, still having ptsd from the overleveled ghoul hordes) and I was able to ask them where the terminal was (in a corner I had passed several times)
---
The queen takedown is someone who has cheesed the bloodied build out with every armor piece, chem, food, mag, bobblehead, team shared perk and perk loadout possible. It's not cheating so much as cheesin'. The game allows someone to get that powerful but the event ending so quickly doesn't thus the game isn't sure what to reward.  
---
Gonna need to fix this as its becoming the norm.
---
Same old same old🥱 come back when you’ve got an original comeback little guy
---
How pathetic is it that they’re not even paying you to be a vanguard troll, you’re just so worthless they banked on you doing it free
---
I had a person on my friend list join tonight, so the issue is not universal.
---
You’re the only troll here buddy. Now stop replying you’re putting me to sleep with your repetitive nonsense🥱
---
Try one in the same; “ tucker and dale vs evil”
---
If you do not share your platform, no one can help you.
---
Well my one friend joins just fine. He has fallout 1st but my husband dont and he cant
---
They really don’t care if they did would they have broke there promise of cosmetic only or put out a subscription service that is not only overpriced but broken as well.
---
Dawww is the troll angry that Fallout 76’s hype was for nothing? You finally had an out from being such a miserable little puke and it was ripped away one shitty bug and greedy financial decision at a time.
---
Don’t worry. For $12.99 a month, Todd Howard will come to your house and nuzzle you to sleep.
---
I’m playing rn, so the hypes on kiddo. It’s waaay past your bedtime, go get tucked in 🥱
---
I have preloaded silos before so I am betting it’s this. When I go to launch the second nuke, it takes like maybe 3 min to navigate back to the launch room. Idk it might be something else but I have def done this with friends and it’s the easiest way to do triple queen. I’m not a super queen killer but if you do it enough times, you can do a silo run in about 10 minutes solo (lockpick and hack the reactor computer, have mainframe cores with you, etc), then come back and just run to the end and select the nuke location. My friends normally fast travel back to camps or watoga to store junk while I do this. 
---
For the queen, you have to meet a damage threshold to loot her. So if there are 20 people there and 2 take a couple of shots and then hide in the workbench shed, they aren’t going to get loot. Because they did not do the minimum amount of damage to receive loot. 
---
If 1-4 people have insane damage and can kill her almost instantly, the rest of the server will not damage her enough to get loot. But that team will have.
---
It’s a dick move for sure. But generally these people do triple queen, switch servers to do another triple queen and just keep doing it. I talked to a dude who was buying materials and damaged cores in bulk and he said a crazy number like 75 a day and that he could kill a queen in like 24 seconds solo and showed proof.
---
I think everyone just uses that as a "hours played" stat.
---
I've worked through a few of the destroy robots challenges.
---
I think that's too much effort for Bethesda, they're too busy putting Fallout 4 cosmetics in the atom shop
---
Do you have 1st?  I am kind of confused by your posts.
---
the last thing I did before coming to work was kill the queen. that was fun. I got some help from a bunch of lower than 100 but higher than 50 guys. I enjoyed listening to them in open they were really having fun. it was a pretty chaotic battle and it took far longer than any decently well practiced crew could do. I actually prefer a longer more chaotic fight with newer people now days. they are super excited and amped to be there. the rally high level guys are literally fighting sleep to keep going, 
---
then I finished the queen fight and returned home. I have a bath haus now. it is an outdoor toilet / anti radiation arch. theres a display next to the toilet . it has a plunger and three rolls of toilet paper. There's a ceiling fan and the roof is vented for air flow.I don't want a stinky hot bathroom. 
---
I sorted all my crap and managed my inventory. stored all my things. I swapped out a couple floor peices, then I surveyed my domain for a couple minutes before leaving to work IRL. that was a good session for me.
---
Yes. I have fallout first. But my husband does not. My friends who do not have 1st ironically cant join
---
“You repeat your jokes”
---
*proceeds to use the same insult 3 times*
---
Difference is mine’s relevant. Fallout 76 is a shit heap and you’re one of the mindless cunts that not only swipes your disappointed mommy’s credit card to buy their crappy service, you go online and *brag about it*.
---
You might as well wear a name badge that says “Hi! I’m worthless!”
---
...........but they made a little short documentary about making the game
---
Find where I told you it’s past your bedtime &amp; you need to be tucked in... I’ll wait🥱 when are you gonna be done kiddo
---
Well that is not as intended clearly, submit a ticket to Bethesda is about all you can do
---
Then maybe they should just make good product, like a business would. Then more people would buy it and this would not be such a problem for grrr he community.
---
Oh ive seen it, good film.
---
creation club? fucking disgusting. as a modder myself, paid or monetized mods especially by large AAA companies getting paid for our hard fucking work? is absolutely disgusting.

LMAO look at your comment history! It’s literally months of you just playing F076 and posting shit on Reddit every hour of the day! Jesus Christ I’m talking to someone who LITERALLY does nothing but play Fallout76!
---
No wonder you’re so pissed at people who make fun of it. *IT’S YOUR WHOLE LIFE!* lol!
---
I wish there was a smaller subscription without private worlds where we keep the stuff. Ive had this problem for a few days
---
That's crazy. How long did it take to do? Also what confuses me isn't so much the challenges but why they give you so little. And they really should have just put in a hours played feature and made that challenge actually obtainable instead
---
Whaackkk
---
Those people are horrible enablers.
---
Someone mentioned this earlier. Suggested fix was to have the person that can’t join hard quit the game, log out and back in to console, then try again.

This song is basically Fallout 76 summed up.

No man, I wouldn’t think you’d be posed. I would genuinely feel bad for you if you weren’t already shown to be a snarky cunt. You do nothing with your life but play FO76 and post about it on Reddit, it’s literally your personality at this point, and you cry when someone criticizes it.
---
This is more of a “go seek help” kind of deal, because you clearly don’t have a job. Your mom’s funding this and I’m sure she’s sick of it, lol.

I really don’t know why people who don’t even play the game are in this sub either. They come and complain etc but don’t even play the game. It’s ridiculous.

Some people also think McDonalds is health food if you get the fish. One person thinking a game is good, doesn't make it a good game. Even if that one person is yourself. Try to expand your horizons and try some other games. Theres alot better out there.

I've been thinking about it and decided that when I get that far along, Im not going to actively set stuff like that in vendors but instead set up lettering and have low levels get my attention by picking up a free Blank Holotape from the vendor (forgot where I got those but can get alot quickly) then I would come over when im able.
---
You don't magically lose 50fps. That's a pic issue
---
No, it's not. It's legitimately a bad game. But that doesn't mean you can't enjoy it. As I said, I enjoy it as well, but I'm well aware it's a terribly made game.
---
Bunch of RDR apologists. 
---
I've been only playing RDO for 2 months but the idea that console's haven't had problems is ridiculous. 
---
Disconnects are a regular occurrence. 
---
Including one's that consistently happen when completing bounties. 
---
Camps get removed constantly and you're lucky if they can get placed down again. 
---
I've had bad pop up, like 50ft ahead of me and frame rate drops. 
---
I personally think 1st is much better than the outlaw pass. Outlaw pass being 35 gold, roughly $14 for cosmetics and emotes, that aren't guaranteed because you still have to grind for them, 1st $13 for cosmetics and emotes (although not as many) that are given to you upfront for no grind and both "rebate" your upfront cost with equivalent in game currency.  Now ask RDO people if they'd like private servers. 
---
Fallout weapons and items can be picked up in world or crafted, RDO those items have to be purchased by in game money. 
---
How about that time they have you a free horse but you could only use real world money to insure it. 
---
Oh and how about in game insurance?
---
And that doesn't even talk about an infinitely worse monetization model. The fact that the dual currency is co-mingled means that most items can be purchased by real world currency. 
---
And that leads to REAL pay to win. You can buy a "rare" shotgun that is identical performance wise to a vanilla one that is level locked to 30. 
---
And though all other weapons and ability cards and card upgrades are level locked, you still need to grind for cash to buy it. But of course since the currency is co-mingled, if you can't be bothered to grind you can spend real world money to bypass that.
---
How do u fix that. Im having the same problem my husband isnt showing up in my social menu under friends just under recent
---
of course my man on all parts. still aint free though :P
---
People need to understand Bethesda, a AAA Gaming Company, fairly large, has made all these bad descisions.  And they have earned the place most of the community sees them at.  
---
They made a bad descision pushing off 76 last year as it is fundamentally flawed.  And they made one attempt to "Fix the Game," then went straight for your wallet.  Personally I believe Wastelanders won't even make the game what people want it to be, seeing Bethesda's track record.
---
If I end up getting proven wrong, I'll be surprised. But I dont see any of these games (Fallout, Elder Scrolls, Wolfenstien) going anywhere good under Bethesda Games at this point, as there has been a clear disconnect after Fallout 4.
---
Why the fuck is there a disclaimer on this? fallout 1st is a disgusting cash grab you can say that loud and proud till the day you die.
---
the junk box should be 10000% free in the game. it should be an APOLOGY for us putting up with their broken buggy game!
---
Maybe you just logged in wrong because when I log in I have fun.
---
Bruh half the times I fight the queen I don't even get loot
---
heck of a lot better than public servers though. just being able to run around and defend without staying crouches all the time is as free as running naked through a meadow.

I've been playing for a year.

I'm not overly concerned with 20 atoms, so I'm not worried about how many you get for it.

There are *still* people on this sub who gladly spend money on Atoms.
---
Had so much hope for this game. Now it's all replaced with heartbreak at what they've done to my favorite game series.
---
reads like you have quest markers checked to not show on accident somehow. 
---
go to inventory &gt;data&gt; main and side quests. if you click them you can toggle them to show or not show.
---
Lol, I love this game, it's like a b grade 70s movie; "Corpse Grinder" so bad it's good.
---
Yeah there is no stress when you build it up either because your effort won’t go to waste
---
I subbed for the private server stuff. It was cool for a little bit. Being able to claim all the workshops with my friends was awesome. There was almost zero lag. The game felt like I was running it just from my PC. But it got boring. Same dailies, same events, same nuke launches and Vault raids. There just wasn't enough to do. We all unsubbed from the 1st stuff and are taking a break. We are waiting for Wastelanders to come out, but I feel the same trend will continue. Run through all the content and then there will be the bare minimum trickle of content after that. It sucks because I really like this game, I just wish there was more stuff to do.
---
Yippie Kayai pilgrim
---
Yeah it is. Not sure why so many people want to think they're the authority of what I find good.
---
Ayyy same. Picked up RDR2 after months of not touching it. Lots of great content now 👍.
---
Bethesda only wants to appeal to investors and those at the top are pushing every single method to do so, at the expense of seemingly evertything including reputation as I believe they presume they can recover that in time once they've secured investment.
---
It’s weird because I feel like they’d be making more money legitimately if they weren’t shady. I WANT to give Bethesda money for cool cosmetics and stuff, but the cosmetics aren’t even that good, and they are grossly overpriced. I bought 10 bucks worth of atoms on one of those sales and haven’t even spent them because I kept holding out for more cool stuff on the shop, why should I buy even more? I’ve also made it most of the way through the campaign, I even took my time and messed around doing side stuff to drag it out, and they’ve barely added any content. It’s like they’re deliberately trying to sink the game. I’m truly baffled.
---
Your comment makes no sense. Seeing as they are a business, don’t you think that the smart business decision would be to make a product that works, that will garnish good reviews, and that more people will ultimately want to buy?

I mean, you can think it's good. You're just wrong. This game is unfinished, buggy, glitchy, lag issues, latency, etc. I could go on. It's legitimately a bad game, but if you wanna think it's good, go for it. You're just wrong.
---
Like I said, you're mixing two different things. There's a BIG difference between enjoying something and it being good. You can enjoy something that's bad, or dislike something that's good. Overwatch is the example I use. So many people love Overwatch, yet I find it boring. But that's just me. I still understand it's a great game, I just don't particularly enjoy it. Fallout 76 has too many problems to be considered a good game, but I still enjoy it and so can you.
---
Nah,  it's a good game.
---
I put it a ticket and they responded saying that they are aware of this issue and encourage me to also submit a feedback ticket about it, as they are seen directly by their developers.
---
So I enjoy the open world one, I doubt I'll ever play the Battle Royale because it sounds like it's a lot of griefing in hacking... too old to enjoy battle royale's anyway
---
You’re ignoring the fact they would be making far more money right now if they made better decisions that encouraged people to play the game ***AND*** spend money on it.
---
So someone IS getting loot and the event rewards though for sure everytime? The dude at least one shotting it is getting the flux and looting the body? Does how fast the event lasts and/or cooldown between nukes have any effect on rewards/loot do you figure? Sitting here thinking about it, I DEF met the damage thresholds and wasn't rewarded for the event but was able to look the body. Ever see that happen?
---
So fallout76 is better than both of those?
---
I was hoping they’d pull a Skyrim with this game, but nope one whole year later and the game is still a buggy mess
---
Thanks. Forgot all about the tent.
---
Since the beginning FO76 has been acknowledged as a side project and has been treated as such. No surprise there we can agree upon. 
---
As a side project, I’m not surprised it’s a complete cash grab. I am surprised, however, the core game is still broken yet they still think a broken game can grab oodles of cash.
---
This is exactly me man
---
I'm looking for one too [PS4] .   I saw a couple for upwards of 15k and would have snapped them up but I didn't quite have enough caps on me at either time.
---
&gt;	Fallout 4’s crappy four year old engine
---
TFW you think the engine is only years old...
---
This is the same engine as FO3 which was release 11 years ago.
---
I put Seinfeld voice onto your post and now I can't unhear it. OH I'll be kramer!
---
"Jerry Jerry. It was Neuman. I just found out I heard from a guy who knew a guy yeah, Neuman was in charge of typing in all the rewards  He had a TYPO a TYPO it was supposed to be 200000. Any way when he submitted his work the manager caught it and laughed. He thought Neuman was joking and it was so hilarious he kept it to troll the players! Neuman actually got a RAISE!" 
---
"neuuuuumaaaan"
---
I think that they stopped reselling Skyrim because they ran out of relevant platforms.
---
Just you wait for PS5 and we'll get Skyrim: Future Edition with no changes outside of maybe new logo of the game.
---
Keep the downvotes coming. I love it!!! I will reiterate the FACT that there is another company financially involved in this game. And while Bethesda may not agree, the POCKET BOOK may have other ideas. Still a  business trying very hard to please the customer and the financial backer. Not an easy situation. I find it hard to believe there is no one in this reddit that understands this. With the exception of the first comment.
---
Yeah, but we can all agree something NEEDS to change so Fallout doesn't die.
---
Even though it looks like Hood with bandana it doesn't.
---
lol challanges are these weird things that keep happening as I go about doing whatever. I never go out of my way to do any of them they just kinda pop up as complete sometimes lol.
---
Thanks!
---
If someone quickly kills the queen, they will be the only ones to loot the body. Everyone should be getting the event rewards regardless of damage though. I have gotten it hella delayed - like an hour later. Just would be fast traveling around and it pops up, but that hasn’t happened in awhile. 
---
No, time spent and cool down don’t effect it, the thought is that if you do a crazy amount a day, chances are one of those won’t be a one star 😂 
---
There is a delightful new glitch where if you die at the end of the event, and it does the event count down til spawn, you will be unable to interact with the spawn button (can’t open the map to respawn) and have to restart your game. Essentially making the queen you just killed useless. The last two times I fought the queen, this happened. So I will no longer be fighting the queen until it’s fixed. The amount of ammo and healing that gets sunk into it is not worth it really for the terrible loot but I am def not helping for nothing.
---
I also noticed a bit more budget appeated after I used the items in storage.  
---
I recently moved my CAMP. I constantly ran into budget exceeded when building the new one.   I deleted some items from storage then set the rest down.  My CAMP budget was full when I logged off.  When I got back on it mysteriously had more room.
---
Damn dude Andrew really traumatized you in these last posts are you ok? Tell you what for 12,99$ i can help you fight back because clearly you have no comebacks at this point.
---
🥱🥱🥱
---
LOL
---
&gt;  If you want to go bloodied, spend the time on a non-bloodied to get the gear first for sure. 
---
Gathering gear to prepare for a bloodied build is not necessary as extensive as one might think.
---
I was going to just go vanilla (or Junkie's if I went anything) on my melee guy. Then a bloodied guitar sword dropped. I decided on a whim to give it a try. Up to that point he was wearing almost entirely crafted leather with like one piece of vanguard's.
---
And he started kicking ass. (To be fair, I did get all the mutations I needed pretty quickly, but mutations are cheap enough these days.)
---
Every time I thought about putting away the bloodied weapon and going back to a full-health build, I didn't want to, despite being VASTLY underpowered compared to a fully equipped bloodied build. Finally dedicated him to the build and took the adrenal reaction serum. Haven't looked back.
---
I thought I was going to need to start with a full set of unyielding to have any fun, but that wasn't the case at all. This is probably the case if you want the character to PvP, but if you only care about PvE, you'd be surprised just how much you can do with a crappy bloodied weapon and crafted gear.
---
If you need to do any pre-setup, I would say it would have to be your mutations (and a basic bloodied weapon of some kind, of course). Everything else will come in time.
---
Someone please correct me if I am wrong, but the amount of quests one has available to do is pretty slim. Then add in the higher level you are the less quests there are to do. It's been a year and no word on when more DLC is supposed to come... like the Presidential Election/bunker. 
---
Other online games like this have more quests and variety... heck even WOW when it first came out had more stuff to do... and that game was mostly "Fetch me 5 pelts of XYZ beast...".
---
I still log in every so often to sell and collect stuff but I stop to think... what is there to do? I've already done about everything and explored about everywhere. 
---
I thought about maybe creating an alt but then what happens when that character reaches level 60+...
---
There isn't much to do and the other players are usually pretty friendly and helpful but often times everyone is running solo. There really isn't any incentive to partner up. 
---
Then add in the bugs, which seem to be getting worse... I have a LOT of video's of random bugs I find but don't share them because everyone has already seen them and it seems the dev's don't care about fixing them.
---
Instead it's all about the ATOM store merch and special 1-2 week events which seem to be oddly planned/executed.
---
Like the Halloween event in Whitesprings... in terms of the in game story... where did all of the decorations suddenly come up from? I could see the robots for the building maybe... but we are supposed to believe an Eye-bot set up a lot of brush fires for people to light?
---
I feel like I'm losing my fucking mind here sometimes
---
Bethesda is cancelled
---
Yeah this game is lost. The only hope is that wastelanders is an upgrade for it. If not and the game is still shit then they NEED to start issuing refunds of their business will go straight down the drain.
---
Agreed
---
Ok Boomerang
---
if he is anything like the cargo drone you cant kill it,
---
Depended on the console. I used to play on the PS 3 near the end of it's life cycle. I'd have mods online ALL the time. They would abduct me or block me inside my apartment. A few would be pretty good sports after abducting me and forcing me to a random location on the map by showering me with money. I got millions and millions this way. 
---
Later found out Rockstar wasn't too worried about the PS 3 community towards the end of the PS 3 cycle so they ignored the cheaters and hackers on that console and focused on the next gen systems.
---
That no spawn shit happened to me during encrypted a few days in a row. I often can loot the queen (I'm a fast bloodied but not cheesin' build) but when the event ends and the rewards bar pops up.. There ain't no flux rewarded. That is happening to others I am playing with too. We are there for the full fight, we aren't dying, the thing goes down super fast, we can loot the body but the event rewards nothing at all. Says complete. Have seen the delayed rewarded happen. This ain't that. Have also seen it the other way around. I get rewarded the flux but CANT loo the body. I am telling ya something is fucky with this.
---
Y'all are blinded by rage. 90% of the shit they did was scummy but they didn't double down on wrongfully banning a player. If you are over the age of 16 and think they banned the map maker wrongfully you're honestly a moron. I hate to put it so blatantly but I've seen so much stupid shit that I have to believe you're either under 16 or a moron if you deny objective reasoning
---
Part of me wants to think that not even Bethesda can be that thick skulled but you’re probably right. 
---
While I enjoy Skyrim as much as the next guy I hope that when they do that the sales will fail, I mean really there can’t be that much interest in ANOTHER Skyrim and there’s more competition such as Jedi Fallen Order and The Outer Worlds and such.
---
That is genuinely a great thing to think about. I will never test that theory tho
---
What company and what does that change? Back up your 'hot takes' this isn't fight club
---
Yeah I have this bug also. Really annoying.
---
Anyone that gave it to me free would get every legendary item I own
---
For me it's mostly if I go through my storage at my camp... something I don't use often and I select it in the box and my game will decided to pause for awhile and not respond until I guess it loads that items information...
---
I'm also looking for the elusive plasma grenade plan.
---
Sorry, I'm not reading.
---
Buy my Atom shop skins.
---
Sorry. Just traded mine for a 6 star super explosive more ball bashing damage anti tank peashooter....
---
But they said "we're listening" so they must be listening right???
---
Every time they've said "we hear you" it just gets shallower and shallower
---
Do they aim at you, or at the last place you killed someone? I notice that while I'm killing stuff on the move they always shot to where i made the kill, so i can just jump out of the way right after a kill, and vats back down for the next kill.
---
Thanks dude!
---
Last few times I've helped someone do the quest it's only been 1-3 mobs per wave. Same with the tea pot quest. Kinda makes it boring considering half the time you are just standing around waiting for something to happen.
---
When I first did those quests it seemed like dozens of mobs spawned each wave... not sure how/why they reduced the mobs spawns for dozens to just 1-3 per wave... kind of a sharp drop.
---
Well at least you maintained the 3 legendary description to topic referenced / category:) I’ll take it in the...uhm aim intended from that rifle
---
Firestone and Ford sure made some downright shitty decisions to stay in the green. Look up the TREAD Act. Company’s put profit before people all the time, doesn’t make it right. I don’t understand why people justify business for staying in the green to continue to sell a broken product or services. No one is losing lives here but if a company builds shitty products the consumer has all the right to voice their complaints.
---
I will post my ammunition I don't use as free... not ever gonna use it and prefer someone who needs it gets it. What kinda makes me sad though is those who buy them and then goes back to their camp and sells it in their camp. I am just happy to get rid of the weight but I prefer it go to people who desperately need it.
---
What?
---
Not explosive peashooter! That weapon does work well with ballistic damage, you need energy damage!
---
If typing was accurate, my message would be understood probably 1% better. The damage comment was supposed to say *Does not
---
Dual wield anything would be awesome. I’d love to dual wield my TSE harpoon and turn it into a Four-shot Explosive harpoon 💪
---
I like to think it isn’t Bethesda, I think it’s the parent company that wanted a fallout ESO but Bethesda wanted to do it in a way so fallout fans would actually get behind it..... only for it to crash and burn between the PR the game gets, the dwindling player base, and the parent company/investors wanting to see net profits. 
---
No matter the reason Bethesda is trying to generate revenue and it isn’t working. There throwing a lot of spaghetti at the wall but none of it is sticking.... time to fix the wall or get a new wall, not throw more spaghettis at it. 
---
I’ve heard insanity is doing the exact same thing over and over expecting different results and I feel like that’s what’s going on with fallout 76.... time to change it up before it’s too late. 
---
Also this fallout 1st thing.... if you look at it it’s a lot like ESOplus..... sad thing is it isn’t really fitted right for the fallout franchise nor was it the time to launch it amongst the bug ridden fields that are the Appalachia currently. It would of been so much smoother if they just fixed it before releasing that but no..... so more bad PR and more disappointed players. 
---
I truly hope the wastelanders update is the holy grail that fixes everything because I feel like if it goes south it might be the straw that breaks the camels back. 
---
Bethesda, whoever the parent company is..... just a simple google search will tell you just how unhappy most players are with the state of this product, it’s hurting your numbers.... want the game to be more productive? Then make the players happy, fix the game, pay some big streamers to play the game and give it another go, give it a right and proper no man’s sky treatment. ( look at the state of NMS between launch and now.... that’s the treatment. )
---
I once had to get on my mic/headset to get one low level player to take a gift bag. He was level 20 and was delighted about what I gave him and asked what I wanted for the items. I told him nothing and he said I was the nicest person he's ran into in the game. I kinda wondered about that considering I tried the usually emotes and "tea bagging" the bag I dropped for him and he didn't understand at all what I was trying to hint at.
---
Perhaps there should be an emote where you tag a certain item or bag for others to be made aware of it... Kinda like in APEX
---
Yeah I wanna duel wield 2 Fatman's
---
He's so smart that he implies if you believe map76 guy got wrongfully banned you must be underaged :( what a confident, smart feller!
---
What happened though? Whos map76? whyd he get banned?
---
I think that you must watch a lot of youtube lol
---
They are going to paywall wastelanders.... i guarantee it.
---
I play with my wife and my son, we all have 1st. We have had similar issues many times but not always. When they can't join my private world then we just try to join either my wifes or my sons world and we get it sorted out that way. Not a solution for you but this is an issue that probably many of us have!!
---
Relogging into your private world takes significantly less time than public server hopping, so you're able to re-roll the vendor's inventory much more rapidly than you can on public servers.
---
Each visit to any vendor in The Mire, Cranberry Bog, and Ash Heap has the exact same 3% chance to sell one of the 7 dense plans.
---
If you want aluminum ore fast travel to Harpers Ferry, turn around and cross the railway bridge. At the end of the bridge there is a path off to the right that will eventually take you up to the top of the cliff. There is copper and gold ore here. Head down onto the grass and follow the rock wall on the left until you reach a cave that is covered in something that looks like Hanging Moss from Skyrim. There are five aluminium ore spawns in that cave. Beware the stalking mothman. He has trapped me in there before.
---
Nope I do not think he was wrongfully banned.
---
first lets off cut out all the shit that doesn't matter. 
---
his influental status as the map maker is irrelevant. 
---
this is what we know. 
---
a group of people were exploiting the game. 
---
one of them reported it. 
---
they all got banned when beth checked out their PCs. 
---
their intentions do not matter, they were exploiting and hacking. AS a group. and considering that people are selling 3 star legendaries online for 30 to 50 bucks. I find it hard to believe they were doing it out of the kindness of their heart. 
---
They are not paid employees of bethesda. there was no pre arranged agreement that they should do this. the whole article boils down to a group of hackers getting caught because one of them fucked his friends over.
---
You can't reason with them, had the same argument three days in a row with the same user. "Context doesn't matter right??" "Uh the context is that he didn't report the exploit even though he said it was reported"
---
Who?
---
If  a Rocket launcher drops from a Mob I will use it a couple rounds till I run out of ammo and scrap it. The amount of damage one does against moleminer that drop them is laughable. my .308 and .50 do similar damage... which give the weight of the Launcher and the ammo (missiles) makes the gun impractical to operate and use. For a smaller amount of DPS you can get a Rifle that weighs less and mod it and stack perks to get similar damage on a average perk card build.
---
I am level 360 something. sometimes I swap out some perk points get myself a good old 2 shot fatboy and throw on the liberty prime PA just because that is the sum total of joy.
---
You can, I've certainly killed him.
---
And you say you'll never kill him, but just wait until he flies over as a 3 star....
---
Here's a mostly complete list of spawn chances for various world items: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dphwyz/datamined_list_of_world_items_with_limited_spawn
---
Sentiment the same here
---
I grabbed Destiny 2 for free, 200 hours and haven't paid a cent and it is smoooooth as butter.
---
Its hard to say on fat mans becouse it appeals a nich demographic. I love them and have a bloodied reduced weight on me wich i adore and never unequip it. The holy grail i believe would be bloddied, limb damage and reduced weight.
---
lol yeah youtubers amiright? it was bethesda's fault to 
---
* not enlist him as a game tester in the first place
---
* not double check if he was right or wrong according to his narrative as he is not an average joe, he ran the most useful community website ffs
---
* not roll out a fucking ptr server for reasons exactly like this
---
* if he really had intentions to profit off of game's bugs you make sure a com manager publishes evidence for their actions
---
but yeah now theres water under bridge you lads can defend bethesda for this one too. their community engagement is fucking abysmal.
---
In my experience the devs have been pretty lenient on the whole thing for both factions. I know I myself have really pushed some boundaries and I am a little surprised they haven't banned me for some of the knock down drag out verbal scuffles I have gotten into.
---
On novice any raid can be completed solo as there’s no time limit. Even standard can be done solo with a little practice.
---
Should we tell him that he lost out when he bought the game?
---
Bethesda's intention and motivation. Sigh
---
Bethesda is lost. They're just another EA and Activision now. No longer a respectable, trustworthy company. There's so few left.
---
Weapon/armor plans have a 10% chance to spawn. Mod plans have 25%. Clothing has 20%.
---
If you're searching explosives crates for the plasma grenade plan, you're wasting your time. It's a myth that they can spawn in those (pulse grenade plan can)
---
How old are you?
---
And I bet you killed the real Paarthurnax too, *DEGENERATE*
---
Lol, no. It is now my sworn duty to leave the session that houses a Paarthurnax killer
---
I wanted to ask if they were corrupt without blatantly saying it cause they’d likely just ban me like they did my friend. Tried to argue his case and got muted. Just crazy man, this sub is good for BGS replies and some real good posts about the community then they ban people for literally defending the game and cite some rule that they didn’t even break😂 and yeah man you’ve been lucky not getting banned😂
---
Not freebie. We paid for it.
---
They are in a discord with community managers though but all those are only liaisons with Bethesda, they don't make decisions about bans or have a say in in such things. Personally I think he was rightfully banned automatically, shows the system they have in place works. It's not the first time someone in this group had exploited for personal gain, even though I just think he was lazy
---
I think I understand the concept of this. Currently, items on display at camp are at risk of being automatically scrapped when crafting because they're still stored in our stash. A separate junk box for storage and using for display items, that's not linked to the crafting mechanics, keeps them safe for display without them disappearing and can still be used to expand storage, even if we have to manually retrieve items to use them for crafting.
---
Hahahahaha
---
I just put sent/cav cause it depends on a couple of factors. Are you into pvp, assassins sent/cav, you into just pve, maybe unyielding maybe weightless, it all depends
---
We should have a shared cap account between characters = 150k caps. Which is the  5x30k we get spread across our 5 anyway. Beth knows we mule caps over, so why not just make it a shared account over the 5 to save us all the hassle and drama doing it.
---
How does the reward system work? I mean is it worth to complete novice, except for fun?
---
Gonna keep it, like it or not!
---
Remember the difference between Bethesda Game Studios(game developer of elder scrolls and Fallout) and Bethesda Softworks (publisher of BGS game, and games from every other Bethesda Softworks owned studio like Rage, Wolfenstein and Doom).
---
I want the Atoms for the x-mas stuff.
---
Thanks, anyway
---
Hey you, you're finally awake
---
Are you playing on a calculator?
---
Filthycasuals is good though. Sometimes you come home from a long day and just want to play your favorite game and enjoy the community, not worry about more issues. This game has been getting bad press and unrelenting criticism from everywhere. There is no lack of that.
---
lol he was hacking and got caught.  this community outrage is just as fake and contrived as the rest. 
---
1. he DIDNT work for beth as a game tester. he was hacking, and got caught. 
---
2. he ran the website for free for users but still makes add revenue from it.  are you that naive? you honestly think he was hacking to help bethesda? someone who didn't hire him? out of the goodness of his wee special heart? he literally broke every rule in the ToS his status for making an interactive map does not just let him get a free pass. 
---
3. yup. he had intentions to profit off a games bugs then got caught anti bethers trying to spin it into their favor.
---
lol go read the damn link eregon catch up scrub. :P
---
You can add me PSN jourik82
---
"oh officer I am not robbing this here bank no sir I am uhhhh testing the security see yeah thats it I am testing it to help em out see."
---
There was no link
---
The game continues when you're frozen, so you end up dead.
---
Idk. I just had a great time at the blast area.  Still figuring out all this higher level stuff and it’s harder that expected with less reward but still fun.  I need more screws
---
When Betheda finally gets a clue about feedback and adds our suggestions to the game for the benefit of everybody, not just people who can pay the Atom price tag.. Then I'll have my optimism back that 76 can get out of the pit.
---
Until then, this game is going nowhere. Fan feedback only feeds Bethesda's bad habits of trying to sell us back our own ideas, and every other major feature request, or overhaul is basically without an estimate.  And to top of it all off, I know for a fact that Wastelanders is going to be a messy, ugly lanch.  You'd have to be extremely gullible and naive to not expect it, even after the delays.
---
Smart fridge

---
sorry mate I meant to send this already :P 
---
they report the facts while trash talking beth  but if you pull out the facts that matter they also shoot themselves in the dick. that's the problem with biased media. to easy to write your own counters if you have any truth in it.
---
I'm not saying it's a bad sub, but the tone on so many of the posts borders on bootlicking fanboyism. I can understand being excited. If you just got out of the vault today, great! You deserve a place to share your adventures.
---
But... even we diehard fans are falling off because we can't justify being blatantly lied to.
---
fanboys or simple, people who doesn't care playing a game that you need to spend thousand extra money they will smash you in downvotes. That is what Bethesda is listening.
---
Entire game should be boycotted
---
For me personally F76 is a 7/10. It’s a good game, but not a great game.
---
"It's all over but the grind and nobody's grinding but me."
---
There should be another challenge for just, uhh, not doing certain things in game for x amount of time. Would be called "Master of Your Domain"...
---
🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑
---
Okay I assume he's B
---
If ur just doing it for the acivment don’t waste your time
---
There are some with the mods on on pc, but they arent legitimately obtainable
---
Nah, the increase in revenue from 🐑 is enough to outweigh the cost of loyalty.
---
🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑
---
Idealy we would have both. The PA would fit the bulky-bear-theme better but i can totaly understand that not everyone is into PAs
---
This would be awesome! Full support on this
---
Ive used it since it came out and never had that issue
---
Yeah. Giving all your inventory to the lowest level player on the map actually gives you 32 levels...
---
Honestly what's the point if you're not enjoying it or if it's that much of a chore for you?
---
Unlimited caps. Only available for fallout first Subscribers.
---
Well they usually generate more bugs thqn they solve with each patch . The game will eventually reach maturity in few years. But can an online game generate enough revenue o er time to maintain itself ? Doubt .
---
Still I love their games .
---
Only if you fork over some money to get Fallout First.
---
Because from 68 to 100 even with double exp your looking at a week of play time right there just by farming for it specifically and you’ll burn out on it fast.
---
I played at launch and stopped after reaching level 200 (before the xp nerfs.) I used to do a glitch in the silos allowing me to complete it in about 8 minutes. It involved locking onto a turret with melee and glitching onto the roof, allowing you to skip to the last part when you kill the waves of robots. I’d like to think that they’ve patched that by now, but who knows?
---
This is legit sad.
---
They would just stop development probably if that happened
---
That's not true. Any suggestions the players make they can sell back to them, they'll totally listen to that. The rest just goes straight into the garbage. They can come lie about it all the way want, their actions speak volumes. Anyone who disagrees with this is delusional.
---
But not everyone is experiencing the same bugs. It varies between users and which  platform they play on. I have very few of the reported bugs.
---
PS4 here and for months I've been having frequent freezes that can last up to 20 seconds. They happen randomly, even on the main screens, outside of the game. I've reinstalled the game twice and changed internet provider not long ago. My PS4 has a direct ethernet cable connection to my modem. I've even wiped the PS4 hard disk once and checked it for bad sectors on my PC.
---
 I'm not convinced that outright replacement is the answer when every other game that I play is smooth as butter online and I've measured my data stream and it has no lost packets. I'm convinced this is a problem unique to FA76 and their servers and possibly my location which is  middle East.
---
They haven't ported it to smart fridges yet....XD
---
Well then you will be playing the same Bethesda games from now on, they will always be buggy, they will still be trying to fix it and you will continue supporting them by buying atoms every patch. You have nothing to worry about.
---
NCR armour is pre-war riot gear
---
T-60 is basically an upgrade to the T 45 that was starting to be issued
---
X-01 is the prototype version of the balance is Power armour
---
You can’t fool me Todd Howard!
---
I know that’s you Todd Howard, you can’t fool me!
---
Why r u so judgemental, are you a YongYea mindless drone
---
Your post history indicates that you actually dont like this game very much or Bethesda, so I'm not sure what you're trying to accomplish with this.
---
Oh I think they listen, they just choose what to listen to. Then they decide how they can implement it behind a price tag...
---
Should have gone to Specsavers
---
Fallout 76s new map and lore was worth a look, but the rest is not fun.
---
I'd imagine so lol
---
They nerfed Fatman vs SBQ many patches ago. But even before that they nerfed explosive in general.
---
quit with that sycophantic bs
---
Holy shit, did you get hacked?
---
Hold on, help is coming!
---
They never bothered to make it backwards compatible for xboxone either which is odd because the made a port for it right out the gate....you'd think they'd have released it by now but nope.
---
I say it's strange because FO3 and NV are BC.
---
Wendigo Power Armor theme???? Anyone ? lol Or am I alone?....lol
---
Love this idea....
---
Why care to make something compatible when you can make people extra dip and buy again?
---
If dev stopped how would the company make money?
---
Yes, only because disconnects and bugs will prevent you from actually finishing. Aside from that it’s pretty easy
---
Hey Ladydevann here - have you submitted a ticket? We are looking into it.
---
You are too judgemental, bethesda needs the money so they can improve their games
---
How many times do we have to teach you old man??
---
LOL man I have been the master of my domain for "looks at watch" 4 whole hours.
---
I’ve always assumed he’s a scripted friendly SB.
---
I followed the quests at the start of the game and it was the first SB I came across. Kind of assumed it was a gentle introduction to new players?
---
havent been online after accepted your request 
---
 join whenever bro
---
The method of storytelling isn't the best, that much anyone would grant. However, the good storylines and environmental storytelling is still good, in spite of this.
---
If the no humans thing is a deal breaker, you may as well just quit now and wait until Wastelanders launches.
---
As a side thing, I really don't get the whole must have humans thing. I'd be perfectly fine if there wasn't ever a single human so long as there was a meaningful dialogue system and interesting characters. 
---
Biv is fun. Rose is great in how annoying she is. MODUS is eerie. Grahm is precious. The game's not lacking of good characters. Just a dialogue system.
---
whatever you say fanboy
---
I completely agree! Idk why people keep hating on this game. I've spent maybe 2 or 3 thousand dollars on this game believe me it was worth every penny and I will continue to support Bethesda in every way possible. People say I suck Bethesdas dick but in really I just know a good game company who cares about their customers when I see one.
---
I say it's a good game and then I say **Except for** ...
---
yep if I do the brother hood thing it starts following me around sometimes. 
---
if I do the morgantown airport thing the cargo drop starts following me around. 
---
if I do the scorchbeast sample it looks like I poop a scorchbeast sample every where I go. 
---
only way to fix is to relog I beleive.
---
Just let people enjoy things...
---
I feel the "purchase atoms after every patch" part was really a bit too obvious
---
Fans gotta stick together against this hate. I bought Fallout 1st for 6 of my accounts, it's worth it. Don't know what's with the mindless YongYea drones hating on Bethesda
---
The whining was really, TSE shoot guns would melt all the ghoul at the gulf club house in literally one second. But Bethesda had no clue so the nerfed all TSE. Only half year later they figured out the real problem and nerfed explosive shoot guns.
---
Take workshops. You get exp for taking it then you get more exp for defending it. Plus the exp from killing the enemies from the defense missions. I usually go to the Poseidon energy power plant the Charleston landfill and the Charleston airport between those three I normally always have a defense event or a public event to level up at
---
I can feel you on this one
---
I agree I am just pissed I missed the red rocket bundle I was planning on getting that this time around but I lost a riding glove and had to buy another set. so my play money was short.
---
Jesus ;/ Why the hell would they give such an achievement when there are no more quests to do and only grindy events are left.
---
I've got Outer Worlds and the inbound CyberPunk 2077 to look forward to. Barely got any of the social side of fallout 76, because most of my friends saw what was happening long before I did, and rightfully bailed. Because of that, I'm not really losing anything... See you, wasteland cowboys...
---
I've mostly seen it justified as "supporting the game until Wastelanders and other free content comes out," which is just laughable.
---
0 shits given to be honest it's not like its hard to get around a ban. its like being threatened with a pillow.
---
I decided to buy fallout 1st instead of vaccines for my children and I don't regret it even one but! worst comes to worst they die of malaria but at least that means I have more  money to spend on fallout 1st!
---
Can you provide screenshots of your inventory after it got wiped
---
You're not funny you know that. Another YongYea drone
---
I've seen some really cool camps that have creative ways of closing their vendors.
---
One had two doorways next to each other with the garage door clipped in; essentially, their vendors can be shuttered when closed.
---
not atm since i’m going to sleep but i’ll update in the morning
---
Can add me too TheeLevs
---
At this point I imagine Wastelanders will be a 4 hour quest, and all the cool weapons, armors and features will be behind a paywall.
---
No its not.
---
This isn't some volunteer program run by students. It's a full priced AAA title by a multi-million dollar company. There is an expectation for them to deliver and they can't even meet their own mark, let alone ours.
---
I agree that there are some very judgemental people. However, this isn't a charity. As a customer, at a bare minimum you expect for the product you purchase to work as expected and when there is a problem, that it gets responded to and fix in a timely manner. Bethesda has consistently failed on ALL accounts.
---
There isn't a single count in which Bethesda has succeeded on the expectations people would have of any business. 
---
Reliable product - failed.
---
Customer support - failed.
---
Fulfilling on promises to customers (roadmap; cosmetics only MTX; staying on the right side of the line) - failed.
---
Communication - failed.
---
The list goes on. None of this is exaggeration and all of this is backed up with evidence.
---
The truly sad thing is that you think your declaration for purchasing atoms every month is laudable. 
---
I'm not asking you to hate the game or stop playing the game or stop spending your money on buying atoms. You do you. 
---
Just see the facts and evidence for what they are and you'll have answered your own question.
---
Congratulations for not helping anyone.
---
I've had a similar experience. It really does suck. Don't let a few bad apples spoil the bunch, though. The community is what makes this game great, and giving low levels some items is one of the best things we do. Just move on and try again. Know that dude who nabbed those has taken a huge hit to their karma
---
Unfortunately even just by playing you are helping them, because you are giving the whales a reason to be there. If every non-paying player abandoned the game, they'd panic and maybe start listening.
---
😂😂😂 👍🏼
---
Wastelanders flies in the face of everything you just said.
---
Where did you get your facts from? YongYea the clickbaiter?
---
I don't want to eat wall spaghetti. I asked for water, bread and some cheese.
---
Didn't they already?
---
TBH best thing for them to do is allow local hosted servers, release a construction kit, take down their servers, and make it open to modders and private servers. Let the community make it into the game we want. Within a week, all the major bugs they haven't touched for a year will be fixed.
---
By making better games people want to play, not just exploiting the fan base they acquired from previous successes and using those previous successes as a foundation to make a shit game people have to pay out for. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed FO76 for what is was, but soon as your friends stop playing it really loses it's appeal. P.S Outer Worlds really showcased all that Bethesda is doing wrong with their last few titles (FO4 was okay but they got really lazy with the story telling side). And TOW had great commercial success and is a really well rounded game. Great story, good gameplay and a whole lotta fun.
---
What was the last Bethesda game you played that was like that?
---
I like the idea. Getting hit takes you out of stealth into danger state. It would certainly balance things up a bit. You'd need to stand up and crouch again with the special perk to have a chance to reenter caution state again. 
---
I have a 150+ PA heavy gunner char, a 150+ bloodied stealth commando toon and a &lt;100 gunslinger toon, so I'm seeing it from most perspectives.
---
Ah bloody hell, I was just trying to get people to do some raids with me
---
It's not in the game. Datamining showed it was meant to be connected to new event/quest or something
---
Actually it has some code dating back from Morrowind, some even say from Daggerfall and their Terminator games.
---
Farm events.
---
I've got the same thing. I recently farmed an insane amount of it, and I always keep track of when I have one. At first I had 1 extra a couple times. Knew I didnt pick it up, but whatever. Then today I've ended up with 6 all at once. Incredibly strange. 6 free caps I guess
---
&gt; Where did you get your facts from? YongYea the clickbaiter? 
---
Bitch, please. That low-effort, Reddit top post, low effort hack was wiped off the face of my Youtube feed for almost a year now.
---
I was here from the beginning and lived through all the failures.
---
Then you should know Bethesda can get better, stop being a YongYea drone hating on Bethesda
---
Workshops require caps and you need to stash your scrapped junk before taking workshops because you will get pvp'd.
---
Or avoid workshops. Farm mole miners in welch in ash heap. Farm cranberry bog, watoga, or the fissures for legendary scorched beasts.
---
I have been playing since beta. I like the game and enjoy it still. the only time this game pisses me off is when I hurry or if I focus in on one single thing. that being said the quickest way to level as a high level is by fissure hopping. sleep/ music/ food hit all the fissures rinse repeat. if you are melee I would have to guess whitespread for the shear number of ghouls
---
fissures reset by the time you go through all of them so you can grind them infinitely. 
---
if you already never want to come back why are you doing the acvievement. just go already.
---
Is there a place to see everything datamined?
---
I mean why even bother to buy the atoms tho, it seems like every other thing I do, I’m being given atoms. I own like a quarter of the shit in the shop and never bought any.
---
Do people legit make the choice to basically donate money to them that way
---
[Nope.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bethesda_Softworks_video_games) That was Bethesda Game Studios.
---
&gt;if you already never want to come back why are you doing the acvievement.
---
There are much better games to play than this, but if that's the last thing to do in this game I'd rather have 100%, especially with 2xp week.
---
Nope. All Bethesda Game Studios.
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Bethesda\_Softworks\_video\_games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bethesda_Softworks_video_games)
---
While Softworks WAS a developer back in the day and has a plethora of games under its belt as a dev, they haven't developed any games since 2001.
---
So, as I said, like comparing apples with oranges.
---
This could well be the issue, i frequently alt-tab, so somehow it's messing with the resolution and whatnot?
---
They'd be saving much more money not running the servers and having staff be allotted to fallout 76 and probably turn to their next game in development instead
---
You could possibly search Reddit for other posts on it. That's where I saw about the datamined event previously.
---
Wait, I just found this.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_Beer_keg
---
Ok well ill quit while im ahead thanks
---
After watching exilecon all night and seeing how those devs are handling things coming back to this subreddit is fucking depressing.
---
good luck gonna be a shitty grind. that's not how you find happiness in 76. you find happiness in 76 by letting the enviroment and circumstance take over, Ie I need to repair my weapon. ooh I am low on aluminum. I go to a wrecked truck and start gathering ski poles. I notice a player base on the road side that has vendor.  holy crap his stuff is expensive. I make an offer below what its already on the vendor for but he refuses. I use his benches to scrap and check out his shop. stash my loot. then I fast travel to a couple other aluminum spots. 
---
   you point yourself in a general direction but if you laser point yourself and put on the blinders you will miss half the game.
---
&gt;I feel like some people need to hear this: Zenimax owns Bethesda, and doesn't want to listen.
---
Ftfy
---
same way you subscribe by going to bethesda, then finding account info and them pushing the unsubscribe option
---
Just today I saw a player at the vault either starting a new character or brand new to the game so anyways I was fucking around and said to some fandoms that were at a persons camp that we should go greet them and the noobie got like a full setup right out of the vault from me a lvl 16 and like 3 50+ players it was great
---
Your dollar is your vote people. Hear, hear OP!
---
I used to have two explosive revolvers with other different legendary effects on each one. I named them Bonnie and Clyde.
---
Would have been awesome to duel wield those.
---
This seems melodramatic.  
---
I imagine they have a very long list of complaints and feedback. They are constantly telling people to report things on this subreddit or elsewhere. I have no doubt that they are listening. 
---
Now, have they acted on player feedback in a way that you wanted? That's a different question. Although maybe it amounts to the same thing in the end, if players don't feel listened to.
---
Saving to see if you can post proof, been running it since launch with no issue. Not calling you a liar, just need proof of it happening before I warn people about it
---
They started with a good idea and that's what got them onto the top of the hill. 
---
Fallout
---
They pushed the cart down the hill before making sure the way was clear.  
---
multiplayer -&gt; online-&gt; always online-&gt;paid service-&gt;paid convenience-&gt;paid stop to intentionally created grind-&gt;yearly subscription-&gt;paywall.
---
They started with a bad decision , full price, unfinished, $ shop and just kept adding glitches.  Lag did not help.  
---
 
---
It's like the are writhing their hands before putting their palms out asking for money.
---
You bought an orange from their cart and it was good but somewhere along the way they wanted money before you received the orange, then be
---
in a topic only related because you mentioned toilet paper. I made a bath haus with anti radiation arch a bench some lockers and a toilet. next to it there is a plunger and 3 rolls of toilet oaoer.
---
Because I truly past all the bugs and glitches enjoy hopping on this game with freinds we always have a blast camp building , running events or just pissing around. 
---
That's why, im not going to say it's perfect and I haven't been fustrated at times but after hundreds of hours play time I can honestly say I have enjoyed the game and thus il support it further as long as I keep enjoying it.
---
Oh ok seems easy enough
---
All these freezes that OP is referring to have been a thing since *literally* beta, at least on consoles. Every friend I talk to about this usually just has an attitude of acceptance. I thought this was just a thing we have to live with?
---
Now you're acting surprised? Why hasn't this been addressed in over a year? That's disappointing, but not surprising.
---
It is very difficult to complete anything but novice on your own. Also the reward of novice are not worth it, you get 2 vault steel.
---
You only get plans to craft the armor from standerd and expert raids
---
Great idea, would be a great way to get more people into the vaults as well. One of my favriot things to do in game. More people in them might encourage devs to open the other raids sooner.
---
Take an up vote!
---
Doesnt matter, as long as you play and use those in-game atoms its justified to them.
---
Xbox, but thanks 🙂
---
No thank you, it's way too late in the game's life for that. So many of us would have to do so many trades and so much rebuilding to get back to the top.
---
There's absolutely nothing to do, nothing to chase that isn't just rng. I liked it for a while but it's easily the most boring experience I have access to now.
---
Survival being up could have kept me playing if they didn't take it behind thier house and execute it with that damage cap update.
---
Yikes, the private world they gave is a box in a box in a box of what anyone wanted. Its like asking for a cake and being willing to pay for it but getting raisin cookie for the same price.
---
I've only named a weapon once and it was an explosive quad shotgun named boomstick
---
Same feeling. One of the best-written ones.
---
I'm just saying it's not any sweat on their brow this far out and they had it complete day one....they did it with other titles
---
&gt; Remember the good old days when developers made a completed game for a nice one-time fixed price?
---
There are a lot that still do. Bethesda isn't one of them, though. And that means that they lost a loyal customer that's bought almost all of their games, some even multiple times.
---
Yeah think I've got around 600 or so. Think I've got 3 that I've actually picked up
---
I can see them doing the same shit when PS5 and Scarlett come out. Prevent Skyrim from being backwards compatible just so they can sell a new version of it.
---
People do make the choice - whenever an atom bundle comes out with an included outfit, i see a huge amount of people wearing those things in game. Same with Fallout 1st, the amount of camps I see these days with scrap boxes is crazy
---
What a bunch of moaning sad people. If you don't like it, just don't fecking play it!!! How do you expect they finance new content or upcoming dlc's if they didn't have the atomic shop?
---
 I've played this since beta and yes, it's been extremely flawed. Bethesda tried something new and I'm pleased they did. 
---
I love the single player aspect of 3, NV &amp; 4 and that's why I'm a 1st subscriber. I was hoping Wastelanders was getting released so I purchased it for that very reason.
---
In closing, don't like don't play.
---
Different understanding. They understand short term high profits, not long term. In any case after 2-3 years they will just say that the platform is not anymore enough profitable (in their prospective) and they will shutdown. But they will do it exactly in the point.  Completely different view for example with Dota 2 which is so many years and it is still interesting, getting new players that keep playing and I believe is profitable (in different way maybe).
---
What you say is so true, "whoever makes the decisions doesn't care". This is just facts, I don't think its right to hate low level bethesda employees that probably feel the same as Us. But whoever's in charge could not give a shit
---
These scorchbeasts are making me thirsty!
---
I got a three day ban one time for making a thread that people should realize that there's better things to worry or be pissed about than a god damn video game. IIRC, I even suggested The Peace Corp and several non-religious hands on type charities.
---
I'm done with it for now. I put a lot of time into it and all I have left to do is dailies, which is more of a chore than actual fun. It took me 2 weeks of staring at it in my library until I made the decision to uninstall the other day. 
---
I'll probably come back to check out Wastelanders, but it'll have to have some serious meat on its bones for me to stick around for long.
---
That's what I'm aware of but my significant other who has played for a long while with a kickass build has had the same issue. If doesn't make any sense.
---
And all the fantastic mods.
---
Uh.... I dont think that would work. 
---
Wendigos are thin AF and PAs are bulky as heck.
---
Then again..... get me a wendigo-corpse and a tank of Helium. it might be a bit of a stretch but we could make it work that way
---
\*gets hauled away and bashed into a bloody Pulp by reddit's bad-pun-Brigade\*
---
I drop it when that happens. Phantom tech data sometimes makes it so I can't turn in what I actually find.
---
everyone uses 5.56 as currency when they hit the cap limit
---
I thought you were done with this game? Why are you still here?
---
Echoed my sentiments entirely. I can get past the bugs and continue to not buy shit on the Atom Shop. My problem is that I find the game dreadfully boring. Maybe it’s fun with friends but I don’t play it with others. Any time I have, we were stuck doing the pointless side quests you mentioned. 
---
I’ve already deleted this game and moved on. I’m currently playing Outer Worlds and not even that game is 100% selling me. Maybe I’m getting old.
---
Bethesda isn't getting a fucking penny from me without an amazing turn from their usual sloppy bullshit. I'm almost boycotting them entirely over this game. They have failed over and over again, despite all the resources to fix it.  ES6 will have to be the most epic, perfect game they've ever released for me to even buy it used or on sale. I have lost *all* faith in them. *ALL* faith. And I'm a diehard FO fan. Outer Worlds, while short, shows Obsidian understands us and highlights quite dramatically how tone-deaf and out-of-touch Bethesda is.
---
Maybe they'd start listening if you were a Fallout First member and threathened to cancel your subscription or do a charge back. See them flocking to your topic like headless chickens.
---
Pretty much...
---
As stupid as it may sound maybe EA has a chance to get a better reputation than Bethesda. Been playing Jedi: Fallen Order and it is really good.
---
It's nice when you get the stealthboy spamming tesla griefers. The new scrip modding is not so much fun though. I got melted by a level 13 with an explosive gatling plasma lol. If Bethesda can't keep people from modding game script things will get real fun soon let alone their shitty bugs.
---
Monarch was disappointing in terms of how it was made out to be severely hard but it was a breeze to sweep through from Cascadia. That being said, I still really enjoyed exploring Monarch and didn't mind the pacing and taking my time doing everything. 
---
Curious though, did you prefer FO76 to TOW?
---
Pics or it didn't happen.
---
But the menu is wall spaghetti, eat it or starve;)
---
Neither. Both are disappointing. I do feel F4 is a more fun game than TOW, even though the writing is not as good. At the least the actual game is enjoyable.
---
Well too bad! The metaphor demands you eat wall spaghetti! 
---
Either that or you can help yourself to the meat wall, where teaching it Spanish...
---
The initial bug was incredibly difficult to replicate and only happened under a very specific set of circumstances. It involved the team leader crashing inside the vault instance, which doesn't seem the case with you. Forgive me if I don't believe you.
---
Why don’t you use it?
---
Came across one on PS4 last night for 20k. Ouch!
---
thats true Divine is pretty darn salty anti beth, I am the fan boy who gets offended. but not so much today cause I have been having lag issues on public servers a lot too lately. save some of your hate for dupers and ass hats using 2 shot explosive laser gatling with splitter beams on em. a couple of those can literally shut down a queen fight. I can relate to the frustration a bit today I finished my shop up remodeling and I am stuck with half a marquee sign :/
---
Granted beth left a lot of design flaws for dupers to take advantage of but they're still dicks for doing it.
---
Love this idea! More vault steel!
---
I’m level 91 and use a heavy weapon power armour build
---
Keep the unique items from this quest, especially outfit that works as stealth armour, it’s really good, here’s the build I made based on this quest line and fixer from other quest: https://youtu.be/m1OTKSxeeCw
---
Wish I could give you more up votes 💪👍👍
---
It depends on what you are going for. Someone on here could give you a better explanation than I could. I have a full scout set. I like being able to go invisible so one piece has chameleon. Beyond that I am far from optimized but I know some people can make themselves near invincible with the right combination. Plus the 3rd slots can give nice weight reduction perks or other abilities.
---
He's a scripted neutral enemy to show new players the threat without forcing them into a fight right at the begining of the game. I've tried killing it, it doesn't attack.
---
Speaking of gatling gun, that's one of the ones I run. I'm heavy build. I've had this issue for a while, and it's nothing to do with damage. Either that or I blue screen and it messes it up. There's so many people who get hits on it at one time in one spot and it's increasingly difficult is what I'm saying. Everyone who contributes deserves some kind of drop.
---
Okay
---
Yep, been happening since beta actually.
---
If by new CC content you mean the VR instanced settlement and faction battle content, all you're telling Bethesda is that you're willing to spend money beta-testing mechanics that'll very likely be for Wastelanders.
---
Happened to me, submitted a ticket. It seems that every time I log off and on my emotes disappear and I would have to manually equip them in the Atomic Shop.
---
I simply quit playing. The game wasn't fun anymore when it turned into standard MMORPG grinding, minus the "Massive" &amp; "Multiplayer" and "Game" parts. 
---
The only thing I had any fun with was killing super mutants I was ten times the level of with overpowered melee weapons, and that got old fast.
---
Ah, the modded version of the castle I see.
---
Still, that's a pretty awesome build :)
---
Except for raid 2 (Meltdown). It is virtually impossible to defend the G.E.C.K. **and** the pipes solo.
---
Duping sucks, man
---
I don't see that working most of the time.
---
When did you buy it first?
---
It’s not just the Tesla’s it’s the explosive lasers as well.   I have pretty decent weapons and gear and you shouldn’t be able to blast me from a distance with 100% accuracy and take no damage. F that
---
Months are the same around the world. One of three things is happening.
---
1. They fucked up (most likely reason).
---
2. You cancelled the subscription instead of turning off auto-payments. It’s confusing but there is actually a difference. Turning off auto payments let’s you keep access to what you’ve paid for already until the period ends. Cancelling immediately ends the subscription.
---
3. You’re clicking play before the silly news pop-up comes up, which often shows that the private server is locked. Try waiting until the news thing has popped up after loading the game, then try.
---
Which says more about the (lack of) endgame in FO76 than anything else. I for one would welcome a way to work towards acquiring a specific legendary item because the pure RNG we currently have is something that I find frustrating to the point where it saps my desire to play. I'd be OK with the process taking several months as long as I can do measurable progress towards that goal when I play.
---
Bethesda = Konami
---
&gt;The game is just downright boring.
---
I seriously don't get this. I started playing this game with my boyfriend the other week and we're both having a blast. 
---
I know that Bethesda isn't the company they used to be. I know that they have made some terrible decisions lately. But I seriously don't see how so many people on here find this game so boring.
---
&gt;Quests where I have to go collect beer bottles or kill some flies or collect different meats or collect temperature data just aren’t fun.
---
There are so many other quests? I'm getting quests all the time and some of the events are great. At least the first time you play them.
---
I understand that we all have different opinions, and that's fine. However, I really don't share your experience. Maybe it depends on who you're playing it with. I don't know.
---
I agree that this game could've been so much more, sure. And it might not ever get better, not even with NPCs added. But as of now, I'm still having so much fun. Even with it's and imperfections.
---
I still truly hope that Bethesda will learn something lesson from this and try to improve. 
---
It would be nice to see an interview with Todd Howard or any other higher ups in the company, where they don't stroke their dicks and actually question some of the decisions they've made and the received criticism. Because as of now, they're not being held accountable for anything.
---
Eh, in the days of one’s camp constantly being leveling and PvP being one of the only endgame pastimes, it felt justified.
---
Red is
---
I bought it on Friday 25 October
---
Yeah throw your money at Bethesda. That'll show them.
---
I think the difference may be our age. I am 47 years old. I started gaming on gen 1 ataris and nintendo etc. got into PC gaming around 1993 94  ish and never looked back. that shit was a very expensive hobby back then though.
---
The first big mmorpg I got into was ultima online. back in dialup days. that 2d game had more content than a lot of the flashier new games. and the people playing it were a different kind of player. first there was a subscription of 15 per month. then the dial up of 20 per month plus the cost of your computer. which was a really big portion of my pay check to save up for and get and maintain. people act differently in a game when a sizable chunk of their income is involved in their hobby. people were just better to each other. 
---
over time I have learned some things.
---
1. over time all games with free trade will end up pay to win. the players,duper,cheaters will make it so one way or another they will black market trade items if they can. 
---
2. no matter what devs do the people in forums will always divide up into factions and portions will not like their course of action unless it directly helps what they care about. example I am not unbiased I am a firm believer in the squashing bugs mentality it pisses me off when they announce new content or pvp balances etc when I just want the base game to fucking work better. the game is fine in its current configuration as far as I am concerned. If I had my way they would do nothing but bug squash for the next year. However I know if they did what I wanted they would lose portions of their player base from other factions. Like people got mad that they delayed the wastelander DLC called it another broken promise etc at the same time players like me in the bug squish camp applauded it. dear god take your time get the roots of the game solid you know. but /shrug meh.

3. currently you and I probably line up on different sides of the first argument. I am glad they went to sub base. a sub lets them set long term plans in place. it lets them appease and repay investors and it gives them stability in a very finicky hit and miss market. the people that complain loudest about the sub are also the people who probably never spend money on atoms. to be honest beth doesnt need those customers. when the free to players complain they just put more noise into the air for the developers to shift through when considering customer feedback. 
---
ugh This is turning into a wall of text and my brain is turning into mush cause I am at work and its getting towards the end of my shift. in a nutshell. the sub price is cheaper than ultima online was back in 1996 ish. over all I like the game and I will be supporting their "evil" business practices.  Did they make mistakes. of course. but our playerbase now days are just flat out nuts with the anger issues and the conflation of every tiny mistake. friggin drama queens , and to be honest I do not beleive the anger is real. I think its scripted and manufactured. astroturfing is the word. only recently learned it. very proud of it I learned a thing :) .
---
Sure will!
---
Yes, this happens to me whenever I quick-switch from my camera to a previous weapon. It won’t go back to my camera, instead it will pull out one of the other weapons from my favorites wheel.
---
You can only hope they pull a Bioware with Anthem and announce overhauling the game. Even then, people were burned for their loyalty so bad that most are skeptical.
---
&gt;I got melted by a level 13...
---
Did you have pacifist turned on?
---
nah it’s just a shit game carry on
---
Yup, I got this glitch not too long ago and it lasted a couple of days, and yesterday it happened again but I was playing this morning and it was all good again. Just Fallout 76 things...
---
It's not necessary. I could kinda sorta see using Long Shot in a sniper build, but even there it would only be situational at best because it's not all that often that you're in a place where you snipe at things that are out of normal rifle range.
---
It didn't fix itself for me but I fixed it by going into the atom shop and re-selecting all the emotes I want to use. Never happened before, really weird.
---
Right well thats straight in my vendor then
---
SPOILERS:
---
That quest line was the reason I changed my character to a woman. I know you can technically be there Mistress as a man, but if there is one faction in the game that I would want to be in a part of it's the Order of Mystery. I changed my gender, hair, and completion to look like one of the girls so I could RP the last (or one of the last) surviving members (not done dude who walked in and just took over).
---
I enjoyed the story of Freddie Lang, if you've gotten that far.
---
Dude why
---
It took you a year to realize?
---
Wait, what?
---
I WANT TO ESCAPE THE VAULT AS A BABY¡!!
---
Tell me HOW!
---
*** proceeds to reinstall the game... ***
---
This topic has been posted so many times since the game has been released
---
When I was doing this quest on PC I had to ask to other player for help... all of them instantly assumed I wanted force them PvP.
---
... that was a very bad day, I got too MANY salty replies, none simply had in mind I didn't need to kill them, they could kill themselves for me to revive.
---
LOL noice. need some mirelurk stuffies to litter around the place to make it perfect :D
---
Yeah, but they had cell based system back in TES: Arena, Daggerfall and the Terminator games.
---
Oh come on, the servers aren't stopping you nuking the queen and finishing the main quest. It's been done a million times. If it crashes, jump back in and try again. Or don't, and play something else. Whatever you want. But don't come up with silly excuses.
---
one gun to rule them all. currently vampire ultra-cite laser Gatling. I haven't swapped weapons in combat for at least 100 levels.
---
if you like it otw that much why you aren't playing that? 
---
oh you finished the game and you can't  keep playing? too bad...
---
 you know this game is to keep playing for years it's online with friends  they are not doing  the next fallout of your dreams here just a game to hangout in some fallout universe online that's  it ...stop telling bethesda for the 100th time how the fuck do their game as the next goty while they are not aiming  for that
---
id say thats more build dependant, i did a solo ok with a shotgun (cripple) and PA blocking doors. admittedly cheesy but it did work pretty well
---
I've already decided I'm not gonna support Bethesda's future games unless they show some kind of remorse or change of heart for their customers. The company is infamous for bugs, which I really don't mind that much, it's just the marketing and the way they've treated customers that piss me off. The people responsible for all the bullshit at Bethesda need to be fired or quit so they can start fresh. Otherwise any future release will still be marked with the Fallout 76 stain.
---
Wtf
---
I want to play a game.
---
I'm going to leave heavy legendary weapons at your camp.  You have a chose.  Collect them and slowly move towards the train station to scrap them or let them remain and live without that free script.
---
Man this was a great read and full of valid and insightful comments, and yeah your experience shows :) i'm not as old as you as you probably guessed, just above half your age in fact, but I just want to point out that while I believe both points 2 &amp; 3 are 100% correct, i don't think at this point they don't actually add up.
---
Tbh i am not mad about them breaking up non cosmetic promise as I said my last post it is really feasible to earn 1300-1600 atoms per month, and both the fridge and the bot are far below that. I'm just annoyed by the fact they lied - not mad.
---
That said tho Fallout First is another beast regarding its timing, how it was rolled out and one specific lie about scrap size. We know game is in a questionable state, nothing has been added for this last 5 months, bugs are still rampant and wastelanders is postponed. Do you really think this was the right time to add sub service? While everyone was complaining about either content draught, amount of bugs, lack of communication or many of its other issues? That leak implies that it was supposed to roll out with wastelanders, that'd been perfectly fine tbh, but when they postponed it they should've delayed its complementary service too. It just is in such a bad taste tbh I started to resent bethesda like i never did. Add that they blatantly lied about stash size? They could've added 100 lbs to everyone for example by saying we've found a new way! But nah. 
---
Everything thats been happening since patch 13 are a train wreck man. I defended this game, I had hoped but it turns out they were only, not mainly but only, are after money. Its sad.
---
Thank you for the long ass reply tho man it was a nice read!
---
new planet follow route, kill lvl up, meet new follower/npc do mission. next planet, repeat. when you reach monarch is more  of the same and you lose all hope... then  you start to think that it seems that people hate a game and a company so much that they convince  themselves  that this is better bc i don't see bethesda learning anything from this mass effect bioshock  thingy with nv perks  system i think they could learn  more from borderlands  than this lol
---
It’s supposed to be something you do passively and earn naturally during the game. Play events, someone dies? Help them out like a pioneer scout should. Earn your badge. Ever upwards!
---
for solo imo its not really worth it reward wise unless your really good at them imo.  compared to a team your gonna eat stims
---
Would that be a bad thing?  As much as I loved the idea of this game at launch, at this point it would be a mercy killing instead of letting it suffer a prolonged wasting away.
---
Yet here you are commenting... every day.
---
the fact that i could avoid meeting people like you now gives me more joy to keep playing;) i wish i had money enough to pat you all to leave the game
---
That’s pretty cool
---
armchair programmers not understanding game engines strike again
---
by your logic dota 2 uses the same engine as quake
---
have you been living under a rock? all i see everyday is copious amounts of asshurt on the front page
---
everyone that disagrees with me is a shill
---
as far as the marker sub goes, there was mod vs market owner drama (mods said he was spamming it to much, he countered, then entered bitch ass fighting)
---
so now that sub is blocked here, because neither group will put on their big boy panties, as a result the users and players suffer.
---
There’s an unmarked fissure site east of relay tower HN-B1-12.  My camp was just north of the tower and I’d watch the SB spawn.  I think it’s there to scare the crap out of new players.
---
Iv played every weekend and most evenings since launch and must have hundreds if not into the thousand hours in this game, iv rode the glitches, server dropping and losing a bloodied weapon was the last straw so I contacted bethesda support and they couldn't give a damn, I even tried fallout 1st, enough is enough now.
---
&gt; The Outer Worlds 
---
kek
---
that game is a steaming mediocrity
---
I doubt there is something after wastelanders. My bet for half baked addon with tons of microtransactions, then only bug fixes patches and servers shut down on the horizon
---
23 server disconnects?
---
&gt; The Fall of 76
---
lmao 
---
theres so much misinformation and blatant lies in that video its not even funny
---
Look at fallout shelter
---
***Thank you!*** Seriously. I've been trying to say this for awhile to mostly mixed reception. Bethesda has proven time and time again they will gladly lie, cheat, and steal to make a quick buck. 
---
They don't care about us at all.
---
Thanks mate! I try to explain this exact thing to the people who disagree with pvp.
---
Have you submitted a ticket?  JUST KIDDING!
---
Good luck, friend 😉
---
Thats the fallout subreddit. They... don't like 76 over there.
---
why are oyu still here then?
---
u/LadyDevann
---
This subreddit in a nutshell, someone complains or has a negative opinion and the swarm of fanboys descend
---
Surprised it took some of you this long. Honestly, they have been lying from the beginning... about stash space, about non cosmetic mtx, about content, fixes, etc. They should be ashamed... but they aren't.
---
I'm on my 3rd playthrough...so yeah...but thank you, your hostility and low standards for online mmo's is much appreciated. You have yourself a nice day now.
---
I use it for hours played though I never see myself actually getting those atom. If I actively tried though I'd expect like 7600 atoms xD
---
I honestly don’t think it needs to be “boycotted”. Just stop playing.
---
ah, i remember now.  man, i purge upstairs often.  initiated it once and that was enough.  sometimes I go and join in but man its probably one of the toughest events and i usually die at least once.  lol
---
As a 1st member: fuuuuuck this whole post. Leave the scrap box and just increase the stash box limit
---
&gt;Stop pushing microtransactions as hard as you are
---
youre gonna be in for a shock when you play any other triple A title in the last 5 years or so 
---
&gt;Stop pricing everything so high
---
do you want lootboxes,this is how you get lootboxes
---
&gt;stop spending so much dev time on new Atomic Shop items
---
people that work on atomic shop don't work on the game 
---
&gt;stop selling pay to win things
---
how do i "win" in this game?
---
Nice to still hear positive things sometimes lol and good of them to help you. Just so you know for the next times at one violent night don't be in a rush playing instruments and filling the meter to finish event had probably up to 15 legendaries a few times!
---
i can do this deal today.  when are you on?  yes, cap limit is a constant bitch, so buying 10k in 5.56 is a nice way to blow some caps!
---
&gt; Oh really
---
sorry, someone came and got it out of my vending
---
Because money is valued differently to different people. Forget vote with your wallet. Some people can afford so many votes they just buy every election.
---
Normal workshops you just capture and move on, but I think you are talking about the Power plants, which means you are repairing them. Fully repairing them makes them operate longer before they go down again and more rewards after starting it up as well if I’m not mistaken.
---
awesome, thank you.  this is right up my alley
---
I fully repaired it,how long will that usually last for?
---
do you have a recommended build?  This was suggested by another vault hunter
---

---
Well, with nothing to do in late game except farm better and better gear from the same events over and over again, that's to be expected.
---
Thank you for pointing me in the direction of where to gear up at.  This helps a lot :)
---
Suffer with agoraphobia, so keeping up and spending time with freinds is often difficult when they have there own life going on doing things I can't do at the moment so games like Fallout give me a great chance to have fun with freinds and there drop in drop out there's no real commitment :) so I can carry on playing when there not available
---
And either Wastelanders was already made when the game released (which some of the official pics suggest, IMO), or it's something the intern scribbled together as a side-project.
---
Hmmm....sounds plausible.
---
Thanks for running that experiment and sharing your findings :)
---
are those recommended gear buffs?
---
let's see how many playthroughs you would endure before coming back again with your high standards mmo (lol) to tell people how this game should be
---
fktard
---
Bunch of gourd flowers behind Big B's Rest Stop then some on the way to Harpers
---
Also that wall...you can actually walk around the side to find that most of it is destroyed...I realised after which was annoying 😅
---
Nice! One violent night is great for low levels to rank up very fast within the time event.
---
Oh I haven't picked up 76 since the Nuclear Winter, but please, enlighten me, what is there to even do?
---
It would seem that serendipity is necessary for any tanky build  The other vault hunter who recommended a build also had it included and with 1 rank.  i see several similarities between your two builds but he maxes agi and puts more into cha where your build went heavy endurance.  I do like how the other doesn't utilize chems  I've never been good at using consumables in games.  It is also really nice being able to compare the two separate builds and see what people are recommending :)
---
When a player who's halfway through a games content and most likely playing on normal mode complains about a lack of difficulty and apparently quality... the game is consistent throughout and the pacing is great if you're actually exploring and focusing on sidequests in addition to the story. It's almost as if your problem is with RPGs in general because they all follow a similar structure.
---
I support fallout 76 but not by spending more money than i paid at launch. I support it by playing it and whoever is in charge of fallout 76 should get a slap and told to start taking it seriously. Its has soooo much potential but its being wasted and the energy theyre giving it is mostly to the monetization rather than the game itself which is clear and very disappointing.
---
But my hope is still alive.
---
Do the ones u have still have a quest market beside them in your inventory?
---
They don’t communicate anymore either. I rarely see any see anything from them on here anymore. The last thing I saw any sort of response was when they made a post about how they’re not banning people for informing them about cheats/exploits after they.... well, banned that one person for informing them about an cheat/exploit. They don’t listen/care unless it benefits them monetarily.
---
Truth be told...I’m not sure why the scrip limit isn’t at least 160! So I can scrap (4)3* weapons! Not 3 and then scramble to fill it with whatever else. Especially since the weapons weigh so much
---
Fair enough.  It seems there is a lot of support for the unarmed path but I will keep in mind that 1h weapons are equal to 2h weapons.  Thankfully for groups of supes, I'll be rolling with a group of snipers most of the time so I shouldn't have to worry too much about being overwhelmed.  Just have to live longer than my opponents :)
---
I knew it was going to end badly for everyone, because it had to, like all the other quests, but it was still a great bit of writing.
---
I completely agree. The problem was I had no idea of a limit. I figured I was about to pocket 50k caps for a piece of bad ass armor. 
---
But yeah, the whole mule thing is good if you’re hardcore and have trusting people you play with but I’m mainly a solo guy.
---
[This](http://imgur.com/gallery/MzFWChF) is the reason I have to leave my paddle ball at home
---
Well there's always the 76filthy sub, instead of angry anarchism, gamersriseup bullshit and toxic children you get to be on a dictatorship where Todd is godd and blind consumerism is the local religion
---
Didn't have any luck. I'm playing from asia btw. Thanks for the offer though.
---
They don't like Fallout in general over there.
---
Thanks for ripping the band aid off i think i needed to hear this lol
---
If all they care about is profit, they are really dumb.  In fact, they are probably just really dumb regardless.  They could have been making fortunes on this game.  They hardly scratched the surface of what they could sell as far as just skims go.  Did you see how many people bought the gold 50 Cal skin?  How about all the PA skins, especially Liberty Prime?  Imagine how many polished brass and chrome plated Gatling gun skins would sell.  Imagine skins for the hunting rifle that make it look like grandpa's Remington 700 bdl.  A skin that changes a combat rifle to look like an m16a1, a 10mm to a 1911, a Tesla rifle skin, a smg skin, a pipe gun paint, a Guass rifle paint, etc, etc.  Jeez, I don't even remember seeing fo76 irl merch like cool t-shirts the way I did for fo4(which were awesome shirts btw).
---
I think fully repaired is 4 hours? While not fully repaired is 2 I think
---
I've been actually having this problem all over the place. A lot of the times when I kill a two or three star enemy, like 90% of the time I get just a one star item.
---
FYI workshops have their own resources which show up as green when you build structures in them
---
You can 100% damage your own camp with a flamer
---
I'm playing on supernova, but feel free to keep assuming.
---
I explored every nook and cranny, ever side quest until now. So you're wrong about that, too. 
---
Im sorry I'm criticising a game you're enjoying, but don't make stuff up, thank you.
---
100% should be operational, you aren't being given part of the service you paid for, chase this down and get an extension, they owe it to you.
---
Having said that I doubt Bethesda is going to be nice at all if you ask them for extra subscription time since it didn't work. Or maybe they'll perma-ban you. Who knows.
---
I know,I used all of the important stuff up already
---
1. What do you mean
---
2. The main quest is greyed out in the complete quest section
---
Easy to say with no proof. If you can't see that TOW is a vastly superior game than FO76 there's no point in trying to teach you anything. Making stuff up sounds like the title to your uninformed diatribe.
---
That is one of the quests one has to remember when naming FO76 together with Anthem as one of the great disappointments in gaming. Yea, FO76 is bug ridden, but at least it has very entertaining quest like this.
---
Thanks! Completed the set. I found atleast 2 plants in the back between the stop and the river.
---
I really hope Bethesda sees this
---
Ooh I’ve been trying to tackle this challenge for a few days now and haven’t been able to find a detailed guide like this one! Thanks for sharing it! :)
---
It would be good if you could stop calling FO76 broken.
---
If you even play the game you’d see
---
They are the Verizon of game development.
---
Military wing vendor will have it. Only place they can be obtained.
---
Yea, I'll try, but they mostly complain about the queues for joining into the GfNOW servers, when the obvious reason is 1 step arount the corner - Servers status info-page clearly indicates that half of servers are unavailable due to the maintenances and upgrades with scheduled ETAs….
---
Oh
---
You're supposed to eat them?
---
Well, displaying doesn't do anything, while eating works...
---
Like many people have said shotguns are probably best. You can find a perfect role for much cheaper than most other weapons as well
---
If you look in your Holo section, find the overseer tapes. Are there yellow diamonds next to them? In thinking they might needed to be listened to, I'm having the same issue, been playing nearly 3k hours lol
---
Well, they only like the mythical "when fallout was my particular flavour of fallout"
---
Yeah I tryed that, didn't change anything
---
I wrote my reply and then realized I started ranting, so fyi i get pissy.
---
Love it. two characters, main is ~120. Been playing since beginning of Beta. But ever since Vault 94 raid started to wipe people's accounts, i've not touched it. I love the game yea, but I do not have the patience to do it all over again. This game has been extremely hard to love for many reasons but after I stopped playing it I started to enjoy other games and made me feel weird about going back to a game that tries to sell me features i wanted in November 2018 and kicks me to the dashboard ~2/hr. Wastelanders really is this game's only hope, but I fear the worst. The game struggles to functional normally, much less when we drop NPCs and a shit ton of new variables into play. Plus they aren't even listening or responding to us anymore... Things are bleak right now and I hope they improve but Beth really hasn't given us a single reason to give them the benefit of the doubt.
---
That sounds fun. For me. I farm my own legendariez during quest play. So, anyone drops goes to vendor machine for someone who needs it.
---
My camp just got destroyed when they nuked whitespring area. Lolz
---
Cobbleton Farm in Toxic Valley and Sunday Brothers Cabin in The Mire each have five gourd flower plants :)
---
The strangler power armor is bugged to hell. Locks up everyone's game when you use it due to the acid animations and the pieces randomly fall off the PA into your inventory. 
---
For the thorn and solar armor, a lot of legendary effects are not in the loot table and cannot drop, including unyielding, chameleon, and improved sneaking, among others. 
---
I just don't see the point.
---
Just because were on reddit does not make us superior to people who dont use it, dont assume people dont u derstand just because they are apathetic to it
---
Going to a swapmeet today its my birthday and after a new brewery. Ill be a while.
---
You got your money’s worth
---
I really hope they expand on the faction in the future.  It was one of the more interesting and unique quest lines.  The computer already has options for daily missions.  I could easily see some Raider crushing happening in the future.
---
‘Going to work’ - in this comedy of errors game lol, I think you should lower your expectations :)
---
And as far as I know and I've looked a lot, only the mods are available. I've never seen plans for any armor scout modifications. But if someone else has, please provide the deets so I can try your way.
---
Try hopping to another server, that might help when quest objectives or markers are broken.
---
For myself I enjoy: cranberry relish (+10%xp), brain fungus soup (+2Int), berry mentats (+5Int) and a nice nap before I hit the wasteland
---
Bug “fixes”
---
When you says "locked" what is the message exactly?  Usually if your account does not have Fallout 1st, clicking to play Private Worlds would take you to a sign up screen.  I've been on Fallout 1st since it came out and it's due not to renew for another week, so I don't think your issue has anything to do with renewing.
---
When you stated submitting a ticket to Bethesda did not work, what didn't work?
---
Wow. Kudos sir. I've tried to say this on a very different way, but you nailed it. No need to change a word on it.
---
“Shankwell liked this”
---
Tato flowers just outside vault 94. Enough for the completion of the task.
---
I'm still playing DayZ a very good example of buggy for years game. I took it, I'm enjoying it from time to time despite the bugs, I'm actively critize it but I'm not going to spend no even half Euro until they make the bugs not deal breaker (example the new map). The difference here is that Bethesda promote a game as ready (comparing with early access of DayZ) for a lot of money, they claim cosmetic microtransactions and beside of all these lies now you have to pay to win either with Atoms or the subscription. Here the fanboys are not just defend the game but also defend the policy and that's is very bad.
---
Fine a mirelurk queen then cripple her so she cant move. Then use your NON explosive weapon to kill NON diseased hatchlings. Take some radaway to lower disease resistance and there ya go!
---
I don't know, I think many of the challenges are FAR from passive gaining.
---
Ress someone in the water?
---
Cook food that require far apart ingredients?
---
Kill specific creatures with specific (and some bad) weapons?
---
Craft things like cure disease, that you naturally find much more than you need?
---
Not ot mention "take pictures of creatures"...
---
I'm still waiting for bug fixes and ultra wide support in Skyrim. They didn't even bother for the special edition.
---
In don't understand why the community is still hopeful about this company's post launch support of their games, there is none.
---
You are referring to Resource collectors and the lights on the side, they never go beyond the three yellow, cosmetic I'd imagine? They are on or off, the game is not that advanced to give differing production rates linked with power.
---
Probably repossess his home and jail his family, you know being Bethesda.
---
Seriously this. It's like no one from the company has even played their own product or they're just not reporting bugs internally.
---
"Video games used to be"
---
I dont know man, shit has always come out full priced since the beginning.  Superman 64 comes to mind.  And fallout has already died once.  I think you are looking at the past with rose tinted glasses.
---
devs arent being scummy.. they are doing a job they were hired to do and following orders so they dont lose that job
---
devs dont make decisions.. they execute them
---
😂😂 yeah OP i hope you like getting flogged
---
Ah. Perhaps they didn't even intend to play them. With a few minutes left I noticed that one of the others started playing, so I started the jukebox and began banging the drums.
---
I really need to get a mic though, communication is hard in fo76.
---
look at the game and you'll see laziness. the lmg, 10mm smg have no scope mods. any gun you get can never have any iron sights or scope. its horrible to design a whole new gun and I cant even properly aim with it.
---
Stealth is broken enough like that.
---
Burning money to keep warm would be a less of a waste than spending it in the atomic shop
---
Can send me an invite too, viperxr22. However, i'll probably be playing nuclear winter today, for dxp
---
Rifleman and Tank Killer
---
The persistent lag. It really gets to me after a year. Please let me have a smooth session for once!
---
The Overseer's Mission is the one for getting all her holotapes. This is NOT a main quest, it cannot be finished, and the tapes are a poor indicator of how far in the main quest you got. The main quest line starts with the responders and then takes you through all the factions (raiders, free states, brotherhood, enclave) until you run a silo and drop a nuke on the scorch beast queen.
---
Some parts of the main quest are notorious for temporarily bugging out and not displaying quest markers (Rose, I'm looking at you). Relogging/server hopping is the only way to get them to reappear, AFAIK. If that doesn't help, you may want to visit the locations and look at the terminals associated with the main quest line to see if this shakes anything loose.
---
Your snarky edit was a bit snarky LOL 😂
---
Queen needs to drop UNIQUE stuff like bear arms and fixer. That will make people nuke the fissures like no tomorrow.
---
That's why I haven't played for the past two months. I have never paid for anything in the Atom  Shop because of pricing, and the game just isn't progressing unless they can charge you for it. And then it's still broken. So many issues with the shop, and new content. I think I'm out completely now. Way too many better games out there.
---
Even with the atoms I earned in game, I don't give it to them. I have twice, for the cultist items and the raider emote. But they don't deserve my atoms rn
---
What in the actual shit
---
What he said. You can just stack the steel beams on top of each other (they're in the "Stairs" category). For the connectors, you kinda havto work around the beams. Place stairs and then a second floor by the beams on hte height you want the connectors to be. Then place your connectors but make sure they are overhanging past the floor. Then remove the floor.
---
All connectors on the floor will be removed as well, but the overhanging connectors will stay in the air. Then you can keep building the masts from there.
---
You can imagine how tedious it was to get them ALL done :P
---
Right now until 18th
---
Now until Monday or Tuesday
---
Just remember; in fo4 you can pull down the console and with two lines make any settlement budget limitless.
---
Thank you :D
---
Oh here we go..
---
How many and how frequently can you get them from a power plant?
---
Thank-you.  I have "server hopped" the private server going back and forth between characters and I think I saw spawns change but I just thought it was in my head.  
---
The dense plan though seems really odd for me.  Never saw one then I pick up 4 in two weeks, like I said one immediately after dt and the other three in private servers.  But you might be right, it might simply be me hopping more often on the private server.  
---
So that means I should be able to re log into my private server over and over and the Asylum uniforms should also reroll?
---
I was thinking about using walls, too at some point. But in the end it looked too "blocky" for my taste. I'm just glad I found a way to keep those connectors in place.
---
An extra benefit is having power in the whole thing without having to string extra powerlines - half my base basically is powerlines now lol
---
Amen!!!
---
He probably turned it into one of his horcruxes
---
It is broken. Even most of the game’s defenders say that it’s broken. It’s probably the worst Bethesda game to date in that regard.
---
Cheers, matey!
---
I totally agree. I just finished Cold Case and I had chills the entire way through.
---
No problem 
---
The plasma flamer is a semi-automatic rifle. Anything that effects rifles effects the p flamer
---
I haven't played in so long. There's better games out there.
---
You're welcome - I'm glad people enjoy it as much as I do :)
---
 "Calling fallout 76 broken would be a disservice because saying that something is broken implies it was once functional."  (c) Joseph Anderson
---
Yes, yes it has...  It just works!
---
You guys are all thinking of the Asylum Worker Uniform, which admittedly looks the same, but is not.   
---
The different colored asylum uniforms are rare, the Nurses Uniform, not so much.
---
stalkers should come with 40% extra bashing on melee weapons 💪
---
I've heard that this is a sign of a server in decline.  There are only so many free slots for enemies, and they don't always get put back properly when an enemy is killed.  Once they've been occupied, you get this trickling behavior from events that would otherwise spawn quite a few of them.
---
From what I said about someone attacking me at a vendor I would have to have pacifist off to see someone initiating.  Can't carry a gatling plasma at level 10. If I am not in a workshop someone can't kill me of pacifist is off. This was more of a stupid response to a previous comment of mine on another post that wasn't even directed at him but people feel the need to make stupid responses to shit that wasn't aimed at them and continue the habit.
---
Down voted for the terrible grammar, actually. Stay in school.
---
You can't just run at low health. 
---
Bloodied requires a pretty hefty investment in perks, equipment, and mutations to actually pull it off.
---
I use it to quickly rad myself when i need high charisma to buy stuff. Two shots to the ground and I’m near death 😂
---
Mix and match vanguard, troubleshooter and exterminator armor. Look for poison and rad resist and plus endurance and strength.
---
Dense mod for chest armor, or Fireproof, protects you from scorchbeasts.
---
Tanky perks include blocker, barbarian, adamantium skeleton, sun kissed, nerd rage, born survivor, dodgy and serendipity.
---
Considering that the Wastelanders trailer is voiced by the Overseer, I very much suspect we are supposed to find more of her holos in future updates. But then, we're talking Bethesda here, so the quest might also very well just be broken. I'm hoping for the former, though.
---
add me on psn: Owl_No
---
Thank you :)
---
Not with the effects no but I do think it would be interesting to be able to use legendary modules on things you craft each module adds an effect up to three. 
---
Still random but it would make it able to create a legendary weapon/armour you want.
---
This needs more context. Is the nuke going to explode if you don't do anything about it? If not, why this heresy? Atom is our Lord and Savior, dont fiddle your dirty thumps on his holy message!
---
Plans do not exist, only rather expensive mods.
---
I only run with one person, so I keep my CHA at 3 just to be able to share 1 cost perks with them. If you're running with more people, CHA can become even more useful. To make up for it I maxed END, but honestly AGI is probably better with how it scales. I've currently taking a few points out of END to go into LCK and INT for nerd rage and serendipity, and maybe more AGI eventually.
---
Serendipity at rank 1, since I hover around 40% or lower health, has a remarkable chance to activate at what it calls 15% of the time, saving my butt a lot. The big thing is I'm technically a bloodied build, which means keeping half my health or so full of rads for the STR bonus of Radicool in END. That bites me hard, sometimes, and I just drop like a fly.
---
As for chems, I started noticing I had 60-80 pounds of them, and it felt like a waste to sell them for so little to npc vendors back during the first month of launch. I might sell them in a vending machine now, since I can price them better. With my mutation, they're less effective too, but it can be nice to feel like you have something hotkeyed to press when things start getting bad. Addiction isn't that bad, though, so even if you don't perk particularly for it it'll be ok. It's a far cry from psychojet fueled melee in FO4 where time slows and you sprint everywhere popping heads off.
---
Mutations are another thing to seriously consider. Serums are the easy way to get them, at high cost if you don't find them for cheap on someone's vending machine, or there's a mine near West Tek that has a decontamination arch inside as well as radioactive barrels. I did what they call the server hop where you stand in radiation until you're mutated, either cure it if you hate it or keep it if you like it, then log out and back in in a few minutes so you can stand in the puddle and get radiated again until mutation. You do that for awhile, and if you're really lucky, you never get ones you have to remove because you might remove your good ones. Eventually you'll get the mutations you want, maybe. I got really lucky and my build up there shows the ones I actually got. Still need to track down herd mentality (+2 to all special when in a group, -2 when alone) and grounded (+100 energy resist, -50 energy damage) though I'll probably look for serums. Starched genes is really important to keep your mutations from curing when you cure your rads.
---
But yeah, the number one important thing if you don't wear power armor is some combination of those perks that increase DR and ER, and probably something like Serendipity to erase incoming damage sometimes.
---
By the time you hit level 50 you'll have a better idea of what works for you and what doesn't, and hopefully some good gear in the process.  I'm always looking at others' builds too in order to compare what I'm doing. It's how I found out about serendipity, haha.
---
There's also the issue of nuke zones.. If we run rad sponge on multiple people, it can kind of keep you alive but.. Nuke zones hurt. I'm putting a set of T60 together just as an option, but I'll have to get a bunch of perk cards to go with it.
---
Good luck, and happy wastelanding!
---
Bad example runescape lets u buy bank space out of their shop and u dont even need to use actual money
---
I’ve been using the power armor for a week and haven’t noticed any freezing yet
---
It's trash
---
PA or a radiation suit.
---
Fallout 76 was my last straw, Bethesda won’t have anymore of my money. 
---
Obsidian can have it all if they just keep making more stuff like Outer Worlds.
---
God mode? Energy weapons? Whhhaaat?
---
To be honest I agree 100%
---
But I'm sick of actually seeing these threads. 
---
Bethesda stopped listening months ago and after spending over 100 dollars on this broken product, I'm done. I supported it hoping they'd improve but nope. Then they announce fallout 1st, demanding more money than I've already given. They've had enough off me.
---
I'm completely done, I've uninstalled the game and don't plan on going back to it, I've just went back to fallout 4 and NV with mods and I'm having a blast.
---
If you want Bethesda to listen then stop playing the fucking game. Stop buying atoms, uninstall the game and just leave it until there is a game worth going too.
---
If we all got together and set dates to stop playing in protest then maybe they might listen. Playing the game and struggling through it will not help
---
I got kicked out of my friends world 2 times, and blue screened trying to join him. Restarting my game didn't help, I just gave up.
---
Do an SBQ. If you don't notice it, you will notice it, you will notice people complaining about it. This is a well documented bug.
---
I gave up on RDO for that reason.
---
Well i figured out it was cause he wasnt on my friends list in the social menu of the game. Now i dont know how to fix that lol
---
its all started with pubg mod...
---
Dude, chill. People are allowed to like different things. You just look like a fool acting better than someone because you like a game they don’t.
---
I feel you man.  This game has tons of potential but Bethesda just does not seem to care.  My hope for the game is at an all time low.  Wastelanders will determine whether or not I uninstall the game.
---
Most folks know how to place the nuke so we can do the fight in our armor. If I ever need to go in to a zone I’m still pretty much one shotting most anything even in a hazmat suit. If I’m going to do the meltdown raid I’ll switch some perks around and use power armor, though it isn’t ideal
---
FO76 is like that old Star Trek episode, "the givers of joy and pain."
---
Sorry, I should have been more specific, I'm a bloodied vats sneak build. Pa and radiation suit breaks my build, because I need my unyielding armor.
---
That’s the thing that irks me about RDO. It’s fun to play cowboys with friends. It’s just always a crapshoot if you can stay connected.
---
I have had some luck with clearing the cache in my Xbox and having a pretty stable connection.
---
I think they are suppositories actually. The different shapes give you different discomforts that affect your stats.
---
Also I forget the combination.. but you can use a combination of radshield and other stuff and make yourself practically invincible to rad damage for a solid 5+ minutes
---
The people who still play this game and buy atoms and Fallout worst memberships are part of the problem,
---
I agree, that is the stupidest challenge reward. I think it should be 5000 Atoms. Most people aren't going to get to 7600 hours anyway. 😧
---
I've gotten a couple robot challenges done. The scorched ones are easier tho.
---
Doesn't matter, there is no alternative unless you stay completely out of radiation and nuke zones. Glowing blood packs and radshield will only get you so far. Or swap out a few pieces of armor with RR, but it's still not as good as pa or a radiation suit.
---
My thanks for bestowing thine wisdom upon us.
---
Sleep in a bed for well rested bonus
---
Craft cranberry relish for xp bonus
---
Use bobble head leader or intelligence
---
Do path to enlightenment if you see it
---
These will all give an XP bonus that are stackable, then spend the next hour event hopping or use looking for group or discord to join Queen fights. With about 5 mins left on your bonuses go craft everything possible then repeat!
---
The only way to manage a nuke zone out of power armor or a hazmat suit is armor with built in rad resist like robot and trapper and the +25 rad resist legendary effect. I believe you can get over 200 red resist this way if you combine that with Rad Resistant perk and Radshield. You'll still need a lot of rad x and rad away if you plan on spending any significant amount of time inside a nuke zone.
---
It is a bug. Any bug where you benefit is considered an exploit. They are doing huge ban waves for exploits. So take your chances with keeping it.
---
I just started playing Outer Worlds directly after picking up FO76 about a month and a half ago. It was like a breath of fresh air.
---
My friend was in my friends list. 🤔 Hopefully they will get it fixed 😞
---
There is a nuka cola drink that purges rads, but still not enough.
---
It’s generally not worth powering up the plant once you can make a fusion generator
---
Nuka grape.  Buy em from the soda bot in white springs
---
Get the Goulish Perk Card and farm rad aways. Thats how i do it at least.
---
Where is this?
---
Try Outer Worlds or Fallout 4 mods. They have a big update coming up on November 21st that looks promising!
---
See a creature? Take out your camera and snap a pic. No need to go hunting.
---
Interesting, I had to stash a good roll of a Tesla because ghouls kept getting their health back.
---
I'm assuming it blew up but did you have a countdown or did it blow up instantly? what happened?
---
Yeah there is little point in debating which GAME is better because everyone has their own preference, I was merely highlighting how the dev teams have handled their products. TOW is small and not exactly replayable, but its a complete game and clearly has had a lot of effort put into it to make what it is feel full...where FO76 was botched from the start, all this time has been spent un-botching it and now Beth are rinsing a shell of a game for caps...I mean money
---
The stretchy model is what you look like in power armor, so pretty much anywhere you can force the camera against a wall might remove the power armor visually
---
It does a countdown
---
Res someone in water happens naturally all the time during certain events. My point is you shouldn’t need to ask another player to down themself.
---
Which one ??
---
Everytime you die it would put at 30%
---
I always thought that they  should add human NPCs for side quests that aren’t apart of the Wastelanders update. Staggered updates instead of one big one.
---
Grape? Not sure.
---
I am in the datamining group. It is tied to a weekly brewing challenge that has never been triggered. There were some atom shop kegs added last client update that appear to work the same way with a different design, so I am assuming they will be triggered around the same time, but that is purely an assumption. There are a lot of items added to the game that have never been implemented.
---
Atomic shop only.
---
Unfortunately not. It so when you die from rad damage you dont respawn at 100% rads and die instantly again. I keep a rad emitter in my base and a gamma gun in my inventory to re-radiate myself. You can also keep spoiled meat or other stuff like toxic goo to eat/drink to get rads back.
---
You probs wasnt on his
---
That is probably because if you'd die from rads you don't respawn with a full rads and die instantly. Or it is just a fixed amount of health you get when you respawn. In this case the game goes health is more impotent than rads. 
---
I don't know. Just my 2 cents.
---
Neither of those are multiplayer games he can play with his girlfriend.
---
I feel ya bud, same boat, I'm not playing again until wastelanders. Then I'll give it a shot, but until then its collecting dust
---
Yep, probably 😂
---
I keep my character between 10 and 25% health in a rad zone with PA and diluted radaway. It's true that the unyielding perks don't work in PA, but that's just the way it is. You still have great lethality because of mutations and your weapon perk cards.
---
Never seen a map that empty. Always full when I log in.
---
No, the problem is bethesda, not people that want play and are still hoping to see this game get better! Don't search the problem in others just because the real problem is hard to fight!
---
Im reinstalling my game later today to see if it fixes if it does ill let u know
---
Totally agree.
---
Even then, consider the fact it's been a year since the game released. FO4 for comparison got two large DLCs, a medium-sized one and 3 settlement DLCs in a year. Let alone FNV's DLC in a year, or FO3's or even Oblivion, for that game series Bethesda seems to really care for. FO76 has only gotten a BR gamemode as its massive update this year - other than that it's been a few one-off quests, Survival and a bunch of Atom Shop bullshit.
---
It's pretty mediocre offerings compared to whatever Bethesda or Obsidian gave us in the past with this series, and considering the playerbase is dwindling I don't see it improving past Wastelanders.
---
One of if the things that you can hack is use any item at any level. PC is a joke ATM and Bethesda needs to take it seriously.
---
You’re in the honeymoon phase. Pretty much any game is fun for the first week.
---
You get to grind for hours to make your base look marginally better!
---
That's content, right?
---
Fort Independence
---
Interesting how you say that but also contributed nothing to the conversation
---
Add me ramraid1976
---
Well holy...shit...BETHESDA TAKE MY MONEY
---
Who did it first ?
---
Ahh, you did some adjustments to your ship since i first saw it 2 months ago. Love how you "armed" your ship btw.

Still one of the best camps i´ve seen so far.
---
What is your build and how efficient is farming them compared to places like west tec
---
Yeah but Rockstar will get RDR2 into an actual working condition.
---
Thats an Randome ancounter, one of them.  Looks like an mininuke that hit the ground...  
---
the colour is randome. Good Look :D

it also can be  a crashed Vertibot, Satelite, Sheepsq.  or an Tank with some Gutsy's and an assoulttron   
---
and somethink i surly  forgot\^\^
---
I mean, it's not really deniable that East Coast Fallout is pretty different in priorities to West Coast Fallout, though, so it's understandable those who prefer the Black Isle/Obsidian approach probably aren't too big of fans of Bethesda's games and vice-versa.
---
I love seeing little things like this or the stickers on the scrip machine. I kinda just want to make a sticker set from all the images 🤔
---
If I were to build a glass cannon (max damage, little defense) VATS focused unarmed character, my perk loadout would look like this: [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f1633df&amp;d=ss2sg2se2ir2s92sf2l71pe0cu2lt2aj2ao0a04e31er2eu0ar2lv2lk2lu2l10a70&amp;w=pm0&amp;m=28ghc4f35&amp;nw=&amp;n=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f1633df&amp;d=ss2sg2se2ir2s92sf2l71pe0cu2lt2aj2ao0a04e31er2eu0ar2lv2lk2lu2l10a70&amp;w=pm0&amp;m=28ghc4f35&amp;nw=&amp;n=)
---
On the other hand, my non-VATS focused unarmed build perk loadout would look like this: [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f1c73a8&amp;d=ss2sg2se2a12la2c72ir2s92sf2l71pe0cu2lt2aj2ao0eo2e31er2eh2eu0ar2&amp;w=pm0a04&amp;m=28ghc4f3&amp;nw=&amp;n=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f1c73a8&amp;d=ss2sg2se2a12la2c72ir2s92sf2l71pe0cu2lt2aj2ao0eo2e31er2eh2eu0ar2&amp;w=pm0a04&amp;m=28ghc4f3&amp;nw=&amp;n=)
---
I heard a theory recently that Bethesda could be trying to fatten up their bottom line with things like 1st and general MTX in their games, because they are looking to sell the company and need to show just how profitable they are. Probably complete BS, but it'll be interesting to see what 2020 holds for Bethesda.
---
Yeah your wallet won't be having a Happy Time.
---
That's honestly the main issue, really.
---
Bethesda wanted to push towards territories with 76  where they just wouldn't be able to catch up to modded 4 no matter what. Sure, 4's worldspace is a lot less interesting, but at least I don't have to wait a year and a half to not use 90% recycled FO4 weapons to go and grind shit, I can just go and download a bunch of classic weapon mods and some settlement stuff and have a good time.
---
Wastelanders really should've been the original pitch for the game.
---
Yeah you have to have fast firing weapons. If people don’t have a good Xbox or internet connection when I’m fighting with my strangler and gat plasma. Bye bye
---
I doubt they are going to stop development anytime soon, as much as many people seem to be hoping for that to happen, BGS Austin currently has 28 open job postings, if the game was to be abandoned, there would more likely be layoffs instead. Even Anthem is [rumored](https://kotaku.com/sources-bioware-plans-a-complete-overhaul-for-anthem-1839892415) to have a complete overhaul in the plans, and if that game is not given up on, then why would 76 be, knowing it will be "the" Fallout for like a decade? It does need new content, and to be made more palatable to the single player crowd, the Wastelanders update will be the first real test of that.
---
The majority of people are most probably already "boycotting" the monetization naturally by never spending on atoms, nor buying the subscription. But it is a normal part of the business for whales to be in the minority, and they tend not to listen to the outrage. If the revenue is not high enough, there is a fair amount of room left to increase the monetization as well (more paid convenience), it is still light compared to ESO.
---
You could’ve taken him. He only had a smidge of health left 😂😂
---
A year since launch and still happening
---
Sometimes when fighting a player using energy weapons you become invincible. Not sure but I think they have to kill you or get you down or something, but then you take 0 damage.  It is total crap.
---
Alright, no offense, but you think that maybe the person with a year's worth of playtime is probably going to have a better idea of the scope than you are?
---
I agree, mind you, the first 20-30 hours are fun enough, but once you settle into the slow-burning grind of mid to late game you realise it isn't worth the minimal payoff. It's the same issue I have with games like Warframe where the point of plsying is to get better at grinding to get better at grinding to get better at grinding.
---
I bought the game on my PC shortly after launch, when nobody wanted it, for only $7 from a wholesaler, and it still wasn't worth the money. Bethesda was one of my favourite devs 5-8 years ago but now, I've got my doubts about TES 6's (eventual) release.
---
You want to know the difference between me and Bethesda? I reply to comments directed at me.
---
I personally really like the game despite its flaws, I mean, I know it’s creation engine so it’s gonna be buggy, even some 800+ hours in with high level endgame gear equipped main  I could still find stuff to do. I think you and yours are in for a very fun time in Appalachia for some time.
---
My issue is entirely the games oversight by Bethesda Austin’s leadership and total lack of respect for the community and customers by paywalling the most requested feature (unlimited scrap/ more stash space), and way overpricing the subscription; I have the means to buy it but my SO and I would have to spend &gt;$250 CAD just for this one feature? No fucking way. 
---
The other value adds are minimal at best, and private worlds  are not interesting because of the lack of social interaction with anyone else. I love seeing other people’s camps and builds, and vending is my favourite thing to do, but with everyone playing private, there’s no point to playing.
---
It’s sad to see because of the wasted potential for an amazing game despite everything it had against it.
---
This has always been my favorite stash box.
---
You can sell the extras for 1 cap each at robovendors. Just keep 1 it is all you can use.
---
Makes sense instead of improving and keeping up with many other devs nowadays putting out amazing games and then theres their dev team putting out outdated tech pushed to its limits and not fixing a game after nearly 5 years. Might aswell spit the dummy out and go someone else. If they do hopefully they will sell IPs, can imagine a couple of company's that would love Fallout or TES
---
I agree its crazy easy especially with my stealth rifleman build running an ie fr dragon
---
Sick! Well done mate!
---
Yep. Issue isn't the building upon of the engine over time, it's the janky implementation of some of those features and just straight-up poor game design. A fresh, fancy new engine won't solve Bethesda's middling rut it's been stuck in.
---
The fuck does it matter who did it first it’s just as hypocritical writing that reply
---
It hurts, because it is true :(
---
Impotent from rads, I was hoping to have kids with super powers :(
---
I’m a heavy gunner and I’d say it’s better than west tech for script if you hop all the fissures but the legendarys are more 1 or 2 stars either way I was just reporting my findings
---
Yeah okay I see how its gonna turns out if we continue talking. Have a nice day
---
So the person with the energy weapons be aimed invincible?
---
Yeah, I know, I only fight the sbq when it's nuked like that. but I never launched a nuke, and would like my first one on harpers ferry hehe. But it looks like I have no choice than equip pa, or radiation suit, too bad then I guess.
---
I think they should make a system for building under ground. People are building under ground already, might as well make a system for it. 😉
---
So the person with the energy weapons becomes invincible?
---
I just wear a hazmat, use diluted radaway when I get about 5% or so health
---
Down voted (and don't care anymore I have better things to do) because you play the teacher when nobody assign you, kiddo.
---
Do you have any more Info on this please? Also, I thought chems of the same type didn't stack.
---
Lol. Okay
---
What a glitch! Maybe bobbles are a lotion containers. You unscrew the head and smear some extra XP topical lotion all over your... Important bits.
---
I think a lot of people are just hoping for the miracle update to fix the game, really. I stick around for news on Wastelanders, but there isn't much else other than that.
---
I find that if you show up for Project Paradise, usually a couple people will show up. I think many people just look to see if others are there before doing it as it's pretty hard to get any rewards solo and impossible to get the really good ones.
---
Random each time you find it.
---
That has always bee my take on it, I was a bit freaked the first time I saw it at level 3, thought I was toast.
---
I have one unyielding piece that has rad resist. But the chances of unyielding + rad resist are so low, even in player vendors. And I can't spare the perks, I also have only 1 endurance.
---
Yh i know thanks
---
There are several areas on the map where specific events can spawn. There is the bomb, a Deathclaw + its nest, a downed vertibird, and a few others.  
---
There's a spot southeast of the fire station, one east along the road from the fissure site that is southwest of whitespring. There are more locations, but that's just what I recall right now.  
---
If you go to these areas there's still a chance that no "event" will be there.
---
Like mounted creature heads? Why haven’t they released more than 6 of those?
---
And then give us the vault building set from FO4
---
Definitely.
---
What’s worse is that, for me personall, I’d argue Fallout had way more going for it. I like what I’ve played of TOW but it’s basically Borderlands with a smaller world and better writing. Didn’t come anywhere near scratching the Fallout itch I’ve been feeling. 76 had so much potential, and they fell on their face at every turn. Then they finally got on the right track, took a few huge leaps, and then sat down and shat all over everything they’d done right for a few bucks.
---
I have hundreds radaways, and stimpaks, and the healing mutation. And ghoulish just restores health. I need something solid against rad damage.
---
Same here! This game is the worst functioning socialist society I’ve ever seen. I had to redownload the fucker and move around files. Lol. Piece of ace. Oh - and now I get frequent time pauses in frames like every 5-10 seconds
---
Seems like this is my only option then, still a bummer though.
---
Go with halo, if on Xbox 😉
---
I bet it took you awhile to think up that response. You should be proud!
---
Beautifully put brother - time to say shit on this:)

He is the coward of scorchbeasts. The queen kicked him out of the hive for not being a good drone. His time away from the hivemind has given him the chance to develop his own personal interests. His paintings are terrible, but what a poet.
---
Good one. 😂👍
---
I'll keep the mistake. 😆
---
That really is the only way. No major legendary effects give rad resist so you need to get it off the secondary effect and built in to the armor. Like another person said, I believe it's possible to make yourself immune to rads for ~5 minutes but you need to stack multiple things. Unfortunately it's the drawback for nuke zones with all builds not just bloodied. I cant run around in a nuke zone on my bloodied guy or my full hp commando.
---
Actually I don't find it disgusting. I don't approve of various things about Creation Club, but I have zero problem paying modders for high quality updates.
---
You can speak for yourself of course, but I'm sure many modders would appreciate the support and the chance to add paid work to their CV. I've seen some mods that are downloaded hundreds of thousands of times and don't even have 10% of that number in endorsements. A lot of people who download mods do so selfishly.

Clean Appalachia is still going on. Would be fun if BGS buff the SB because lorewise we took down the weaker and the "previous" queen (if SB works like bees for exemple, it's possible for a new queen to lead another hive).
---
What’s irritating me, is on my 3 character which is up to 97 now I haven’t gotten a single BOS paint plan.
---
I rather doubt this stuff will come to 76 in the end, my post was more 'what if' than anything. 
---
That said, virtual worlds in this game would be something worth paying for, for once.
---
Yeah, it seems like those are my only options, still have the ultracite  pa quest reward with zero weight in my inventory. Guess I'll use it then.
---
God forbid Bethesda put in some effort and challenge themselves haha but even then why would the weapon mods effect the holstering? It didn’t in New Vegas, where weapon mods originated. The only major weapon mods are turning a pistol into a rifle and that’s just moving it from your hip to your back
---
I think the big kick in the teeth was yes we're pushing back wastelanders but here have a overpriced subscription service in the meantime, they certainly could have timed that better....
---
Exactly, and why is nobody mentioning that in New Vegas, the game that originated weapons mods, this was no issue?
---
Those heal too much rads.
---
Search “where to get robot armor plans not asking showing”. I have the post marked but don’t know how to link it.
---
Also up the hill at Billings Homestead! :)
---
Agreed. Disappointing dud of a game unfortunately.
---
Dont listen to this buffoon. Rad-X and +25 rad resist armor if its been fixed yet. Also some perks allow give radiation boosts
---
I'm not home, so I can't check rn. But do you know if pa has mods I can apply that positively affect a build like ours?
---
Talk about grizzly advertising.
---
Most of those posts are people shitting on it and barely playing it anymore tho. This game is pretty dead right now save for some die hards. The subscription kicked up dust for a minute but then multiplayer gamers went to CoD and RPG gamers went to Outer Worlds and you probably won’t see them back until Wastelanders
---
how much are you offering?
---
Fine by me, just refund everyone and cut your losses ala Epic’s Paragon
---
Why not both ? I mean giving a free bunker or player home to everyone would be a great way to apologize for the Fo1st controversy. 
---
Concerning new players homes, I think that the Watoga Estates would fit, with its practicly untouched buildings. You could be instanced into your new player home and be able to build inside. That could also come with a few display racks that are already there and takes no budget, to display your weapons. 
---
Idk just some random ideas
---
I wish diluted radaway was a bit weaker. I'm always surprised at how much it actually heals, even without perks that positively affect it.
---
The only thing i want to correct is to please specify BGS Austin. When you just say Bethesda, most peoples minds will default to Todds team and there are 3 Bethesda companies under Zenimax control all doing very different things. While Todds team helped make the original game a lot, all problems and decisions post launch is being made by BGS Austin (formerly Battlecry Studios). Focus the outrage on who's actually doing the bullshit, dont blame their older sibling.
---
Whitespring, burrows, Charleston capital building for ghouls. West Tek and isolated array for super mutants, SBQ fights for scorched, just tag everything. All high lvl, all with many mobs. Do all of this while well rested, cranberry relished, boiled scorchbeast brained, mentatsed, leader bobbled, in a group with inspirational 3.
---
Cool never noticed this.
---
A wendigo eyeballs you hungrily....
---
technically a fort
---
I guess I'm lucky it's double exp weekend then, maybe shift my perks and specials around a bit.
---
Rockstar is probably the best single player dev in the business. Tho I love them both, RDR 2 is somehow a better RPG than FO4 imo. However comma both R* and Bethesda are dumpster fires at multiplayer lmao
---
We already have Fallout 4. Never really Dove into to the mods. But the outer worlds does look pretty good. We don't have to play together. might look into those
---
It seems you are right, but let's keep it polite anyway. You can't expect everyone to know everything, and he was just trying to help, just like you.
---
just like GTA O? KEKW
---
And with all that rockstar still out performs Beth. And at lease they don't nickel and dime you to death. Charging for basic things like private servers. 
---
GTA has been running for how long. Still got free dlc and content. So Yeah, don't compare the 2. Beth is a pile of shit compared to just about anyone else.
---
Don't care, i'll probably keep on playing considering the fubar'd situation with "everything".
---
lmao this sub is such a fucking circlejerk
---
I think TOW is one of the worst RPGs I have ever played. The developers took shortcuts where we should have depth. While I'm not surprised this was launched as a $60 product, please consider trying it with a Microsoft Game Pass for $1 this month before you buy.   
---
   
---
Don't get me wrong, we need more games like The Outer Worlds. We need a champion in a time where game developers are bound by producers interested in nothing more than the shortest path to profit. For the past 5 or so years we've been abused by early access titles and micro-transaction laden games to the point where anything other than that is seen as a diamond in the rough.   
---
However, this game cannot be my champion. The Outer Worlds is one of the most simplified RPG experiences I have ever had. Beyond the extra dialogue options you get for pushing the correct arrows on the 8 or so starting stats, what does this game offer? I can certainly say it doesn't do anything cutting edge... but that's not always necessary. We can't expect to revolutionize features for a genre every year. However, can we at least expect the game to not take steps backwards in features and depth?   
---
Here's a quick list of what I see as the biggest problems with the game.   
---
1. Too many static items in the game environment that should be lootable. I'm doing a melee playthrough, I walk into a hospital bay and see a giant surgical saw.... and it's a static item. I'm not asking to be able to make a spoon collection, but I think a happy medium can exist between everything being lootable, and almost nothing being lootable. Right now it seems like way too much stuff is bolted to the ground.   
---
2. Player equipment limited to two slots - Head, Body. Puts a huge damper on customization. Where are my legendary rings? Where's my bracers that allow me to block attacks with my fists? Where are my gloves of stability for long range weapons?   
---
3. "Instance" style mapping excuse for lazy game world. Simply put, the planetary exploration teleportation is awful for an RPG. No world has been built for players to explore. What you get is a bunch of map fragments to teleport back and forth to chasing down quests. Legendary enemies are not discovered, they are encountered on the linear beaten path every one of us will be forced to take. This is very much the "Dark Souls 2" bonfire teleporting system that was a downgrade from the previous version of the game.   
---
4. Perks tree is a \*\*\*\* of flat % upgrades. Move % faster, gain % health... I could have designed the perks trees in one afternoon in a boardroom with 3 people. Where's my blood mess? Where are my unique perks that make my build differ from everyone else?   
---
5. Simplified hacking, simplified lockpicking, simplified terminal interactions. Simplified weapon types, simplified ammunition types. All of the mini-games have been turned into "Press the action button"   
---
All of these concerns yell at me "shortucts" forced on developers by production. I don't see the depth we have come to expect from the traditional RPG genre. I don't see character development that's going to differ or be unique, the perks that are worth taking are obvious. In the coming weeks, I think you are all going to discover this experience is lacking significantly in uniqueness. We are all going to end up with the same perks because a very limited set are actually good. We are all going to have the exact same enemy experiences, because the maps are linear.   
---
With all that said, if you are enjoying the game please don't let me rain on your parade. I don't plan on hanging around this community for X weeks after launch to tell everyone to stop enjoying the game. Hell maybe it's just me. I see ZERO other posts on the front page criticizing the game... maybe I'm crazy
---
I didn't get you three comments deleted.  You did that all by yourself because they were against both the sub and Reddit rules - not to mention childishly stupid.  You need to take some responsibility for your actions.  If you don't have the maturity and mentality to apologies when you do something wrong then at the very least have the balls to own up to what you do.
---
You might have a disease or you could be starving or dehydrated
---
+1, indeed.
---
we shouldn't
---
Its cool either way.
---
iirc....look at the color of the stripe on the tail fin.  That’s the color wire you cut.
---
I stopped playing until wastelanders to see how bad things get. Not sure if I'll even come back then.
---
Well, that's stupid. They nerfed it to where it's completely unusable, even with a bloodied build boosting to max damage.
---
I like the idea, but the caps cost should be way way higher, caps are practically free in this game and are worthless, as for flux, people 'farm' these 🙄 in huge quantities so again the flux cost should be massive.
---
Make this legendary system worth something and cost time a resources. Everything is better if it takes time and effort to obtain.
---
But I really like the idea, nice one 👍
---
What's the dmg rating on this?
---
Deathclaws are not so cooperative sometimes :(
---
🙄
---
Because people like to vent their frustration...
---
Where else can people vent their frustration with Fallout 76?
---
 Thanks
---
Outer world's is great, I just finished it a few days ago and want to build a 2nd character. I just started rage 2 on Xbox game pass and that game is pretty good so far
---
You're so brave.
---
'Free' content with FO1st sub.
---
Take a photo of their dead body.
---
If you get the Well Fed buff from eating, when it goes away you'll lose the +50hp or whatever it is. Can kill you if your not careful. Could be that.
---
Yeah that or use radshield. That helps, especially in queen fights. You can get up close and she won't do much damage with her rads. I usually use PA you will lose a few stats but it doesn't break the build too much, it just takes time to get used to muscle memory for stims and what not
---
After your food bar drops below 80% you will lose 25hp (50hp if you are using rejuvenated perk).
---
The model you're describing doesn't bother me.
---
I like crowdsourcing, what's wrong with that? It's an effective model that I prefer.
---
I’ve found all of them but it won’t tell me I completed it
---
I never said he couldn't enjoy it. In fact, I specifically told him he CAN enjoy the game...
---
Clothing has a 20% chance to spawn, and when it does, I'm pretty sure it won't change until the server gets recycled. If it rolls for "no spawn", it may or may not re-roll for another chance after you relog. I think someone said it recycles 10 minutes after the server owner logs out; not sure about that.
---
I specifically said he can enjoy the game... You're doing the same thing he's doing, mixing liking a game and thinking it's good. They're two different things.
---
Inversely, one person saying a game is bad doesn't make it bad. No matter how many times they repeat what everyone else in the local youtuber chat room is saying
---
But we have to keep the obsidian good, bethesda bad narrative going.
---
For me, it's a 7/10 if all the technical problems I've mentioned were fixed. In it's current state, it's an easy 3/10.
---
I really was the last one online last night. There was no one else on the server.
---
There are always going to be "highly-requested features" that never get put into a game. This happens with every game that has ever existed. And even if they did put them in, you'd see a dozen more "highly-requested features" the next day. We all have things we wish were in the game, but most of them are fairly minor and don't really need to be in the game and claiming that they are "absent" is going overboard. There are plenty of "features" I see people mention that they want in this game that would actively make aspects of the game worse or are so minor and specific that they would change nothing about the game for a majority of players. And people act like all these things would take no time or resources to make. Sure, some might be easier than others, but they have internal milestones and schedules, they can't just take every armchair designer's idea and churn them out while still doing the work they planned to do. That's why the extra shit that gets suggested ends up showing up in the Atom Shop or or bundled into a membership. It's shit they didn't plan to do, either now or ever, but had to reallocate time and people to add in because the demand got so high.
---
Personally, I think that Bethesda dug themselves into a hole by jumping the gun and releasing the game in the buggy state it was in as a full $60 title. If they had sold it as a $30 Early Access game, I think expectations would have been lowered, and people would have weathered the issues more easily. But right now they are in the bad position of trying to come up from behind.
---
Does it count?
---
OMG, I was deceived by myself this whole time?
---
Thanks! S2, really. I'll try that.
---
Yes, that's why I though about scripts too. I thought that caps are not used just for this and if you passed the 50% probability to success and Apply a random perk, the opportunity to get exactly what you wantis drastically reduced so we should try lot and lot and lot of times before find something really good. Anyway yes my payment system was just an example and probably we should pay more caps. Thank you really
---
The same bonus health can give you constant health regeneration when you run bloodied, only Bethesda can fully explain how bonus hp works in this game and why. In the mean time you can check what I was able to discover from testing it in game: https://youtu.be/-W1DPhUCRpQ
---
I reinstalled this game about a month ago and as soon as i load in my head was missing and whenever I sat my power armor down it would just disappear into the abyss. I promptly uninstalled.
---
I agree, its good but not worth 60 dollars , the planet's feel empty all the companions and boring when comparing them to other games by obsidian (fallout new vegas) and yes you can replay and get different endings but in reality there's maybe 2 actually different endings ? I did enjoy the game but overall ive spent way more time on 76 than the outerworlds , and past all the bugs and shit woudknt the game i spent 400 hours on be a better deal than the one,i spent 24 hours on ?
---
leave nothing but footprints.  or else!
---
Ah! Great question. Emergency Protocols is a torso mod that increases speed and *halves* incoming damage  when below 20% health. If you equip Fireproof in Endurance scorchbeast sonic attacks won't do anything. My only challenge in PA is poison attacks.
---
if all else fails just jump in some water and wait
---
If you need your lmg primed i could help you out. I farmed the plans untill i found them in a vendor haha , but yeah ive noticed too everyone a scorchbeast appears its usually legendary
---
No problem, will be interesting to see if you get a response from the ticket.
---
And yet its STILL more rpg and still better then what Fallout's become. I miss the good old Fallout games.
---
What vendors sell them?
---
Player vendor , no real vendor sells them
---
Ok
---
I'll let you know, I'm really hoping
---
All good points except the final snarky sentence was a bit snarky 😎
---
This thread gives me hope for this community. I thought people here liked the Atomic Shop.
---
borderlands co op is what my wife and I like to play together.
---
Yes, Xbox and PS4.
---
thanks I wasn't sure about rage 2 but I'mma check it out
---
It's like 8 or 10 per hour, but it only holds 2 or 3 at a time. So you have to come back every 15 minutes for them like other resource extractors
---
I’d say £30 is fair for outer worlds. Would never in my right mind pay £60 for it. Just like I wouldn’t even pay £60 for FO76. Got it for £9 that seemed fair to me.
---
FO4 is infinitely better than TOW, that's a fact, not an opinion.
---
Do you know a good way to get them to land? Me and a friend went to try and farm some yesterday but about 4 in a row wouldn’t land at all so I had to take it out in the air... my friend is a melee character so had to use one of my weapons to damage them I heard something about damaging the wings on them but can’t seem to get hits to register on the wings
---
Looks like the Pentagon
---
You don't have to miss them, you can enjoy them all from FO1 and on.
---
Your friend did more than What he said
---
Ive played both extensively. 4 is very watered down. It is not a fact that its better. Its your OPINION. Grow up.
---
I feel like I've been hearing this....I don't think it's entirely accurate
---
Also this isn't really related to FO76 you bitch ass nigga.
---
Don't forget to feed the router gerbils for that huge download 😜
---
I love TOW but hard to disagree with a lot you just said. I do genuinely think its a great game to play but could do with A LOT more. But tbh, after the FO4 let down, FO76's poor execution, I really felt like a nice simple RPG did the trick. At the end of the day, it was a fun game to play. I'd say a solid starting point, hopefully they can use it as a foundation to make it something a lot more. 
---
I really liked AC: Origins, making it way more RPG like than previous AC titles. It's both a brilliant game and a decent RPG-esque game. As for Outer Worlds, as a game, it's great, fun to play and not alot to bog you down in terms of time wasting game features. But as an RPG, it is rather lacking. 
---
Idk what it is though, just really enjoyed it. A shame there isn't more. Fingers crossed for some good DLC's and in future a more developed sequel. 
---
P.S, was gutted I didn't get to fly around in space :(
---
ooh I don't know if it was a glitch or not but last time I went to the barrows in Harper's Ferry when it was nuked.  there was no radiation in the barrows.  enemies ranked up and glowing but I wasn't taking any rads.  hope this wasn't just a one time thing and it helps you out
---
Yeah but I have high doubts they would even add them, at least any time soon.
---
Yes it counts haha.
---
Yes ik. Lol thank god ill be the only one home
---
Zenimax wants to be Activision.
---
I meant I miss the joy of a new Fallout that's actually a Fallout. I forgot the people here can only take things in the most literal sense. Lol. Say "I miss ther good old fallout games" anywhere else and they know what you mean.
---
we're on our private servers
---
There's literally a method that will result in other players being banned. Not hard to do either. Luckily not many people know about it, but you can literally make other players get detected by their auto ban.
---
yeah but you all keep playing, and keep buying because some of you enjoy it. 
---
which is fine. but it's also like having a big mac hours before a wagyu steak dinner. 
---
sure a big mac is a tasty, but now you just ruined your 500 dollar wagyu dinner because you just couldn't wait a few more hours for an incredible meal. 
---
Bethesda knows now it can just keep feeding you cheap trash and you'll eat it up so there's no point of going through the trouble of preparing a gourmet meal, your standards have lowered, so accordingly, so have theirs. 
---
So in conclusion, enjoy your Extra Value Bethesda titles going forward. 
---
fries and coke available as optional 'upgrades' in the atomic shop.
---
Your whole existence on reddit is pathetic from what you say to people with comments like this constant shit overflowing from your mouth you’re a sad miserable fuck with a shitty life and it’s easy to tell like I said with how you talk it relates to outer worlds fallout 76 because it’s the classic Bethesda vs Obsidian fight of who has the bigger dick or doesn’t
---
I agree that depending what avenue of purchase you went down, FO76 is the better deal for $60 For the time you spend in it. On the other hand most of that time is grind. FO76 had multiple teams working on it, assumingly far more budget and production time and yet. It launched with far more bugs and broken features than I've ever seen in any game ever. Still I've spend 1600 hours grinding away and don't regret it. TOW succeeded to do what it aimed to do whereas F076 did not unfortunately.
---
Not in pvp at least
---
Wish I had a two shot
---
There are two fallout subreddits that are opposite of there - this one and r/fallout.
---
Both are exact opposites - toxic shitholes with people looking for something and everything to complain about.  
---
What more do you want?  A third toxic shithole of a subreddit?
---
Lol, you're kidding me. That's beyond sad, but also completely believable because of Bethesda.
---
I especially like the new exploit that allows you to cancel memberships, refund games, etc. They are just really bad on PC.
---
306 listed on my semi auto handmade. Does actual damage around 700 on regular enemies
---
Thanks. I will wait if Wastlanders can lure my friend back.
---
lol i'd love to hear more about your facts more often then, they seem fun enough
---
i'd say they are both 8-9/10s btw
---
I used to just do a glitch that made me immune to radiation. Then run around as usual
---
Fatmans are underwhelming.
---
I'm curious as to why mine is so low then.  I know the assualt rifle is less damage, but it's not half damage
---
I ply it because it's fallout, not because of Bethesda. (So I wouldn't say I'm a fan of them, but of the series.) 
---
I'm fine with the offer. I played some weeks without 1st, after it was released, and didn't miss anything from the game I got before. They just offer new options for a subscription, like many games. I could easily go on playing without it and I will when I have less time to play.
---
I think for example EA is even more insolent with their payment models.
---
They are also working on bugs and add new content. Well, they could be faster, but I'd say 'blame it on capitalism, not on Bethesda'.. also, since I played other fallouts, I'm used to long waiting times for bug fixes, if they ever get fixed. It's the same with other game developers.
---
Having a rough saturday mate?
---
You are using your weapon in nerd rage range plus adrenal reaction mutation? And are the perk cards the right one? I know they sound stupid questions but that damage does seem a little low, right now i cant remember but i swear ive seen my assault rifle get up to something like 280 with commando build, need to check to be totally sure
---
The Fat man should have a small OHKO radius where the mini nuke hits tbh.
---
Please, do tell!
---
Wasteland 3, May 2020 my man. Also have you checked out ATOM RPG?
---
When this happens it's because the server is going to shut down soon so they stop letting people spawn into the world.
---
I Run a bloodied auto assault rifle with 25% ffr, non explosive. In vats I hit for 1200+ dmg consistently with the right perks and mutations.
---
Nah i’m doing great just someone throwing the softer version of the n word around at op because he thinks the outer worlds has nothing to do with fallout 76
---
It can be directly related to your armor and perk cards. Guessing that you are running unyielding? Health at &lt;20 with nerd rage? Commando cards all on? Max level rifle? I run a bffr handmade that while technically it does a little less damage per shot than my BE handmade, it is absolutely waaay more powerful in terms of DPS.
---
I am below 20% health, bloody mess, nerd rage and I think 8 rifleman ranks. I've never picked up a bloodied AR so idk... But handmade and fixers are pretty high damage rifles. I wanna say my combat rifle is listed around 230s
---
Yes. Only certain weapons though.
---
Green Thumb doesn't appear to affect challenges.
---
Also adrenal reaction mutation. I'm trying to think if you're maybe missing a dmg boost
---
Meltdown can’t be done novice solo with out some cheap PA door blocking
---
My experience is that it doesn't matter in VATS.
---
If you're trying to get Bethesda to listen to you through customer support, you're gonna have a bad time.
---
Bloodied hits for ~10k, give or take. Two shot hits for about 8k.
---
Yup yup and yup!
---
Take a look at my link - isnt that enough to pull it off?
---
Even with demotion expert and bloodied wouldn’t it be doing thousands of damage already?
---
Really? This is nice, just because of this comment, I'll launch my nuke on harpers ferry when I get home. And if I remember to, I'll post here how it went. Thanks!
---
Well yes, but actually no.
---
No. The person killed becomes invincible
---
awesome, and good hunting
---
It’s gotten worse in my opinion than months ago
---
Have you got the weapon equipped? The damage boosts might not show if not.
---
Ok. Thanks I will try that
---
I have all nine rifleman perks and everything else is the same
---
I still don't have the keg. I have up after a couple months of grinding.
---
Maybe he's black or isn't from states? You know, back in my home country, we have this debate that should we use the older word that was used for centuries for black people or just force the literal translation, "black people" into our language? The thing is tho, my ancestors never enslaved black people en masse but that old word still sounds derogatory coz its like full of hard syllables if you know what I mean - it sounds hateful, but it actually isn't. Same with spanish word for black. 
---
Just food for tought🤔
---
Lol that’s a first for me as well
---
Outer worlds is a double A game... not triple A like 76.. and from a smaller company. Yet it still manages to do things better than 76 in some aspects
---
Yes. It's the only one I carry around at the moment
---
It’s not foolproof, but Scorched usually spawn as minions when you attack a scorchbeast.  If you kill them all, the scorchbeast will land to engage you in melee.  Wide open fields are ideal, because trees, buildings and uneven terrain will block their landing pattern.  If you can drag the fight to a road or field, that’s your best bet.
---
AAFFR or BFFR shouldn't be too hard to trade for. Post on a trade sub. Explosive doesn't exist on plasma rifles/pistols
---
What's it say in your pipboy?
---
Same goes for the "Well Traveled" pipboy skin. Been trying to read every sticker on there.
---
You're proving his point.
---
Dang, that indeed seems low, the receiver is the best one you can get right?
---
Powerful automatic
---
I'm not sure brother, something sounds way off, is AR automatic maybe?
---
Wtf does that have to do with the watchability of your gameplay? Absolutely nothing. Get over yourself...
---
Bloodied with all the fixings at 19% HP is something like 3.24x your damage. Stealth commando with covert operative and mister sandman is 3.5-3.75x your damage. It is normal to be able to outdamage run and gun bloodied builds. When you marry the two builds, you get something truly disgusting.
---
It is but I run the commando perks
---
That might be the mistake then? Ive read you have 9 rifleman perks on another answer, auto receiver needs commando perk cards
---
&gt;But now, a year later, [I don’t have any hope left.](https://youtu.be/Uo2NIV3IrMY?t=125)
---
Fittingly, from a game by Obsidian.
---
I love Fallout 4 immensely and still play it all the time but I've just started Outer Worlds and the storytelling and roleplaying is already leagues better. It's not sufficient to say that 4 is a different type of game because it's not really, there are fundamental things that should hve been included.
---
He misses good fallouts, i do too, and some good fallouts are isometric and have games inspired by them (yeah yeah but wasteland 2 thus 3 would have never been made if it wasn't for fallout) coming out soon or recently came out. Am I missing something here man lemme read the comments again
---
I just did the same thing!! 
---
In all my fallout games, I just head outside and ignore all the cues to go on this quest or that quest. 
---
So here I am, level 80 (after like a YEAR of playing) and I like this Mistress of Mysteries back story, so I figure I’ll do some of it. 
---
Finished the entire quest and had a blast!! I loved it! Great story... fun toys to play with...
---
Now I’m going through Rose’s Raiders, and it is proving to be fun, too. Mostly due to the dialog, but I’m enjoying it as well...
---
&gt; Bethesda isn't interested in what you want, unless there's a way to sell it to you.
---
You nailed it right there.
---
What happened when you cut the wrong one?
---
It's not a good weapon for PVP because of its weight ammo and low DPS but it's a fantastic weapon to mess around with.
---
No its completely believable, hell i enjoyed this game a bit for some time
---
But as alot of people have been saying and showing, bethesda is being really scummy; From the horrid state this game launched in to shit buisness practices like releasing a broken subscription on a barren and still broken game.
---
I dont dislike this game but i dont exactly like it either, im just dissapointed in bethesda, a company i loved go down the fucking gutter of controversy but still have "loyal" fans after everything they caused for themselves and for the fans
---
I dont care if you do like this game or not, im not gonna go out of my way to to actively shit on people that somehow really enjoy this game, what i say doesnt impact what you enjoy (its what bethesda does that should). 
---
But i will always remain surprised at how people still actively support this game after everything thats happened
---
And dont worry about the downvotes or upvotes, they're just numbers from random strangers and have no impact on this convo
---
Shit idk unless it's level 20 rifle or something heh
---
I gladly paid 60 for a finished product.
---
Guess what game I'm talking about.
---
Lmao this is perfect!
---
It's a decent game, 6 or7/10 for me. Biggest disappointment was the story. It really left me cold. Doesn't hold a candle to the writing in games like Witcher 3 or NieR: Automata.
---
I meant commando (was trying to get across that I had 9 points in the damage perks). Sorry for the confusion.
---
Would also be nice to get a Capital Wasteland or Mojave Nuka Cola Machine as a vendor machine. Maybe even a "Nuka Nut" bundle or even seeing Vim and Sunset Sarsaparilla making their way over. Some might ask, how could Sunset come over, it is a west coast brand. Well think of it like this. There could be a new interior involving items sent by the owner's relative who operates out of the west coast. Maybe it is their way of still getting that west coast taste still on the each coast. I could also see some corporate espionage mini quest to get both a sunset sarsaparilla and Nuka cola recipe that would cost a bottle cap and either empty Nuka cola or empty bottle to make (in addition to the purified or boiled water, syrup, sugar, etc).
---
As for Vim, I mean we DO have advertisement for it in the camp items and we are close enough where there could be some trickling into the Appalachia market.
---
;)
---
How about we first make the glass in the existing display casts less opaque? 😂
---
No probs! I honestly have no idea.. Whats your platform?
---
The instant they didn't treat the beta like a real beta and released the game very shortly after, I knew it was a lost cause.  That was the moment they decided it was just going to be a money grab and nothing more.  It's a top down management problem, unfortunately.  It's also kind of the modern business of video games.  The sad part is the game could be a lot better and the company could make a LOT more money.  But... it's about short term gains and quantity over quality.  It's get this out for the holiday season and on to the next project.  From a business standpoint it was a good decision.  The game, as is with the vision and scope mapped out originally, it was only going to be so good.  And that alone was fine.  They should have just released the game as is with no promise of future improvements or evolution.  It would have went over better and expectations would have been appropriate.  Instead we were strung along with false promises.  That could have been ok, if this game has top down backing and full development support to actually do big things.  That's just not the case. It's not the really of business.  The blueprint of this game was flawed from the start, can and it lacked the scope and vision to make it truly special and a proper system for a reliable monetary business model.  The best approach was and still is to just leave it be, can move the developers to other projects, and let it run out. It made some money, and that's ok.  Unless they are willing to revamp the game fundamentally, as in take it down and rework the whole thing, they can not get to their desired end goal.  They're just better off testing a new blueprint with a new game instead to reach that same endpoint.  Well...not really.  They already have the design, content, and coding already done in this, so it's still much faster and easier to rework this protect into a new blueprint instead, but it does mean no new sales on existing customers.  This should be ok though as most revenue will not come from the original sale but rather purchaseables.  I like to reference games like LOL for this because they are very literally raking in a billion dollars a year on this, and there is VASTLY less marketable and customizable content in that game.  FO has characters, weapons, armor, building, and creates all that can allow such things.  It just doesn't have the right blueprint to pull people in, have people say, and willing to invest long term into the game for, say, the next decade.  The sad part is I don't think they're far off from having something that could achieve this.  However, they are unwilling to invest in and evolve this product to get there.  They have customers telling them everything they need to do and have generations of pervious games that have been modded to the Moon showing them exactly the things people want in the game.  They have many other games that are great references if proven blueprints that they can learn from and incorporate.  It's all there.  It just requires listening and action.
---
On Xbox it happens once every few hours of okay which is bad. Crashes during stupid things too, like trying to open the pipboy or during reload animation but more often it happens during the load screen into nuclear winter for me and my friends
---
I’d accept that too
---
For my gauntlet character, I use a hazmat suit. Power armor is obviously not an option.  If you build for stealth, you can sneak attack easily.
---
For my rifleman, I typically use a hazmat suit, but also have X-01 for those times that someone launches dead center on fissure prime.  I hate being in power armor because stealth perks are disabled, but I can still plink away and contribute to a team effort.
---
I actually starting designing my build around this quest and the equipment you get as soon as I finished the questline! I will definitely check out your guide there.
---
Kind of like how everyone who dislikes the game is just riding the "youtube hate train" right?
---
I build camps so i buy atom shop stuff. But thats just me.
---
Wanna hear the best part of it though? Report it, and you're likely signing up for a ban, since it uses a third party program. Now, it was never intended to get people banned (designed for other stuff), but if you use it the wrong way, you can ban any player even though they did nothing wrong. I get that using third party stuff is bad and all, but with Bethesdas level of anti cheat it just goes to show what you could do with I'll intentions.
---
Nice.
---
PC
---
I played hundreds of hours mostly solo, but recently teamed up with a random extrovert. We're a team of four or five who do events together, but often run around doing our own tasks like camp management and quest things. Being on a team has added a great amount of fun to the game.
---
They patched it out a month or so ago. Sadly. Fun while it lasted though
---
I would argue that a lot of that resembles the original Fallouts, though.  You couldn't loot everything under the sun in those games.  Equipment customization was very limited.  Even New Vegas was quite linear... or at the very least, it didn't leverage the open world aspect very well.
---
Obsidian made the game they wanted to make.  The real question is whether or not that style is still relevant in 2019.
---
I use to run around in pvp with by bloodied vats crit faster reload one lol. One shot people. Now I just equip it to remember...😢
---
If you can get a marsupial mutation/serum, you can just jump up onto the wall on the right side of the room as you walk in through the big doorway opening and just hang out there tagging stuff with no danger of being hit by the ghouls. It's a great low level tactic for leveling quickly and safely there.
---
I joined that event this morning and did just that, level 90+ though, and everybody had the same idea to farm the event and rarely kicked on the jukebox. We all ended up with a bunch of XP, junk, chems,   and a half dozen or so legendaries.  It's a very fruitful event if you don't rush it.
---
Is your build without PA? If so, would you mind sharing it?
---
Damn, was going to suggest we meet up and open trade, that way i could see the damage on the weapon without equipping it, im on ps4 :/ one thing im sure is that it is not right, without equipping my handmade (so without the bloodied effect on) i have 207 dmg, only with commando and nerd rage..
---
Did you post this in the correct sub? The only thing about Fo76 is your title.
---
It's quite simply described as a project you didn't really want to pursue but felt pressured by the market.
---
Buy amateur dev studio at low price, give them your project to work on, see it failing as you never even tried, try to milk as much money as you're able to on its last days, lay off the new studio as 'it' failed your expectations, declare genre XY as not profitable enough to keep working on it (in this case 'multiplayer' Fallout), Voila!
---
To be fair, OW is 25-30 hours. I don't know about you, but I've been playing FO76 for a year, whereas I'll be finished OW this week, 3 weeks after I started playing it.
---
Harper’s Ferry really isn’t a lucrative nuke, unless you’re looking for flux.  Unless you’re nuking a private server, you’re going to be competing with a bunch of players to get hits on a couple dozen enemies. I don’t find it fun.
---
If you really want to set it on fire, check to be sure it’s full of ghouls and mutants first. Scorched tend to be light on legendaries.
---
I think a majority of those ppl currently playing are still playing it because they bought the deluxe super mega awesome edition w the duffel bag and bought all the duped gear on eBay that they would rather live in a world where this game is actually fun instead of admitting that they made a bad investment.  I got one really really good lever action and I had Sooooo much fun w the game.. Then the endgame.. Then nothing.. Then nothing.... followed by more nothing.. I love the idea of this game, now it's just a bloated money grab scheme.. This sounds dirk but when I'm at work I day dream about how this game could have gone. Mutation skill trees kinda like a classification; extra arms to carry more/carry multiple weapons, extra legs to ruin fast an jump higher, or a mega brain type that.. Idk.. It's done. Bye bathesda
---
I think the rifle is listed at 270ish dmg in the pip boy. I can't remember exactly but it's less than 300
---
Agreed. Big fan of the USA but a little more personalisation is all a Scot needs :)
---
I play solo but I mainly play In team bc it’s more fun and we all share heavy gunner perks
---
This is making me crazy lol. I just spent like 15 levels of swapping points around.
---
I'm just trying to get mine over 200 lol.
---
You can find Aster around the pond in front of Lucky Hole Mine and the surrounding area.
---
It’s really crazy especially if you put everything together and some chems on top, with my bloodied ffr fixer i was able to solo SBQ in less then 2 minutes, here’s my build if you didn’t saw it yet: https://youtu.be/NOWZtRW1oyI
---
Also not playing is protesting
---
Not a glitch
---
What do you think is a good trade for it I mostly have caps
---
And yet people keep being really unhappy about it.
---
I still find it highly coincidental how they fucked up bigtime with the new subscription instead of Wastelanders release right before release of Outer Worlds...
---
someone who made that decision at Beth HQ knew what they were doing or was just actually even too incompetent to know what the competition is doing
---
Listening and doing what you ask are two different things. My parents would always listen to me and then tell me to clean my room or I wasn't going out until it was finished. But they always listened.
---
And allow everyone to actually break the glass and take whatever is inside 😅
---
Radx diluted + radshield + glowing blood makes it only 6 rads per second
---
Haha this is eerily similar to how I approach every Bethesda game too - strangely enough Rose's quest is the only other one I've finished too!
---
I found the LMG prime plan in somebody's vendor so keep an eye out at player camps too.
---
I mostly play solo unless my brother is online.  I wouldn’t mind playing in teams, it’s just that I’m not online consistently enough to continually play with people.
---
I'm not that crazy about the Legendary Scorchbeasts, solely from the standpoint that I think they have too much HP when you account for their recharge.  I would have liked to see general Scorchbeast HP taken down to maybe 75%-80% of what it previously was, so their Legendary versions were a bit less tanky.
---
Perhaps in return, you bring back how aggressive their attacks used to be.  Because right now, they aren't difficult to fight... they are just annoying bullet sponges.
---
Idk if 40 hours of “good” rpg is better than 1200 hours of “okay” rpg. At least in my case. 
---
I was infinitely hyped for OW, but after beating it once I haven’t had the desire to go back in for more. I feel like it ended up being the perfect getaway from 76 so I’d be less burnt out on it. I was honestly hoping OW would carry me through the rest of the year, but it looks like Modern Warfare will have to do it.
---
yeah I'm with you on that, it sounded pretty good at first "Hey guys we're delaying Wastelanders to give it a bit more polish...bla bla bla"..."but in the meantime look here have a shitty subscription service so we can get more of your money for next to no content"
---
I had abandoned EarlyAccess games on Steam with more content than this
---
Awww I thought the same at first, but kinda grew to like it. Despite the giant clown collar.
---
If you don't mind encountering a few mirelurks/hunters and their queen, Mac's Farm has a boatload of cranberries. Some literally in a boat, but much more actually growing in the pond. Aaronholdt Homestead has less, but the enemies are vastly easier.
---
There's no point in farming a ton of them, though, since cranberry relish spoils within a few hours.  You will also need gourds, which you can find in planters in Raleigh Clay's bunker. Gourds can be planted at your camp, but not the cranberries.
---
Your turn in will consume them all
---
oh boohoo
---
Thanks for the advice fam
---
Nope it must be patched, bcos I just turned it in and i have 39 of them now.
---
I am not able to turn the rest in, even after server hop. 
---
Probably bugged even more
---
thanks for the confirm
---
I'll sometimes do it with people I know, but it represents probably 5% of my time with the game, at best.
---
Thank you both for clarifying. My proud build uses the cooking fire glitch to get inside an overpass. Once there I filled the space with foundationless curved walls that aligned “perfectly” with the edge of non-space creating a seamless underground lair. I then aligned a dome door into it that has an open view into the glitched landscape. 
---
When you move around, the elements flash in and out of existence. It looks like the description from HG Wells book The Time Machine. Hopefully I’ll never have to move it because it took almost a week to get it right. So I can appreciate the tedium of a good build. It’s the main reason I play FO76. 
---
On that note, may I have your blessing to try my hand at a ship? I have an idea for other uses of rigging but I’d need practice doing it. (I’m on PC.)
---
If they listened to feedback we would have had Fallout 5 instead we have a MMO called Fallout 76. Enough said!
---
Oh wow I did the exact same thing! Immediate gender swap and changed my planned build to suit the gadgets you get too. 
---
Always prefer approaching the gameplay from some kind of rp standpoint and this was an obvious choice.
---
is that what it was? i thought i stubbed my toe
---
Any time you gain or lose health or endurance from a buff or armor, your health recalculates. If your health is low enough, it can kill you or take you to one health.
---
That doesn't really make sense. Nobody knew about fo76 being an mmo until it was almost released. How would community feedback after fo76's announcement change the entire game?
---
I don’t get any lag on Xbox when I use my strangler power armor. Haven’t noticed any lag since I got it really.
---
Insta-wanted status?
---
Good point, I was generalizing to avoid dwelling on the subject. I shouldn't have aimed it at them guys though, my bad!
---
Depends on how many stars and what effects it is but more than 30k for the top tier ones
---
I don't think the quest properly consumes the Technical Data - hasn't for months.  You end up with a lot of junk that you can't turn in anymore.
---
My husband and I play together and we see a few other duos out there. Four person teams seem to mainly meet up at camp and for major events.
---
Lol you tryed messin with my post so let me set you straight your immaturity to try and mess with other peoples post ends up with people screwin with you in front of everyone such as calling you dumb lol thats why you an idiot lol and ill keep on callin you one...sorry to embarrass you when it was public lol. Maybe if you want to trash talk do it in real life not behing a screen lol chump.
---
And yet there are still people who viciously defend this game like "I mEt mY nEw bEsTfRiEnD oN hErE sO 76 iS GrEaT GeAm good jOb bEtHeSdA" or "MaN tHiS gAmE Is sO GoOd AlL tHe nEgAtIvE CoMeNtS aRe FrOm bLinD HaTeRs wHo jUsT WaTcH yOuTuBeRs". All the hate Bethesda gets is well deserved and I really hope all these Bethesda fanboys wake up and smell the ashes from this dumpster fire and realise Bethesda arnt their friends but their predators. 
---
76 is a direct case of customer abuse. Fuck me Australia got them to admit they lied about what they sold but nope, still blind followers who say how great this godforsaken and pitiful excuse for a fallout game is.
---
that's their usual business and how you know they know they fucked up but play the "and what are you going to do 'bout it?" card, they release something shady fully knowing what they're doing and then go radio silent in hopes players will shortly after forget about it and they can continue with their "We'll let the last developer on this game know what he knows anyway since he writes that code but gets told to ignore and ship it"
---
They changed the quest
---
It only becomes active when you loot a new technical data so all old ones are basically useless
---
Maybe Tenderizer rank 1 for the extra 5% damage,  but I think everything is already solid
---
I usually play with myself.
---
Ive thought this too! 
---
To bad if they implemented it, it would be for Fallout1st members only.
---
The point being that nobody who played past Fallout games wanted a Fallout mmo game.
---
I have a perk for my heavy gunner that occasionally cripples them
---
That was insane. I do around 350-400 damage a shot depending on what I'm shooting (non-headshots)  you were doing almost 10 times that amount. Something is off.
---
I just want either a anti armor or bloodied ill be fine with a one star
---
almost always
---
Lvl 50 😕
---
Yeah I'm sorry for being bitchy. 
---
I don't especially like Bethesda anymore. But I'm still enjoying the crap out of this gane.
---
GTA and RDR2 are very sparse in the world details   You're not going to notice a flower as you blow past it a 60 mph.
---
I’ve been using the strangle power armor for over a month on Xbox and I don’t get any lag or freezes. My frame rate doesn’t even drop.
---
I need a right arm but everything else is. I cant imagine any points boosting damage for rifles that much though?
---
Eh
---
I have never played on a team.. only been a "team player" in certain events
---
Want to argue, **because I know there are people who are listening**, but it seems the people in charge are disconnected from the community at large.....   
---
The last 6'ish months especially have been brutal, our hopes raised with each potential patch, or the new content...  
---
But we find the new content filled with issues and unplayable for many (Arktos Pharma still causes some to people instantly CTD etc)...  
---
It's hard to stay hopeful...
---
Yeah we were just roaming the cranberry bog walking between the spawns and actively shooting any we saw to drag them over sometimes waiting a few minutes between hitting it just avoiding it’s shouts and they just wouldn’t land could of just been bad luck we’ve just hopped on now I may take a trip down and see if it’s any better
---
It dm
---
every time?  Ouch!  
---
Platform?  
---
if [PC] any mods?  (not judging, asking for troubleshooting and replicating)
---
I run a stealth build and was laughing the entire time on novice.
---
good to know
---
I dont think legendary affects should be modifiable. Bad roll? Find a new gun and start again.
---
For the most part I like the idea.
---
An explosive Gatling plasma makes people lag in general without the strangler power armor
---
You can only turn them in when you have the quest active. You get the quest by picking up technical data.
---
You might try putting one in an empty container (tool box, ammo can, whatever), closing the container, then opening it again and picking it up. There are people reporting that this activated the quest for them. I never got that to work, though.
---
I feel like I shouldn't have to state the obvious, but Reddit is full of people like you. If you don't like watching it, don't watch it. Go play on PC, I hear it's a beautiful experience with plenty of hackers to ruin your day.
---
PC, no mods - all vanilla.
---
they just went the route for lowest investment, most income.
---
Bought new amateur studio for a penny that they can (and will) simply lay off as soon as 76 'costs' them more money than it brings them as those aren't their 'main developers' but a bunch of 'acceptable losses' and didn't need to invest much into it as they owned engine and tools already.
---
They probably made enough money before/at launch to cover every cost they might have had for years (power of a big franchise)
---
Don't buy it. Too much money for too little stuff
---
You actually made the Citadel from FO3.
---
Agree. I do spend a lot of time with others at their camps or mine. 
---
Also in the first few months of the game i think you "needed" a team to have your back. Pvp hardly an aspect now of course
---
Lol
---
"Only you can prevent hungry bears!"
---
Nomnomnom
---
I know technical data was really bugged for a while.
---
They would duplicate themselves in your inventory, and I don't think the biggest ones worked for turning in or force triggering the quest
---
I see what you did there 😏
---
Shocking there isn't one yet... I've been holding off to play it, because my friends play at different times. Not about to solo it either.
---
Oh and instanced style mapping is an amazing mechanic and if done right, can contribute immensely to a game's immersion and depth. See Metro Exodus.
---
That's the sad thing that I wish would be punishable by law, Bethesda purely bought this new amateur studio for a penny so they can abuse their developing ability for their quick cashgrab and probably lay off the studio as 'failed' as soon as they shutdown 76
---
What *agenda* am I pushing? I'm not some sort of deep state agent of the gaming industry bud. 😭😂 I'm a Fallout lover like you. I fell in love with Fo3 and FoNV they were masterpieces.
---
And maybe I'm out of my depth, sure Fo76 isn't meant to be those games. It's just that the way Bethesda has gone about Fo76 feels like they've wronged their fanbase. 
---
Therefore, imo, Fo76 is a bastardization of those masterpieces. Bethesda took the Fallout formula, crumpled it up, loaded it into a rock-it-launcher and hit Megaton with it, exploding their A bomb. Then picked it up and marketed it as Fo76.    
---
The larger issue is that Fo76 started off on the wrong foot, crippled both legs and never bothered using a stimpak. They just kept having more and more issues, releasing bugged content and tah-dah now there's a subscription to obtain the things players like us asked for since before launch day. 
---
You can't honestly admit that Fo76 is on WoW's level of MMO. WoW is a complete and fully realized MMO. Fo76 could've been too but Bethesda hyped up this game only to milk the fanbase and the super fans are quite literally paying the price now.
---
I dont think tickets are supposed to be used for unsolicited ideas..
---
16 time the detail
---
I know a bug/glitch that can fix it but won't say it here.  Throw me a pm ^-^
---
160 sounds about right for commando cards though. My junkies commando is at 130 on most anything, laser, plasma and handmade. I would expect if you got a handmade or fixer you'd get in the 180s or so. My bloodied guy is semi auto though so there's the damage difference. With full auto you're hitting 3 or 4 bullets at 250+ damage each, whereas I'm doing like 1 shot for 750
---
Thanks for the tip, gonna do some swimming later hoping to catch it, or check vendors. Not sure how much they cost though, sittning at roughly 1.5k caps.
---
I agree and this is my favorite quest in the game. Does make me wish there had been NPCs from the beginning though. I would love to have been able to sort of "take sides" throughout this quest line with either the Raiders or the Mistresses, or maybe go a third route and just have different people take over each faction. Would be cool if some people could just get together and RP out of there as a hub (the HQ) and have council meetings and stuff. Alas I don't really have friends lol.
---
Will do :)
---
The only reason I swicthed to rifles is for the armor piercing from tank killer. Up until then stealth guerrilla was fun, also with BFFR and BE 10mm pistols which I still use during events to save on 5.56.
---
I implied that as Machine Games is under Bethesda, and with Youngblood we can all guess what happened there.
---
As someone who works in software (not game) development, Bethesda does care, at least a little, about what players want. They just don't know how to deliver.
---
QA is either poorly managed, poorly staffed, or both. Who knows the state of the dev teams, but I'm betting they're feeling overwhelmed (and understaffed) (and poorly tasked). Product management is tearing their hair out trying to compensate for the bugs and slow feature development. 
---
And this is just the game itself! The art and delivery teams (ie the money makers) are clearly given more resources, to the point where they (likely) grabbed the combat knife object for the alien probulator and made it a separate weapon,  instead of waiting for game dev to incorporate it as a skin. Because game dev were overworked with bugs and main projects. And saddled with awful tools and bad management. And roadblocks with other dev and QA resources.
---
Are Bethesda fucked? Yes. Is it malicious or even intentional? No. 
---
Does that make it worse? Very probably, yes.
---
"It's only a model"
---
I agree, I imagine it will be like Anthem's Cataclysm.  Something they add to the game that won't really benefit it in many ways.  I've realized that unless a complete overhaul and fix comes to the game, I'm not coming back.
---
I've kinda just been stalking the sub since January
---
Released in 2002, BethGS was founded and in 2001. Do you really think they made morrowind in less than a year.
---
I fixed this the other day. My fix was just restarting my pc. Avast popped up with a"your computer needs to restart to..." and so I did. It worked
---
One would think it should be pretty clear for even the most die hard F76 players by now, but alas.
---
Show us your build by using nukesndragons.com and we can see if it can be adjusted.
---
Thanks, updated my info!  
---
**Issue: Emotes Wheel is completely blank** (Ticket Submitted on 11/15/2019)
---
First seen reported under Patch 14, the Emotes wheel will be completely blank, making non-verbal communication impossible, which for some is a serious issue.  
---
[Example 01](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/duc3gs/pc_emote_wheel_empty_unable_to_communicate/);
---
Work Around:
---
Re-Equip all emotes from the Atomic Shop.  
---
Some Users are reporting every time they log in the Emote wheel is again empty, forcing them log out and go to into the Atomic Shop to resolve it.

Fix:

Gave this up unfortunately. Started playing the game a couple months ago thinking it was finally the right time. Got super into it with a friend. Then fallout 1st dropped and I haven't played since. Game isn't worth your time cos whatever you're preparing for in game will not be worth it. You already know wastelanders will suck
---
Holy crap I would be so up for the RP idea and using the HQ as a functioning base of operations!
---
What weapons, armor and perks are you rocking? Also, now that you’re level 30, one more level up and you can get 2 ranks of starched genes so you can lock in some awesome mutations.
---
Think about that if you have to start again everytime you have a really drastically reduced opportunity to get the weapon you want (and with this algorithm is really low), the random perk make it a low opportunity, the broke change reduce the opportunity, an high cost can limit your trying, so it's really less. If you find for example a Bloody limb damage and you want desperately a bloody explosive, can be really annoying throw the weapon or scrip it and restart since the 1st, I think can be difficult just get the 1st one right effect, think about the second and the third. Anyway I think developers will calculate the probability to get the right combination that you want (it's not a complex formulae) and will set a right percentage (not sure, looking for the 0.01 of certain stuff). Anyway it's why I thought at the modifications.
---
I think things in the world (not in containers) only respawn faster for you, if someone else entered the area before you, so the things loaded. So if you only use your server alone, it will need some time so that things respawn in this area
---
Get health regen mutation
---
Considering even the american flag isnt accurate cuz it was changed in Fallout lore, it would be cool to see some other countrie's flags with slight alterations.
---
Horde events give you tons of xp when you have to search for the locations of the boss each location you check gives you 644 xp each
---
Wait 5 minutes off of your server and it will give you a new one.
---
I only play teams when my friends are online. Which lately is... not often.
---
I dont like playing with randoms unless it's in NW, and even then it's a coin toss if you get someone who knows what "teamwork" is or not.
---
And what I should use for contact beth stuff? I could hate read and filter all posts of reddit for find suggestions 😂 but id you have got a link of the official suggestions section please write it because I searched and I didn't found
---
"It said in case of emergency, break glass.
---
It's me. I am the emergency. Gimme your caps."
---
I’m glad someone finally said it, I tried the game through gamespass and couldn’t bring myself to play past the first “planet” it was just extremely boring and the “capitalism is evil” aspect of the story is so poorly written it’s just cringey at times
---
Cant wait for fo76 2 to come out 2 years from now
---
I was so dedicated to this game that I actually purchased TWO keys to increase STASH space.
---
Then 1st was released...
---
Bethesda is only interested in their Atom Shop to sell skins for NW.
---
This will not change, it is the direction they have chosen to move in.
---
How can you miss them? Were they erased from existance and wiped from everyone's computers and steam accounts?
---
The bog has a lot of gullies and ditches, and the scorched will get stuck in those.  They’re very difficult to find.  On my melee character, hunting down scorchbeasts is not a lucrative solo activity.  If I swap perks into heavy guns, it’s a totally different experience.
---
In my opinion, I couldn't compare outer worlds to New Vegas, I love New vegas, the difference is New vegas was open world and didn't feel linear towards the story, you could go wherever you wanted, and do whatever you wanted, TOW is just disguised in a way to make you think teleporting to the next planet is open world,
---
The only things I disliked about New vegas is not being able to run and the story ending just ending your game like that, now that is a linear thing about New Vegas
---
Actually there are more people getting the subscription than most people want to admit. Some people are stubborn and won't, but the value for the atoms alone is worth it, and if you check your friend's list, you usually see quite a few people with it.
---
The subscription isn't a bad thing. Scrap kits and repair kits aren't bad, predatory MTXs. Black Ops has bad, predatory MTXs. This game is just struggling financially, and they are trying to do SOMETHING. No, they aren't going to just hand us everything for free. Something has to generate revenue. That's the way of the workd.
---
I think I got the same issue in my lvl 30s. Keep to the areas you already visited in the main quest. Discover, do side quests and events to level up. Whitespring, cranberry bog and mire were too hard for me alone at first.
---
I can see Fallout potentially being handled better elsewhere but I’m not so sure about TES. Bethesda seems to take the development of that franchise the most seriously.
---
Mine works fine. Sorry about your luck. Game crashes have been getting worse lately though, ever since the mischief night event.
---
Ya because interplay was so "good" that they could keep there franchise. Oh wait haha.
---
The finished aspects of "unfinished" Fallout76 is still 10x more content than "finished" OW offers.
---
This is it exactly. I can't return my digital copy, so I might as well keep an eye on the game.
---
Till you got them goddarn commies around
---
Curious what a world map looks like in fallout world prior to the war. USSR and such would likely be a thing right?
---
In fallout lore, does a country named Yugoslavia exist?
---
I played it through once through gamepass and genuinely enjoyed the whole experience. It is certainly lacking a certain depth of content that we have been conditioned to expect from big RPG releases, but that didn't necessarily impact my enjoyment.
---
All this being said, I haven't been inclined to pick the game back up since. It was a fun little experience to romp through once but I shan't be coming back 10 years later like I do with New Vegas.
---
It is also a totally different genre to Fallout 76, so I don't see any real comparison there.
---
What are the other effects?
---
That’s it
---
:(
---
Yeah I run heavy guns and my friend is a melee our plan was I hit them to attract it wait for it to land and then both attack, it makes sense they wouldn’t land due to the ditches and such just wish the landing was a little more lenient on where they could land.
---
East of Silva Homestead (past the Arkos barn) has a ton of Tato flowers.
---
Can you remember which perk? I will have to invest in it for sure
---
He needs a hunters handmade or something for fliers
---
really makes me worry about the next elder scrolls :/
---
I play in a team 99% of the time.
---
Both are online games with session, gta ofc got free private ones tho
---
I might try to swap it to semi and see what happens
---
Hey at least im not a console gamer telling myself im so sick at the game that i need to grace youtube with tutorials. I have yet to run into a cheater on PC so i will be fine. Thanks for the tip and admitting pc is a superior platform. Bless your heart!
---
6 rads/sec is stil too much if you have only 10%/15% health. But I have Allready accepted my losses, and Wil use power armor. But thanks anyway, could still be useful for fighting ghouls, even though they rarely see me.
---
Really fun to use during campfire tales and collision course. It's a "hold my beer" type of weapon.
---
Oh good, another one of these posts
---
Welcome to Capitalism

It takes approximately 5 minutes for the you private sever to refresh.
---
Most people sell serums for 200c-500c from what I've seen just to give you an idea.  Without Starched Genes you can lose it if you radaway though so you might want to wait a few more levels until you can get that.
---
I have it, but having health regen is not the problem here.
---
As people mentioned, it will return in mid-December, a couple of days before a new holiday event starts.
---
He's Scottish basically
---
You say game crashes are getting worse yet yours "works fine". Please elaborate.
---
I mean in a nuke zone I just keep myself a little higher than 19%. I still one hit ghouls at like 40%. But yes I just throw on excavator in nuke zones as it's not worth it to keep up my normal armour there. Only time I'm in a nuke zone is for materials anyways. I use the things I mentioned before so I can melee the queen and take no rads though which is nice
---
[deleted]
---
&gt;Edit: Maybe you can play the game instead of just hang out at your base all day and you might see some interesting things.
---
The salty and aggressiveness is strong in this one.
---
It was the way you kept saying they're wrong. Just a ballbag thing to do
---
Hop to public servers in between private servers.
---
Use gamma gun or assualtron head to get rads back. Or toxic goo
---
Even if they were around, i remember reading somewhere that in fallout lore the Soviet Union was weakened to the point of being irrelevent compared to the People's Republic of China, being seen as the communist super power of the world.
---
So if the USSR was still a thing before Oct. 23, 2077, nobody seemed to care.
---
You have 39 junk quest items and 1 real quest item.  Quest only activates when you find a new one.
---
I have an anti armor  ffr reduced weight one. It's fun to just mess around with it's not that useful though :(
---
Hey, the store has no defects. That tells you if they want something right they can do it.
---
They're making enough to pay you to shill for them aren't they? Can't be doing that bad. What moronic logic
---
Are you kitten me?
---
I want a Texas flag. I wouldn't care if it was an atomizer shop item.
---
My private server doesnt seem to have many issues, however I have noticed a little influx since this last patch/bug fix or whatever they want to call it. It was worse during mischief night but just in public for me. I haven't had too many issues in private servers since it released.
---
[PC] I havent crashed in about 4 months, only time my game acts weird is when my background apps pop up, not games fault though.  Just too lazy to fix the settings.
---
Your saying their wrong. Your being a jackass please gtfo out.
---
As USSR, sure.
---
A lot of them spawn 1* for me or are 3* with a 1* drop.
---
if only more of us would stop.  corporations only make changes when it makes financial sense.  too many keep giving them money in the atom shop.  i won't until they give me something more.
---
So stop playing and whining about it. Jesus Christ. Nobody cares that you really really really really don’t like Bethesda. I am going to continue to support them as long as I enjoy their stuff (and I do) no matter how many people hate hate hate them. In fact, the hate just makes me like them more.

People seem to forget that they made that one fallout game that we dont talk about. They werent perfect developers.
---
It cuts radaway effectivenes
---
Hey, user here who's submitted tickets - they don't work. Sitting on a bug from February, and I see other users still have the game bug (as do I!), and the responses are inadequate, incorrect, or plain incompetent.
---
I have new bugs (my bloodied explosive harpoon gun makes all my ballistics hum like an assaultron head, even after clean install), and I don't even see a point in using the official bug reporter, since the eyes that see them aren't attached to the hands that can fix them.
---
For the political map globes in 76 they took the current irl map. But I think lore is, that USSR still existed
---
They've had a year to fix that bug if it were one. If it isn't intentional, that's probably the saddest part of 76 yet.
---
The dev's kinda suck too though let's be honest. Shitty quest objectives and writing. A world full of boring shit. Zero innovation. Zero response to feedback. Endless bugs. 
---
They may work hard, sure, butbthe quality isnt there
---
Probably backwards compatible. If wastelanders goes well possibly a remaster on a new console
---
I keep a bloodied 10mm on me as a torso hit wont one shot enemies at events
---
How nice of you to say what he can do.....stop doubling down. You're in the wrong
---
Full trappers, or trappers mixed with lead lined combat. Lead lined backpack, rad shield, glowing blood helps
---
Exactly!
---
🤔
---
If you use vats I recommend change ground pounder for concentrated fire, and also add 3 points action boy/girl to get that sweet ap bar to rise faster. Check captainoob on YouTube, he’s got a whole lot of weapons tested.
---
You try brahmins milk? Build a fert bin at camp, milk
---
I've been messing around with vats lately. Not really my thing so far but I'm giving it a good go
---
I really hope that they get their shit back together for TES VI.  With all this shenanigans I’m more cautious than optimistic to say the least.
---
I hear it, but bethesda doesnt
---
Thank you that’s actually pretty good, PA users should just camp next to the power plants
---
They are being rushed by the publisher side. And sure story isn't what they're good at, but the graphics, ambience, and beautiful atmosphere was really good.
---
Europe had actually collapsed and became the European Commonwealth if memory serves me right. Also the Mediterranean sea had a dam built over by portugal and had been drained in the hopes of finding oil.
---
 Downvotes from this place are exactly what I expected. You think this crap means anything?
---
People: boycott fallout 76
---
Same people: check out the new gun I bought on call of duty
---
They have to write this if they don't want pay us for intellectual services. Legally. It doesn't mean they are not listening or we can't send suggestions. They want the property of new ideas and they had to write it. If they legally accept to listen us they have to pay us. It's just an economical strategy.
---
Thata true
---
Would you be interested in a Two shot Ultricite Gatling laser
---
...
---
https://youtu.be/-xUqpKkB0bU
---
No seriously Ive reached the point where I loathe Bethesda. Fuck em. They do not care about us beyond siphoning every dollar they can.
---
I have crashed three or four times since fallout 1st came out, always when I was using a legendary machine, same as in public servers but when you crash you go back to the same server.
---
There were a bunch of posts a long time about about how explosive bait would make the queen land. Not sure if still valid though.
---
Bethesda does listen. The Inside the Vault from a few days ago recognized the outcry over shutting down the NW Halloween skins early. They admitted to causing the confusion and committed to using clear time zones going forward.
---
The problem isn't listening, it's managing expectations. They don't share our priorities but they also don't make theirs public. It's a severe lack of communication. 
---
Like when they broke from their Road Map by not releasing Wastelanders. What we need / deserve is a new Road Map -- even if they don't stick to it. The lack of any information continues to erode consumer confidence. 
---
I think your overall message is probably accurate. It's been a long, hard road and we're still not outta hell.
---
They don't care about passionate fans at this point. They are trying to profit from the whales who just want to consume and it is working. No offense to those that keep buying stuff, I (and in most cases we) cannot control you.
---
It just bothers me that they keep putting so much work into new monetization, but they seem to have completely given up on fixing any of the persistent bugs.
---
The game still crashes regularly which seems like should be the #1 fundemental priority before doing anything else. The goofy enemie animation and weird bugs like that are annoying but fine as they dont change gameplay much. But at the same time everyday I seem to find more and more bugs on top of encountering new ones. 
---
The worst new one I've found in the last few months is that using a melee weapon the first hit deals 0 damage. It doesn't delay the damage and it pops up a few seconds later, it literally does 0. Little game altering shit like this is everywhere in this game and patching all of it should be the number one priority as somehow a year later it's still their buggiest game to date. Idk, sometimes it makes you just want to stop playing because they clearly neglect making the game fun and functional for the players.
---
They are listening. They made an entire post because people thought someone had been banned for finding a bug and reporting it.
---
They just aren't doing anything.
---
I have to say whilst the idea wasn't too bad, the biggest let down other than needing to spend money to get things is the main plot.
---
Leave Vault 76 and find your way to defeat the scotchbeast queen. That can be done in a few hours. Well basic and no fun once you done it, there's no after game plot as far as I know of other than repeating the same thing over and over again.
---
They should have had done more to it. Bring out Wastelanders a few months after Vault 76. Or at the very least some after game quests and such.
---
They are selectively listening. You are dead on about a severe lack of communications. How many important topics have they been totally mute on over the past year?
---
&gt; 76 is a direct case of customer abuse. Fuck me Australia got them to  admit they lied about what they sold but nope, still blind followers who  say how great this godforsaken and pitiful excuse for a fallout game  is. 
---
Incorrect what the law suit was about was ZeniMax telling people in Australia they were not eligible for refunds due to their dissatisfaction with the state of the game.
---
Your source being?
---
I'm really not and even if I am, I don't care. The game is bad. Period. But the fact that the game is bad shouldn't and isn't stop anyone from enjoying it. It's that simple. Move on.
---
Lmao you just scared away the Bethesda employees for the next 2 weeks at least
---
I agree especially given one of the vault 94 missions had a guaranteed 3 star and is easier.
---
So while I agree that there is a ton of hyperbole in defense of the game those youtubers have absolutely stoked the hate pyre since the game launched, and many times in objectively false ways. The class war story is a great example.
---
I still log in a few times a week to knock out a few dailys but im transitioning to Red Dead next week and FO76 my get uninstalled for awhile 😞
---
Does it no longer one shot players due to the damage cap? Other than that I can't think of any other nerfs to it, and it was quite useful and fun 6~ months ago.
---
He IS wrong. The game is bad. Period. But the fact that the game is bad shouldn't stop and isn't stopping anyone from enjoying it. It's that simple. Move on.
---
Because he IS wrong. The game is bad. Period. But the fact that the game is bad shouldn't stop and isn't stopping anyone from enjoying it. It's that simple. Move on.
---
Yeahhh... I read every single comment between him &amp; the other user so I know he didn’t. Any more assumptions for today Esham?
---
There are only two countries in fallout. America, and commies.
---
Lol, I see now. Wondered if it was petty nonsense between mods. What was he spamming exactly? Just like advertising the market sub too much for their liking?
---
Bethesda isn't listening to... Reddit forums where an arguably small percentage of overall customers are posting about their unhappiness with the "quality of life".
---
Till you use a flag of a country that's hated by another country.
---
Haha this comment make me wanna give Bethesda a Hitler
---
How does that boot taste?
---
This happened to me yesterday twice....
---
daaang good question.
---
And like put them on a vendor
---
I play in teams at night by day I solo
---
They find the game good. How is that wrong? Why do you feel the need to tell them they're wrong?
---
Such a good question that it got downvoted. Lol
---
if they are built to resist explosions and radiation; it won't do shit. which makes no sense.
---
i believe it was from spamming the sub link to many times as a new post is what started it
---
Jesus Christ... Doesn't have anything to do with that. 
---
Fucking faulting people for liking a game or defending it.
---
Because they find the game FUN, NOT GOOD. They're two very different things and no one seems to understand that.
---
i would settle for a pick your mission and it won’t lag to shit weekend
---
I agree. it's only a thermonuclear weapon. The ammo is heavy as Satan and so is the launcher. Can't it be the bfg9000 of 76. it's really disappointing because it really looks so dope to fire and they are rare.
---
Looks pretty decent. His accuracy seems to be a lot better than mine is. I'm starting to suspect something is fishy for my char :-/
---
I always solo when I bush Wookie, aqualung it. Sorry, you got some people not following the etiquette.
---
if your level 400 you should do fine
---
This is my Favorite Game, but this was my first Fallout experience as well. I can honestly say I am addicted. I have spent Hundreds of Dollars on Bundles and also Subscribed to Fallout 1st and was trying to stay engaged. But after a few days I cancelled my subscription.  An empty world with no content, just farm the queen over and over.  Just feels like all I do is trade guns and armor pieces. If it wasnt for the Fallout Community I would of left this game a long time ago.  All to say, that im a trying to go "clean". First learning not to invest my money into something broken and overpriced (Spoiler Alert: Probably get Free Atomic Shop items with a future bug anyway). Second, to admit that I was wrong to defend this game. This was the hardest case of Denial I have ever been involved in. Overall I hope to make a good recovery. Ill still play and you will still see me online. Just wish Bethesda would of took me out to dinner before screwing me.
---
Yup. That’s my consensus on it also. Just odd to me because the sub they’re modding over is literally named after the game half of the sub is trashing then they ban the people for defending it?? It’s like they hate the game too I’m not sure😂
---
Eh I guess but seriously what keeps you playing? I'm genuinely curious. How can logging on and grinding the same events/places for scrap or legendaries fun still? Don't get me wrong, I grew up playing mmorpgs and understand how you can grind a game forever, but this one though? I just have a hard time imagining grinding and upkeep on weapons/armor is any fun at this point. I had hoped for this game. I was wishing a year in I could jump back in and play but the game is still broken. No server rejoin? Still? So what's the point of taking landmarks when I can just drop server and lose it? What's the point of dropping a bike and farming the location when I can just drop server and lose the progress/supplies needed to raid the bunker? To me the game just feels like pushing a boulder up hill. I want to like this game but I feel like the devs are purposely making sure I don't. It's a real bummer dude.
---
I don't work for any game company 😂 I wish! I'm a project manager for a construction company. I just know how running a business works, unlike most of you whiney little entitled shitheads 😘
---
Theres another one i think southish of robco or whatever its called where awol event takes place. I had my camp there for awhile and hed always peacefully fly overhead until i tamed a sloth that would agro it and it would demolish my camp. The sloth was put up for adoption not long after
---
I see. Odd how that turned into us literally not being able to mention it by name but boys will be boys man😂 considering how my friend got treated for literally defending the game they mod over I’m not surprised in the slightest
---
They spent a year lying to us that they couldn't increase the stash limit because of stability concerns, and the whole time they knew it was possible to have unlimited stash and they were just waiting to monetize it behind a subscription paywall.    
---
Fuck them in their fucking lying asses.
---
So a big chunk of countries wouldn't even exist to be put in the game  with a FO tweak.
---
Coming soon to Fallout 1st members.
---
I’m ashamed I did
---
Works fine for me. Took over six in a row last night on private, no issues. Just saying, your experience isn't end all to the service.
---
Me and my girlfriend play together, but it’s frustrating because we are high level and still doing events like the final nuke launch and arktos pharma suck with only 2 players. End up just blowing through weapons and aid. 
---
Still haven’t finished the main quest. We got through it once with another player who launched the nuke and another time the code hadn’t been cracked yet. Would probably need to team up with other players to have the desire to run through those again, but we don’t have any friends who play.
---
it'S been broken for ages.
---
I go shopping on public for awhile, then hop to the home server after.
---
I get what youre saying but single player season pass =/= free "game as a service" updates
---
I run a bloody unyielding wood armor stealth build with 1 piece of chameleon with pipe revolvers and rifles i deal about 1500 per shot sometimes more the wood armor is cool for shrouded trying to find my last right arm to make it a complete build armors stupid when bloody cause you get 1 shot half the time anyways i take down everything but scorch beasts which take like 2-3 shots
---
Crashed twice today, including just now after some kid I was teamed with had put the effort into building a workshop defense. In fact my crash earlier today I was just running thru a workshop stealing some supplies (did not actually claim) and it crashed there too. We were on public though.
---
Ok. “Broken “ is a definitely an explanation. Thanks :)
---
Meh depends on your build. It raises how much up you get from Stims, but how much does that really help you? I have ran it lvl 2 for a long time and always felt like I was getting full health even from 1/4 hp. But if you have a lot of strength and ur hp is really high and you need more, could be worth
---
Your experience isn’t the end all either. How long did you manage to carry on playing for whilst retaining the workshops?
---
Number 1 request: ANTI CHEAT!
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
And of course I totally give the intellectual properties of this idea at ZeniMax, definitely and officially :)
---
If you are server hopping for mobs, you’ve got the right advice.
---
If you are server hoping for items on a table or in a safe for example, you need to loot items (120/60 I believe it is) for items to reset.  You can’t loot the same safe over and over once you take something from it.
---
Just quit playing FO76 to boycott them. If enough people quit playing so their pockets will start hurting, you bet the higher-ups will listen to us.
---
I love the game but not the way it is right now, the game could be so much better.
---
Suddenly I like you more then most people I get in my team xD
---
Spent about 80 percent of my time over the last day in a team, took on content a little too hard for my player but survived.
---
Team makes a lot of places easier, and has some entertainment value. Kind of more random traversal of the map but i consider a scouting mission than I go back to thoroughly looting and reading a place later when solo.
---
I am glad if we make it that far.
---
Theres too many things that give/have explosive resistance unfortunately, they work well against groups of low level enemies, but not much more after that
---
Strangely, Green Thumb also doesn't work on the firecaps in the agricultural center.
---
I play both, probably 60% team 40% solo. I actually made a really good friend out of a time I was playing solo and needed help killing a legendary swamp stalker. I randomly invited a couple people to my team, he joined, helped me, and then invited me to an Xbox party and we’ve been playing together ever since. 
---
I enjoy the company of being in a team, plus the charisma perks such as strange in numbers and inspirational, along with the herd mentality mutation make playing in a team so much better. 
---
Plus I’ve found that people are not really assholes as they were when I started playing a year ago, and much more people are helpful and friendly, so even adding to a team to just do our own thing is nice because we share a beneficial perk card, get more exp, and yeah it’s a good time.
---
The lighting and draw distance is definitely improved. Most static objects cast shadows, better ambient occlusion, higher resolution. Trailers look much better than the game.
---
What level are you?
---
I agree a team camp or the ability to make a small building blueprint and bring it into a team camp (or camp village!) would be fun.
---
Pride flag
---
Hold up, you're gonna be able to go to the Captial Wasteland???
---
I lived building vaults in FO4, i even made a quick totorial video to show people how ro build one at any settlement by getting underground
---
damn dude. i'm not even sure we can still call it a bug anymore. It really ruined the early gameplay. The whole stuff was fresh and exciting, it was mostly 2-3 high level players carrying \~10 newbies. You play like a maniac, kill countless enemies and sometimes none of them drops any loot or their loot won't even load in. The worst one was the golf club with the loads of legendary ghouls. Sometimes you kill 10 of them, zero legendary items. aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
---
I played this game since beta, and had no idea brahmin milk cures rads. I know you can milk them, but haven't tried it, since I always have excess purified water. How much rads does it cure?
---
I was told that these posts are few and far between yet all i see are complaints on this sub reddit!   
---
I haven't played for around 3 weeks as the game doesn't draw me in at all anymore.  
---
I really hope out of nowhere Bethesda just drop a huge update to fix everything...but the chances of that happening.
---
I always solo. Regardless what I do during the matches.
---
The scorchbeast will land on the ditches, no problem. The scorched can hide in them, so they’re hard to find, kill and force the beast to land.
---
For sure. I've uninstalled recently, probably won't reinstall until wastelanders. If a bunch of it is locked behind paywalls I'll uninstall again. Bethesda has an idea of how many people have it installed, so if it's just sitting there in your library you should probably get rid of it.
---
More targets
---
More folks to use keycards on
---
Would be good.   Canadian Flag.
---
Logically, if the same team member not wanting to reveal his/her position and risk a fight was beside you the whole time, it just means he/she would run away from the fight once it rained metal.
---
FO76 is kind of a middle ground, Fallout isn’t specifically about FO76 so it doesn’t quite fit the bill. FilthyCasuals is a rampant fanboy echo chamber.
---
There’s a difference between toxic shithole and constructive criticism, so yeah, a place where we can hold Beth accountable for issues with FO76 instead of having their marketing team/mods downvote/remove posts to promote their game image would be excellent.
---
Imho useless for pve, but pretty good for pvp superstim build. You'd better try it out in a combat with real opponent.
---
I go solo but hang around with other people
---
Pawses the game...
---
Heavy weapons quad harpoon gun, and because I never run out of ammo. Have a 2 shot harpoon gun for a long range weapon.
---
That's really true. I prefer hide-and-seek to murder-death-kill, but let's not burden others with our choices.
---
Wait you can cross the wall without opening the gate?
---
But Canada was annexed during the war.
---
Like 165 i think?
---
Hard to swallow pill: they won’t port them at all because the game is monetarily under performing.
---
They clearly said they find the game good. It's not for you to decide what they perceive as good or not.
---
You don't really need blocker/bulletshield with VE GL + stangler PA; nothing is gonna touch you...
---
you need BFFR weapons. the highest dps bffr rifle as far as I know which is actually usable is the bffr fixer followed by the bffr handmade. bffr combat rifle works as a cheaper alternative. I can pump out over 2k per shot with those guns to the head no problem. think my fixer was hitting the queen to the head for 500 per shot. when you're talking about 98 fire rate and 25-35 magazine sizes, those are big numbers
---
Well, about time someone did it xD
---
Outworld it's a cool game but less than a week worth of content. Watching a stream or YouTube video of a playthrough will save you some money.
---
I played the first 120 hours solo, and the next 780 in a team with my bf. 
---
I almost never play solo now.
---
on ps4 the light looks crappy, even the black smoke from generators is all buggy and the white light in-game looks like part of the screen has brightness set to 200% 
---
but i still enjoy the game tho, hope to see many performance improvements
---
They already got our money, they don't care about us anymore.
---
Remember this next time Bethesda releases a game, and let them know with your wallet that you won't fall for their shit again.
---
We know what drives them and in the end it is bigger than gaming. Vote.
---
My biggest pet peeve is when everyone spawns in 4 different corners of the map :/
---
add me on psn: Owl_No 
---
i can make private server and i shall help you
---
My guess is that they've realized that the playerbase is getting smaller and smaller, without hope of recovering, and they have decided to milk those we are left.
---
i run a junkies rifle build with enforcer for a shotgun.  the reasons being junkie gives me a nice damage boost since im not min/max and i get to keep high hp for my solar set.  and the shotguns for cripples (CC is OP)
---
Amen
---
Yeah, Loved MoM - best quest line in the game
---
Yup, that's cruel but it's reality. Totally agree, I've the same feelings about that.
---
It all depends on your stat distro. IMHO, "Cola Nut" gives you more bang for your buck. I have a Mistress of Mystery build who simply doesn't have room for Endurance, and uses it as a dump stat - stealth/sneak and alpha strikes to mitigate damage. In a pinch, "First Aid"  becomes useful by way of Super Stimpacks (as mentioned earlier) and use of diluted Stimpacks outside of a bloodied build.

I’m talking about a constructive criticism sort of sub to discuss legitimate problems with the game without being moderated by Bethesda, or being shilled off the front page by the marketing team making multiple “*oh hey look at x thing in the game isn’t that great!!!*” And upvoting one another’s posts to suppress any actual, good discourse.
---
Not anti Bethesda shitposting, that already exists as FO76Memes, I don’t care for a fo76T_D-like sub.

Future of fo76?

I spend half an hour pissed I had to walk all the way back to Stellar bay and take the long way. Is there a video I can watch to see where this hole is?
---
Wait are you talking about the Rizzo place? Sorry not from the inside of Cascadia no, you gotta walk around and get to the other main entrance to thr sealed door, go left to the marauders and the whole thing is open
---
Of course. That's the idea. Just like a music band sell merchandise. You're buying Fallout, not a 0s and 1s.
---
I agree completely....... it might be the weed talking at this point, but to be at the level this game currently is, youd almost HAVE to try it. Like youre not this bad at your job and are able to keep it by accident. 
---
And all that being said, i still play proly once a week. It has its ups too, so im not just a guy out to bash for bashing and upvotes. I just thinks its absurd the taboo around talking about this games faults. How is it going to get better if we just shut up and take it?
---
Oh, ok. I guess I will have to head back to stellar bay and take the long way.
---
If I recall the entrance from Cascadia has a bridge to get there, not 100% though
---
I would if enough enemies spawned in one place.

Bullet Shield is a waste. Move the points elsewhere. 1 point in Adrenaline is helpful. 1 point in Tenderizer is helpful. Cola Nut is great healing for 2 points END investment (no animations, either) or Revenant for a sizable DPS boost if you do go down (same point investment.) No real opinion on Luck of the Draw, but Mysterious Savior isn't bad for keeping you from dropping if your Luck investment is high.
---
Their marketing team does a hell of a job shilling posts off this subreddit to improve their image. Downvotes are in full force 100% of the time if you so much as breath a negative opinion on ANYTHING in the game.
---
Add me too I'll join in. I like to nuke whitesprings or Morgantown for ghoul leggos. You can get shots in and stay close for power leveling with power armor or a rad suit. GenomeNinja
---
If you got to the hunters cabin, its not that far a walk from there, walk up the main road. I don't even think I opened the gate, just walked around the wall
---
Ye this is a bit fun actually. Remember when people said ”you dont need to buy atoms, you can farm them in game”. I bet they regret that noe 😂
---
It’s funny come on:)
---
Thing is I walked straight to cascadia from stellar bay, I haven't discovered any of the locations east of SB.
---
&gt; They no longer deserve the benefit of the doubt. And by continuing to give it to them, you are fueling Bethesda's worst behaviors and justifying their new direction. 
---
I have to ask this, not just from OP but for every single person who plays this game still: How long have you people been living under a rock?  
---
They've been trying to do this for AGES now, Horse Armor in Oblivion, Lootboxes and overpriced garbage in ESO store and more recently the bullshit they've tried to pull in Steam's workshop with paid mods (which now are being sold for coins with arbitrary values and with lower quality then their free version).   
---
Seriously just take some time of your life to watch a video or browser Reddit itself guys, nowadays you HAVE to be cautious with what you going to buy, if you make the mistake, at least have the decensy of not wasting any more of it in cash grabs like this.
---
And a single unit cabinet to compliment the 4x versions... For corners.
---
The game being bad is not an opinion, it is bad. But being bad doesn't mean it can't be enjoyed.
---
I keep the game installed hoping to see the update we’ve been looking for, but this game has been a rockslide and its disappointing. I wanted Fallout Online for a long time.
---
Time to accept my money has been taken for 20 hours of fulfilling game time.
---
Just dont preorder, whatever thet promise.
---
when greed and monetization becomes the real goal of the company there is not much you can do at that point, all they will do is lie to you and try and suck you dry on there death spiral and worst part is they don't care what they take or steel from you they believe there to big and you are to small to stop them from getting away with it..! so this should state very clear what we want for Bethesda studies now  [https://youtu.be/ZlawibQ\_QKI?t=29](https://youtu.be/ZlawibQ_QKI?t=29)
---
Just dont preorder, whatever they promise.
---
Ah that's a bitch. That gorge is impossible to cross anywhere close without crossing that bridge. Its not that bad of a walk though, Amber Heights and Fallbrook are on the way
---
1 lvl with cola nut combo lets me take all three pylons, for my team. I don't kill the imposter, just keep myself alive and kill a few gutsys.
---
Weapon skins for the weapon type. Armor skins for armor type. And outfits are outfits that go over ur armor
---
I uninstalled the game and launcher a few weeks ago.  Hopefully they give me a good reason to reinstall down the line.
---
All games are a waste of time, but I'm not going to let Fallout 76 be the game that beats *me*.
---
Weapons skins are only for the shown weapons. Apparel can be crafted at the armor bench usually for just a few cloth.
---
Reminds me of the cool road map they layed out for us with all the potentially neat stuff that was planned for the game. With Wastelanders pushed back to possibly March or so, and Survival mode given and then taken away, all that's left is Wild Appalachia. Not much progress for a year's time considering that many updates/fixes took us 2 steps forward and 5 steps back. Overall, I have absolutely no confidence that Bethesda will turn this game around for the better. And for the better, I mean for the better of the community and not their profits. To be honest, I expect them to spew some such nonsense to the likes of, "Were sorry, blah blah blah, but we're shutting the servers down."
---
Still, I'll continue to play for this and that reason, but I think a lot of us hang on because it's still Fallout and there's really nothing else quite like it.  Sometimes I feel like Michael Corleone in The Godfather 3: "Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!" 😂😂
---
I will try soon and let you know how it goes thanks for the tips
---
What console? If you’re xbox I can get you through a silo in like 20 mins lol
---
shouldn't we be comparing RSP's and __NOT__ comparing a RSP to game passes?
---
strait up apples and oranges
---
I really hate reading posts like these. But, if im honest, im kind of in the same position.
---
You know what happens to games when you delay their release?
---
They get better. Wastelanders have to be so fucking good that the hatetrain will say "now Bethesda unfucked this", or it will be pointless.
---
For sure I'd like it to be released in next ten minutes, but only if it'd be ready. If it's not ready, I'd rather wait
---
And just to illustrate this, I just crashed out doing Line in the Sand.  Logged back onto a clean server, went inside Ft. Defiance, and yep—Blue Asylum outfit and hat.
---
Quit playing quit crying. Some people still enjoy the game if you dont cool that's your choice but whether you believe it or not theres still a lot of people that genuinely still enjoy playing the game. I support fall out I buy atoms every check because I enjoy what I buy and support fallout.
---
Me too! Got a pink bat from a Scorched (but accidentally scrapped it), really good armor and plans from technical documents, got an aae25rw minigun from Murmph, and rare plans from some events. I have been wondering if some numbers have been tweaked.
---
Does the gun have +250 damage resistance while reloading? That effect is bugged and breaks the primary effect.
---
How much damage are your floating numbers saying?
---
Pipboy numbers aren't important at all. My handmade says 200 but sneak attack headshots do 1500+
---
Use vats to headshot people, someone suggested concentrated fire, you need that. In 2 or 3 shots it proc's the full 95% and becomes hyper accurate. You should also be using sneak attacks all the time.
---
I’ve been wondering the same thing.  Did they change something?
---
Don't, you get a nasty ascaris lumbroicides infection.
---
Ever heard of development hell? And the countless cases of game delays that still turned out to be complete and utter trash.... yet i hope they won't fuck it up.... I really want it to be great
---
Scrip modding?
---
Yes, but considering that you can probably kill a whole pack of super mutants with a 2w gauntlet just as quickly, it’s not very efficient.
---
Honestly so what? Either enjoy the game or dont. They dont make the game specifically for YOU. I enjoy it a lot at this point. Can things be fixed? Sure. Does that mean I wont play it ? No. If you dont like it stop playing. Gtfoh with your boycott this game bs. No one cares if you like it or not because other people do
---
PC.  It took a couple hours last time then I had to give up because it was almost 2am.
---
I can see nothing has changed much since I stopped playing 6 months ago; I don’t see me coming back either. Not that others care but I’m sure I’m not alone. I loved the game during the year I played it but always wanted more in the realm of a larger DLC. Sorry for the fan base to have to deal with this level of disappointment based on their love for the FO series.
---
Too bad we don't have the modders to fix it as usual
---
Oh not at all, I totally agree.
---
i, well its not a total fix but it seems to kind of favor favorites so having them favorited sorta at least i think weights the  randomness of it
---
My only thing with this: It should cost more caps to do so, or maybe a high level quest. 
---
Reason being you’d be digging out a large area for it. Just hope they don’t paywall it...
---
As soon as you stop searching for legendaries, the legendaries find you.
---
Sounds like a great opportunity to disgrace other nations flags.
---
I've played my fair share of what was available. I'm over it and moved on. 76 was getting better for a few months then just tanked. The whole pay to win aspect was a huge let down, not to mention the regression of bugs that had been fixed, then came back with an update. Think I'm done with Bethesda for their lack of caring from the public out cry. Sad really. They used to make decent game. Might be a good idea for them to sell the FO franchise back to Obsidian.
---
The PS5 is going to be backwards compatible
---
Got all of em on
---
Yeah it ain’t worth the headache, but good luck
---
Probably nothing beyond backwards compatibility. Why would Bethesda waste time, money and resources to re-release the game on next-gen, when people are already right now giving the money for microtransactions and 1st for a broken game?
---
[Gotta make it through Starfield first.](https://www.pcgamer.com/starfield-bethesda-pc-rpg/)
---
I just take what i get as i go along.  Primary weapon is a rifle cause i don't like in my face attacks but, i literally have everything else for variety so i have to walk everywhere.  Only use pa for scorchbeast fights or falling down mountains
---
Really cool build! A lot better than the pirate ship I attempted to make on console, lol. I did do a pretty good cosplay of my pirate character the Buckhannon Buccaneer though! https://imgur.com/gallery/xvvZbEv
---
You don't really need skeet shooter if you use a combat shotgun and mod it right.
---
Better Criticals do not stack with the +50% crit damage legendary prefix on weapons.
---
If you are ysing an explosive shotgun, might wanna use adamatium Skeleton so you don't cripple yourself.
---
Shows up in any zone
---
I need stickers of that to slap on trashcans around town.
---
I can just see underground flags and campfires not mixing well
---
Assuming you are asking “where” ...
---
Westek
---
Charleston Capital biuolding
---
Whitesprings
---
Fissure sites Scorch Beast hunting (great during the double XP weekend)
---
Events:
---
SBQ
---
Violent Night
---
AWOL Armaments
---
Uranium Fever (guaranteed 2-3 legendaries, but only level 40)
---
Monster Mash
---
Sheepsquatch
---
It depends a lot on the area and time of day.
---
Like, I think most of the Savage Divide is just ugly.  You don't notice many shadows compared to the Forest region.
---
In some interiors, like the Whitesprings, my character is super glossy and horrible.
---
And yet, there are other times when it actually looks kind of nice, usually around sunrise.
---
Just rejoin. You have like 15 minutes before the sever resets
---
I just had a "Teammate" find a bush and just go AFK... new XP farmers suck
---
did you say you were using an assault rifle? I'll check the damage on mine when I log on
---
Really? I’ll give it a try. I usually take a break and sulk 😂
---
Ur probably right haha and I'm pretty surprised too but glad i got at least one comment from someone with the same view the big majority of game developers have ruined gaming it's not just one it's almost all of them everyone just loves to put it all on bethesda tho
---
He would never cheat on Bricky
---
Read a reply to another I posted about that. I'm not explaining it again because some rando is too lazy to read the other posts.
---
By not getting spotted. My agility is 15 by its own, plus complete unyielding armor wich gives 15 to all special except endurance, plus the perk that makes you 75% harder to detect while sneaking. I can tickle a super mutants balls, and he still wouldn't see me. That's how. For a bloodied sneak build at least. But I can't imagine being bloodied, without sneak.
---
It's not a fucking pay to play subscription you fucking twit.  It's a monthly atom booster with a few bells and whistles added on to incentivize people to actually fucking buy atoms.  You know, buying atoms... the shit that's supposed to actually finance all of the free shit?  All of the ACTUAL content that's been added with Wild Appalachia, Nuclear Winter and what will be coming with Wastelanders has been and always will be fucking free.
---
Thank you 🙂
---
When is it the best to find legendaries?
---
My stealth Vats build, only when vats works properly though lmao so its hit or miss but mostly miss. I like being in rooms full of bad guys and stealth killing them, until my 95% hit chance is actually 0% and my 23% hit chance becones 95% lmao this bugs me so much.
---
I've been playing since beta as well, and have the fasnacht bonfire in my Camp prominently displayed. As I was running back from a West Tek run, I noticed for the first time two small legs with little sneakers poking out under the bottom of the bonfire. Apparently there is a child's body up inside the fasnacht bonfire yikes!
---
Wow, never noticed that and I've been playing since release
---
I have been having a lot of fun playing Fallout 76 with some friends. Overall we pay very little attention to what you see on social media about fallout 76 or pretty much any other game. Mostly these places are pretty negative about almost any game. In the end if you enjoy the game then play it, if you don't enjoy the game then don't play it. Don't make your choice based on what others say is popular.
---
Overall the comments I see from most people about the game are far more negative than my actual experience playing the game. I often think people spend more time commenting on stuff in social media than they actually spend doing stuff.
---
I'm pc, but thanks for the offer.
---
Anyway, I made around 6k 5.56 yesterday, put them into machine - and they sold, all of them, in few hours. Wow. You were not kidding...
---
1) You act like Bethesda is the only dev that goes quiet for an extended period of time.  EA, Bioware, Bungie, they all do it.  2) Every fan base makes posts like these whenever there's a little silence.  You really think Bethesda has completely stopped listening to the player base?  Don't be dramatic.
---
Just copy the WOW dungeon finder.
---
Lol, so focused on TES IV that I completely forgot about this
---
I just wish that they came up with more "stuff" to mess around with in the absence of Wastelanders.
---
The Clean Appalachia thing, for example, that was cute and probably represented an extremely small amount of actual work on their end.  Heck, for the past several weeks, the Atomic Shop has fallen pretty flat with very few new items released, even though we know there are a *ton* of unreleased items for it.  A lot of things that were supposed to happen this year aside from Wastelanders, like the second Vault Raid, player prestige, some general re-balancing - these were all pushed back as well, and yet, here's Fallout 1st which was just sprung on everyone out of the blue.
---
Also, let's face it, there has been *nothing* about Wastelanders since that trailer back in June.  Yes, June.  And when people ask for an update, Bethesda pretends not to hear us.  We may be looking at another *four months* of nothing if Wastelanders arrives at the tail end of Q1, and that's troublesome to me.
---
I'd fail it. I want Biv all to myself.
---
No problem! That will be 50 fusion cores 
---
Jk
---
That's a bummer, but I think it would be cool to see that location nuked. I just wish the map would change more after being nuked.
---
So keep on bitching? Got it
---
I’ll have them in no time when I take over all workshops now 😂
---
Guess thats a big diffetence. I dont know anyone who plays 76.. Friends are al fIFA and cod only if gamers at all
---
Can't fully remember, but we could drag the storyteller into this, he probably remembers. But seriously though, check out the Fallout Storyteller series, it is pretty good.
---
Thats amazing
---
I nuke private and public lobbies at least 5x day and when that happens just have to rejoin lobby or have someone fresh to the lobby go and spawn them not hard to fix and it's not a new bug it's been there since day1...you must not launch nukes often if you didn't know that
---
And a great answer! Thanks! Had no idea there where pa mods that favored bloodied. And yeah fireproof, I've been thinking a lot about that perk as I didn't have any luck finding the dense mod for my combat armor. That's like the only way I die nowadays, splash damage from an attack that wasn't meant for me, as mostly nothing detects me.
---
I usually have my camp in the big a little south of the watoga train station, there’s plenty of of small  ponds, rivers and flat land. Plus it gets nuked a lot so you can farm for flux or legendary enemies
---
I want an NCR flag.
---
Bloody Stealth Commando. I like that enemies are less bullet spongy and I have to be aware to stay alive.
---
I have been farming workshops on a private server for several hours no problem.
---
I literally re installed F3 FNVegas and F4.
---
F76 is just F4 but in the woods and with tons of crap nobody likes.F4 at least has story trees and things to do reach the end game.who the hell wants to just roam around doing nothing?that is why we love the fallout games.its like an interactive story.you get to choose how the story is to progress.with mutants and ghouls mixed in.
---
The vats system is one of a kind what with gruesome exploding heads...lmao so gratifying sometimes.
---
Until they put story trees and npc's in this game is dead and stinkin'.
---
GTA is peer to peer while 76 is on a dedicated server. apples to oranges
---
K-bye
---
Because the people that still play this game just want to spend rl money on atoms and play house . They get offended when you bring up one of the many bugs bgs swept under a rug for you to forget about
---
Then someone please tell me. How can I keep enjoying this game while also doing something that makes changes or inquires change?
---
They never should have made an online game.imo.
---
ok.. thanks for the update
---
Lmao
---
 Bethesda scam &amp; spy business in plain sight.
---
Congrats on realizing no one made you play this game and that there are plenty of other ones out there that you can enjoy
---
there is no pvp and there is no winning in this game, you can still kick my ass without any scrapbox or ranger outfit. So whatever you call this i don't care but don't say it's pay to win, don't lie, you act like a kid and no one want to talk with a stupid kid.
---
I have them on PC.
---
Well, it sure can't get any worse than this. So yea, technically it can only get better...
---
What about my favorite country? Texas!
---
Bethesda is not a charity no one is supporting them from goodness of heart, it’s business they are making products and people that like those products are buying. Works exactly the same with EA and other developers/publishers
---
What
---
It took me like an hour to launch my first nuke. I don't even have a specialized build, just melee PA build. I went in solo and the enemies can't even dent me much. It only took that long because I got lost for almost 30 minutes and couldn't find my way to the next room. I'm sure experienced people can do it in 15-20 minutes, maybe even less.
---
I do now
---
SMH
---
&gt; you act like a kid and no one want to talk with a stupid kid.
---
Can you stop projecting your own faults upon me? thanks.
---
You missed the number one reason for server lag:
---
BETHESDA AUSTIN IS ASS WHEN IT COMES TO PROGRAMMING.
---
Oh i did read that. i just think that its a stupid thing to say in general, even with the "i meant the feeling of a new fallout that's like the others". It's basically saying "I want old Fallout, but new, but not too new cuz different is bad, and i want it to be exactly the same as the old, but it needs to be new".
---
Like. Fallout 76 isnt the entire series. You dont have to like it. You can play the old ones, or be patient for fallout 5 to be made after starfield and elder scrolls 6. But saying "i miss fallout" is just a dumb thing to say.
---
You are a genius!
---
I think it was the day the codes changed, bad luck.
---
Platform?
---
I might have them, would have to check [PS4]
---
In the middle, right near Murgle's spawn( just west and south I think) is a "lake". Actually a big puddle of toxic water, but I think you can put the large purifier in toxic water? No boiling for recipes though.
---
Ps4? Add me. Andreslamantis.
---
Damn, I wish! Xbox
---
Thanks man! I’ll add ya!
---
Pathetic response to a once good company. You've become so use to the player base fixing your games, then you got greedy.
---
Need to give them to another player.  When the player drops it or sells it to you - the quest activates
---
Note: it seems there are 2 types of technical data: active and inactive (though they look the same in inventory).  The “inactive” type is just garbage
---
Pretty sure they're not worth 1k caps...😂
---
I want Biv to go drunk with eggnog and patrol Morgantown looking for Santa.
---
I really wanted to enjoy the game. There was (and still is) so much potential, but good (and free!) community relations would be required in order to realize any of that potential. It just ain't gonna happen to 76, I'm afraid. Now if only I could get 76 as a solo only offline game and mod the ever-loving shit out of it so my computer is within half a degree of complete meltdown, I feel like I could enjoy it. Oh well, there's still Skyrim.
---
I’m on the PS4. The plan for the robot chest piece is the only piece of robot armour I haven’t learned on my character.
---
it’ll come bundled with anthem
---
Do you often allow your 9 year old kid to play PEGI18 games ?
---
Fun novelty weapon to mess with from time to time.
---
Yes, I run a few bloodied builds (commando, shotgun) as well, and having a teammate watch your back (and more importantly, contributing) is a force-multiplier. PA adds it's own form of survivability, especially with Emergency Protocols torso mod (although you shouldn't need it with Ghoulish + Rad Sponge.) I'm typically in a Nuke zone to collect flora and tag/kite mobs with a tesla to loot later. My buddy (also bloodied) cleans up the trash with a meat hook in his Hazmat Suit. The only real threats in a Nuke Zone are getting swarmed by a pack of ghouls due to poor positioning, or other players.
---
Found it. Might actually go for it. Thanks for the tip! Now to figure out a style to go for😂
---
Maybe 250 caps max
---
Yup for sure, just outside of the town by the train, there a couple of smallish lakes, nothing great looking and water may be toxic
---
Doesnt matter, people are paying subs. Boycott all you want, theyll just target whales harder and harder, and catch their prey every time. "The free market will provide" lmao
---
 When will you be on dude?
---
So how many buildings have you made where you didn't wire up utilities, and instead go around giving people a bucket of water and charge $12 a month for it?
---
Yep, people shilling for Obsidian are all over this subreddit...
---
I'm pretty sure I've covered the entire map at this point.
---
And what revolutionary gameplay does Fallout 76 offer?
---
None of my sidequests have quest markers, not even the main questline. I've had to watch videos to see where the map markers are SUPPOSED to point. Top this off with invincible flying scorched and Scorchbeasts attacking you from underneath the map and you have your typical F76 experience.
---
Then keep buying their products and they will keep lying you countless of times and ripping you off with things like F76 at release and Fallout 1st. I surely learned the lesson to not support this company anymore
---
Not like discovering things. More like, lets try to jump on this branch today.
---
One of my toons lives with Murgle, so I used warehouse walls to build on to the trailer thing Murgle lives in. Personally I  think that style fits in the ash heap.
---
Nice try Todd Howard
---
To be frank nowadays most companies aren't listening. When they actually are listening, then it's with a respose speed of a dying dinosaurus. Anyone who responds quickly is usually trying to vover something up, like GGG when they tried to sneak in lootboxes into PoE...
---
I'm fine with Bethesda not listening, I'm not fine with them not listening and being greedy...
---
EVen with rad shield, diluted rad-x, 5 pieces of rad resist armor, and all the perks, you're still taking somewhere in the range of 20 rads per second. In theory you can survive by spamming radaway every 20-30 seconds, but it's a pain in the ass and not at all viable.
---
I haven't finished it yet so I can't speak for length, but the content it does deliver is great.  Much like the other Fallout games, I will definitely be playing it through several times with a different motivation for my character.  Other than just being a dick to other players, I can't see that sort of range in FO76.
---
i don't because i'm not saying that this is a pay to win game when it isn't and i tell you why, but you insist with the same shit, now you attack me because you can't accept that you were the one being a kid and stupid lol adios
---
I had level 2 for quite a while. Experimented without it to free up other perks. Hardly noticed a difference or issue with it.
---
As I said, we're stupid
---
Go to top of the world.  Respawns are qwick there
---
Not obvious to everyone who disagrees
---
That was certainly true in uranium fever

Yep, the Mistress of Mysteries questline is amazing and heartbreaking. We knew that everyone is dead, but still... finding out *how* the Order died made me both sad and angry at the same time. Seriously, fuck Olivia! This quest was Obsidian-level of writing, maybe even above...
---
I did get lost playing last night and realized it was 6am lol. Had no clue what time it was
---
It is pay to win though. You can win PvE games too. Being able to collect more scrap per run than someone who doesn't pay is you objectively winning more at what you are supposed to do in the game. Not having to spend resources to repair weapons so you can do other stuff with it is winning more. The survival tent allows you to travel faster meaning you can get on with winning more, faster. 
---
Just because you aren't in a PvP game doesn't mean P2W is impossible.
---
He woulda gotten away with it too if it werent for you meddling gamers!
---
Lot of sheep
---
What do SIT on when programming? Todd Howard's dick?
---
&gt;Outworld it's a cool game but less than a week worth of content. 
---
So what is the difference between that and fallout 76?
---
I miss that.
---
listen here you little shit, just because your mom is not in the house that doesn't mean that everyone can waste time with you, go and breath air in the park or kick a ball. it's not a pay to win game, period. chau
---
Same. It's been awhile since that's happened.
---
Did a run through fort defiance, my luck still sucks. All white, weathered, and dirty spawns.
---
Or, if you are on PC, join me and I'll guide you through the silo in, like, an hour. Just keep each other alive and tag the legendaries. I don't have enough CHR to share Born Survivor, otherwise I would have, but I'm sure I can get the enemies fast enough to keep you alive. Bring your power armors if you can.
---
You might not know this, but this game is bad and doesn’t work right
---
There should be a new item in the game, a Toddy bear with Todd's face on it haha 😂
---
Your story is a great illustration of what an online, multiplayer, Fallout game can be.  
---
I've loved the franchise since Fallout 3 and despite the disconnect problems and technical problems it's great to play a Fallout world with other players
---
Players shouldn't report bugs, and Bethesda will not do it themselves. So we should all kick back and enjoy the broken stuff, right? Oh and don't forget to mail your next paycheck to Todd Howard.
---
Straya!
---
The Atom Shop is a freaking Joke i scroll right past it everytime i log in
---
Well, I'd love to hear your take on the matter. Do you agree or disagree and why?
---
Ever heard of Duke Nukem Forever?
---
&gt;how do you not get one shottted
---
Serendipity has a 45% chance of negating all damage. Blocker 3 reduces all incoming melee damage by 45%. Dodgy negates 30% of all incoming damage at the expense of some AP.
---
Those three perks combined make you damn near invincible. Pop a diluted stim now and then (or use an autostim armor piece) and you're good to go unless you get caught off guard by a group of level 50+ gutsys or level 60+ mutants with miniguns.

🤣 this must be a trol post.

Spoken like someone who has never tested software.  Ever.

This is the best idea I think I've ever heard
---
Shotguns are way better.

Yeah I know sometimes people think it’s worth that much I knew a guy who sold it for 2k alone
---
I sell u 8 complete set's ( clean Helmet + clean suit )   \^\^

it's not Rly that rare as many player think.

Near lewisburg maybe close to the train station in the pond itself the water is shallow enough to build in the water.
---
I suppose every game you play is bug free, but I've never found that to be true. I stuck with games I like when they were only marginally stable, but since March of this year, FO76 has been very stable. Yes, the server crashes and there are other bugs, but I simply love the gameplay. Unlike yourself, I do believe Bethesda is listening and trying. JMHO.
---
Two things.
---
1. I never said player's shouldn't report bugs. Please re-read carefully, I explicitly said " If you suspect something to be buggy, report it."
---
2. I don't get this Todd Howard thing. I, again, explicitly said that Bathesda has been shit recently. I don't understand why instead of discussion I simply get hate here, from people who clearly didn't take the time to read my post.
---
I can present multiple arguments in favor and against that thesis. Exceptions, while worth considering, are not how you should define the basis for your viewpoints - at least I think so
---
Burrows.
---
NIRA.
---
Fort Defiance.
---
You may be getting downvoted but I low-key actually want this
---
I could be wrong, I thought there was a spot south of the station  near the big bend tunnel populated by mirelurks
---
We also shouldn't ever hire game testers so we can infinitely live in a buggy mess too. Wouldn't want an intern at a police station to shoot someone suspicious too, right?
---
Eating downed players is pretty funny. I’ll throw it on sometimes for stuff like sbq or meat week where players die a lot.
---
Good old fallout games mean the them being actual rpg style games n not watered down with less rpg. Save your "I think sometimes opinion is stupid cause i'm an asshole" ways for someone who cares. I'm not that person. I don't like talking to moronic assholes so shoo shoo. You're dismissed.
---
Here you go dude. I'm a PC player unfortunately, or I'd invite you to the community that I'm a part of, but here's a link to a playstation community that we're partnered with.

---
I'd love to know, why do you think so?
---
I am a server-side programmer, actually, but because in the internet everyone can claim anything I'd not use this as an argument.
---
But, still, You havn't made yourself clear - do you beg to differ? You claim that players trying to exploit the game DEFINETLY wouldn't potentially cause problems?
---
Hmm Ill hide while in a team when I feel it is dangerous to wander about. Also, you dont always have stimpaks to revive or are clearly outgunned. Sure I'll revive you if the coast is clear, but if there are 5 enemies roaming around and I have no stims I am not going out in a blaze of glory with a crossbow!
---
Despite all criticism, that's one thing i will say positive about Bethesda-they do immersion and Easter Eggs well! Not just for this game. I was playing one of the recent Wolfenstein games,and while i was working my way through a base,i found a drink vending machine that had a button marked for Nuka Cola.
---
How the fuck can people here not know that? Really? You haven't realised it since the release of the game? With everything they did and everything that happened with Fo76 ? I have no clue how can people need a "wake up call" to realize this.
---
So does human taste like chicken?🤔
---
Main char is a junkies stealth commando, vanguard sentinel armor, doesnt hit as high as my bloodied stealth commando, but survives way better. my DR and ER are both higher than power armor as well.
---
😎
---
I’ve been using a super sledge for that exact reason. Still a waste of time haha
---
I'd drop some points from sluggers to get 3 incisor.  Armor penetration is huge.
---
You don't really need 5 in makeshift warrior at and game. Just repair Your gear.
---
Oof, you're gonna have to sleep in a gas mask, OP :p
---
I rarely run solo. Most of my chars use herd mentality and strange in numbers. Besides, this game has no content if you aren’t talking to other people.
---
I don't have much trouble with packs of ghouls, thanks to vats with very high perception. I find that I mostly die because of the rads, which is my own fault, because I get distracted by some mob, completely smoke them, and forget to take radaway. And usually, the only time I die during the sbq fight, is when she blasts another player, and I'm just standing too close haha.
---
&gt; Spoken like someone who has never tested software. 
---
More like spoken by someone who *knows* to let professionals do their jobs and let YouTube Tryhards go to hell.
---
The guy who got banned used a **cheat** engine on the game *hundreds* of times and then, when Bethesda finally banned him for it he ried about it like a Toddler, pulled a Cartman and punished the *entire community* by taking his (albeit mediocre) mapping site offline.
---
Sadly I'm on PS4 and we were able to launch the fucker about 6 hours ago now anyway.Thanks for the offer though friend
---
'Murica! Fuck yeah!
---
You are right, but BoS aren't holding out american soil. Submit to the Enclave!
---
Lol it takes you an hour to get thru a silo???
---
You are an utter idiot if you didn't the full post, he had permission from Bethesda community managers and his intentions of using cheat engines were to fund exploits and remove them you twat
---
Fair point you are making here. But the fact that Bethesda does keep making so stupid mistakes, still needs to be reported. I would definitely not buy Fallout 76 and any other Bethesda game anymore until they get their shit together. Now let me be clear here that if a company/dev team is open for feedback, I would definitely if I had the time and motivation report/suggest any difficulties and the details so that hey can improve. But  Bethesda no Longer deserves this. The only thing keeping it afloat is the people that are spending money and attention on it. Maybe I will also return/resel Fallout 4 and not buy Elder Scrolls 6 by the matter even if it is hard to do.
---
I have both my pistol build became a pistol/rifle build to take advantage of pipe guns full potential  Great for sneaky solo play.
---
My shotgunner is more team focused even though the range is trash on shottys the utility is great for biger fights enforcer is just fun
---
For months now. And they aren't "real" per se... they don't give you any extra rewards as with turning in 2 you actually picked up manually.
---
Now the trick is to find yourself a supplier who cuts you a good deal or start farming the materials yourself whichever works for you. 45s are good too as with bandolier they weigh nothing and then lever actions etc are still pretty popular. Not as solid as 556 but if you got them kicking around..
---
Damn, you really angry. Any in game currency is still bad. Either way, don't defend Fallout 1st
---
Yeah, I know that.
---
If you could turn it in, I wouldn't be complaining. But it's useless so it's a little annoying.
---
you're an idiot and deserve to be milked by bethesda for life like the idiot you are
---
I don't get ya. Do you consider yourself a game tester? are YOU going to work overhours because some player raised an exception on your servers?
---
Glad to hear it from the head of Bethesda; 'MY\_SHIT\_IS\_PERFECT'.   
---
Who else could bring us such factually true and objectively correct information?
---
Got reset/relog after you get one as there's a timer.
---
Never have we ever had such a shitty and buggy unfinished game upon release, the average game has a few bugs,
---
But this one really seems like they cut the deadline by a few months
---
They never released a game with so many bugs before
---
Tells you what is going on in their heads 
---
"Profit profit profit!"
---
For those hoping Bethesda will get there stuff together and go back to their old ways, I wish this was the case. But I would bet that Starfield and ES6 will have monetization. They will probably go all in for the creation club. They will cut content to sell it to you later. Plus I believe it's a real possibility that mod tools won't be available for the next fallout or es game. Greed is the name of the game now my peeps. Just my opinion, now worth a lot lol.
---
This may be interesting for a future build. So how much do you die outside of nuke zones? For me, it's a very rare occasion, but that's simply because they don't see me. If something does see me, I'm usually dead lol.
---
F\*cking finally. As I have mensioned before, Im a programmer. The last thing I'd want is my users trying to crush my app, or find loophole's in its logic "just to report it". That's why we hire QA.
---
&gt;If trying to insult me is all you want, sure, go ahead.
---
Can't say you didn't ask for it, dumbass.
---
People on the other sub would provably call this toxic but it's just a realistic outlook on things.
---
I’ve got it down to a science. Me and my friends spend one day a week hitting all three silos then hopping servers and having a different one in our group do it and we all just rack up legendaries and levels.
---
Username definitely checks out!
---
Lag...
---
You always had to server hop to catch another mutation. I thought nobody would acquire mutations the old school way, nowadays, what with serums being sold for cheap everywhere. 😉
---
Okay, your "shoo shoo" comment has pretty much painted the picture in my head that you consider any opinion besides yours as childish. But sure, i'm the asshole.
---
What exactly do you consider to be "rpg style", anyway? Because to me, it's still plenty rpg. I have stats i can increase however I want, and perks that I can choose from, I can build my character however I want, I can do sidequests at my leisure. I mean, if Final Fantasy is an RPG, then so is current Fallout games. Do you just want the isometric games, or are you one of the types who says New Vegas is the best despite all the problems it has, especially at launch?
---
And another thing, you're right. It is an opinion. One i disagree with. Just like you have every right to voice yours, i have the right to voice my opposing views for the sake of discussion. And i never said your opinions of the games were stupid, i said the way you voiced them was stupid. Because once again, saying you "miss the good old fallout games" makes no sense when they still exist and nobody is stopping you from playing those instead.
---
&gt;y never released a game with so many bugs before  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Tells you what is going on in their heads "Profi
---
That's true. Im also against everything bathesda did regarding this game's release. But players gotta understand, it's entirely within bathesda's rights to ban players for intentionally trying to screw up the game. They may to it because they try to help, but in reality they don't know the implications of their doings.
---
Can confirm too now, so thanks for the tip! Harpers ferry itself also looks very spooky when nuked, I like it.
---
I made a post about this in detail about a couple months into Fallout 76 including the Travelling Merchant, Raider outfits, and it’s following DLC outfits as well, I can only hope they tap into the nostalgia at some point
---
As **Esham** stated Luck of the Draw could be replaced with something, I'd suggest Serendipity as it looks like you're running bloodied.
---
This is my Two Handed build for reference, not saying I have it perfect by any means just something to look at.
---

---
I loved the instagating combat rifle vats build, was very powerful, almost dumb for crowd control. I switched to unarmed bloodied to see what all the fuss was about, and I'm loving it! Granted you are a little squish if the RNG is bad. Otherwise just walking up to the mirelurk queen and one-shot hoofing her in the front butt with my weak looking girly character feels great man! Also having a goal to gather all the specific armor and weapon items to make it work gave me a great goal which is still not 100% complete.
---
Today I rolled a perk card pack on a new character and I wanted to use 100% of the cards rolled, can't beat that luck lol
---
great to hear it worked out for you
---
Problem with your argument is that many of these players finding testing and reporting bugs have a better understanding of code then most Bethesda employee's.   I honestly think these people are being banned out of jealousy.  These games count out a buggy mess every time, and players are getting sick of it.  No one holds them accountable for their shotty work.
---
So, by doing this, logically you have admitted two things:
---
1. all you want is to insult me. That's fine, Im not taking that personally.
---
2. If you you were rest of this paragraph, you could have noticed that by doing so you are admitting to be "intelectually incapable" of coming up with a counter argument. Think about that for a sec.
---
I mean I see their health bar go down. But watch ithers when they attack there's yellow numbers appear showing exactly the damage amount
---
The one that got me like this was one day i noticed that the cigarette machine is like a huge lighter. Walked past thousands of them in fo4 and never noticed.
---
Two thoughts here: your character might have stayed in the world if only the game client crashed / bluescreened, and then killed by mobs with no way to get back to your loot bag. Or did you crash immediately after picking up all that junk in one go? Inventory is only updated server side when you drop (and maybe also consume?) something. consume?)somethingsomething something
---
Hèhè, those stupid glowing basterds never saw it coming. Reminds me of Boone in new vegas with the phrase on his baret "the last thing you'll never see"
---
I really do not feel that uploading a video is going to help them troubleshoot this long standing problem which is likely down to shitty network protocol handling between client and server.
---
Almost like he cant continue providing the toll to people, because the ban stops him from gathering the information.  
---
Amazing how hard that is for some idiots to grasp... Almost like your too busy brown-nosing for the devs that dont care...  
---
Would be such a shame if you used that poor excuse for a brain you have...
---
I’m poor in caps otherwise I would drink the serum and throw on starched genes.
---
Almost like he's trying to keep the community updated.  
---
But at least he's trying to do something, not wasting his own time replying nothing but rubbish...
---
ha right on brotha
---
The Stockholm Syndrome level comments in this thread amaze me.
---
Depends on their armour
---
I like using them against people’s CAMPs because they damage a ton of objects and structures in the camp
---
Eggggzactly. There is some real hate out here in the real world. Im not going to get into that though. Real flags in game and bathesda's guaranteed horrible response to whatever issues would arise from that is something i hope gets avoided at all costs.
---
I used to do development - unlike 99.94% of the posters who are complaining about his getting banned.
---
For me its 12am GMT
---
Just a shame that everyone else's experience is proving that this is a complete lie...
---
Pretty sure PS5 and Xbox Scarlett said they’ll be backwards compatible, no?
---
 'Bathesda has -recently- been a shit company who only made shit games' ? You are referring to Fallout 76 only, the other were OK given after third party modder's intervention.
---
I report players if they look like there are exploits afoot and leave it at that. There is no point really shooting them, a server is a server they will just move to another.
---
Go to settings - display - show damage number - on
---
" many of these players finding testing and reporting bugs have a better understanding of code then most Bethesda employee's". See, Im a programmer myself. General understanding of "code", or even the related mathematical principals, doesn't grant you the ability to magically reverse-engineer the game.  
---
Much of any online game's logic is processed on the server's side, and the players, as skilled as they are, could never magically understand it without looking at the source code.  
---
But I think how smart or skilled they are has nothing to do with it. Put yourself in bathesda's shoes for a second: All you know, is that some player repeatedly tried to exploit your game. You don't know who in the world is he, what's his skills, or even if he himself has any idea what he's doing. He isn't going to work overhours fixing whatever shit he may have caused.
---
Your choises are: 
---
a) ingnore him, and by thus permit ANY player to mess the game up, or -
---
b) ban him for clearly defying the game's terms and conditions.
---
Shoo shoo means I don't count YOU as worth anything. Calling my opinion stupid like you did right out of the gate listed you as an asshole not WORTH discussing with. No matter how much typing and whining you do, it's a waste of time. Nothing you say means a single thing to me. Idc what your opinions are and that's your own fault for how YOU started out. Read the room hun. I clearly think you're garbage. You'll find no kindness, agreement, or discussion here. You don't get to start off being an asshole then expect discussion. You don't get any. So again, shoo shoo.
---
To be fair the map size is definitely 4 times the size of 4s map
---
With a few exceptions, skins are only for the thing listed. Apparel teaches you the plans to make whatever it is at an armour bench.
---
There is a nice sized lake just a little south of Lewisburg train station in the Ash Heap. It has a few lead nodes nearby and also several pre-existing structures to loot
---
It's weird, I feel legendaries have become too commen nowadays. Maybe it's because I farm exp at the usual spots that also hold the most legendaries. But come on, 5 or more for a casual hour of running farms? And they are all garbage!
---
I would love to see fewer legendaries but the ones that drop are 200%better in stats
---
This! It annoys me so much they didn't add them into the game.
---
For PvE it doesn't matter. For PvP the right set of regular armor is OP.
---
I have a load of them, haven't set up a vending machine recently, moving about too much. I've seen them up for around 50 caps to 5000 caps I think 10k once LOL, have a go at 1k see what happens.
---
The raids reset at 12am GMT?
---
Doesn’t it run at 1800p on the X and 1440p on the PS4 Pro? 
---
And while the game can be ugly at times, I think the lightning effects are beautiful.
---
Yes, just nuked harpers ferry, and power armor is just too clunky for my taste, I was glad I could get out of it in the burrows. And after just reading all the comments again, I think it's best to go with a hazmat suit in the future.
---
I also didn't like their greedy elder scrolls blades title.
---
A lot of down votes for the correct answer.
---
It could probably happen, but would require an all hands on deck approach like Wastelanders seems to be getting.  I could see some work being done in the future to enhance nuke zones.  I’m betting most of next year will be dedicated to polishing out the damage from year one and expanding on Wastelanders.
---
Is the suit like a hazmat in protection, looks like a kid's costume anyway, too clean and not real looking.
---
Go to your settings and turn on dmg numbers and when you see a yellow number means you hit them in there critical weak spots every type of enemy have different weak spots of course anything that seem to have a brain thier weak spot will be the head
---
I always carry excavator with dual calibrated shocks so I get a total of +200 carry weight for hopping in it. I only use it for whitesprings nuke zones, getting flux, and mining lead at lucky hole mine. Other than that I'm always in my unyielding set. Each piece is 3* so I have 15 legendary effects on me not including my weapon which is dope.
---
In my experience yes.
---
Its not midnight for everyone around the world, its whatever 12am GMT relates to you
---
I think EST is 7pm, maybe ?
---
12am GMT happens when this comment is 1 hour and 40 minutes old.

Just keep in mind that you really, really don’t want to get hit while in a hazmat suit.  Stealth is your friend.
---
Yeah im running pipe vats crit revolver but actually have every revolver almost
---
^troll or has no idea what he is talking about
---
What mutations do you want? I could help
---
c1) Understand that your team is slow as hell, and accept the found information and fix what was found.
---
Profit is as profit does, a company has to make money or they go bust.
---
Marsupial and chameleon
---
I really hope they do. It would also create more variety in nuke locations I imagine, as I for sure would like to see every piece of the map in a destroyed state.
---
I am so glad I didn't buy this horse crap. I was waiting for the next full game and was excited when I heard about 76, but was too busy to play at the time, so I figured I'd wait until time opened up. I've never been so happy to be over worked.
---
Cry harder.
---
You have to make sure they're set to ON for "survival" as well [snickers]
---
Seriously though, why is that still an option?
---
Bruh
---
Tenderizer in the charisma stat is a damage perk.
---
dude... you are ignoring the most important part of my argument. Id be specific:
---
what if the player potentially does something that messes things up badly?
---
They're usually anywhere from 200-400 depending on the seller.  Modus is a rip off.
---
Yes, but even before I switched to unyielding armor, enemies rarely saw me with my 15 agility and 75% harder to detect perk. So I think/hope it will be okay.
---
Legend thanks bud. Exactly what I was looking for 👍
---
White spring for higher levels
---
i could be wrong but im pretty sure it's 20 hours from the difficulties clear.  at least one night a week we end at 11ish and we get rewards again at 7-8ish the next day
---
Thank you for the positive post.  It's refreshing to hear something with at least a ray of sunshine in it.
---
Why were you downvoted? I'm part of this community too and it's very good
---
Do people not know for a bug fix, it has to be reproducible?
---
Actually, I have a more simple analogy.
---
If you had a store, which had a lock on it's door. Would you like your costumers try to lockpick it "just to help you"?
---
C'mon. Its that simple.
---
As long as you’ve got high AG and stealth perks, you should be good.  Do you use Escape Artist?  It makes you so much quieter.
---
map76 guy should probably send his CV to them or such, so he could do that legally.
---
Things like "penetration testing" when non-asked is illegal everywhere, and the support is usually not "trained" to respond on a case-by-case basis. (Contacting a programmer or such for that, would be more useful)
---
You're unironically arguing that submitting bug reports should be a bannable offense and likening that process to shooting someone. Any insult made by someone as utterly vacuous as yourself, especially regarding intelligence, can never be taken seriously.
---
You either die a hero or watch yourself become a villain. 
---
This sub is pathetic at this point.
---
Correct, you do report bugs, except you need to know that what you're reporting is an actual bug, and not just "I think people are exploiting the rolls" because that solves absolutely nothing
---
I don't know about super sledge but I was being serious. A high level mr handy blade can do a lot of damage cause its attack is so fast and you get at least 1 dmg per hit. I have one that regenerates health too on hit and the auto weapon repair luck perk
---
Now, I am.
---
True.
---
Lvl125 Bloodied handmade with full unyielding. Used to have a piece of chameleon but ive stopped using it as I enjoy mobs detecting me. I love the thrill of being nearly dead so have to really watch how I position myself. Semi-auto Handmade has long scope so I can snipe as well as semi-close combat.
---
Yeah, Mate!
---
&gt;Im a programmer myself. General understanding of "code", or even the related mathematical principals, doesn't grant you the ability to magically rev
---
Technically, one can report it and still have sold his cheat engine to thousand of people.
---
Bush hiding...what peasants.  Aquaboy is the only way to hide is style.  Hold yo breath till you the last one left!
---
The case seems that it's not as it's been portrayed. There's a big difference between accidentally discovering an exploit, then reporting, versus intentionally recreating those same conditions dozens, if not hundreds, of times to verify that the exploit is real. 
---
The first case should be reported as a bug and then Bethesda *should* do the second part on their end to verify its existence and try to find the cause.  A player doing the latter portion is more likely them using it for personal gain, not for the good of the game.
---
False
---
It's pretty good so far. Can't talk for the whole game, but the intro cutscene really sucked me in. It has a pretty fair amount of Gore and craziness. With humor.
---
sounds right up my alley.  thank you for being honest
---
Odd man out but I love the game and I’m glad they’re catering more to people willing to invest in it’s development. But I’m sure you’ll be back once our money does contribute to making the game better. 
---
But yeah, solidarity! Um, can I have your stuff? I mean you hate the game and don’t want to support it so why not? Right? It’s not like you’ll actually keep playing in spite of the problems. I mean who does that?!
---
It’s okay, we won’t harass you when you come back. Pretty sure the replies I get to this response will not be as kind tho. Lol
---
Joking aside, I get people feel let down and have legitimate complaints. Hell, I waited a year to start playing BECAUSE there were problems. It’s much better than it was, by all accounts. 
---
What I don’t understand is the circle jerk of misery though. Sorry if that sounds harsh, but my inbox is FULL of people complaining so much (and still play). 
---
In comparison? I didn’t like Diablo 2. I stopped playing it and have never gone back to it. I also never posted anything online about how I felt. Other people liked it and played it just fine in spite of my thoughts about it. 
---
And so will everyone on FO76. They will continue to play and love it and now that Bethesda has found it’s audience (in gaming news articles today) and is catering to the majority of us who love it? It’s only going to get better. And I’ll be playing a year from now because bugs and problems have always been part of game development. 
---
From my first play through of Wasteland (for those who are too young to know, that game was essentially Fallout 0) and not being able to finish it because of a bad sector on the floppy (Google it) - I was hooked. Still am. And all the negative reviews and comments can’t change it. 
---
Sorry.
---
I’d like to know this as well I have a 3* similar to this one.
---
Wow, okay i take it you either didnt even read my last comment, or are choosing to ignore the point of it. Again, never said your OPINION was stupid, just the way you SAID it. If you took one sarcastic question as me being an asshole you really need thicker skin. If you dont care about my opinion, then why should anybody care about yours? Also, if you don't consider me "garbage" and not worth your time, why do you continue to respind to me? I think you just get your kicks out of arguing on reddit, and since I have nothing better to do I'm happy to oblige :) i also noticed you didn't answer any of my questions regarding the nature of RPGs, or your Fallout prefererences, so why not start with that? I await either your answer, your continued arguing, your silence, or your blocking me, with great anticipation.
---
exactly!
---
You are a fucking liar.  Your company does not deserve the Fallout IP and should just license it out to a more capable company.
---
They are worth 28 caps
---
Maybe the guy isnt level 250 like most of the no lifers ive seen in this game lmao
---
 "You're unironically arguing that submitting bug reports should be a bannable "
---
Well, with all your godly intellect, you may have failed to read the following, quote:  
---
  "If you suspect something to be buggy, report it. Don't test it."
---
I rest my case.
---
Nice
---
The colored bats spawn in the vendors inventory?
---
Yep.
---
Yeah but it is easy to do 180 and scream LIER LIER at the guy after one post from bethesda. because they never lied about anything and everything that they do IT JUST WORKS.
---
Funny enough i was one shot killed by a low level at Morgan Town Vendor the other day.
---
I think he was level 16, he literally one shot killed me whilst jumping about.
---
So embarrassed was i that went back for more and he killed me twice more.
---
I am no mug either 221 levels and wearing unyielding/Sentinel Armour.
---
He to kept slapping to initiate PVP.
---
I think the intent of the next generation is fairly seamless backwards compatibility, hopefully it just works right out the box with crossplay between the two generations. Considering this is an online service game I'd be surprised if we didn't get some kind of visual upgrade patch, even if it was just cranking up a few settings to make use of the new hardware. Unless the game is just dead by then, but considering Wastelanders is scheduled for next year and they've referred to that as part of the "Year 2 plan" or some words to that effect I don't imagine they intend to abandon the game by the time next gen is out.
---
There's a slight chance that OCE will become the next great war, where if you display one flag the other country finna shoot you.
---
Okay I want this now
---
All you really need to know is that the mods of this sub are more useless than a ghoul slayers gamma gun.
---
Just leave and rejoin again - _-
---
Except he actually stated that he was working with Official FO76 Community Managers to find and figure out how exploits worked and give them detailed reports so the Dev team could fix them.
---
So if we are going to aim for democracy, general ratings have fallout 76 as the worst game in the franchise and bottom 50% in comparable games. So how would you rate a bad game?
---
I wholeheartedly agree. I uninstalled after the release of "fallout 1st" to make room for outerworlds. If you uninstall, that is a metric they look at. So if you want them to stop their shitty antics it's probably your most effective tool to say "hey I don't like this fucked up direction you're taking things".
---
Chameleon mutation is useless, just get a piece of chameleon armor.
---
Anecdotal evidence is anecdotal, more news at 11.
---
On the flip side, I can't recall the last time I had a full on server crash. I've had a couple of the xbox freezing and going "NGGNGNGNGNGNGNGNG" issues that kick me to the dashboard, and c couple instances where my internet flaked out and I DC'd, but no actual crashes that could be blamed on their servers.
---
Damn its hard alone
---
Passive mode, and my rig was able to handle the graphics spam. It was just boggling to experience.
---
You don't need stims to revive anyone.
---
This. The red one and firebreather ones were always common. The white responder fireman helmet was, and still is, the rare one. 
---
The red on you're talking about is like asylum uniform hats. They're worthless without the accompanying outfit.
---
Well, technically, all of the Residents are American. But this game’s become is silly as hell, so fuck it. Raise your haggis-stained tartan and Longshanks be damned!!!
---
You don't download a bot program in World of Warcraft to see how it works.  You get banned, even if it was "to help out" Blizzard so they know how it works. It's in the rules you agreed to when signing up.
---
Same thing goes here.  This has been staple for online based games for decades.  It is nothing new to argue about.
---
God you're dull. Couldn't you have at least made this fun? I expected high and mighty self righteousness like most guys do and got duller then dirt instead. Now I've gotta find someone else to take the bait. I want amusement. That's all reddit is good for.
---
Anything Bethesda related should be boycotted
---
I have shot at him and he always flies away before I can do enough damage.
---
QoH had been working on my main up until about a week ago but then got "stuck" as you described in the main post.  The quest still currently works for my Alt Characters though.  Has anyone been able to find a fix yet?  Have tried abandoning the quest, but so far it still auto-reverts back to the turning in the sample stage of the quest when I relog.  Anyone have any luck with reporting the glitch to Bethesda trouble shooting?
---
What others have said, you need to not be on the private world, or be on a public server, long enough for the private world you were in to disassociate you.
---
Private worlds have a "feature" of persisting for a period of time (a few mins), which is great if you want to exchange gear between characters on the same account, but bad if you want a fresh server for new content quickly.
---
So disconnect and have a sandwich, take a piss or putz around in Adventure mode for a few before spinning up a new private world.
---
I mean, i dont know about you, but i found ruining this for you mighty amusing lol.
---
Perhaps a way of combining your friends camps. Like if all 4 of u put in your build limit to one camp. This might also help with lag as there would just be a bigger camp rather then yours and a team camp. So 1 larger over 4 small and 1 large Perhaps no matter who logs in you will spawn in with your team camp. And you all get 1 or 2 vendors linked to the player who placed it respectively. And if one opts out of the team camp it simply downs the budget 1/4 and removes some things or puts them into storage so you can sort what you want to keep and remodel. Perhaps a community stash box that you can store and trade with other members who are or are not on. So of I put screws in a box. Log off. My friend logs on, the team camp is generated. And he then can loot the screws from the team stash. And leave something els. This would synchronize with the team log on/off feature.
---
don't confess you were using the map, they might ban you too.
---
My endgame gunslinger was the best, most fun, coolest build. If you invest in agility, luck and a bit of perception, you will love it. You can use a silenced 10mm and be John Wick, you take a revolver and you become Sledge Hammer, you go cowboy and... Really fun. In terms of damage, critical builds will allow you to headshoot and oneshoot everything except bosses. But you can join scorched Earth and deliver amazing support. With the right legendary weapon, you will be overpowered.
---
Sell them, they reproduce like rabbits!
---
You can only turn in one at a time, and it has to be an in game find for it to spawn the quest. All the extras are caps for you the next time you hit up a vendor.
---
I’ll bush hide all the damn time.  Let a whole team of 4 run right by me then shot their asses in the back.  It happens all the time.
---
&gt;It's not an opinion. 
---
This is 100% incorrect. You're flat out wrong.
---
&gt;This game is flat out bad. 
---
This is an opinion, and a valid one at that. In my opinion, however, it's a pretty good game, in spite of its many issues.
---
i’d be up for it on PS4
---
If they could do that then the current solution for camp conflicts wouldn't be the way it is
---
Right, because nobody actually paid for the game to begin with. I have first, yet I honestly believe that this should be the case. I don’t want to be responsible for someone else’s camp not loading, just as everyone else prevents my already low spawn rate at the Whitesprings Station even lower by dropping a tent in any server with an opening
---
It doesn’t work exactly like how you’d think the description reads. Instead of having to press caps lock or slightly push the joystick to “walk”, you benefit from quieter movement while at normal sneaking speed.  It helps dramatically when you’re very close to enemies.  West Tek, for example.  I tend to sneak past anything without stars, and it’s very useful if you don’t want to engage a fight.
---
Beat me to it.
---
I would prefer a instrument that I can play with a hat for tips.
---
Biv could hook up with Rose
---
It still counts as an object as if someone was in your camp spot anyway you wouldnt be able to spawn in until they left or you waited.
---
Your camp has a radius of space needed so if the camp is in it obviously you wont be able to place.
---
You don't understand the difference between liking something and it being good.
---
Kinda stupid.
---
The pre-war Fallout world map is completly different from our world.
---
Europe (or at least most part of it) was like USSR until they dissambled the European Commonwealth.
---
As far as I know is that the UK still existed but I do t know if they existed as a whole UK or sinply without Scotland and/ or the Norths.
---
USSR also existed but also unknown if completly or not (like without most Balticum countries or Ukraine).
---
China also existed but whats with countries like ROC, Vietnam or both Korean states ?
---
Japan also existed but whats with India, Thailand or Australia.
---
Also unknown if all Islamic countries existed as own countries or as a Arabian Union since the EC invaded the whole Middle East.
---
Africa unknown.
---
Same for South America except Mexico and the US annexed Canada one year before the nukes came.
---
Btw. aynone knows what happened with the NATO in Fallout or did it never existed there ?
---
Yea it is especially during the sunny parts of the day I was wonderin the same!
---
They're both subjective opinions, you're the only one having a hard time understanding that fact
---
I always wear combat armor but if I get over encumbered I bring out my excavator power armor it gives +100 carry weight other than that I don’t wear power armor
---
Incorrect. A game can be just bad.
---
Perfect reward for like visiting ever town and finding the hidden sticker
---
I run all 3-star Scout armour most of the time, carry a set of Excavator for hauling junk, X-01 for queen fights and nuke zones, and Ultracite because I wanted a jetpack on my head.
---
Hell yeah
---
I don't know about anyone else, but I want that location, just what I've been looking for.
---
Kinda sounds like my guild from guild wars 2  after i mentioned a bug thatd been in the game for 3 years
---
Conan! What is best in legendaries?!
---
A game can be considered bad by some, and good by others.
---
Ikr? Balance is important in games. Especially if they have pvp as well. He's arguing with most of the people replying to him. He's absolute gold. XD
---
how about a "will work for legendaries" sign
---
Incorrect. A game can be considered fun by some and not fun by others. Regardless if the game is good or bad. But the game in question is still factually good or bad.
---
if any one wants to go after fever blossom it's behind the cemetery in point pleasant.
---
Go to west tek and collect toxic goo from the large vats. Put then in your quick wheel and you have raddiation on demand
---
*tfw you really wanna just put a Russian flag up because why not*
---
well said
---
Dude, Bethesda bans people for making their game better. They delay shit that actually might improve the game while wasting no time in pushing out new monetization methods.
---
Bethesda has jumped the shark. Time to jump ship.
---
or you know you could contact customer service to get an answer vs farming for internet points. but ya know to each their own.
---
Well. I see your point, but I think the analogy is a bit too extreme. Anyway! 
---
Bethesdas anti cheat is to be quite frank, 110% useless. Not difficult to get around at all. Now, I'm no hacker or anything fancy, heck, I can barely code, but! I know there's literally a way to ban other players characters in game by flagging them as cheaters. True, this uses a third party thing and is Not intended but, if their security is so bad so things like this can be found on accident by pretty much amateurs, there's some serious problems on their side. This only goes to show what a skilled person with I'll intent could actually accomplish. 
---
Now, I'm not supposed to find this, but there are seriously the security similar to security of a house without a security system or a lock. All their anti cheat really does is scan for certain "names" of programs on your pc. It will flag you as a cheater if it detects any programs with such names running. I think it also recalls corrupt characters or such but not sure. My point being, security is horrible. I might be wrong on some of this, because, as I said, I'm Not good at any of this, but! 
---
The massive security risks. If people report such bugs, maybe they should be banned, but they won't if they get banned. Suspend them and actually thank them for pointing it out at max. Give them an actual human written comment on the situation and give updates. Bethesdas customer support is the worst, and if the people is working with community managers, suspend them at most and actually talk to them. 
---
You have a valid point, but I'm guessing you won't but your money in the bank if said bank has open vaults where people can just walk in and take money, and only thing preventing them from is a sign that says "Taking money from vault is against the banks terms of service". The game needs security. If Bethesda can't provide it, we as a community need to. But if we get banned for reporting such stuff, no one wants to do it. Especially not with Bethesdas horrible costumer service. 
---
Anyway. Maybe not the fancy answer you want, but I think it's important info. This will likely receive some hate for what it is,but ey.ask me whatever if you have questions Cx
---
Bullshit
---
If they can, I am 100% in. I asked for a refund a week in once I realized “oh this isn’t rough, it’s an alpha”. 
---
BGS told me to eat shit. Would be great to return the favor.
---
r/murderedbywords
---
why? the dude is just trying to at least talk to somebody about his problems since the company he dedicated his time to has completely forsaken him. And it doesn't sound like he wants anyone's sympathy, he just wants others that help Bethesda with bugs and exploits to know they can be permanently banned if they test bugs and exploits whatsoever.
---
I just wish that the build limits were squares instead of circles.
---
If you have to use bugs to counter a playstyle, that immediately makes you a trash pvper.
---
Your account was problably hijacked

For pvp first aid is good if you run with the healing mutation and even if you do not, however, this is more so for pvp and not pve. In Pvp it will be more useful when combined with Field Surgeon. The reason for this is because of the strange way these two cards work together. Field Surgeon will not give faster healing for the added % that first aid offers instead, it will burst heal for a normal Stim Pack worth of healing and then do a normal steady healing for the additional 45%. This comes in handy with pvp builds, as the burst healing will replace sudden drops of hp when combined with auto stem armor, revive armor, and Born survivor while the additional healing will steadily tick hp up along with Healing factor (provided you can get to an optimal range or break combat for healing factor to burst heal you even more.) 
---
In pve the added healing is only good if you are dealing with poison or have a limited supply of stimpacks. 
---
Additionally, Superstim packs become over powered heals for sudden drops in hp for yourself in both pvp and pve.
---
^
---
Things that are not going to happen.
---
You're allowed to like what you like. Nobody's saying that. The whole point I'm making is that Bethesda has made their prerogative very clear and it seems like some people are kind of in denial about it.
---
I find it very useful in pvp combined with born survivor and field surgeon
---
It's Fallout. Power Armor or bust.
---
Currently using a two shot 10% weight and stacking damage minigun #reks with the heavy gunner and heavy weapon perks but havent min maxed to be completely op yet. Switched over from a rifleman build because it just wasn't cutting it for me
---
I replied to the ticket, and haven't received any sort of answer. This is my first post anywhere about it, so I'm not trying to farm for any sort of internet points.
---
I see, That makes me fear a bit I wont be able to do it with my current character. (swift/stealth build) I might be wrong but it really feels like the vaults were designed with only power armor tank builds in mind.
---
Yeah, it just takes longer
---
no hes not a hero, no shit. He doesn't put out fires, he doesn't arrest criminals, he doesn't drive an ambulance, what he does is take his free time to help fix a fully launched game that is ruined by people that will never see a single warning, and for doing that he has been removed from bethesda's game with no response, no apologies, no explanation whatsoever or anything.   
---
It reminds me of my friends mother who was paralyzed for life from the waist down by the special needs child that she was looking after. Sure its terrible that it happened but the blame is hard to direct at either parties.
---
Usually doesn't but it absolutely affects this one.
---
I hadn't received any sort of notice prior to the suspension from bethesda since I first set up my account and purchased the game.
---
Blatant copy/paste of my answer but thank you for the input as well. 
---
