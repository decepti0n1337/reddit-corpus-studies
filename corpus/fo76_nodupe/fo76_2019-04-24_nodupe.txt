I hear a somewhat high pitched radio interference noise when I jump from a high place.
---
---
---
It basically just zooms in on the hand in the hello emote. They’ve pulled the same crap before but this is pretty pathetic.
---
Thanks for catching that. Didn't notice. Was just curious as to how they were getting their 4* legendaries.
---
They're not going to reply, I'm sure of it.
---
At least it works with all of the PA frames, all the others ignored Raider, Excavator, and Ultracite
---
Briefcase Bloodhound looks like its for finding those Volatile Material briefcases that give 1 nuclear material and nothing else. Even if it makes it so it gives more nuclear material, it still doesn't seem worth it. Nuclear material isn't that rare; we don't need a perk for more. Even if it sniffs out briefcases
---
Yeah, limited items are fine they just need to be a feasible price in the time given.
---
This is bethesda trying it out. Repair kits is how it starts. Then you can buy stim packs. Then mods. Then extra perk cards. It's a slippery slope.
---
get bloodied, get adrenal reaction, nerd rage and all the appropriate melee perks. get down to 10 health. that sucker will be 400 easy.
---
Yeah, same. Kinda makes me regret doing the beta.
---
So, what are the perks?
---
Oooh lemme shoot u a friend request because I'm having trouble atm
---
The point was that if they nerf item durability in the game and then sell repair kits, they might as well shut down. That kind of strategy is shady as hell. If that is what is happening and players find out, the game is dead.  
---

---
With all that being said, I hope it's just a stupid convenience item.
---
What happened?
---
Free fertilizer
---
Ok, but the thing is, even at $40, 20 years of inflation still puts that at the equivalent of $60+ in 2019 dollars.
---
Maybe never heard about that. I know the kill cyrpids challenge the flatwoods monster ciunted as both an alien and well a flatswoods monster
---
Swimming is barely used in this game, but reduced jumping AP usage could be useful
---
Do people actually use anything with less than 200% durability?  I could maybe see these stupid repair kits being somewhat useful at low levels, but even then, I'm throwing away more junk then I'm using for repairing anyways.
---
Who?
---
That's just a glitch, the paint is only supposed to be able to be applied to the Excavator suit while the Plague Rider is advertised as being usable on all armors
---
Repair kits in the atom shop
---
I heard a rumor about this.  If you attack a scorched creature when a passive scorchbeast is nearby, the scorchbeast will go aggro on you.  That's what I heard, anyway.
---
NP, figured it was a typo, but that's how it works.  Cheers!
---
lol you watch too much youtube, kid
---
Have it on my server on PS4, found her 2nd try at  cemetery! Gt xXLilRedYeadXx
---
'Genie' is an Anglicization of Djinn.
---
&gt;This is oddly a well balanced game in my opinion
---
That's... an interesting view point...
---
Clear you reserve space for FO76, it's a common problem after each update.
---
Idk but I would love to smack people half a mile like the World Series bat in FO4
---
What if the perfume is similar to the syringer where you cause effects on your enemies? Like paralysis, " drowsiness" not so much an instant sleep but you have reduced aim and what not. Maybe bring poison into weapons.
---
Workshop buildings last only as long as someone holds it.
---
Fortnite doesn't have nearly as much stuff to prioritize than Fallout. They run on different engines I believe.
---
There's usually always one in the cabinets in the Military Wing of the Enclave bunker, if not more. My record is five. In the main area with the terminals all looking at the map
---
People cheat, they always will. But unless you’re new, pa is weaker than good legendary armour.
---
PS4 found the tourist body out front of Bolton Green laying on the edge of the fountain.
---
Great, now all I have to do is... complete... Way of Enlightenment........
---
Both types of players have good chances of being deadly. It all depends on your strategy, gear and build. Think of all of those legendaries that people sold to vendors when the game first came out. Everyone thought they were crap. Now it’s the only stuff people want lol.
---
Who is Duecehead?
---
I've never bothered with those challenges so I wouldnt know. I was just trying to give you another option for the alien (if it even works)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
here is the post about it : [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9xuu1s/i\_think\_i\_found\_an\_alien\_body/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9xuu1s/i_think_i_found_an_alien_body/)
---
Ugh I would love if they went full Mothman on Point Pleasant, there's so much material to work with.
---
100% 
---
A raider or BoS handmade skin would make double all the atom shop income they’ve ever made, but yet they choose the useless box that will do wayyyyy more harm than its even worth... 
---
I think that’s why they want us to get used to it, so they can push us more and more into the pay for convenience hole, eg ammo converters and refrigerators
---
The biggest hurt for me is I love this world so much. I have so much fallout related stuff. Hoodies, shirts, bobbleheads, pipboys, etc.
---
I feel like this might genuinely kill interest in fallout. People already gave me shit for playing f76. Now they can all say "told you so", and if I wear my 76 hoodie I'm going to hear about it.
---
I don't care about the lost money. It's just another beloved franchise that's being killed for me. It sucks
---
[removed]
---
Douchhead? Is that real?
---
Even on a well built and powered PC this is still a problem.  Not sure exactly the cause not being a techie myself but it seems to be a deep rooted problem and not one a quick little patch will ever fix.
---
I have 3 decent 1-2* level 35 weapons I was going to offer up.  Let me know if you are interested in a two shot dragon, zealots gatling laser, or zealots fat man.  Like he said L35 isn't far ahead.
---
You get it from the bucket list quest
---
Every patch I look for all the hidden patch nerfs. Just saw that recipe's are removed from SBQ fights and something about legendary stuff and watoga.
---
Does it have provide any protection or stat buffs? Can you mod it to add?
---
Automatic pistols shred anything in their path in a stealth/crit build, but semi-auto pistols, especially revolvers, are pretty lackluster in comparison.
---
What about one of the robotic aliens?
---
**shudder.** What is that! :')
---
In my case a mix of weight reduction perks and + str.
---
It's okay to feel good about it player!
---
Where would one find these at?
---
Ah that one came out last patch. So there are no confirmed new ones with this patch? 
---
I've done 6 side quests since the last two patches before this one.
---
Yup. Watoga protectrons can no longer spawn as  a legendary. Which drives me crazy. That was, hands down, my favorite circuit to farm. 
---
Was the gear the best? No, of course not. Was it a relaxing way to get a few neat surprises before I crash at night? Hell yeah.
---
Did you do it?  I'm only level 28 and people keep saying to wait until I am higher up...
---
SWEET
---
Made 4 new characters lately took them all to the dam and it still hasn’t popped up for me yet
---
At this point I'm thinking PS4 might be glitched, honestly. I've been making a loop to each location  and server hopping after for the last 6 hours or so. If it IS a glitch, I hope we'll at least get some free atoms or something in compensation because I wasn't planning on spending my entire day off looking for the highly-anticipated new feature in a game.
---
$60 in skins, commitment
---
Nope and nope
---
+karma, cheers mate
---
I really don’t see the need for repair kits. I’m level like...118, and for the past 60 or so levels I would’ve only needed a repair kit once. I was doing a silo and just forgot to check the condition of my weapons before going in. Totally my fault. But that’s the only time.
---
It's not like there are millions playing. The player base has dropped off a cliff so precipitously since launch month that there's probably only a few hundred thousand playing at most across all platforms.
---
All my friends on Xbox (I play on PC) quit months ago.
---
Honestly, I think the "vocal minority" speaks for most of the majority that already quit playing. And now I and many others joined the latter ranks today.
---
I'm waiting for the update to download I forgot about it lol. I should have everything crafted in like 20 minutes I just have to get the PA frame
---
I spent 250 atoms on repair kits. Yet I haven't "bought" any I keep track of my earned and payed atoms and well I used earned to get them.
---
I met a German woman the other day. I took 4 years of German in high school and was able to communicate with her and we shared some laughs and items :)
---
I got that too.
---
No, I paid $47 for it - on launch day.  Amazon's awesome.
---
Wouldn't have been too hard to apply the textures and normals to the other armors. So lazy, and they didn't even do the same for the bone excavator
---
I did the same having my camp near. Dam that sucks lol
---
I will buy atoms and buy repair kits with it.
---
Could be buying all the power armor skins, but I’m not :).
---
Yeah, but then we’d need working plumbing or the portable would “break” after so many dumps
---
Bet it’s for repair kits...
---
Fornite’s graphics are rubbish and so is the game!
---
The VATS button is the zoom button. That should solve your first problem. Dunno about other lenses though
---
The bottom one is in store now, granted I was starting to think it was hype as well.  The 4 horseman stuff was mined a good while back.
---
Hey if you got money to blow go for it
---
Lol get fucked. No more griefing for you kiddo.
---
Ask them to remove their turrets instead of being a puss.
---
Anytime. Sn Mantrayne if the other guys doesnt get to ya first.
---
Legendary toilet... triple star...lol
---
Got it. Thank you!
---
makes you wonder why they need to put repair kits in the store if they can just make good skins that people want to buy.
---
If you’re in the sub right now then you already have the answers to your questions, literally sort by best or hot if you wanna know what’s going on, I’m not google
---
You had pascifist mode on.  Duh.
---
You're a saint
---
+karma
---
In survival.
---
No quests that I know of tied to the sheepsquatch, just the camera quest
---
Anyone find this yet
---
Looks like Team Rocket is blasting off agaaaiiiiiiin......
---
Looking for them now.
---
Heh, really haven’t gotten any games recently because nothings really caught my eye to play. Kinda picky on what I get. Next one is RAGE 2 though so gotta save a bit for that xD.
---
Make sure ya turn off the super duper perk when using it...ha!
---
White Knight was overpowered. No one wants to admit it, but 90% reduced cost and degradation was much better than any other durability perk in the game. They also fixed Fix it Good, allowing armor to be repaired to 200% durability (which is twice as good as a repair kit, of course). With the old White Knight and Fix it Good, repairing armor would have been completely trivialized.
---
Also, $60 was for the base game. Why would they make continue making content with the game without some way to monetize it? Why would any company? They wouldn't. You either charge for the content piecemeal, breaking up your playerbase, or find other ways to monetize it.
---
My strategy is simply buying Atoms only when there are time-limited items that I won't be able to obtain otherwise or when interesting things are going to be leaving the store forever.
---
It's gameplay influencing like it or not.
---
1. I cannot make them.
---
2. Now I need to use my material that another player doesn't.
---
This is like selling ammo in the store.
---
I don't like it. Yes it could be much worse but it's still bullshit especially after all the had press this game has gotten deserved or not
---
All games of service require extra revenue after release, you think people working for free after the release. This ain't Fallout 4 or 3, where a game was made, 4 DLCs created and thats it, support for the most part is done. Every games of service needs revenue to stay active, I don't care who it is.
---
Where's my beef burrito recipe when I need it?
---
Would be a lot of work to be honest. They need a dynamic bounding box that scales to the overall shape of the item with each mod, then use that to determine placement. 
---
That being said they have a army of slaves so no reason they can't do it.
---
Truth.  Probably the same people who said "I uninstalled!!!" about the TSE nerf, about the delays to content, about the patches, about the duplication, about fixing the duplication, every step of the way.  Karma drama is all it is.  I just bought some repair kits to have around for convenience.  Big deal.
---
that's probably why you're not a PR rep
---
why is literally every comment you make toxic? you contribute nothing to any of the topics you have commented on in at least the past day. What makes you feel like you absolutely need to constantly be overly aggressive about everything?
---
Yay, thank you
---
That's ok I'm sure youd be able to buy a plumbing repair kit in the atomic shop.
---
I checked. West Tek doesnt have enemies in the "do not make legendary" list.
---
I was checking the water park &amp; the carnival and then server hopping. Found him next to the car at the water park after about 10-15 server hops.
---
Oh I know... it's awful. There's a mod for Scorchbeast's if you're on PC that replaces their scream sounds with Pingu the penguin's "noot noot" sounds from the claymation children's show. It's far less irritating/discomfiting.
---
You don’t need to open the pip boy. Switch it to the quick boy instead.
---
Yeah at the vendor. I was hoping that something had changed after the update. But I've been back about a dozen times now looking for the shocks, and it's still the same old stuff :-(
---
Rage 2 looks good, but more excited for Cyberpunk and Outer Worlds myself
---
No
---
Probably future content.
---
Ok. Fine, since you seem to be hung up on that. But once again, those were for games that were complete, almost entirely bug free, and did not have a chunk carved out to make a dlc. Fallout 76 came out at $60, with no endgame other than a really poor repetitive loop, broken, unable to function without horribly ruining your experience, and an in game shop that is constantly thrust in your face. Which has more value?
---
Well... you see why.. You think buying repair kits started a shit storm.  Grinding is your thing, profit is Bethesda's
---
No It's a skin for it. You are unable to create it since its an atom shop item that hasn't been released and you are unable to get the entitlement for it.
---
Glad to help
---
I think it would be weirder if they DIDN'T participate in the sub with alts.
---
Me too, can’t wait for both of them also :D.
---
Cheers
---
I have invisible enemies that will hit me while they load into the map.
---
Right under a post about how good the power armor skins are and that people are buting atoms.
---
Various plans are more complicated... and should weigh 5 or more pounds.  Paper is heavy when you start carrying books around.
---
Hmm. Never had to myself. Interesting.
---
confirmed! Just did it
---
Lol yeah I'm a drama queen because I'm upset with Bethesda for adding P2W items to the game when they said they wouldn't. You're blind devotion to a company is troubling.
---
So you can pay real world money to avoid in game material costs and you don't see then problem? Someone without money to waste on atoms has to grind for repair materials, and you can just pony up a few bucks and repair all day long without using a single material? You don't see the issue with that?
---
Not going to stop people from buying atoms for good skins. Especially if I've played for 200+ hours on a game I only paid £45 for.
---
I've heard it too! I spun in a circle looking for it. Was thinking "the sheepsquatch went live!"
---
But na, it's just me.
---
TBH I kinda like that as an option, beats only seeing one one set at least.
---
5. Getting rid of Survival mode so players are coming together again and open up faction based pvp for those who are interested such stuff. Getting rid of Open-Pvp completely and make workshops worth more for faction based defending.
---
They are when you can buy them through the atom store.
---
You think it would be weird if people tried to keep their jobs?
---
Wow 500+ hours on that game and never knew that
---
You're talking in worst hypothetical actions to prove a point and the world doesn't work like that. We should speak facts not with our feelings or what we think might happen.
---
If they do your hypothetical thinking i'll jump on the wagon of disappointment, but i don't see it happening.
---
[Anne](https://imgur.com/a/jVjiT8H)
---
Dunno, ask bethesda PR reps
---
Yea that is entirely on me. At least i did admit that i was wrong and i just updated the post with a short apology.
---
Here’s a picture of Anne at the [Landview Lighthouse.](https://imgur.com/a/jVjiT8H)
---
Just killed the SB Queen, and I got 3 advanced repair kits.  
---
I really don't think we have to fear anything about the 100% one from the shop...
---
Doesn't happen everytime, or to everyone, but I see these same posts after every update. Can't tell how many times I've given this same answer.
---
same happened with that no way and it was around 200 and it just disappeared for me
---
I’m server hopping the water park right now. I thought it was my best bet
---
Ok cool!
---
Not until the item lvl is raised past 50
---
The Atom Shop is about rewarding players and making money. Stop the fucking complaining about an entertainment game company doing things to make money.
---
That is literally the only reason they exist. To make money.
---
Steps have been taken to help remove duped items. So you could say it has already "recovered" at least partially.  
---
I dont know if there will ever be a time when the economy is what it couldve been without duping.
---
Funny you should mention New Vegas, a game where you had the option of crafting a repair kit instead of buying it in a store if you so chose.
---
Honestly, the way this "quest" has been set up is sooo stupid. How is it fun to scour the whole map hunting for a dead tourist which could spawn anywhere in these locations at any area within them??
---
At least give some kind of clues. This is just annoying.
---
🖐🏻🎤
---
No just a mannequin
---
the website you used to host the image wants to send me notifications and has dirty ads about women in my area
---
I mean somehow the workbench repair bug went through which is something that would have taken 2 seconds to test and see. As a developer i check my stuff to make sure it works and doesnt impact the things around it and in this case that would have been the inspect screen since that was what was changed.
---
Here you go (or anyone else still looking), I just found it [https://i.imgur.com/eUt8Zxh.png](https://i.imgur.com/eUt8Zxh.png)
---
Don't see why this would be downvoted other than people being dumb. While it's not the main point against them, it's still a valid point. They haven't been needed, so they're not necessary for anyone that knows what they're doing.
---
lololol
---
And you could craft them or buy them from in game vendors.
---
&gt;Edit: ty nutsupreme
---
Lol out of context that's hilarious
---
Time to fully utilize my immunity to fall damage!
---
I know,  I was just too amused at the thought of America being the center of the Devils Backbone lol
---
So you have enough time to open up your pib boy, select the menu to view your weapon, scroll to your weapon, select repair with a repair kit, repair it, re select your weapon, before he kill you?
---
Or you do it the normal way, use your left d pad button, switch weapon amd kill the melee guy like we alway did it.
---
Being able to have discussions like a normal user without the onus of corporate control over their head and not being bombarded by users makes more sense than only participating in an official PR capacity.
---
We as the people paying for and playing this game should know when major parts of the game are changed. The fact that they felt that it wasnt important even with all the other flak about legendary stuff going on shows that they are VERY out of touch with the playerbase they are supposed to be representing.
---
They really should have been clear on that.  
---
I do like that it works on ALL PA though.  As someone that swaps sets around depending on what I'm doing its nice to have the option to at least use the skin.
---
I haven’t had a chance to play since the update how much do they cost?
---
Fully patch duping and release level 60 weapons problem solved
---
I’ve met a lot of awesome people on here and from the bazaar group! Making the wasteland a better place!
---
I kept wondering why I hated the game so much and felt like I wasted so much of my life on it. Level 126 its a fair bit. So I Loaded a save in Fallout 4 and found out...
---
The first thing was a companion who spoke to me, the next a raider who yelled when we started fighting, then saw a reporter and heard the first bit of her story... and I knew it wasn't just one thing but a combination of many...
---
Fallout 76 has no soul, dull storyline (nonexistent as there is zero interaction with any NPC and no reason to read or pay any attention to recorded voices), boring to sleep main protagonists the scorched who can't speak coherently, no companions, no other humans as bizarrely beyond all credibility all survivors of the nuclear attacks living outside prior to the player leaving the vault have died, seriously how lame is that.
---
How has it gone so badly off track? Trying to woo disappointed players with clothing items... pathetic.
---
Death pls.
---
Can I ask if anyone has been able to get the camera on PS4? I've been trying for it for the last 6 hours and been unable to find the tourist spawn.
---
I got a random encounter today with what looked like a nest with hay. Definitely not a deathclaw nest.
---
  
---
Heard a roar that I didnt recognize, but no squatch. Didnt have the outfit on me at the time. 
---
That and the Alien (separate from Flatwoods Monster) piqued my interest as well. 
---
Actually found the encounter at the spot where the Zetan bestiary submission in the Prima Guide is taken. At that stage of development, the Zetan dropped the Alien Blaster instead of its current static spawn. Makes me think they were originally meant to bea random encounter event and potentially had that removed when they decided to put the blaster in the safe. 
---
Most likely explanation is a copy/paste of all enemies classified as Cryptids, which includes those two as they're in the game files yet not readily available in game.
---
More fun explanation is the two of them being accessible.
---
Woot
---
No shit FO4 but were
---
Be careful
---
Same problem.
---
Found Anne at the Point Pleasant Mothman Museum. Laying in front of the statue.
---
Go to Quarry X3 (Green swimming in the bog)
---
There are two portable toilets and in one you’ll see a mr fuzzy hard hat
---
I mean, it's probably still better than having all the materials for fixing your weapons.
---
Currently queued up,world is full,

So if you don’t die from falling, could this be used as a free form of fast travel?
---
That's why PR workers aren't allowed to create alt accounts to talk about the company they represent. If the company found out they would be fired.
---
Honest question, do you have *any* idea how companies handle PR?
---
Ive learned its best to have 3 guns and a melee weapon.  
---
And knowledge of random workbenches and weapon smith stations
---
Yeah?
---
I just had people leave the server
---
so basically what you are saying is "im a troll and just like raging all over the place". honestly did you ever think that maybe the reps ignore a lot of what goes on in this reddit BECAUSE of people who are overly toxic/aggressive?
---
No problem
---
Repair kits remove any reason for luck of the draw, lucky break, and gunsmith. Thats up to **11 PERK POINTS** on cards that are now outclassed because you can just throw money to fix things. Thats 11 points you can spec for pvp advantage.
---
I agree, I don't think it was designed with Microtransactions in mind. I do think it's a ridiculous step back from 3/NV's repair system in that you can't do combination repairs of items. They could have just had the amount of CND you restore  dependent on a perk rank
---
Any idea what unlocked it? I took a picture of the Impostor Sheepsquatch during the event and it didn't count.
---
Poster collage is a reward from the new camera quest released 23th April. But i think you guys alreaady now that by now lol.
---
From what I've read, all mods got fixed except targeting hud
---
I took a picture of the Impostor Sheepsquatch during the event and it didn't count.
---
Edit : I'm still on the same server
---
It’s the same
---
That breaks it down really well, thank you! Guess I'll start picking up more T-51 as my everyday armor then.
---
Once you exit the game, you'll lose ownership of that workshop and you won't regain control when you log back in. I've seen unclaimed workshops that still had stuff built in them, so what you build seems to remain for a short time after you log out.
---
Public workshops in this game aren't really meant to be used like CAMPs or the workshops in Fallout 4. They're only as valuable as the resources you extract from them, or the events they spawn. Or PvP.
---
Yes. Can't tell how many times I've came across Graham or the responder bot and wanted to call everyone there.
---
Had to sign. With a second chance, hold him there with an alt account then fast travel to everyone to get them to visit Graham.
---
Server wide messaging would be awesome.
---
I could see it getting abused be at putting a 1 message per person per hour (or more) limit on it would alleviate that.
---
I use the T-60. By far my favorite PA.
---
I think they’ll nerf those said items or make newer and better items available that makes people want to dump the ones they have. 
---
Where’s the challenge of killing the SBQ in less than 2 minutes??? There is none. At what point does even that get boring or a newer game comes up... 
---
They might have higher levels of armor so people will have to upgrade at some point.
---
Or the game could be better designed so this nonsense isn't all but guaranteed. They had repair hammers in Morrowwind almost 30 years ago! They didnt have to make you buy the dang things.
---
As you said, why wouldn't they find ways to monetize it. But this introduces the problem of conflict of interests. On the one hand Bethesda wants to earn money, on the other hand they want to add more content for the game. There is a tension existing btw these 2 factors. Which is mainly why people are concerned about this.
---
You don’t have a backup weapon in this case.
---
Tbf I did build the Porto-shitter outside my players house, so I would love to actually use it
---
Nobody else had any kills
---
Well I know that the paint was part of the Dev room items, so I was just curious if they’d been “refound” like the BoS paints.  Thank you for answering :)
---
Wonderful.....

It's probably not that empty, I've been on them a few times and it only show two people when I passed by a lot more than that.
---
Wonderful....
---
Not a bad idea. Might stop the resurgence of topics about repair kits. 
---
Typically we liked the idea that people would post on the patch notes instead of making their own topics. But people want to be heard.
---
no one else had kills, dum dum
---
So if I reconnect quickly, Im going to find my stuff in the workshop? I alt+ f4 without thinking.
---
If Bethesda would hire you you’d do amazing things sir
---
I like it, but where’s the suit? Feels incomplete without a suit.
---
Even if they have 0 on a leaderboard stat, they still show up.
---
kid? Woo-boo... Look at you.. trying to act all tough on the internet... Fuck outta here.
---
Gotta get creative with it!! I rock the tux makes me feel like a bank robber 😈
---
Yeah, thanks for saying so, made me double check perks and sure enough, ammosmith was right where thru hiker should have been.
---
Cheers!
---
Yeah, for the love of God. I've wasted so much plastic bulking a bunch of stuff and then 'scrap all junk'ing from muscle memory.
---
When you actually bring up the leaderboard yes but not on the top 3 list
---
Are you still on?  My PC IGN is Steffydoll
---
No, but you are.
---
Thanks. Was hoping for more small quests for the mounted heads.

This game has a economy inside the game mechanics? I know that people trade items for absolutely high amount of caps without any reason, but how is that affecting my daily gameplay? I don't see other players that can destroy my game experience because they buy armor and weapons for 2k caps and higher from other people. As you said nothing is real what they are trading even the made up prices. A legendary is worth maybe 200-800 caps ingame and thats what IS real and probably never will change. If people want to go higher prices with their useless stuff then so be it i guess, doesn't affect me or someone else game experience so everything is fine. 
---
Something like that would definitely kill a MMos build in scripted economy system, but definitely not a casual themepark like f76.

I’m just an antisocial murderer at this point, but I’m glad I’m supported. I won’t kill you. &lt;3
---
This community has turned into trash, defending a company, not the game, for pulling this shit.
---
There’s a time machine?
---
Well you know what happens when you ASSume
---
Youtuber that Bethesda invited to the GreenBriar event for 76 before it launched.. Ends up talking shit about 76.. Ended up going back to making Fallout 4 mod videos.. because that's all he's good for.
---
Watoga has two I believe.
---
It’s hard not to die because it’s so unpredictable where it’ll sling you, but essentially yes. I’ve been testing it a lot, you can definitely control the direction you go in but not so much the height. I don’t have armor to negate fall damage, just goat legs, and I die all the time (it doesn’t seem to work in power armor)
---
You.
---
Yep took me a good 45 min at water park but at least I didn't waste caps, I was gonna give up went to different server to make a trade &amp; he was there on that server lol. Best luck 👍🏻
---
Umm.. it has to do with Easter lol ...As in Easter eggs.
---
Would be cool for them to leave comments in the book as well. However I see that just leading to text wieners (8==D) and profanities about mothers.
---
I care about my cat's opinion of Fallout more than I do Juicehead's.
---
Xbox, press the guide button while viewing photo, then press Y to screenshot it. Open the xbox app on PC and sign in. You can view the capture and download it to PC. Not the best solution...but a temporary one nonetheless.
---
Only if you join back in on the same server. You'll have to initiate a new claim on the shop though.
---
Ohhhhh please let me home run scorched over the mountains
---
I’m sick of this, I can’t take it anymore 
---
I was ok with it being cosmetic and camp items but now? This is not my fallout.
---
Just copy paste Text from different MMos that already have that xD
---
I guess, but good luck rejoining the same server. Especially if you're completely restarting the game, and not just backing out to the main menu. 
---
If someone in your friends list is still in that server you can join them and your stuff *should* still be there, but you might still need to go through the process of claiming the workshop again. But I've never tried that.
---
Looks like the big robot guys from wolfenstein the new order
---
Oooh i'm sure they'll change that soon enough.
---
Just visual.
---
The all get saved onto your screen shot storage. So you NEVER loose them. You just have keep the Golden Loading Screens 👍
---
Ok stupid question.
---
Plant crops at your camp.  Scrap everything, bulk what you don't think you will use or need and sell to vendors.  Do events in easy areas.  Find other similar-minded players to do quests with. :)
---
It’s another incentive to continue leveling indefinitely. Every five levels you get a perk card pack, each pack has one animated card. Meaning it would take a lot of levels and/or a lot of luck to get your perfect build with all animated perk cards. 
---
By having multiple avenues for player progression, you appeal to more people. Personally, I don’t care about maximizing my damage output. Frankly, I don’t really care about animated perk cards either, but I won’t lie and say I don’t feel good whenever I get an animated card for a perk I always use.
---
Haha nice I hope I get a chance before they patch
---
I’ll make sure to keep an eye out for you!
---
Nah, I lost my purified water :( happens.
---
He will be slumped outside passenger side of first burnt car you see as you enter, right in the middle can't miss him if he's there👍🏻
---
Damn straight.. Trust that meows opnions.
---
So you hosting sky diving lessons or nah? I see you’re experienced
---
None of the bodies are spawning I’m getting mad :(
---
I quit because Bethesda added P2W mechanics to a game that they said they wouldn't and instead of being upset about this community is blindly embracing their move because if they didn't it meant damning the game which it wouldn't. I actually enjoyed the game. I wish they added fucking gardening plots from F4 so I didn't have to have my crops exposed.
---
do the prop ones even count? if so then i wasted an hour trying to take pictures of one in flight.
---
As long as you're in PA and nowhere near fissures, I don't see why not.
---
Yeah from 17,500 to 22,000 caps!
---
Well that really sucks... thank you for the confirmation
---
You're my hero &lt;3
---
You'd be wrong.
---
Hooooly shit that is absurd but I am so gonna be messing with this for a while here. I tried it around watoga - doesn't seem to work in power armour but i somehow flew up northtowards the monorail elevator, down into the map then teleported south beyond the edge of the map where i got stuck. I was overencumbered so sadly had to ditch some stuff before i could fast travel back.
---
I left this game and sub a few months ago and checked back in to see what people thought of the new patch. Looks like very little has changed. Ignoring player feedback in lieu of milking a few dollars from the loyal people still hanging onto this game. And stealth changing things without any notice.
---
Haha, nope, it really gets under my skin
---
Its just cosmetic. My excavator looks like X0-1 but has my excavator stats.
---
I’ve got the first two down which is great but I tend to find my crops damaged and I can’t keep up with my fruit and veg rotting and have a severe lack fertiliser. Bulking isn’t something I’ve considered but I’ll keep that in mind. And what would be ok to sell to vendors?
---
Who hurt you?

Thank you so much!

Grow up.
---
Your blind devotion to a company is disheartening.
---
Yes. People exchange goods and services for currency, or other goods and services.   
---
If you've been wondering why people are excited for player vendors, it's because players vend things.
---
You mean the outfit in exchange for the head, or just give the outfit away for free period
---
I always know when someone has visited my camp because all the damn doors are left open.
---
Vendors buy any of your bulk materials.  For me, I scrap EVERYTHING, and sell mostly bulk glass/ceramic/steel/wood.  After your camp is built to how you like it you should sell whatever you won't need in the near future, or what is easily replaceable.
---
Still there?  Been server hopping for ages.
---
it's a fun mechanic to me. I just spoiled it by joining someone who already found it tho.
---
In other words, "Your opinions and our past promises don't mean jack shit. Give us money."
---
Who’s ansel?
---
Just chill out and dont get ahead of yourself. Focus on events in Forest and Toxic Valley.
---
Also, if you can show me where to get a non-Marine unyielding sentinel left arm for 200-800 caps, I will literally provide you with unlimited oral pleasure until the day you die.
---
I see immaturity is a strong suit for you.
---
Honestly I would stop playing for a bit. This whole thing is kinda gross.  I stopped a bit ago tho.  Have been watching from the sidelines to see if they would make things any better.  &gt;.&gt;   They are getting extra greedy without fixing bugs that have been around a rather long time still.   This is no test, if its in the code it will stay there.
---
Also, put a fence around your crops.
---
Ok I’ll keep myself in those areas for a bit, cheers!
---
I have it on my server at the Colonel Kelly Monument. All the way up the steps. Xbox GT: xKoKaneZombiex

It doesn't. I tried, it counts as an assaultron.

Easy we don't....
---
Ignorance is bliss.
---
Man, there have been so many more since I originally posted this.  At this point, I've simply moved on from Bethesda since they've gone full EA now.
---
You’re rad my dude🤘🏻
---
Anyone still on this server?
---
Ok thanks, this is all incredibly useful for me
---
An item that can directly effect game play even in it's simplest form is P2W and Bethesda knows it.
---
Thank you!!!!
---
Okay
---
Nothing ignorant here. I've kept up with the game since announcement. This is an opinion.
---
Just an FYI - the actual Mr. Fuzzy mascot head doesn't even work for this challenge.
---
I want to be able to do so in-game with other players. Not have harass people for contact information and use a third party program.
---
Thanks.  I found out what the problem is.  (See edit above.)  Sometimes, Bethesda is S.P.E.C.I.A.L.
---
I'm a pack mule always carrying at least 600 pounds and it never takes me even half that long. With fast travel there is no way it will take more than 10 mins unless you don't know a single static drop for resources
---
I pick up everything not nailed down and then bulk it/sell it.  There is a really good spot for plastic (used to bulk) I can show you sometime if you want.
---
Yeah for a minute
---
lol
---
I can think of an ingame advantage right now. The competative event at watoga highschool with the candy (cant think of the name off hand). Ive done it a few times and as far as i can tell you can just keep the event running as long as you dont leave. So defending from waves of enemies for loot suddenly all ur stuff is broken from farming and someone could just bump you out of ur 1st 2nd or 3rd spot by being able to repair instantly meanwhile ur getting whipped out every few hits cause ur neccessary gear is broken
---
I'll wait for you
---
All my laser weapons do just fine. Durability is good. Damage is good, only thing they need are a few more mods to round out their pool.
---
You're right, I'm just a 400lb loser incel that lives in my parents basement never had a job or education and knows nothing about human nature you got me.
---
I guess paying to not need lucky break, luck of the draw, and gunsmith; up to 11 perk points, isnt an advantage theyll admit to.
---
Thanks for your help. Much appreciated.
---
Stop defending P2W
---
The mothman at the lighthouse event counts as a sheepsquatch. Confirmed myself.
---
You don't need more than a few of each bulked item starting out.  Put up a turret or two (at least) or your stuff gets damaged quickly.
---
Big MT. Old world blues

Yeah, Fallout runs off of it's own engine where as Fortnite runs off of ... \*shrugs\* don't know, don't care.

Dead tourist. Starts the camera quest.

182,000 people subscribed , 500 upvotes
---
Are you using gunsmith? If you are, money for kits makes it redundant and useless. Thats a 5 perk point advantage. Then add lucky break.
---
Yeah it isn't that they exist, it is that they are willing to take money for something that should be purchasable or craft able within the game itself
---
This well reasoned explanation about the repair kit situation and the impending larger picture of pay-to-win or pay-for-convenience is going to go over the heads of about 50% of the people here.  Minds are made up. They are fine with BSG lying and selling P2W stuff in the Atoms store.  This is BSG's game not ours.  I've already given up about changing BSG's outlook  -- they will do what they will do until they get to the point where you won't play anymore. They will push the limits.  If they sense no limits, then it's going to P2W faster.  If they sense push back they'll slow it down but CONTINUE to push endlessly.  At this point it's obvious. They care about $$ from the Atom Store.  That's it. Not about making a good game, making players happy (unless it drives them to the Atom Store). Hope I can get another good year of playing before things are ruined completely or the game is shut down because not enough Atom money coming in.  Sad, but that's the state of the game industry now.
---
Hope I'm wrong, but I have a bad feeling this is only the begining...
---
F
---
No problem! Happy hunting!
---
Do you have the carnivore mutation?  If so, this is normal.
---
Thanks mate!
---
You don't need to be third person just fyi. Just can't be in power armor.
---
&gt; honestly did you ever think that maybe the reps ignore a lot of what goes on in this reddit BECAUSE of people who are overly toxic/aggressive?
---
No, they avoid commenting on threads like this because that's literally what you are told to do if your job involves PR you idiot.
---
They **cannot** comment on anything negative about the company they represent. They will not respond to you.
---
In comparrison to every single other gun out there .. they are extremely lack luster, lack the power and ofc the durability.
---
I am glad you're doing well with your build with them, but that does not deter the fact they are el basura, lol.
---
I somehow took a photo of a sheepsquatch and only need flatwood and alien. Do you know a place where i can find him consistently?
---
Just a minute ago someone posted that food and water weighed more, then it turned out they still had another perk card on instead. This sub has way too many posts based on feelings and hunches and no evidence. It's not like the game doesn't have enough real problems.
---
"Jontron is free to watch, but here's a list of things that aren't free:
---
Food!"
---
This makes no sense. Weapon degradation is based on damage done, ie a dragon doing 250 base damage degrades faster than a handmade doing 75. This makes it balanced to use extremely high damage guns versus a player with a lower, but more steady damage output. Armor on the other hand is where the problem really shows. Once you break a piece of armor in PVP it should be gone for good. Repair kits mean you can keep fighting without worrying about losing armor pieces. Also, when respawning from a death, the game places you a good amount of distance away from where you died, meaning you have ample time to repair before reengaging. And not everyone’s inventory looks like a bomb exploded in it or a waste dump. Some of my characters only carry three weapons, one set of armor, my PA frame, and aid items.  And if not, that’s why there are categories and sort options.
---
Out of curiosity have you bought atoms?
---
Ahh yes, thank you good sir.
---
Also, I still rarely leave the forest area to forage at lvl 28.  Just go where you feel confident and the areas where there are no higher-level players nearby (they spawn higher level enemies) to explore and loot.
---
First, congrats for not whining that the main quest is too hard.  
---
Second, when i hit those hurdles, I went for a walkabout.  Tried to discover all the places in the forest, did more events, especially Grafton Days, and got the pharma and cando perks. Also set up.a loot loop going through the waterpark, hunting lodge, and clarksburg in the North.
---
For me it’s to set priorities, don’t need all stuff from AS, so far there was only few thing I liked and I have been playing from day 1. Still got over 7000 atoms left and waiting for something really good. Hope those data mined skins will pop up. And I’m not doing any challenges, just exploring the world and still getting lot of atoms to save for future.
---
It’s a custom sound with the cosmetic nukashine paint that’s mistakenly applied to all power armor.
---
I'm betting there won't be enough incentive to reset your character.  I just don't have faith in their ability to pull this off.
---
Going out in the world hunting for supplies to repair my stuff with gives me something to do. Why would I spend atoms to play less of the game
---
Thank you for alllllll of this ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
---
Then I can kinda get behind it, they wanted a specific look..it beats the "you can use this skin on this specific weapon/armor type" they usually do all hollow, anyway.
---
Imagine being able to add it to your inventory and just leave it on the front porch of someone's camp in an item bag
---
For real, where are the faction items?
---
Why are you being so dramatic about it, just go play it if you want to give it another go.
---
Oh you must be a stock holder who saw their financial reports for the past year to know just how much they are suffering financially. Oh wait.
---
I’m a relatively new player, a friend of mine got it for me because his other friends backed out. I love it so far! I was surprised about how nice everyone has been so far. I like the idea of being in the wasteland, hearing a gunshot from another part of say the same building and running into another player. It’s really cool.
---
I’ve been a fan of fallout for a long time, I enjoyed all of the games, and I’d say 76 feels like Fallout game through and through. The unpredictability factor in having other people there is probably the best part. It has its glitches but I would give it another try. It really can’t hurt.
---
Can someone link me to a genie subreddit? Thanks.
---
There are way better ways to make money than this garbage. And those other forms of buying and selling caps are against the ToS for a reason
---
What the hell
---
I zoned in, forgot about the bots until i had all of them on me...so glad i just made a bunch of ammo for my rocket launcher.  Got it!
---
LMAO. That's exactly it.
---
The one with him taking off his power armor helmet is called "Fashion Finder".  It will be something that increases your chance of finding outfits in containers.  Bet on it.
---
Whales in 76 are entirely different than whales in a mobile game. Much smaller scale.
---
Yeah for about 10 minutes.
---
What a deal! I'm on it.
---
I like it dry with as much teeth as possible.
---
What platform are you on?
---
I set up my camp near the train station at Morgantown and my crops almost never damaged, especially compared to when I was in the Savage divide.
---
PSN Neojinnx, can come now
---
Are you on PS4?
---
PS4
---
I too am looking for it. I ran out of caps fast traveling to all the listed locations and server hopping, now im juat sitting at the miners monument switching servers hoping to find it.
---
And if someone tells me the miners monument isnt one of the locations i am going to lose my goddamn mind.
---
Firstly thank you, I try to keep a good grasp on when I’m out of my depth and clearly being a low level implies if I venture too far in the game without levelling it’s gonna be difficult.
---
Secondly I’ll focus on exploring for a little bit then, see what I can find, and I’ll be sure to check out those areas and that event. Thanks for the advice!
---
While funny, it really upsets me just how poor this game is put together. I love it so much but it will always be viewed as somewhat of a joke because of the consistency stuff like this happens,
---
It's over he has the high ground. Obi-wan would approve
---
Get back to me ASAP
---
Yup
---
Sometimes I forget to swap back to White Knight after I put on Ammosmith and I’m like “wtf my arm is half broken already???”, that perk really is huge
---
I had just joined the server and had 0. We were the only two on.
---
lazy people. honestly repair kits themselves are stupid as hell but my problem is the precedent it sets for the atomic shop.
---
No, I think it was a company trying to make something a bit different that was way outside the safe place of the old crew.  
---
And I have no problem with that.  This is their learning curve for the future.  I knew it coming in.  
---
And because I expected it to be a buggy mess (I have played all of them), it hasn’t really bothered me as much as it probably should because they’ve been addressing stuff faster than most of the online games I’ve played.  I’m not paying a subscription and I’m getting new content.  I’m not buying their shop money, but I’m getting crap I want from it with very little grind.  
---
I have issues with this game, but they are outweighed by the enjoyment I’m getting in return.  
---
Your mileage may vary.
---
Probably getting off soon if someone wants to log in an take it over.
---
PSN?
---
So it doesn’t even give you the stat bonuses that you’d have for some of the other under armors?
---
Totally not that dead.  I was on one earlier with 3 people.
---
Good side is, I did the weekly challenge in about 30 minutes, and didn't get shot at.
---
If it worked that way I wouldn’t have shown up as number two with 15 seconds on the server and 0 kills.
---
Yeah, I love this game but this one is a gigantic oversight. And far from the first one.
---
Wow this is some great stuff, thank you.
---
Pigboy0921
---
Or maybe it's a house fire and he's just giving his opinion. I dont even know who this guy is but I agree with him lol.
---
Do you remember when the Rad Worms glitch was a thing?  You could jump so high with Marsupial that when you hit the ground in power armor you got the stagger you get when you jump off a cliff.  It was slightly annoying, but it wasn't game-breaking.
---
The issue is that even if they’re not adding repair kits maliciously, it still affects game balance. It’s unavoidable.
---
If repair kits are useful and desirable to buy with real money, because repairing with materials isn’t fun, then that means repair costs are too high. This isn’t work. This is a game, for fun. Nobody should have to make a choice between paying real money or dealing with game systems that are intentionally tedious. If it’s not because of maliciousness, trying to get people to buy repair kits, then it’s simply bad game design. Grinding in games is one thing, but when the grind is balanced with pay2skip in mind, it creates problems.
---
If repair kits aren’t useful and the only people who buy them are either lazy or stupid... then repair kits are a failure as a source of revenue. Meaning bad game design.
---
The issue isn’t that repair kits will ruin everything and only people who pay money get to be powerful etc etc. The issue is that, at best, it’s bad game design. At worst, it’s malicious.
---
Well it seema the flatwood monster doesnt count as an alien so good luck. Other have posted some alien bodys that might work havent tested yet myself
---
Nice! Have a great night
---
Not sure what the mutation does but "jump costs no AP" sounds reasonable?
---
This community's blind devotion to Bethesda saddens me. Adding something to a pay wall that can give a player boost over another, even in it's simplest form, is P2W; you know it, I know it, and Bethesda knows it. I had no qualms to the atom store or even the creation club as I made purchases on them as well. No the creation club isn't P2W and trying to argue it is shows you don't know what you're talking about.
---
That’s the point. Lasers aren’t meant to be stronger than ballistic guns. They are infantry weapons. Not DMR or one hit wonders or any of these top tier weapons. 
---
As for durability maxed weapons artisan and running gunsmith 5 will go a long way. I’m lucky if I need to repair any of my lasers and plasma guns about twice a week.  In fact the only time I need to max repair them is after a Queen right which I’m using 2-3 different models depending on the stage of the fight.
---
I tried taking one of the impostor but was with a team of jokers that never used pylon and it was always cloacked so i don't think it was that.
---
Then i found the mothman from the event,megasloth and fog crawler from tanagra town, snallygaster at toxic larry.
---
I took a picture of my own deathclaw,could be it. There's a new challenge in the " world" section and i'm at 43/76, so i don't really know as i took photos of many animals today.
---
I believe it's just bugged and everyone will unlock it without the real sheepsquatch.
---
Any perk I use to avoid vats? Have dodgey
---
they dont have the raw damage to overcome the damage threshold calculations, while also having no armor penetration perk = worst damage per minute in the game, even next to like a hunting rifle.  
---
auto pistol works cause conc fire is honestly quite broken + ammo conservation is out the window, but you give some things up for being able to kill
---
I am doing the same myself
---
If you have rank 2 of starched genes you will keep the mutation. I don’t know about serums.
---
Ignorance is no excuse
---
Lmao you just back some wonderful memories
---
LMFAO imagine wasting money because an internet post made you angry
---
Your lips are moving. And you're complaining. That's whinging.
---
Got her. Come to me, PSN Neojinnx
---
Adding a mechanic that can provide a boost to a player, even in it's simplest form, behind a pay wall is P2W and your blind devotion to a company that thinks they can get away with it is disheartening.
---
Did you actually it left on your d-pad? It may have been empty that’s fine but from the photo you showed here it in no way proves it was empty. Players with zero kills will not show up on the small pop-up other than yourself
---
Did you really try to play the SJW card for "people who don't want the game fucked with by pay to win mechanics?" 
---
What the fuck do you think an SJW is?
---
You've contracted MUD BUTT
---
Got her. Come to me PSN Neojinnx

I found mine earlier on stream at Miner's Monument. Slap on the Travel Agent perk and go on a tour. You should find it pretty quick.
---
You can also check /r/market76 for other players sharing when they find it.
---
Really hope Monster Muffler is a perk related to tanking, whether it increases threat or decreases threat. Really need perks aimed at traditional roles to be able to push dungeons forward.
---
I mean it is in the under armor tag of the store that’s why it’s at the bottom
---
Im buying 50 just to give the cry babies on the sub something to wet themselves about.   You guys really need lives if this is that important to you 😂
---
Depends are you in the southern hemisphere because I am and if u are not you will likely not be on when I am
---
You make the mistake of implying that anyone even wants Repair Kits in their current state to begin with.
---
Do you have any bloodied weapons ?
---
I think they should just accept that they completely failed with fallout 76 and let it go. They keep pushing to make it better with more content but then that content end up being for example: a shot dungeon with some ghouls and robots and not even a real quest. I’ll admit I enjoyed it a little and got to around lvl 60 but the game becomes null and way too “Grindy” way early on. And those who are really committed to grinding grind for HOURS on end with not a whole lot in the way of rewards. I say Bethesda should accept 76 where it’s at and focus all they have on something else.
---
Aweome, i Sent a friend request
---
its also 8 dollars overpriced.
---
It's a skin not a paint job. It will always be the x 01. It will make all the other PA look like an x 01
---
Wish I had gold to give you 😂

Ergo, he was the only one with a kill, and you and every other player were tied for second.

Scrounge up every cap you can (there are lots of tips out there) and when you have around 1800 and some grape mentats get yourself to the Whitesprings (enter via the train station and run to avoid any ghouls). Go to the free states vendor bit and buy yourself the handmade rifle plans. Assuming you have three points in gunsmith you can start pumping out these babies (for the upgrades) and you’ll have a much better rifle early on which can make short work of a lot of enemies. I was super lucky on my first two scrapping of built guns... got the drum magazine and hardened mods, meaning I can go 80 shots without reloading. All by level 17.
---
I’ll join too
---
Did you fix the camera first?
---
Yessir
---
Yes
---
That could possibly be so fucking annoying but I agree.
---
Please not. It would be cool for 5 minutes and then just annoying.
---
Any with bloodied explosive 90% reduced weight?
---
Lol this happened to me too. I didn't even have the camera out, it was just the last thing I had equip
---
https://youtu.be/JU6ZCy_mssc
---
Actually just found it as you commented. Thank you though!
---
Correct me if I'm wrong... but there aren't currently any bows ingame right? Is this a sign for a stealth archer build we have all been hoping for?! Can I finally roleplay my Dovahkiin?!
---
Still on that server?
---
Murphy's law lol
---
Here’s a bug, picked up the camera, tape, and bucket list from colonel Kelly monument corpse, fast travelled home to build camera, reloaded, now I have no list, so how am I supposed to know that to take pictures of?
---
Bethesda, pay less attention to the damn shop, and more attention to quest mechanics.
---
STILL falling thru map when I spawn in 1st time, STILL having to reload guns before firing 1st time. Xbox one x
---
PC but probably a different universe. When the black was available, all 6 were in the camp section at the bottom in the atom show.

Yeah, got the same issue myself. Haven't tested to see if restarting the game fixes it.
---
Late at night I sometimes encounter Japanese players.  One had a hot-mic and speakers...  I got to hear the Watoga vendor bot speaking in Japanese.  It was everything I never knew I needed.
---
Soooo you know where all the stuff is and are loaded, not everyone is that way
---
They just copy pasted a lot of things over from previous games. Thats why it looks so similar to fallout 4. Even the scorchbeasts have code copy pasted from the dragons in Skyrim. Mentions the elder dragons and other types. Not much effort went into the game.
---
It’s also poorly optimised, I completely agree, but it does sound like your computer probably isn’t up to par.
---
You're a drama queen because no one is going to buy this shit anyway and it has zero impact on your game play.
---
Then what were you doing in pvp before the arrival of those repair kit without a back up weapon? 
---
When your gun broke down you just admit defeat?
---
They should show on your map. At least on mine they did.
---
The mods for this forum hate Fallout 76. It's that simple.
---
This was a horrible location
---
You'll just have to stop by and see ;)
---
And here too
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Bucket_List
---
They aren't
---
You rock
---
“Pay for convenience” is a problem too, when most people bought the game under the belief that the Atom Shop was strictly for cosmetics. Any item Bethesda adds that does anything other than look nice spits in the face of their earlier promises.
---
The first time I went into the burrows, most of the tables, chairs etc failed to load, including all the terminals. Trying to complete the quest with no terminals was.......fun. Had to quit to desktop twice before the place would be properly dressed.
---
To be honest I agree with you that there are probably Bethesda employees shilling here under the radar but I wouldn't expect the PR people to be doing that.  Especially if they're not paid/authorized to do so.
---
This is so not right that it is sad. Currently, I can farm for 30-45 minutes and make 1400 caps. Alternatively I could farm for legendaries and get a bunch of junk. The reason usable legendary weapons cost so much is the rarity of that item and the time invested to acquire it. You could go a year plus of playing and never see a bloodied explosive weapon it you could spend a month or so of caps and buy one.
---
Also, I just noticed that I lost everything during the event.  Uranium fever, so it was like 400lbs of weps, mole miner suit parts, armor, ammo, etc.  Infuriating, but indicates that it did the server revert to previous load thing....
---
Yes but hurry I’m about to get off
---
Hmm, try re-reading The Bucket List note again that'll  also tell you where you need to go.
---
Ill do what the fuck I want thanks stranger on the internet
---
Indeed. It didn't work either way, haha. I ended up just using BAE, extracting all of it to the Data folder, and running Baka. Problem solved!
---
Yeah honestly I agree it would be annoying on half the map, but It could be a nice feature. Gives a little to the game. I mean, you could just take off the sunglasses.  
---
Or at least put a lens glare on all glasses, be a nice added touch i'd say.
---
Maybe you should read up on promissory estoppel and maybe try drinking bleach you daft cunt
---
So.... why the repair kits? I’m not spending real world on them, sorry
---
Thanks
---
Its in the atom shop for 500 atoms. I bought it thinking cool this will work great for my assaultron head since I use it as a backup  but nope its not popping up as a skin and it is only popping up as a whole new weapon. Once I get home I can make a video showing it.
---
I’m on now for about an hour or so if you’re still interested
---
So I ended up just extracting everything (overwriting per my preferences), and using Baka to pack it all, which worked perfectly. Thank you so much, I really appreciate it.
---
Any lever actions, if so I’m interested
---
I don't understand that logic, at all. Lasers are super heated plasma. Which to the best of my knowledge is more powerful than a bullet, by a far margin.
---
What we have here is clearly a desgin choice and a bad one at that. As in fo4 energy weapons were quite good and on par with their ballistic counterparts. Where a energy build was more than viable to play throughout the whole game.
---
In 76 I can count the times on one hand I've run into a energy gun user. Most carter to the opinion they're bad and need a buff.
---
I also am not sure how you get sooooo many shots with your energy weapon between repairs, but I don't get very many when I use them, at all {Had a bloodied lazer rifle that lasted 2 reloads before it needed repair}. Which is why I stopped using them all together as I've had better results with higher damage outputs with even pipe guns. With far less in repair times in between.
---
And also on top of that as i mentionned, if you dont have a back up weapon youre dead anyway.
---
The time to open up your pib boy to go and repair your weapon, well the melee rusher will have had killed you
---
He could also have had time to switch weapon to kill you from a distance also.
---
stealthboys. other than that, no. crits are a hard counter to assassin/sentinel.
---
They still haven't learned the lesson of testing a build before pushing it out.  Pretty amazing they are this big and still manage to make such simple mistakes.
---
I would assume the rate in which people have been buying atoms has already been going down rather drastically. All the cosmetics being pretty average and with all the long term players having just earned the good ones, I don't think they see any negatives pushing crap like repair kits unless you make it much more clear.
---
As someone who **loves** climbing up things like this, I approve!
---
I had recently tried getting back on top of the building by going through the Mayor's Office but either by design or glitch, I wasn't able to push the button in the Elevator... Well, since I was fortunate enough to loot the T-45 and T-60 Jetpack plans recently, I slapped it on my T-60 and went about getting back up there on my own! I took a few nice pics, myself, on one of the ledges half-way up. (I'm too lazy to transfer them off my desktop, I apologize!)
---
I had tried getting up there with my Jetpack, via the crisscrossed metalwork, but it wasn't happening lol I might try it from the mountain like the one comment suggested, though!
---
However, one small correction... That's not a Rad Storm, it's just a normal rain cloud. :(  
---
The Rad Storm is a *giant,* green, wall of a cloud, with lightning bolts shooting across it. 
---
I have a good picture of one, so if I remember after my play session tonight, I'll transfer them here onto my laptop and post them all. *(I'm weird, I don't surf the web on my desktop, it's purely for gaming.)*
---
Without as much as fervent apologist wrakoon is insulting everyone across the sub they might as well be paid by bethesda.
---
I'm not the only one who went through it. I met many people today while hopping that also got screwed over. Luckily there are kind people holding the corpse. But seriously the game disconnects you if you read the bucket list. That's complete BS.
---
Your sarcasm meter is outa wack. I joke, because this second round ofoverreactions to insignificant Atom shop items have become especially tedious. 
---
None of it is P2W, and calling it such, is at best, histrionics, and at worst, purposely disingenuous.
---
I'm not devoted to Bethesda, and I think the vast majority of people feel as I do. We just don't care either way.
---
Right, which is why I wante dto ask if there was some sneakychange or I was just a moron.
---
I'm inclined to think I'm an idiot, but, you know … money's involved, so.
---
Stop being so damn melodramatic. Holy hell. Are you able to find joy in *anything* with that attitude?
---
If they shut it down (I highly doubt it) then it would be Bethesda's fault. 
---
I didn't support this game from beta as a charity to Bethesda. I did it because I like Fallout and I love survival games but I do not support the business tactics that they're currently employing and so I choose to no longer support them. 
---
I encourage others to as well otherwise this trend will continue as other game developers try to emulate the "success" of their predecessors. 
---
If these items ever get removed then I will gladly return! I somehow doubt that will ever happen though.
---
Found mine at the top of the lighthouse
---
Cheap fast travel.
---
Tinfoil hat atom challenge isn't today, you can put that thing back in your stash.
---
Yeah, it's certainly odd.
---
Ranger armor.
---
Please, for all that is holy, put some god damned Ranger armor in the atom shop.
---
I’d drop 2K on it in a second.
---
Use the God damn search and you could have saved yourself these embarrassment the last idiot that ranted about this ended up with.
---
I figured I’d do it later and he was right in front of me when I spawned at white spring on a car at the front door.
---
At least it’s not a tick blood margarita. Corpse seeds and flux for the base tequila. WTF
---
It reminds me of getting smacked by a giant in Skyrim, but the frame drop and subsequent lock up or disconnect makes it extra scary.
---
Go check the walls (posters) in any train station. Most of the new stuff they added starts there! Good luck!
---
No, it’s because of whiny entitled jackoffs like you who think you’re owed anything.
---
I go on long walks when I’m playing alone just to open up new map places. Climb all towers. Pick up everything. Scrap when you find a bench. I have opened up so many quests and side quests and optional quests and dailies just doing this. The more places you have open the better, because when you die out in the wild you’ll be hoping you know the area so you can respawn close by. 
---
Make fertilizer with spoiled veggies to repair your crops. Have tato, corn, and muttfruit at your camp so you can cook it into vegetable paste and then scrap it for adhesive. 
---
Level up, scrap old crap weapons, learn new plans. Scrap scrap scrap, and sell sell sell.  
---
I like my home established and decorated, so do that if it’s your jam. Work on it. Some players like theirs portable. Whatever rustles your jimmies. I play with my house a lot and prefer working on power armor, crafting, etc there. 
---
Wanna grind? Find a way to repel radiation and hit Nuke zones. Club the greenies. One hit will get you XP when someone stronger can kill. Hit, run, collect. Repeat. Go home when you’re tired :)
---
There’s so much more to say, but that’s enough. This game is perfect for someone who likes a variety of things to do. Have fun.
---
Hi. What platform? I’m also looking on Xbox.
---
Nonsensical controls _on a console_ as opposed to the PC version.  Well that's a new one.  Wow.
---
Maybe I’ll hold off on doing the quest line then. I’m assuming that the camera isn’t supposed to actually teleport you.
---
I guess we'll agree to disagree. 
---
I won't be buying the kits, because I have absolutely no use for them. And I have no qualms with those that do buy them, because they are funding the free dlc that I get to enjoy.
---
In my opinion, I paid for the game, and I've been playing it since without spending any extra dollars. Those that are actually spending money on the game have no advantage over me in my eyes. They are, however, paying the bills keeping the game going and keeping those new add ons flowing.
---
If they add full on new weapons or armor to the shop that I can't obtain in game, then I will become upset. 
---
The repair kits don't bother me any at all though.
---
I feel you but then again I just got done playing Metro Exodus.
---
The initial loading screen was insane. But yes I'd still take that over loading every single place you go to.
---
Did I mention it was at the game border.
---
This is not pay to win. This is pay for convenience. Regardless, I will not buy them. It's not even an item I would farm the SBQ for. Never felt I needed such an item as it gives no advantage over anything meaningful in the game.
---
I would much rather see some of those sweet datamined skins available for sale though...what's the hold up on that?
---
Thanks!
---
Alright if you insist... Ill tell you. -inhaled- ahhh.... YOURE MISSING THE POINT! YOU ARE NOT DOING EVERYTHING LIKE YOU SHOULD! D-DOWNVOTE! DOWNVOTE! DOWNVOTE!.....AND...UH.... GO WATCH...UH... GRASS GROW OR PAINT DRY OR SOMETHING YA... GOPHER!!! ...
---
there how was that? Did i do it right?
---
Lol. You didn’t pay for any of the latest updates. We all got them for free. Stop being disingenuous.
---
Thanks for asking, PC here.
---
Bear arms lowers heavy gun weight by 90% at lvl 3
---
pretty cheesy how the sheepsqatch instantly explodes and the body goes invis in pieces..
---
I'll try it thx
---
I disagree. That will make a lot of people OP. A lot are already OP with the right legendaries
---
Pay for exp. Is literally pay to win....
---
I left you some serums. If someone hasn't grabbed them yet
---
Hahahahaha My thoughts exactly. Maybe they should add some more content that was from previous games. And take for fucking ever doing it.
---
Oh there's hope yet
---
Kx2
---
This would only work of it wasn't abused... But yes please!! (Maybe cap on points per special?
---
Idk by not putting a level cap they really fucked the whole system as is i could see putting 10 points here or there but its just plain not ballanced for that.
---
All the level 400ish players ive seen would just instantly whipe everyone out and we already have that problem with legendary weapons
---
PS4? I’m leveling a character and want someone to play witg
---
I could see that being a thing. I'm hoping its "Bonus DR when wearing matching PA" but yours makes more sense.
---
crit to the head and gank with autos? that's well known at this point, no?
---
It's an exageration, but they are not at all rare, if you look around every single named location has at least one workbench of one type or another, ok, some only have cooking pots, but most have more than one type you can use to repair or scrap on the fly.
---
Let me look go ahead and head on over and see if there's anything else you want
---
What’s the challenge for it
---
Why would they do this when they've already said they'll be doing a prestige system at 50?
---
I’d recommend you check for a Facebook group. I think PC has the biggest community. Good luck.
---
Yup lol
---
Welcome !
---
No? She says specifically the human body can only take only so much surgery she didn't say hey just because your the courier your more than human so here have all the upgrades.
---
Also if you have other characters I can hold it for you.
---
Still there ??
---
They can be heard just fine posting in a megathread. Having 100 redundant posts cluttering up the front page is fucking ridiculous.
---
I am actually
---
I see you on. I am available now if u r
---
I think the real question is how colossal your bowel movements are to gain +20lbs carry weight
---
I'm thinking greatly increased speed, or reducing the AP cost to 0, since knives aren't really that good.
---
I agree with you, definitely.
---
But the funniest shit is, there is literally a "let's take a picture emote"
---
Did that seriously NOT come up in play testing???
---
WAS there playtesting at all? rofl
---
oh look another troll. please try to actually contribute to the topic at hand. if you have nothing to contribute and only want to be toxic then this is not the place for you.
---
Is this going to be $18 again?!
---
“Can’t wait.”
---
Of which they have plenty. If the game cannot survive off of purely cosmetic items in the store, which is what was promised, then it is a failure.
---
Sure, I’ll head to my camp.
---
Try flatwoods that's where I saw it.
---
Good on ya! I actually had to ask people to get there camera then jump server earlier as I had a queue. I was on that server for hours.
---
yeah. I am already in ur server
---
What are they going to do when the prestige players reach level 50 again in 3 days? Double prestige? And then double double prestige?
---
OOh. good find.  I wanted to change the appearance of my Ultracite Armor....
---
**ALERT! PROTECT THE BRIEFCASE!**
---
I feel like yes but who knows. I repaired three pieces today when typically I can go a few days but maybe my opponents were stronger 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Cool. I’m on my way to my camp.
---
This
---
That's why i use a traveling leather coat in-game
---
I suggest nude selfies.
---
True im just spitballing some damage perks
---
Oddly that totally was an option in Fallout 4's Vault-Tec DLC.  So they could pretty easily do it.
---
Is there a max limit on pc?
---
maybe you hid them on accident. check pipboy
---
Just added you
---
What you talkin bout, Willis
---
Yes, actually. That limit she mentions, and the following sentence where she tells you that the healthier you are, the more implants you can take, is meant to explain that your Endurance determines how many implants your character can have.
---
_cries in NCR ranger veteran armor_
---
psst there are even beer keg skins that are in the atom shop item list in the data files :X
---
New players won't know where things are, but the map isn't that big. By level 50 you should have most of the map explored, by level 70 or 80 you should be familiar with most areas
---
They are going to introduce legendary players in some update, but there is not more to know about what they mean by it or how will that work. Just remember reading about it, probably in the road plan.
---
Perfect timing to test my new immunity to fall damage!
---
repaints being lazy cashgrabs isn't a personal opinion, it's a fact. there's a reason why it's the first thing everybody does when a game becomes mod-able, because it's braindead and literally anyone could do it.
---
meanwhile stuff like the raider excavator and horsemen require actual effort, something Bethesda is clearly not a fan of. so the way I see it, this is the first worthwhile content added to the shop in **months**.
---
Haven't heard of it, nope
---
Do you really think they don't know Reddit is an angry cesspool by now? If not, I am *sure* Forbs or Kotaku will tell them for us.
---
Added. Make your way over!
---
Right? Holding in 20 pounds of shit? Though, I guess it has been a while..
---
It’s generally believed that the mirror grid in the guns are misaligned and or not tuned right. Also we know lore wise the AER series of laser guns weren’t fully ready for full military use. We see it being used but not as the standard gun. So maybe the damage is supposed to be off. 
---
And I’m trying to test and find proof that legendary effects are causing more durability lose on use. It would explain why some weapons last years and other the day.
---
I'm not being sarcastic and it is P2W.
---
They aren't there, can someone please just tell me where to take a picture to complete the quest
---
Horrible analogy.
---
Yea I like this idea I'm lvl 350 I would be buff
---
Here here!
---
Well you’re in the right place if you’re looking for free advice...
---
Thanks a lot.
---
Or the game puts you in the world before you can even move and you die by the time you can take control of your character? Fuck that. They've had decades to fix that. Every damn game. They won't. I've stopped having any faith.
---
Thank you I appreciate it man!
---
I can’t be on until about 9 mtn time
---
the same question applies to literally everything else in this game. something's broken in Fo76? wow, color me surprised.
---
lol.  Try taking a workshop. You'll soon see the not  so friendly side of the savage divide. But most people are super friendly and I agree it's not like other games in that regard.
---
Get this to r/all!!!!! Instead of wasting money on repair kits buy this guy platinum please!
---
12 runs and only 2, 1 star legendaries so far. Much lower statistics than before the patch. Need to run more to get a better idea but so far, definitely a lot less.
---
EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.
---
I guess it's impossible to try to convince someone who's devoted to defending a company that's implementing P2W mechanics.
---
I had to get extremely close to a vertibot for it to count.
---
This is the reason I didnt care about repair kits. If you use them, your still literally 100% less repaired than me.
---
Is that the one with the green-scarf thingy? Never liked that the head-hole diameter is so large, but i’ll try some different outfit combos with it.
---
Bethesda: First worthwhile Atom shop skins in months
---
Community: BEGIN COMPLAINING
---
I made a vaultish base with like 8 doors (lvl 3 locks) with 2 powered keypad doors leading in/out of my base with 10 missile turret I only had enough room for 4 each crop and 2 non essential crops (gourd is a example) with 2 purifiers. Believe me the sacrifices hurt me inside. If you want a superfarm your gonna need a prebuild neutral place to place camp in.
---
No problem!
---
Are you though?
---
Nobody liked the Repair Kits yet you guys still added them.
---
I use it with a white gasmask and a green hood, looks nice
---
As a consumer, this sounds lovely on paper, but definitely has a host of issues that become insane when the ingame currency is too easy to obtain vs the exchange value. 
---
As a business, this is frankly asinine if it's not done extremely well and with a lot of investment. Like having an entire team of economists working towards the ever constant balancing act that it would be (like EVE online for example, which does have a team(s)).
---
This is not the simple thing you might be thinking it is.
---
Still there?
---
The imposter Sheepsquatch counts for the challenge. Also counts for the take photos of robots challenge.
---
I'll look for it I'll find it though
---
Robots don’t take breaks lol
---
You dont see the big picture. The perks are made redundant by throwing money at repair kits. Meaning 11+ perk point advantage for people using them for non repair stuff.
---
Or either a hunter's long coat, said gasmask and a black cowboy hat
---
K thx
---
Yeah, if only there was a way to repair already. And possibility of repairing 200 percent instead and get a huge melee or armor bonus. 
---
Oh wait. There is.
---
More power to you.
---
Workshops seem like a waste of time to me. So I haven't bothered since really early on in the game.
---
The flatwoods monster is a Zetan, you can see through his helmet in photomode when you kill huim
---
I'm eating a bull of cereal and listening to Dick Shale mess up his lines. Absolutely

You that real MVP.
---
Hopefully it happens the right way.
---
Damn their flimsy technology. Honestly didn't even know that about the laser in the fallout universe.
---
That would also be something I'd be interested in the results of. It could be a game changer if you find out something no one knew about yet.
---
250ish.
---
people were complaining before. I know I was. tired of checking the atom shop every week only to see repaints and ugh, repair kits.
---
if they want this game to succeed as a service, or rather, if they want my cash, then put effort into the items.
---
+karma thanks so much
---
There were higher level players in the area before you, most likely.  
---
Server hop or go do something else in game for a while.   I think I was about 20 before moving on with the raider questline
---
brave gamer located
---
Hmmm, seems like you should served hop. What platform are you on?
---
Was it worth all the ammo and chems though?
---
Ok thx I thought neutral robots (yes still red but not attacking) stops spawning those types since there's no enemy in range.
---
Since people most people don't buy atoms we probably just shouldn't buy them I mean I know most people won't but if almost no one does they might focus more on good skins
---
Or, some people are mature and realize AAA developers are in this business to make money, not listen to crybaby teens constantly crying about the games too easy, now it’s too hard, I’m bored, I want more content, but I don’t like this new content. You guys should develop your own game tailored to your personal likings. Bethesda isn’t listening to this endless complaining and I don’t blame them.
---
He da real PVP
---
[Time for this thing to make an hd comeback (hopefully)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Spore_carrier)
---
That guy stole your sweet roll!
---
Check that you haven’t invited more people before , and kick or wait until it clear
---
+karma Thank you. Stop by anytime.
---
Queued be there as soon as I can. Thanks a lot man.
---
everything over level 50 is classified as just a larger number, and more time to flesh out builds. if you struggle with explosive weapons use fireproof perk, and if NON power armor, the Dense torso mod
---
These are all really good ideas!  Do a search for "factions" on the FO76 page. There are quite a few really good discussions put out there as well.
---
Exactly this.
---
Point is you'll  never STOP complaining.
---
Oooff
---
Greed.

Kinda, in a sort of "Oh god, is that a bodybag, that must be a bad car wreck" kind of way.
---
If you are lucky you can get a quad crossbow. Have to reload every bolt individually but can rapid fire them.
---
tl;dr - Bethesda
---
No problem !
---
I read the wiki. I'm saddened I forgot such a legendary game
---
Because they need to hire real gamers or wait until Reddit notices :)
---
I'm pretty sure you have to buy the improved kits or make them yourselves.

ok a month then
---
Oh I hope they have vault tec or raider types.
---
I mean, no, nope. I play in passive and I stow my crap. If I lose any its what I just now picked up. No real loss.
---
go to a workshop with a Vertibot landing pad with your camera out. repair the pad and take a photo before it takes off and gets out of range
---
On PC.
---
Thank you!
---
Gotcha. Didn't know the spawning worked like that but good to know!
---
I was just planning to do this as nothing else seems to mark it off
---
I agree, Bethesda really owes us A LOT more for the $0 we are paying for this post-game release content. I may just have to ask for a refund for all the money I’ve paid for these recent DLCs.
---
I slapped a prime frame on a 1* anti armor crossbow. It was pretty good for sneaking around with and doing the 76 scorched challenge. They could use some extra mods though. I recently saw a tooltip on the loading screen that mentioned the exotic weapons perk that effects crossbows and black powder weapons so maybe they're getting some attention in the future.
---
“The seed of a plant that smells horrid and material literally taken from a nuke site? Ima eat that!”
---
I run power armor due to being a Packrat :)i dont normally engage in battles but it seems that whenever i take over a workbench  someone troll me . and in just a few shots im dead. Il ltry the fireproof perk see if that helps
---
thanks
---
Now equip power armor then your set.
---
Here's a picture I made of them all lined up.
---
https://i.redd.it/jbtygyxyw5q21.jpg
---
you have to be close enough to everything you take a photo of, it can be a pain.
---
*I* was being sarcastic, and joking in my post. 
---
We're unfortunately going to continue to disagree (I know, right?) on the Atom shop stuff.
---
Hang out around whitespring and pick up the leftovers of high level players. Shit, if you see me (EthanATX, on PC) online hmu and I'll make you a set of armor.
---
I’m pretty sure you’d get brain damage if you read 50 subreddits...
---
So, er, is it worth playing now?
---
At first glimpse I thought it was a level 36 SCREWED YAO GIAI.
---
I love it.
---
My post is a discussion and nothing like "Beth Plz". Hours late and wrong? Bad supervision.
---
I’d rather you not be in game but there you are.
---
Going to be leaving area soon, will stay on server so body should still be there. Will try and add anyone else comes .
---
make sure you do some server hopping. different servers will provide different chances
---
Enemies can walk and shoot through doors sometimes, even locked ones.
---
I will try to make it
---
I actually LOLed
---
There’s something wrong happening, that’s for sure.
---
Upvote for edit lol
---
They announced that the content updates would be free so I guess that could factor in to people buying it/the cost. What's not true is OP saying Bethesda represent the player.
---
 While it might be true Bethesda are ignoring feedback (which I doubt but if it were me I would given the beg/rage fest this subreddit turned into), there's every possibility implementations of them are being worked on in a different version of the game. 
---
OP just doing the usual armchair developer/designer/manager shit.
---
not true. I'd stop complaining if they fixed all the glaring bugs and stopped wasting times on useless cashgrab additions, like repair kits, and used that time to create worthwhile additions.

Really disappointed and frustrated that Besthesda is releasing incomplete patch notes. Did you know the Queen no longer drops serum recipes (as of the April 8 patch)?  It wasn't in the notes, so I only found out today. Other changes that Bethesda hasn't told us about can be found here. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgk6y5/dear_bethesda_can_we_get_an_official_response_on/
---
They should. I’m in the same boat and I’ve spent 1k on sale items already.
---
I hope theres another jim sterling. He really knows how to annunciate to really make it sting.
---
Sounds like a great set. I’ll take a look when I get the chance. Thanks!
---
Yes.
---
You think *this* is a F2P monstrosity in design? Or even close? Cause if so, you've never actually observed one in action. F2P gating is terrible precisely because it blocks normal *gameplay* advancement behind paywalls. At no point are you going to need repair kits to continue playing, any more than you'll need atoms to speed up harvester production for 10 minutes. Even if they went full bullshit and added weapons and armor, it still would not be as bad as actual F2P garbage unless they massively, overbearingly made them OP.
---
Don’t forget about the random blood you squeezed out of a gigantic tick. Mmmmm
---
It does. Don't spread false info
---
You're welcome
---
This is awesome, good job!
---
Too bad it's not a tse
---
Well my hope is the purveyor will allow you to, with some work and a bit of luck, work up your own gear to what you like.  Will be a tricky balance to have too much luck needed vs writing your own gear.  That will nullify a lot of that market.
---
Sadly with the way things have worked out as of late, I’m expecting the purveyor to be a huge let down.
---
Depends on platform, I've seen over 1k on PS4
---
Seems like the yes's have it so far
---
I took a picture of a Mirelurk Deep King or Glowing Mirelurk King at the Wendigo Cave and it counted as a Sheepsquatch picture.
---
I have a lot of saved atoms and I just bought half a dozen of them. You want one?
---
I completely agree. But, mega-threads aren't useful to stop the 100 posts if users still feel like they need to post outside of it because they're not being heard. Then, when we start clearing out posts that are redundant, users complain that we're limiting their right to speak out, or are shills. It's always a lose-lose. It's typically why the mods tend to be aloof, even outside of this sub. We're always open to suggestion, but not everyone will be happy, and reddit has a lot of vocal people. One idea can make 100 people happy, and 1,000 people angry.
---
Idk but hopefully it's good
---
Ill takeover for a bit. About to eat dinner now. Everybody can add my PSN: Markooshy
---
Not a bad idea
---
Have a 2shot explosive handmade don’t use at all, but it does not shot like the others
---
Not entirely
---
👍
---
Yeah, well, ya know, that's just like, your opinion, man.
---
Based on what the PC guys have data mines both zealots and hunters applies.
---
I used to hate the game but I love it now, however Bethesda screwed up HUGE here. So he has a right to hate on this. They flat out closed their ears on this subject. Juicehead does good work with his video too, leave him be.
---
Wheelbarrows!
---
Lmao
---
So if I use a Stealth Boy Mark III I can use it over and over? 😈
---
Moderation got nerfed in the last patch.
---
Any new quest that are active now other than "bucket list"
---
Where is it? I have not found it.
---
I bet they've sold at least $10k in atoms use for purchase of repair kits already. You are not everybody, mate. There are oh so many people out there who do not care, and buy them anyhow because they want to. Reddit is not the home of the mighty internet crusader, its an echo board, a place for people to get all righteous and angry over little shit and then get affirmation from other people who get angry over the same little shit. It's basically Tumblr with a focus on things other than SJW's and Anti-vax garbage.
---
They fix the issue of being unable to attach mods yet?
---
Might be something for nuke cards
---
I have a Bowie knife with swing speed and furious, it rips it up man
---
Yes, if you move it closer to the border, it will generally load you in closer to the center. You can move it to the cardinal points to check which location is better for you. I was loading on the edge of my house (backside) and had to keep moving it around the circle until I found the "sweet spot" to have me appear in front of my door. If you build on a cliff, the C.A.M.P sweet spot may be actually over the cliff to have you load on the opposite side. 
---
There have been suggestions to Bethesda to have you spawn at the C.A.M.P. location in front of it. That actually makes more sense than the current system.
---
Yeah. Really wish the game was actually loaded for me when it's loaded for the npc's. It's not a bit of fun being attacked by invisible enemies or recently just a pair of scorch legs that cannot be shot at. But they can sure as hell attack you. The only thing that could damage the legs was my tesla coils and unstable isotopes. Weapons both melee and ranged were completely ineffective.
---
Dropping you into gameplay then "loaded. JK, let's freeze your controls and screen another 10-20 seconds" is garbage.
---
You the best
---
ok buddy
---
It also makes any repair perks redundant. Lucky break, gunsmith, luck of the draw...11+ perk points to now change for an advantage. Repair worries are all gone.
---
If it helps, it's kinda close to the normal bartender bot on the second floor, as I recall.
---
It's ridiculously funny. I hope nobody gets banned for this cause it's pretty fun going ***YEEET*** across the map
---
I will be uploading raw un edited with no annoying commentary or input footage in a bit uploading as I type this

I'll take over if you're still there
---
I'll add you, thanks
---
I am hoping for the addition of NPCs to breath a bit more life into Appalachia but also being able to turn your CAMP into a settlement by increasing the build size and budget.  It would allow us to rebuild by establishing societies.  I found a great spot and wish I could turn it into a scrappy settlement like Megaton.

Repair Kits aren’t pay to win in my opinion, yes they allow players to repair their weapons but if you stock up on the materials for it you can repair your weapon just as much as they can. Yes they’re paying for it but I really don’t think it’s a big deal and I highly doubt this is the first of more to come, they made a statement with today’s patch that if the repair kits gave a competitive advantage that they would take appropriate action and I believe they still are committed to the game not being pay to win.
---
I just did the two quests I picked up at the taxidermy shop, idk if they're new, but no new heads so far.
---
Idk why but everytime theres a new update, my gallery gets completely empty. I can still see the pictures in the ps4 gallery but the in game photo gallery is deleted, everytime.
---
I need to know who has ever bought atoms to begin with.
---
No, it's fear mongering. That's all this shit has ever been. These kits do not, whatsoever, give you an advantage over another player. In fact they gimp you. 
---
Take this scenario for instance: You're minding your own business in survival, i come along and start opening fire on you, your shit's nearly about to break. So you, open your pipboy, go into your little menu, dig through your inventory to find the item that's about to break, then you go into another menu and then another one until it says "would you like to repair with a repair kit?". Because you're in a menu, you are nothing more than a sitting duck, basically begging to be killed while you repair your armor or gun or what have you. There is literally nothing stopping me from killing you while you're in that menu or your pipboy trying to use your 50 atom repair kit. By the time you've respawned, I've looted your corpse and fucked off to another area, perhaps I've even left the game.
---
Explain to me how that gives you an advantage over anyone when you are literally, physically, not able to fight while you're trying to repair your shit.
---
You can craft it in this too. Or at least i'm pretty sure you can since the "Improved repair kits" don't have an atom shop thing next to it.
---
Completely not the case, don't base your decision to not play this game by the minority of haters.
---
Kx3
---
Your post hasn't been removed. Nor have the other 5 posts that have to do with repair kits and the addition of non-cosmetic items to the Atom store. I was reminding other users that might see this thread, and create their own, that this topic has been retired. Because of the update, and it's resurgence on reddit, I feel like the conversation should continue. It should just be limited to a few places, and not 1,000 posts, like last week.
---
Also, I live in Japan and I was asleep. Sorry about the 2 hours I missed. :(
---
Youre right, repair kits seem like they’re useless to anybody who actually, you know, plays the game. Looting junk is easy and it’s supposed to be fun. Not sure why I would ever pay real money to skip playing the game? It feels backwards.
---
But that’s precisely why it’s a problem. Either repair kits are maliciously intended to make people pay more money by making repair costs high enough to warrant them, or they’re effectively useless and both a failure as a revenue source as well as wasted design space.
---
Basically, at best, it’s bad game design. That’s why there’s an uproar. If you like the game it’s easy to look past, but it’s still not good.
---
I created an imgur account and uploaded pics from my phone

That's Elvis level colon power (look it up if you don't know what I am talking about, it's friggen impressive)

Presumably you continue to prestige, and it gets harder and harder to reach 50? Dunno.

I dont know if you are trolling or not but the Zealot affix doesnt apply to SBs and the Queen, only prime receivers do bonus damage against them. There was however a debacle back then that the Queen and her ilk are technically (and canonically) labeled as animals so the Hunter affix should affect them, that however remained unconfirmed.
---
May 23 actually
---
im not really understanding how to replicate it
---
need moar time
---
I’m Canadian and I have friends from my country, the USA, Sweden, Croatia and the UK from this game.  :D

The terminal is right inside man. Just keep your distance and play it slow or run past get in and use the terminal.
---
im still there so hopefully soon
---
Unfortunately I probably won't be on until saturday after tonight :/

Crafting Civil War outfits used to cost 1 gold and 3 cloth, and sold for 21 caps with my Charisma.  Now they cost 5 cloth to make, and sell for 17 caps.
---
Not a big deal, but I didn't see it mentioned anywhere
---
Yeah for bugs, this one is funny as hell
---
good luck, other guy said he is in queue, im still there though
---
It doesn’t work in Power Armor. Not sure why the card doesn’t state that.
---
Hey, that's pretty great for comparisons! I did mine in a larger format on Ultra texture settings to get as much detail as I could, but that meant putting them all in one frame was impossible. :)
---
Im in queue too, but I want the camera
---
1. Go to third person 
---
2. Hold camera 
---
3. Jump and do emote at the same time 
---
4 . Go into inminent death and possibly getting your account flagged
---
The terminal is the first part, then you have to kill the guy farther in for his key fragment.
---
I mean, I can easily drop $60 taking my wife to see a 90 minute movie. Getting even a dozen hours of entertainment out of a game seems like a way better deal.
---
How is it a lore break? Repair kits would exist just like Stimpaks. A limited amount and later people will learn to make homemade ones.
---
Upvoting for appropriate use of “?” emote

Appalachian Antiques (outside Watoga) and next to Fort Defiance has a level 3 safe on the first floor behind the counter. It often has awesome plans in it including the Deathclaw Gauntlet. I have gotten Gauss Rifle, Power Fist, and some other good ones. 
---
The same rule applies, pick the lock, nothing good... leave it and server hop.
---
Leave team and resend invites... multiple reasons why but leaving team and doing it over works.
---
Read the list and it highlights the areas on your map with circles. If it doesnt happen then actually read the list and go to where it doesnt have checked off on the list.
---
 You on now?  I can hop on for a bit.  PM me your PSN ID
---
Try taking off all of your perks and gear then log in and put it back on.
---
PC?  Just finished as well same time as your post.  Body Re-Cloaked, could still loot if you could find it.
---
Can you go into more detail about the crit damage card and legendary effect?
---
You don’t even need to jump. Just get your camera out and do any emote
---
T don't have a list
---
Oh uea forgot about that. I did it at 22. Just took my time
---
I can probably help. PSN is thebeard74
---
there was a post a few days ago stating the opposite
---
Being naked helps too
---
I miss the perception bonus from glasses
---
I'm taking that as a maybe.
---
&gt;	Literally quitting the game because of this? Such bullshit!
---
FTFY
---
I’ve been looking for two hours. I’m annoyed. I have a massive cross stitch I could be doing, but I really wanted to get this camera business started. Fuckin hell.
---
I am not far enough to really know what it does or what a tse is haha - happy cake day!
---
It's on the body where you got the camera.
---
Yeah, we killed it in 4 minutes. So yes? Sorry if you can’t lol
---
PC
---
Nothing but blood stained rocks where she died. It seemed like everyone else got loot.
---
Not true deleting them from the capture gallery deletes them in game too sadly.
---
No. It’s clear from your posts you’re confused and believe to some degree that this is already happening. You complain about a level 200 1-hitting th8ngs it takes you 10+ hits to kill, yet in the original post you want highlevels to get... more power? You realize that that would just make that level 200 that much more powerful than you? And the people who exploited to crazy levels (I’ve seen 600’s in game, and heard of higher) would just be gods?
---
No. 
---
There’s no level cap to allow for adjustment and flexibility. 
---
There’s a special cap to keep it from becoming a game of nolifes and exploiters over everyone else.
---
Yeah. Here’s hoping.
---
Thx, I’ll be sure to give it a shot
---
these have a lot of the same animations as stuff thats currently in the game albeit a little changed. im not really expecting much out of them
---
sent!
---
I figured I was just shooting harder...
---
There was a detailed post that hit the top spot recently where someone dug into the files to determine what creatures count as what. Can't find the link but the same guy also points out that exterminators prefix works on mirelurks and bugs. That post outlines that zealots weapons work on all 'scorched' creatures
---
No Xbox sorry.

Unless you are from the U.K. or something, he's on the Driver's side. And to lessen confusion, let's just call it the left side of the car. :)

Joining you now

I just put mine in a suitcase at Watoga station, hee hee!

Update:
---
I waited around and eventually a meat pile appeared and I was able to loot it. So go back and see if there's a meat pile
---
Sometimes the body will eventually turn into a metal pile that you can loot. I've had the same problem with it being invisible on several occasions.
---
Sent a friend request!
---
Well, it does for the half dozen other people who've made this post today.
---
That perk was dropped I believe. But my thought was we might get some stuff for them in the pioneer Scouts patch coming soon.
---
&gt;... bow and arrow weapon that has been in the files since launch
---
You can't escape the Skyrim stealth archer build.
---
Yeah but jumping will suspend you in the air and load you in the game with an error.
---
While doing whilst the ground you just stop when you hit a surface pretty harmful unless pretty high or big space
---
Goes by total poundage and not the # of players :-)
---
Great. But would you be saying the same thing g if you didn’t have the legendary effects?
---
I got 2 at the same time I'm sorry. Can you tell me which one is you, or can you invite me?

All those things are sounding awesome, i guess no plan to bring human NPC yet or maybe they want to hide it for a surprise or something in the future.

I am now hyped and excited for the future \^\^

---
&gt;Buying repair kits that you can use to gain an advantage over other people in survival who don’t have them because they don’t or can’t spend money on the game is a great example of pay to win.
---
What an advantage, wowee, you get to die quicker while you're in your pipboy trying to repair your shit because you somehow forgot the game doesn't pause while you're in your pipboy. By the time you've finished repairing your shit, I'll have killed you and made off with your loot. 
---
This is truly an advantage you have over me. Wowee.
---
I try to hook people up when I can. It makes up for the dickheads in this game
---
This.
---
A  meat pile did appear after a few minutes and I was able to loot it. And yes my loot was very underwhelming.
---
Could the Nuclear Winter tape be from the perspective of Eckhart? I'm not sure of his fate.
---
Dude, seriously.   This isn't a shitty p2w mechanic.  Did you read the page?  Theres practically .0001% you will win a fight ONLY BECAUSE of that repair kit.
---
You babies are acting like if a fight happened and you broke your weapon you just repair it and kill the person.  No, you're stupid enough to go around with no condition on your gear you die before it's done repairing.
---
Guess what?  Nobodys going to buy them becaues it's stupid and a waste of money.  Your crybaby campaign isn't going to do anything.
---
Is that the left when sitting in the drivers seat, or when looking at the car from the front?    /s
---
Alrighty then I guess I get to relive my post due to all the negativity.
---
Ah, I wasn't sure because they do have a habit of leaking stuff out ahead of schedule.
---
Nobody gives a damn what a small minority of the community is wrongly crying about.
---
What could fashion finder be?
---
I have a two shot lever with crits doing 50% more damage. When I use my bloody build, it takes big chunks out of scorchbeasts, super mutants and such. When I add the perk that puts +40% crit damage, I should be getting a 90% crit damage boost.
---
But when I put the card on, my damage actually drops significantly. Almost like it’s negating the legendary effect and card. I thought maybe it was the server, so I hopped around and tried again with the same results. If I take the card off, my crit damage returns to the lever +50% damage.
---
I’m unsure if it’s a bug with the card or the lever. It’s the only gun that I have that I can properly gauge how much extra is being taken off, since it takes consistently the same amount of damage off, from the same general distance.
---
I was pretty excited when I found that lever. I actually considered making a crit build for just that gun. But after being horribly disappointed, I put it in my stash to collect dust.
---
You do launch up inclines so even doing it up a tiny hill will send you into space.
---
Checked a few times seems like about 20% of my damage is somehow missing, wish i remembered what damage my other guns done before so i knew if its across the board or not
---
Another quick doubt, when I played the beta, the loading screens were varied, I mean, most of them were betutiful images of the game, and when I play today all the loading screens are the stupid card that you make at the beggining of the game. They changed this or
---
You have to farm raw flux and some other materials from Nuke zones and then craft the stable flux. Then you can build jetpack. Have you already learned the right plan?
---
They cared and then noticed how everyone complaining was wrong, and their stance on the issue doesn't add up.  Just because a minority of people think something is pay to win, doesn't actually make it pay to win.
---
It's how back when everyone thought the earth was flat, that didn't mean the earth was flat.
---
Kind of agree
---
PSN is joeytnsf in PST if you are online happy to help...
---
SHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. I can hear the gimp hammer coming down on my beloved gatling......
---
No, I enjoy it, I just thought it seemed to borrows a lot from other games and it seemed to be suited for a more general group of gamers, than older Bethesda games is all.
---
Yea, mine just went down to base damage. I found the bug because I was curious whether or not the vats crit would affect the second bullet or not.
---
I'm happy to run through a silo with you if you're on xbox. My GT is the same as my reddit name, so just shoot me a message here or on XBL.

It doesn’t happen in power armor. But my unyielding sniper has double acrobats, zero fall damage! I want to play.
---
Request sent!
---
You summed up the whole situation perfectly.
---
Adding an item to the store that would only be purchased by players doing the game wrong isn't pay to win.  It's a dumb pointless item.
---
Ah fair enough, the general consensus this subreddit has had a while back was that zealot's only did bonus against scorched mobs due to the wording effects of prime receivers which was "more damage against scorched and scorchbeasts." So peole separated the two. Nevertheless, thank you for the clarification.
---
As soon as they raise the gear level cap past 50 all that gear becomes obsolute "ish"

What kind of armor are you trying to mod? I have 2 calibrated shocks for T-60 if you wanna buy them.
---
You show offline.
---
Just got it, still here!

If you can't finish it by then, when you've evolved into a human jellyfish, learn to play.
---
"You found a new bug" that literally everybody on reddit is talking about lol
---
Hopefully its a bug and not another sneaky nerf
---
It should still rotate in the default loading screens, but pictures you take using Photo Mode (and the new equippable camera) will also appear as loading screens. If that was the only picture you took, that may be why.
---
I was hoarding legendary items in my stash, but lately I have been getting so many good items that there is just not enough space. I have been shoving them in cash registers and lunch boxes in the train stations. Some are 3\* items. I will wait and see what the vendor actually does. 
---
Fasnacht Parade was awesome. I was so looking forward to Sheepsquatch, and  I was disappointed. So I am just going to wait and see what the vendor actually does. 
---
Another player I met was asking about my weapons. I told him it seemed like I got 1 good weapon for every 30 pieces of armor. Oh and if I get one more set of Ultralight Marine Armor plans... I might just have to hurt someone.  9/10 times lately the weapons have been useless. Who is really looking for a mutant killing walking cane? A furious Gauss Rifle? If I have to hit it about 8x to get to max damage, I would have already reloaded and it should be REALLY DEAD except the SBQ.
---
I say plaguetato
---
You hear me postman? I said ride!
---
It was prior to the patch but it wouldn’t be shocking. Finding a lever with those exact perks isn’t easy. I’ve actually never seen another one of them on reddit or found.
---
Not really. Especially not in that game where the real benefit comes from skill points and gear. And it wouldn't be pay to win in 76 either, where level scaling screws with PvP.
---
Cool map. It's worth a shot to test out. I think I have some free time tomorrow afternoon to nuke that location.

So far on my check list after nuking,

Blackwater Mine
---
Csgo made so much money off gun skins a black market formed to sell them for thousands. 
---
Skins make money if you create value. Repair kits dont create value they create negative response. Theyre milking a dead horse instead of a farms worth of cows.
---
Yep. Workshops are getting harder and harder to justify taking over. 
---
If I had an alternate source of acid I would hardly worry about them.

Even if someone is willing to pay 25k caps, I couldnt accept it as I never have zero caps. But that’s reddit’s fault not the game, if they raise cap prices on reddit will just go up anyway
---
He dead as a MF
---
I enjoy the game, I was just making an observation based on how it feel. 
---
And it like you said it’s a new style of game for the company. 
---
I was just talking about how it seems to borrow from other games and media and seems kinda chopped up at times.
---
No, I might change my mind if they do, buy I doubt it. I feel the only think that will save the franchises owned by them is a complete upper management shake up including the greedy CEO.
---
Sweet phot info....nudge nudge any chance we can get in game images framed or poster prints for our camps?  I’d buy atoms for this.
---
\&gt; It is an advantage. 
---
No, it literally is not. 
---
\&gt; If you have irl money you can repair anywhere at the punch of a card. 
---
By the time you're done repairing your shit, i will have killed you and made off with whatever loot you have on your corpse. You know why? because this game does not pause when you go into a menu or your pipboy and you have to go into your pipboy, dig through your inventory to find whatever item it is that broke, inspect it, then click a button saying "repair" and then click another button telling you what repair kit you want to use (basic or improved), then a confirmation. 
---
By the time you find your item, you're dead and in the respawn screen. You know why that is? Because I would have kept shooting at you or beating the absolute shit out of you until you go down while you're in your pipboy because you, physically, can't fight back. 
---
Truly, truly an advantage. It's like you people don't understand how battle works.
---
Dying from spawning in midair has not failed to crash my game so far

Ok. I had an L instead of an I. Now I found you and world is full...

I get that fake shadow and hall of mirrors on PC too. It really is noticeable to me in the Mire.

Aaaaannnndddddd it disconnected me from the server when I died.

I have the same problem. I'm not even surprised just disappointed

That's nice.. I don't care :)

You need to fix your perk cards ..you should be pretty close to one hitting enemies as well.

You rock, thanks

Some people can't find their own ass in the dark with the aid of a map and a flashlight....

Was there anything in the code that mentioned a Scouting Uniform?

This is the line where i wont ever ask anyone to play again. We’re going through abusive relationship levels where promises are broke but we haven’t figured out how to leave. But im keeping my stuff in my car.
---
If you do be sure to tell me about your impressions of it.
---
See that’s the problem, you can’t even accept it.  Most online games don’t have a currency limit. Granted things can cost in the millions... but isn’t that how the real world works?
---
Agreed
---
It does not have to be hostile either. I got half the robot one done in 2 minutes in Whitesprings.
---
Just learn it by playing like everyone else?

It would be a pay toilet, tho.

Glad to have made you LOL.

So you’re complaining that you can’t earn enough atoms for free... and threatening not to buy atoms.
---
Clearly you have no intent or desire to buy atoms anyway. It’s an empty threat from a leech. 
---
Get a job. The developers have jobs, they get paid for those jobs. You play the game they continue to create, you don’t want to pay for their continued work.
---
Go north into Toxic Valley. About middle of that section is Grafton, should get a quest to tune into radio station if I recall. Go there, do quests, wander, kill, loot.
---
I always take Can Do and Pharma Farma (both under Luck), they help a lot early game. Just remeber, you can raise a stat and then choose a card thats for a different stat if need be.
---
Congratulations!
---
Thanks again!
---
Kill grafton monsters and I think the long neck terrifying things it’ll get you acid
---
OK here’s the thing. I’ve read no fewer than 10 different threads of authors expressing their outrage over repair kits.  
---
So let me get this straight.  People say Bethesda went back on their word.  Only cosmetics in the atom shop.  Some say it’s a competitive advantage to buy repair kits.  
---
Yet where’s the fucking outrage over duped weapons and armor?  You want to talk competitive advantages?  How about that shit?  
---
Where’s the outrage over continuous bugs and glitches that still haven’t been fixed? Auto scrapping bulk items?  Slow screen loading?  
---
JFC people and we are worried about repair kits.  To quote Allen Iverson.  We talking bout repair kits.  Not the game.  We talking bout repair kits man.
---
All players on server are getting seeds after the event
---
This. Liked the poster method for starting a quest much better. Random server spawns is a dumb way to start a new quest with ongoing daily challenges.
---
It has never been quite this dramaric but........oh my gosh....as I am typing this i just lost another new workshop.    Haha   boom.
---
Uhm ok
---
Sending friend request thank you
---
Afaik they've always been that way. Hopefully they add an overseers stash box so we can share our excess loot.
---
White Knight was absolutely overpowered.  People bitch about that nerf 10x more than Demo Expert.
---
TSE= two shoot explosive
---
No biggie buddy!
---
Those are the flowers. You need the seeds from the plants that only show up during the Death Blossoms event.
---
I think you can use the grenade box on the artillery as a public storage, but that would be it. Everything else will just have each players personal stash show up.
---
No problem, still here!
---
I would buy actual wasteland and faction items over a goofy outfit any day
---
“Everyone who has a different opinion from me and is allowed to express it is a CRYBABY!”
---
it’s not about the repair kits itself, it’s about the precedent it could set for future items you can pay for that modify gameplay. people have different reasons for not liking the addition, but mine is that im trying to let Bethesda know that while repair kits aren’t that bad, items that *do* give P2W  mechanics won’t be liked.
---
You still there?
---
Yes this happened to me the other day during Encryptid. Also freezing sometimes in load screens. The game is crashing a lot more in general for me lately.
---
I'd rather a proper trading screen where I can actually trade. Not sell for caps.
---
Hell spotlights have been broken since 2015.
---
Or lit on fire and thrown, like a molotov cocktail
---
1400 is a lot of atoms but i personally love the skin its so ugly and the beady eyes look creepy af I LOVE IT
---
But if I am fighting someone out in the 'middle of nowhere' there is not going to be a bench for awhile.  If my main weapon breaks I will have to use a secondary while someone with a repair kit can just keep going with their main.
---
I was figuring that was an exaggeration though - quite the exaggeration.
---
To kill the lady. Get her to fall in the water. She doesnt swim. She sinks to the bottom. Shoot till dead. She cant attack you. Thats how a level 8 did it
---
Out of curiousity, why would you rather trade than use game currency?
---
I’ve heard that it was fixed.... except for on X-01. Sorry :-/
---
Well no one knows. So maybe, but you're probably jumping to wrong conclusions.
---
The brief cases in Watoga (like the one on the bus outside of the terminal building) looks like a bomb, or self-destruct type if opened without the right key. You can't interact with them currently... Hmmm... I wonder.
---
I bought 18 of them.  Gives me a major competitive advantage.  I can expect now to jump to the top of the leaderboard in survival any time now.  Eat shit haters!
---
What disadvantage? You can’t earn as many atoms? o_O
---
I'm honestly a little upset that the skin works for all frames. I understand it doesn't change the stats, but wouldn't it working for just the one suit make it more exclusive?
---
I have three pieces of armour with a 20% weapon weight reduction. If I'm honest, with excavator and calibrated shocks I would probably have more carry capacity, but I have the Hot Rodder skins and don't get to see those enough as is!
---
X-01 helmet is the only one with the recon mod, so there’s that
---
What are the horsemen skins?
---
Yeah Grafton Monsters and Snallygasters. Absolutely creamed my dacks the first time I saw one of those! And it would not stop chasing me as well. 
---
Also Yao Guis.
---
Seen it on Phoenix a few times.
---
You are literally the reason that they do stupid shit like this. Don't buy atoms. Ever. What the actual fuck is wrong with you?
---
Mate if you want to take on these guys you got to leave the quality of life perks like pack rat out. Guaranteed these guys have sweet fa quality of life cards in their build. Fireproof maxed and the dense torso mod will give you 95% damage resistance to explosives. Best of luck out there brother 👍
---
Not anymore unfortunately
---
Server hop every time. I have been farming this place for over 2 months.
---
Rideable Ragstags, Vertibirds, or bring back Centaurs as mounts
---
I went from the Whitesprings to near the Overseer's Camp
---
The only problem is they would make pistols a bit less powerful for balance reasons.  They would have to nerf even if the secondary pistol was a lot weaker.  
---
Maybe they could get around this.  Perhaps make it so you use stimpacks or other items slower. (add a second gun halves the rate or something)
---
It has earned it's rightful place amid my Fallout props. Excited for it to arrive!
---
** STILL HERE **
---
Thanks.
---
I think it would make more sense to gain fertilizer when you use the toilet.
---
3: if you buy them, all repair perks are redundant. So 11+ perks are now free for other stuff non payers dont have the advantage of.
---
I mean... OP depends on your perspective. I can push 350 damage on my prime bloody 50cal without any buffs. If I can get an explosive version we’re talking ~460 damage a shot. And it fires easily as fast as a ripper hits. And from long range- I can chew a scorchbeast out of the air in 5 seconds or less!
---
They thought we would not notice but with the previous patch they completely removed legendary spawns in watoga not including emergency services or the civic center. The missle launchers usage condition is terrible. Vats is still bugged till this day.(stalkers legendary effect will still miss or weapons will lock on to the right of a target and miss all shots.) Explosive projectiles shot over large enemies like scorched beasts and mirelurk queens will disappear ( missles, mini nukes, 40mm rounds). Why does the hunting rifle have a 50 cal receiver but the lmg does not. The majority of heavy weapons have little to no mods. If you spam while making bulk you can craft one extra bulk. Horde events still dont properly scale enemy level to player level, at least not alway. Escape artists does not work with mole rats or rad scorpions. Luck of the draw should work with each shot fired not each trigger pull. Jumping while in sentinel's armor still counts as not moving. Firecracker whiskey recipe has not dropped even though i have done biv's daily quests since the release. Why are mutation serums 24000 caps? and why is there a limit on the amount of caps you can have? Explosive and anti armor weapons still dont work. These are just a few i can name of the top of my head. If you gave me a week I could probably write a book. Some of these issues have been there since day one.
---
Ah, fair enough! Makes sense they would cotton on were someone to attempt this repeatedly.
---
Weird, I'd say in general freezes and crashes are down for me, but this one really frustrating instance is up.
---
Thanks for replying, I am glad it's not unique.
---
I saw that too. I laughed and wanted to take a picture to show my friends... of whom I have 0.
---
Sometimes I just stand there and watch my camp being built in slow motion as I'm being shot at. Then as a wall is rendering it collapses. Shot down by the scortched.
---
Thanks man, Its not that i want to fight them but i sure do want to defend when attacked. I guess ill change it up when doing workshops.. thanks for the advice
---
flowers? what they are for?
---
Well, if they made things that people wanted to purchase, it would make more money. People want things like Power Armor paints, and I just read that a post that a guy would pay 2k atoms for cool "Ranger" armor. A Vault-Tec color scheme Weapons Workbench for 1k atoms is not interesting.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgk8yc/very_new_bug_camera_emote_where_do_you_land/
---
Found it within about 10 minutes of crafting my camera - as I had atoms enough to get the new emote.
---
Someone else on a server had found the corpse, and shared the location.  So basically, with 2 hours of the servers coming back up,  this was known.
---
_____________
---
PSA:  This *can*...
---
* Black-screen softlock you.
---
* "Not black screen" softlock you, with limited control (ie: cannot attack or move, but can swap weapons or perform an emote).
---
* May launch you so far into the world border that every direction is "cannot go that way".
---
* May launch you so high up *without a load screen* such that fall damage is lethal.
---
* Move you only a couple inches, rather than put you into "airplane" mode.  Movement seems "generally leftward", and depends on the emote used/animation.
---
And most of the time, this ends up meaning you are:
---
* Server Hopping to fix loss-of-control bugs.
---
* Fast Travelling somewhere, if you end up stuck out of bounds.
---
* Alt+F4, because while the fall would be miraculous from orbit, it would take 5 minutes to finally land.
---
People who arn't mutated,
---
Jump even higher.
---
Super jump is so good that it's basically mandatory, why would you not want more access to it.
---
If you have the xbox app you can share to imgur from inside the app.
---
Foods give you buffs but weigh you down. Take a poop to relieve weight but loss the buff 🤗
---
Thanks! I’ll have to server hop on him.
---
Ah, that's too bad. Sorry buddy. 😕
---
The flowers? No idea. There’s no recipe that asks for them, at least to my knowledge. I have herbivore mutation so I just eat them raw.
---
Just type another "0" in.
---
You're welcome.
---
Sturdy raider can drop from one violent night- I got arms from it a while back.
---
Um why?
---
Its one of the only events that has a for sure lv 50+ legendary
---
I didn't say it the best place to farm but what other event is better
---
Raw flux is found in a nuked zone. It takes 1 hardened mass, 1 glowing mass, 1 high radiation fluid and 10 of what ever flora you want to make 1 stable flux. You do this at a chemistry station. Have chemist perk in intelligence and super duper in luck equipped will help.
---
The only explanation is that there was no QA. Or they would’ve found the big instantly like we all did ourselves
---
Right, and I really like 76. I have from the beginning, but these just make the game feel cheapened to me.
---
Just got on. GT Dookieinyourhat
---
I wouldn't have an issue if it changed to fit properly to all the armors
---
Actually  chemist does not helps this
---
*Nisha intensifies*
---
I put mine near flatwoods and leave it there for survival mode. If someone blows my camp up I move for free repairs :3
---
Did you set it up over the random encounter spot? I don't destroy those, but I'm tempted to do so.
---
Ewwww Lolo lol wipe twice make it nice 😉
---
KEAZAR here pc playing joining now
---
Big thanks! Saved me time from server hopping! Enjoy the underarmor🏆🏆🏆
---
Bethesda totally knows this.  This is a test - testing the waters to see how the community reacts not at first but after a few weeks.  Many more of these are to come as I doubt the larger community really will quit.  Bethesda knows exactly what they are doing.
---
Good post! Also like to add that on ps4 ive had legendarys not drop legendary loot still. Sheepsquatch event nothing for me once and a few other times the last few weeks. Thought they announced change of legendary always drops a loot.
---
No problem! Thank you for amour as well thats awesome!
---
I'm doubtful...though, why it costs so much steel to add upgrades....I have no idea....
---
You gotta admit it’s pretty funny to make the strongest armor only work if you stand still, so all these battles are just people standing around waiting for someone to move at all so they can get in at the weakness.
---
It says the new skin can go on all power armor so hopefully the rest will be the same
---
Nice!  I walked up to Wavy Willards and found him first try because of this!
---
Does it glow in the dark or anything?
---
12 times for me and I still no spawn. Had to quit for the night. This game is so much fun. /s
---
To make it worse you can't even use it. It doesn't appear as a skin only has a weapon that you can't craft even when you have the reqs and mats
---
Hell yeah!
---
I have a ton of materials and won't be needing them anyway. Wasn't planning to buy them.
---
Doubt that will happen as Zenimax own the Fallout and Elder scrolls name.
---
If you look at the atom shop update post on the Bethesda website, it states that you need to know the plan for the salvaged assaultron head to use the skin. So before you say they are selling weapons in the atom shop, they are not. They locked the use of the skin behind an in game plan. Why, I have no idea. It is Bethesda. Lol
---
Hopped servers three times and his ass did not show.
---
Rather irritating.
---
This still works getting water. After hitting the drink button, spam collect.
---
If Bethesda totally knows this it isn't a test. That is a pure contradiction.
---
Raider Long Coat is coming soon, and you did get a pretty awesome PA skin today, and a few weeks ago with the Bone Raider Skin. I think everyone is being served fairly here.
---
I wouldn’t put it past them
---
But what i mean is that i saw a few people complain how it makes every set look like the X-01 so what I'm asking is do you prefer how they did it with the excavator skin being only available for the excavator or would you prefer how they did it with the plague one allow it for every set?
---
This was exactly my thought.
---
I disagree heavily. It’s pay for convenience, not pay to win. Selling legendaries with random rolls in the atom shop would be p2w, selling repair kits to save you time on tedious farming is not p2w.
---
The moment they stopped listening to us was the moment they turned a dollar or greater profit on this game.
---
Everything we want until they get theirs. Then, thanks all the cash, we're sick of your bitching..  sincerely,, more rich assholes.
---
I'd love a medic style excavator power armour. I'm the team 'medic' (team perks all the way) and would love to be able to display it. &lt;3
---
You can go to an in game vendor and buy everything in a repair kit for caps
---
Thus you probably shouldn't be expressing an opinion as you aren't really involved in situations where they will create a competitive advantage.  While simple a minor convenience in Adventure mode a lot of people are upset that they will offer a competitive advantage in survival mode - if you are in the middle of a battle out in the woods and your main weapon breaks you have to switch to a weaker secondary while people with repair kits are able to keep using their best gear.  It is a very minor advantage but still an advantage.
---
I always check there and Big B’s when I’m going to Harpers Ferry
---
I prefer the new way I dont use all the other power armor types this way is more expensive tho 1400 atoms I think my raider excavator skin was 800 but I guess since its specific to just one its cheaper
---
yeah but you potentially lose three perks that can add to damage.
---
Stop... I mean fly by my house outside of Fort Defiance. I'll give you a stimpak or two. 
---
Wow that was an amazing fail that you managed to video capture.
---
Might have to queue but he’s still here.
---
If you have enough money, you can buy it. Not sure what the price is going to be tho.
---
CONFIRMED!! twice spawned at wavy willard’s PS4. the body was still here when i came in from another server. PSN moonadamt. i’ll camp on it for a bit. good luck!
---
I answered my own question, and yes they are aware. https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/45563/kw/nukashine  but maybe this post will be of use to someone else.
---
*** STILL HERE ***
---
Um... not everyone is a PA user.  I don't use power armor - using regular armore for both roleplay as well as playstyle reasons and my armor breaks a lot.  No I don't do SQB battles but I do fight other players here and there.  I have armor which breaks daily.
---
The Vault is designed to shut down exactly 24 hours after the last departure, with oxygen supply being the last life support function to turn off. It’s *exactly* why the time doesn’t, and likely never will, change as it always needs to be Reclamation Day for new characters.
---
LOL I love this. My kind of humor.
---
You do know us non power armor players have our armor break quite a bit?  I could add some perks to mitigate this but that would mean not being able to use perk points for other things.
---
Hahaha
---
Well, I suppose that seals it.  The Sheepsquatch is either a thing in the game now, or something whose appearance is a week or two off.
---
Thanks heaps
---
Is there a solid list of leaked / datamined weapons ?  Or is that not a priority for the devs a all.
---
For some reason the keycard escorts don't seem to register.
---
I went to posieden power plant and repaired the vertibot pad there, and it counted when i took pictures of that.
---
hey wait a minute i remember you, you posted the video of you making your vid introduction before i believe?
---
Thank you hero.
---
He’s saying they’re testing our reaction.  They know their intent, not the whole community’s response.
---
Thank you man!
---
Miners Monument - Location [https://imgur.com/a/8XejczZ](https://imgur.com/a/8XejczZ)
---
Took me two hours man. I got stitching to do!!
---
this.
---
I had gotten pretty far into the game during beta as well so half of my overall challenges are broken. it’s a no wonder why Bethesda hasn’t addressed this yet, but they should. It’s pathetic.
---
How can people not see these offer a competitive advantage even though its small?  If someone is fighting someone else with the same equipment and their main armor or weapon breaks they would have to switch to a secondary less powerful item whereas the person with the repair kit can go on using main.
---
The whole menu system on PC could use some changes on top of the scrapping/selling issue with TAB. There needs to be a better way to sort items (e.g. chems, water, and food), and it just doesn't feel smooth to use (it seems like the mouse gets stuck, etc when going through menus at times, especially the friends list one).
---
Why would they develop things that take time and effort from a design standpoint when they can make repair kits and people will pay for them. Ridiculous
---
You can do that in the middle of a battle, away from anyone’s camp or workshop?  Please share!
---
SMH.  If you people can't see how repair kits could create a competitive advantage you have to work on your critical thinking skills.
---
Kits make those redundant. Thats 11+ perk points youre wasting that kit buys have an advantage over you to pick other things.
---
I was really loving the durability fix for my Gatling plasma, but this is killing me too literally. I have a Vampire Gatling Plasma Gun that I love. When it works, I can chew up an enemy like no tomorrow. The problem with the loading and pausing gets me killed on a nose-to-nose with the SBQ. Otherwise that prime receiver chews up her health.
---
Seriously. This isn't a cosmetic item. It's a usable item. 
---
Frankly, I have no problem with my stuff breaking. I carry a bunch of weapons, swap frequently, and rarely not get to a bench before one of them breaks. Just saying, I'll have no need to buy these. I'd certainly craft them though if that's how they were done.
---
It seems like a fair compromise. It's all cosmetic anyways, right, so how much does it really matter that your suit of T-51b looks like a suit of Plague Rider X-01? People are disappointed that it makes all suits look like X-01, and maybe they should have emphasized that, but they also only showed one type of power armor in the screenshots. 
---
You could argue it gives an edge in PvP if your opponent doesn't know what model of Power Armor you're really wearing underneath the Atom Shop skin, but I think that's *really* reaching.
---
You have to take photos in photo mode (go to the map and it has a button “T” on PC)  and then those will be shown when you have loading screens.  
---
I didn’t take any pictures for a long time because it’s kinda dumb, but I got tired of looking at that picture so I took a few and it is really a cool thing for the load screens.  Now I try and take one or 2 of every base, posed with a few baddies and such, and you can remember back while waiting.
---
How can one of the most hated games in recent memory think this is a good idea for reputation
---
That doesn't sound right yeah. You'd only be able to take and save 20 pictures then since the other 30 would need to be disposable for the challenges.
---
I’m also looking for assassins cavalier armor- 200 caps or less.  ;)
---
Even if you are in a group fighting another group?  People could take turns covering each other - and with good user interface skill you can repair your stuff pretty darn fast.  There is definitely give those who use it right an edge.
---
Then obviously this reddit and 76 its your first Bethesda release experience (if its not and you're a "vet in their games" then we ain't gonna agree, cause i ain't throwing them under the bus for them trying something new to them. Believe what you wish just know your mind has been filled by toxicity towards a studio and a game that had a pretty terrible release, but i see that they're working on it as they did with ESO. They'll get it together and i'll be here every step of the way. I hope you enjoy the rest of the hours you got with the game, before they mess something else up and they loose you as a player.
---
I was wondering what the t46 version looked like but if it looks exactly the same Im okay with that in fact i think its better that its not exclusive
---
just because you're lied to doesn't mean i have to accept it
---
Vendors are basically drug dealer pawn shops knowing you need caps and then turn around and sell them back at a 500% inflated rate...lol
---
Saw this coming a long time ago with people buying plans for them... same at the top hat and marine tactical stuff... inflation has set in on the wasteland and a depression is coming soon...
---
Go to an armor station and you should be able to make a special head piece. I won’t spoil the surprise
---
You can craft it in head gear at an armor workbench.
---
There are 3 sides to any story.  Mine, yours and something probably closer to the truth.  I’m only giving my side in response.  That we both enjoy the game though is likely the point where it all meets.  
---
See ya in the wasteland.  That’s really all that matters, because we both want this to be awesome.  
---
And it knda is.
---
&gt;You could argue it gives an edge in PvP if your opponent doesn't know what model of Power Armor you're really wearing underneath the Atom Shop skin, but I think that's really reaching.
---
I thought this too but then what would be the difference in wearing a dress over a full vanguard set of BoS heavy combat armor and this?
---
Don't get me started on elevators
---
Lol get the fuck out and stay out then, nobody needs your negative ass in here
---
Yea I been investing alot of caps and resources into my gatling plasma. I want it to work like its supposed.
---
Just added and traveled to you. Thank you
---
Hey it just made me laugh and I wanted to share, I wasted 100 hours on this game I feel
---
There's no p2w here. I bought a few just for the convenience of repairing my crap if it's out of my way to find a bench.
---
If you think this is p2w go ahead and use one during a brawl lemme know how that worked out for you.
---
One of my characters has a HUB for players to use with crafting stations, food, etc, and I'd love to know how many people actually use it. =) 
---
It was really busy during the mask event (since it's just outside of the town), but quieter now.
---
https://twitter.com/fallout/status/1120360394403602432?s=21
---
The something special you get is a one eared Easter Bunny Mascot helmet. *^(Happy Easter!)*
---
Still got those plans?
---
Legendary for legendary. Maybe I want flux? Maybe I am willing to trade 2 for one with caps? This saves a lot of time just put all offers on the table then accept or reject.
---
TLDR: flexability
---
Flux took a major hit. I used to be able to sell one flux for 11 caps, now it 2 caps per one flux. Bullshit how am I supposed to make cash now
---
spoiler: they won't
---
Get Max Gunsmith and you won't have to repair your guns for a very long time
---
It literally makes all sets look like the X-01 so there is no plague set just the X-01 plague that when put on a t-45,51,60 etc makes it look like the X-01
---
That's like asking if you can survive separating your head from your body.
---
Devs could leave and make their own stuff, but they'd NEVER have access to the properties owned by Zenimax. It happens from time to time, and those new teams are rarely as successful as they were before leaving.
---
I wonder if Cowboy is gonna be like the Cowboy perk from NV
---
Came in handy when my AAE broke during the SBQ fight 🤷‍♀️
---
This is a legit P2W item.  Im sorry if you can't see this through creative critical thinking.  It truly offers a competitive advantage in rare situations if used right - unlike purely cosmetic items.  Ive replied to a number of comments trying to explain how this could happen so won't go into details again.  I am going to go play Tower Unite for awhile.
---
Thanks for the answers lol wife wanted to give free stuff at her base
---
I’m glad you wasted something.
---
this community can be so fucking toxic sometimes lmao dude you have no idea. if anyone says anything against fo76 or Bethesda they go full “WTF NOBODY ASKED FOR YOUR OPINION GET THE FUCK OUT IF YOU DONT LIKE IT” while also heaping praise on Todd Howard for drip-feeding them actual content and fixes.
---
Imagine if the guest book would allow people to donate some caps to the C.A.M.P. owner as a way to say "thanks for letting me use your stuff". I'd do it.
---
I guess the fact that you can conceal your regular armor with any rags you find in the game, but this Atom Shop skin is the only way to conceal what model Power Armor you're wearing. 
---
But for real, is anyone going to get in a duel with another player and think "crap! I can't tell what suit of power armor they're wearing!"
---
And also Scorched Killer receivers, although that seems to be worthless as it's worse than Hardened even against scorched enemies.
---
I knew there was a joke to be made with that title.
---
"Here we see the hapless tourist who has entered into the prime mating area of local bears. As you can see from his last moments caught on film, the bear was not to be trifled with during this season.
---
That's fallout New vegas
---
Definitely i while pricey i at least know i will use it. I definitely would have bought the excavator set but i knew i preferred my t-60 stats. Also bright side i won't need one of every armor.
---
A Japanese player here. Not sure about the ping but I get to meet many people from the West Coast in game. It feels quite close, though we have the vast ocean in the middle lol
---
nope. Up to around 100 from dailies, depending on how much the individual challenges give and assuming you can complete ALL of them, and then ~150-200 from weeklies depending on the same thing. So at the very most in 4 days you'd be able to get 600
---
True, prices would stabilise eventually, I think an ingame server text chat would really help in-game trading
---
at this point the only thing i expect from Bethesda for this game at all for the servers to actually stay up most of the time.
---
Better start
---
They promised cosmetics only. I’m holding them to that promise.
---
Damn. Well that sucks but oh well.
---
Wonder why they aren’t on the PvP servers?
---
You could probably buy cards from your local games store.. as that's the in thing at the mo' selling game currencies as well as video games.  
---
Good luck.
---
I wouldn't Especially because if they are 50+ it's more then likely X-01 or excavator
---
I could really see this becoming competitive during group on group PVP fights.  These might end up drawn out and team members could cover for their teammates if their primary, and most powerful, gear breaks rather than having to be down a team member while they run off to find a repair station or just use their less powerful equipment.
---
Turn the flux into serums first.
---
Lol they used to be 60
---
I love the weather and nuke in the same shot.
---
Do you play survival?  Running out of AP and walking is a death sentence
---
Yeah. I bought the vault tec skin pack thinking it was a limited time thing, and right before got the desert camo pack because I think that was limited time. Now I'm broke but want all the new skins coming out. Missed out on the raider excavator set, barely got the chrome excavator set, now I have a solid 90 atoms to my name
---
I wonder what this new patch also broke?
---
Every bubble bursts.  Rule 1 of trading.  
---
Have a backup plan for the inevitable.
---
That could be an interesting turn if Nuclear Winter is actually hinting at NPCs for the future (the tape mentions they need to get to 76 and know the date the vault's set to open, makes sense they're intended to be survivors). Bethesda *did say* Wastelanders would have "true choice and consequences" and this is pointing at them coming back with this tape.
---
Fan theory follows: 
---
If the tape is referring to him going after MODUS, I could easily see the Wasterlanders DLC forcing you to ultimately pick sides -- stick with MODUS or the rogue Enclave survivors who are trying to finish the job and destroy the AI.  Bethesda took a poll a while ago on what players like or hate about events in game. With all their feedback, I could see them using it to add new events which pit MODUS against the rogue Enclave survivors through faction based events.
---
Plot-wise, this already fits into the game without any rectons. If you think about it MODUS' Enclave events, it's apparently searching for something. When he takes over Botstops he produces robots to go out on patrol. Other events have you triangulating signals to allow him to search and look in the area. MODUS is looking for something, and can't find it, and that bothers the AI\*. The story is already setup to allow a group in hiding to come out. Add in the survivors, and it answers who he's been looking for the entire time.
---
\* I say bothered because if you don't complete MODUS Dropped Connections events in time, MODUS gets angry and says "No connections still. I suppose we'll just... 'take the hint'." He seems frustrated he wasn't able to get his eyes on a region.
---
There is nothing toxic or aggressive about pointing out that you have no place demanding somebody to talk because you have a problem. The toxic person is the one calling somebody a troll for pointing that out and saying that their input is invalid because it doesn’t fit your entitled agenda. Also not your place to tell people they don’t belong on this subreddit.
---
Yes, start a new character and you’ll earn all the same atoms which are shared with your other characters...
---
yup I can't argue with that Bethesda done messed up for the 3092571798073108th time
---
Does that work?
---
Idk man, I run a pistol build and it’s super, super weak. The way damage works in this game is that a single large attack that deals 100 damage &gt; 2 attacks @50 &gt; 4 attacks at 25.
---
Something with 20 armor takes 80 from the first, 60 from the second and 20 from the last.
---
So pistols, like autos, are just bad - they already should have had their damage scaled up. Adding a second gun, needing to grind that slot (a rifle weilder only needs one bloodied/explosive rifle, dual pistols would need to legendary to drop), maintain the condition of an extra weapon and expend more ammo is probably still fairly gimped without any nerf.
---
&gt;since knives aren't really that good.
---
I should show you my 3* 40% swing speed, double damage on full health, +1 agility, stealth blade then.  It kinda broke the game for me.
---
I thought I did the math at around 500 a week, if you got all the challenges. I'm not exact on that, and that was figured weeks ago. 
---
If you just look at the weekly challenges total, then add in today's dailies, then figure about that same amount for each day of the week, you should have a solid rough estimate of how many you can earn in total for each week.
---
I'd give you gold but Ive never had any
---
I remember lmao, I was one of them when the game first came out. It's cause you feel so cheated after maxing your character in maybe 20 hours with NOTHING to do. Killing the queen back then was pointless and unfun, then they added serum plans but now I've heard they removed them along with ultracite power armor now learnable making the queen just a bullet sponge rather than a raid boss...and a few days ago I got on and the health bug STILL EXISTS after almost 6 months it's so fucking funny
---
Ok, maybe more of a boil the frog situation.  I think they wanted to dip their feet in the water or they would have jumped right to the other ones they have planned.
---
Stealth blade bowie knife? I've seen a few serrated ones, but in over 300 hours have never seen a stealth blade...
---
Reading is a lost art, isn't it?

Whats your gt so I can join on you

Wait, challenges *aren't* account wide and you can do them again on a new character?
---
Raider life
---
If you are fighting someone and your weapon breaks, and you have time to faf about in a menu fixing your gun without dying then the other person isn't trying to kill you.
---
I don't know what world you live in that you can take 5 seconds to stand still doing menu stuff while someone else is trying to kill you and not die, horribly.
---
I just tried this and sadly it didn't work for me. Only unlocked the Mothman photo. :(
---
I’ve gone to a few worlds and literally everything in White Springs is gone that can be taken, phones, vases, picture frames, you name it. And that’s just one location. 
---
Other areas are the same. Not too mention seeing an over abundance of bulked items for sale at vendors. 
---
Be great if the “value” they say a weapon is would be what you get! Right now the Fixer rifle says 400-600 in the inventory until you get to a vendor... 27 caps...lol
---
I k ow they never could do it because it’s be seen as a glitch, but it’s be amazing if, after like 5 or 10 beers, you perceive your sell value higher than you _actually_ sell for:
---
[The next morning]
---
“Wait, wuh?  I made some awesome deals last night... where’s all my caps go?!”
---
Servers naturally deplete after midnight. Log off and on if you want more players.
---
Survival could be dead as well though. I wouldn't know.
---
Dude I dunno how lol
---
Eh. I bought a few for the novelty. Doubt I use them unless I’m in a real big pinch. Not like they are super expensive and unobtainable. 50 for one is actually way less than I had expected.
---
I was once convinced that the last location I needed in one of these challenges could be discovered with a new character. I created one and ventured across Appalachia to the damn Valley Galleria. I arrived as a Level 3 character with a machete and a pipe pistol after dying a half dozen times or more, just to discover when you do discover it, it doesn't count toward the challenge because it's broken, so you can't complete it under any circumstances.
---
I want a segway.
---
Oh I didn’t see them
---
 Seriously the people defending this companies bad decisions are like religious Zealot's.
---
How about during extended group on group battles where your teammates can provide cover?  You either duck out and fix your gear real fast or have to travel somewhere and thus the team is down a player.
---
I have an awesome 3 star assasin assaultron head. Just waiting for it to be usable/not garbage lol.
---
If you’re playing on PS4 and need someone to level with (I’m lvl 24) feel free to hmu. My psn is sadluna 🙂
---
Yup, I have gigabit speed internet (not that it quite reaches that, but it's still much faster than anything else I've had before) and I'm having the same problem. I worry that things like continuing to increase players' carry weights and stash capacities will keep making it worse. The reason they started so small was to make sure the servers were gonna cope. I don't think they're coping.
---
Buy the recipes from a player for 1k to 5K ea.
---
Then one flux plus a little bit of junk turns into a serum at a chemistry station.
---
I earn atoms with both characters at two different levels.
---
Also a Junkie Radium Rifle, Explosive Radium Rifle if interested.
---
I just stopped mine earlier today somewhere random the other day too. Dropped 4 of each common mask across a couple servers last night too.
---
That’s at Lewisburg, think you got stations mixed up
---
Hopefully it doesn't flag u as a hacker
---
It will be fun making PA look like other PA.
---
That's also another one of your problems. If you're over level 200 by now and you're not a dedicated PVP player you should know to avoid any and all workshops. they are essentially invitations to get your butt handed to you in PvP scenarios unless of course you are fully prepared for the eventual battles to come.
---
On topic please... can your equipment handle 2 hours or intense battle? Did you find any repair benches in there?
---
YALLLLL I FINALLY FOUND HIM! I noticed that there were like 4 people in an area not near an event. Went there. Sure enough, they had found the tourist. It was at a memorial. I can’t remember the name, I’m sorry. Just watching the map ended up helping me
---
And has bothered me not 1%.  I spent 5 weeks building caps to buy 1 plan.  I can change to whatever sells at a moment, cause I just don’t care.  The market will be what it is.  Though I do understand the frustration of essentially making a business only to have the rules change.
---
It was the first porn star to come to mind.
---
The ones that give the mystery meat pie recipe and wendigo mount have been known a while.

you finish the quest and they give you plan for the next one
---
I regularly play with guys who live in Japan, Canada, U.K., and the Netherlands. This game let's me meet the most interesting people.
---
How much for the radium? I have 300 stims + caps
---
It does, I'm told
---
I just did this and it didn't count for me. It only checked off "Mothman" and still says I need a photo of the Sheepsquatch. So, sadly, this is not guaranteed.
---
I've got that one already, but I think there's at least 2 more
---
Well thank you!
---
I want one with a cat 🐈 head on it.
---
Grafton or flatwoods has it on the pin board dude
---
I noticed that too.  It’s actually not overly difficult in an item heavy location like that to make a very decent run.  I’m sort of fortunate that I have a lot of stash items including serums for sell.  I usually stay around max caps too.  I’m pretty eager to see how the market will adjust when player vending hits.
---
With that i agree, but plans change and I can't be mad at that. If they start adding buyable Legendaries then that will be an issue, but I don't see that happening.
---
There's this one tweet of Pete answering a question about someone trying to buy a Legendary Mini Gun and he said "No, Cosmetic Only" which in true that still stands. If that ever happens then my pitchfork is ready and i got me a flame mod on it.
---
Would you rather have the studio continue with the vision they have for this game and let them add utility items here and there that can easily be earn by doing challenges or other in game activities. Or give up on the game and close the the Dallas studio, because they couldn't do the game right on the first try.
---
Unless it’s a must have, I’m usually just selling excess bulk or the same legendary stuff no one uses that you can’t scrap.
---
Nukashine I think?
---
are you using speed demon?
---
&gt;1k to 5k
---
Where the fuck do you guys get so much money?! I struggle to keep something above 1000 caps!

 Broke their word on a premise many purchased the game on. Bait and switch, flat out. Excuse it all you want, but it is what it is.
---
Yeppp
---
Like wise my friend best of luck
---
I’m saving my caps just in case! Sale prices are going down and materials are getting scarce. Just like in real world, over farming will hurt the economy overall as we’re seeing. 
---
Flood the market with serums prices come down however junk seems to be staying the same or going up...
---
The one asking for tips over on filthy casuals? If so then yes
---
When was it nerfed, last time it was fixed to actually do damage?
---
Can you message me on Reddit direct or Xbox Live? Thank you
---
I currently am having the same problem and am on Xbox 1 I don’t even have the option to build the helmet but I can build the weapon but it told me I knew the plan and therefore learned how to make the imposter version hopefully this gets fixed soon I was super excited
---
ak56thethird lvl 60 some
---
&gt;Found? Do you mean dropped from something you killed? 
---
Yup. Off the top of my head I've picked up a handmade, a harpoon gun, a 50 cal, a level 25 10mm, a Mac level 10mm, a pipe revolver, and a couple others I can't recall. I kept the level 25 10mm for my pistol build alt, gave the handmade to my buddy, and sold or traded the rest.
---
I hear you, traveler. My 50 photos were a very important "art project" for me and I can't stand the thought of losing even 1 of them from my loading screens. I know it's silly, but that's where I stand.
---
nah i think you posted it here giving a shoutout to the guy that helped or something I can't remember but I'm happy to see you're still making content.
---
iirc you can't give away repair kits
---
I'm not saying your wrong, I'm just saying that going into battle with nearly broken weapons is a terrible plan, and if you are doing it you are a fool who should be eaten.
---
My opinion is that these things are terrible noob traps, that only provide benefit to new players who don't know there are work benches everywhere, that they should discard broken weapons outright (scrap for mods), and will end up costing these players the most as they spend limited currency the game gives easily at the start only to suffer when they can't get cool items later when the free starter atoms dry up.
---
These things are abominations, and should not exist in the store, they are unhealthy for the game and prey on new players.
---
If you want to argue they are not awful for the end game teams who can easily get them free, not that they even need them, then you are not wrong, but these players also don't face the same cost. 
---
They don't hurt me now, but I enjoy helping new players, and if they keep pushing this type of things it will kill off the new players, which does hurt me. If you have your team and you don't mind because you are all past the point they matter, that is fine, you do you. But don't pretend things that don't hurt you are harmless. I don't suffer poison ivy rashes, but that does not make poison ivy harmless.
---
I bought this game on the promise of cosmetic only. I supported this game through the shitty launch and the lack of real end game content. This I will not support
---
The mire to get that outlaw feel but you’ll have to wait to go there I’d say lvl 40 but savage divide is also a good place, get a place by water I mean if you want specific locations you’d have to give me time
---
Yup I posted a psa few hours ago not to replicate since it says you access a location you’e not supposed to
---
So because they released a broken as hell, alpha state game they shouldn’t have to run in the red until they fix their game? It’s cool if they just bait and switch?
---
Man, this community is full of little sub piggies.
---
I had the exact same realization with patch 7. I had documented the base DMG/Energy/Rad resist values for all the power armor sets and then done the same with 200% repaired versions of the sets. 
---
Then patch 7 rolls out and my DMG/Energy/Rad Resistances we’re all 40-80 points lower across ALL of my sets. Both virgin sets that were repaired below 100% and used sets that were above 100% had lower values. 
---
Someone did a guide with all the Power Armor stats and the mods for it roughly a month or so ago on this Reddit. When it was released the stats the user was reporting for base resist values at 100% or less condition were lower than what I had in game. My brother and I couldn’t explain that at the time. 
---
Its odd the lower values are the standard now. I had similar lowered resist values with Power Armor when the underarmors were bugged a few months back. Certain underarmors lowered DMG resist values when worn in Power Armor. They patched that bug though.
---
I'm onboard with that, they want to edge people in just a bit at a time.
---
Depends how you allot your perks I suppose. I still have all 3 heavy gunner cards at rank 3 equipped
---
Questiin for you then. Can you paint other peoples powr armor? Like they give you say the mats and the pieces (or the entire frame) could you paint it and then give it back to them?
---
yes because calling someone a "whiney entitled jackoff" is not trolling. sarcasm aside, ive never played a game that is this bad at letting the playerbase know about intended major changes like the watoga legendary rate nerf. even if it wasnt intended to be doable in the first place the playerbase does not know that and as you can tell by the amount of posts that have complained about it that lack of transparency can actually make the people who play this game not want to anymore.
---
trying to hold the company responsible for the lack of transparency with things is not entitled. the fact that ive already had to fix bugs that they created using mods and that so much about this game is misrepresented or misinformed why is it that i end up being basically attacked for attempting to help out the people here by providing information? i even gave the developers ways to FIX an issue that they have said before was fixed and never really were. is it really too much to ask to want to be able to enjoy the game that you paid your hard earned money for?
---
I think that would be cool but more so if when you signed into the guestbook, then that camp became a marked location and any caps you had to pay to fast travel there would go to the camp owner!? That would be awesome
---
Ohh yeah, that's me. Thanks man I've just honestly hated how little content there is for the game, not looking for any popularity even just want another option out there for people to watch. Main focus is trying to put as much work into them as I can so it's not just lazy content but it's been fun.
---
Maybe they nerfed us to feel a bit more danger when going against mobs
---
Question, are the male and female tourists separate quests?  I already got Ansel and completed that, but want to make sure I don't need to do the female counterpart one as well.
---
Shoulda left a few legendaries at your door step as an offering. That would appease most
---
No need to bitch about Repair Kits. You're telling me you're going to go into Survival without all of your armor and weapons at max durability? Not only that but on console, you have to press B, tab over and find the weapon, click RS, then spam B again to back out. It's not P2W.
---
My bank account thanks me for it.
---
There will of course be exceptions, but I would still say that they generally suck pretty hard. However, for those lucky enough to get one like you have, these bonuses could be god mode.

Riot now, give them an inch and they will take a mile

I’m about $120 in on just Atoms so far.

Oh thank you so much. Sorry I havnt posted yet. I have all the silo pieces. Alpha and charlie have been solved respectively already.

Charlie is 79473176

As always its bravo that seems to be most trouble. I'm hopeing to if someone doesn't beat me to the punch. Dude thank you so much for the silo pieces. You rock!!!!

Bro not cool he died bro

You can't get mad at a company not giving you free digital currency because their free currency didn't work.
---
It's free, those dailies do not have to exist and you should be glad they exist in the first place.
---
This is called entitlement
---
That's awesome, can't wait for a T45 one, I like the look of that armor the most, but it just doesn't compare stat-wise. If I can have the other armor look like T45 that'd be great mmmkay.
---
Last update....they fixed it but there was also a stealth nerf to the damage. Mine was doing 200 damage before the update and only 150 after.
---
I've got a quad but it just sits in my stash box. It takes forever to charge up 20 shots and if you holster the weapon you need to recharge it again when you pull it out.
---
I would love it if we could re-add old screenshots back to the loading screen gallery from our PS4 hard drive.
---
Early to mid game collect literally every item you can, especially apparel items.  Bulk junk and sell.  There are some areas you can essentially farm for materials.  Depending on your level and gear, take advantage of uranium fever events and farm guns, gauntlets etc, then use the nearby vendor if you are over encumbered.  You'd be amazed how many caps you can get from selling weapons.
---
Every single person that has zero kills is considered number two in that instance. All you have to do is go to menu look at recent players and you'll see every single person in the server
---
Yeah, I about threw this one out before using it because knives kinda suck. I was fully built for the "All Rise" until I tried this thing.  I'd love more knife perks!!
---
You can make 1400 caps from vendors every day per character by selling things to vendors. 
---
Then, you sell things to other players to make more than 1400 caps in a day
---
The most strategic things to sell are serums and unwanted aid items.
---
Nope. Anything with atom shop application is not tradeable, sellable, or stashable. It will immediately be destroyed if removed from your inv, and does not appear in the vendor menu. You can paint with base game stuff (like nuke quantum x-01, nuka cola t51b, BOS t60, etc) 
---
 for other people but not with atom shop paints
---
Didnt have ballistic fiber to repair my armor, insta repair with the kits. They are very useful tbh
---
Good points. And yes I will keep playing until it just get stupid. Nothing can be done BSG is going to do this period.  Complaining about it won't help.
---
Duped weapons and the market for it is still alive and kicking. Just done so BSG can't or won't do anything about it.  TONS of people have duped weapons and armor and it has destroyed the game's balance for the worse.
---
Thanks for the map! Your doing gods work.
---
*Makes fart noise with mouth*
---
You get one plan when you complete the camera quest. Tinker bench has modify tab so I guess It's done there.
---
Honestly? I wouldn’t call that trolling. They didn’t say that to get under you skin. There are loads of people in this sub that just bitch and moan. To the point whwre 76 could be gold played diamond crusted and I think they would still hate it at this point.
---
Do I think you are entirely wrong on wanting info? No, absolutely not. But lots of people are just demanding bethesda say something. Maybe they will. Maybe they won’t 100897678 posts a day demanding info won’t really get us anywhere.
---
I see your goal, I do. But even a genuine thought in a sea of bitching can get drowned out and just seem like another complaint.
---
I've got a quad.....it should be the highest damage weapon bn the game but it doesn't seem like it's doing 4k damage when I use it and it's not worth the time it takes to charge it for 20 shots. Even worse if you holster it after charging it goes back to zero when you pull it out.
---
Oh well was worth a shot. Note to self dont buy crap for my camp with atoms.
---
I often see "they should wait till it's perfect." I also tend to see "Why are my favorite gaming companies gone? They were perfect." They supposedly worked on this thing for five years. That's a long time for no gain on investment for any company, never mind an American based gaming company.
---
Tell me, if you had the choice, would you rather the servers go down in a year, or let armor kits exist? Would you rather this game simply never existed rather than armor kits?
---
Man, this community is full of children who have no concept on the costs of modern game production.

---
Yeah but he let us nuke everywhere we wanted
---
Shit you right
---
They should have named him Bernie.
---
Not entirely sure. I speculate that you will sorta scrap legendaries to get a token per star you scrap. Then you’ll use that token to re-roll new legendary effects on a second weapon (maybe). 
---
So I’m keeping 2 main categories:
---
1) Good weapons/armor with crummy effects that I can hopefully re-roll in the future
---
2) Light weapons/armor with lots of stars. (3* weightless armor is great for this) This helps maximize how many stars I can cram into a stash. Of course having an alt to move legendaries onto is super helpful too.
---
Of course this is all totally speculative. But I think you’ll have to sorta turn in stars somehow and then get to re-roll stars onto an item (but prob not be able to actually choose the new effects, otherwise everyone would have maxed-out god rolls right out of the gate)
---
This shit is wack this game is bad enough we don’t need pay to win now that’s just gonna have more and more ppl leave the game u so desperately want ppl to get back into smfh
---
That Arktos Pharma content looks pretty cool.  I'm going to do my best to not get excited though, because I'd really rather not get my hopes dashed.
---
Future content. Perhaps related to the upcoming legendary vendor, but I haven't read anything definite.
---
I saved 3000 atoms by never buying cosmetics. I decided to save up for loot and here it is lol
---
Laughs with respiratory system.
---
They did, a way we agreed to when we spent that $60; cosmetics, which no one is demanding be removed. Now they are bait in and switching.
---
As far as I can see there are four lenses:
---
\- 105mm
---
\- 200mm
---
\- Night Vision
---
\- Targetting
---
The first one is a quest reward, the other three the plans cannot be obtained yet.
---
Having same problem with robot challenge. Neither key card nor workshop vertibots register for challenge. Tried both aggroed and non.
---
Lmao touché
---
No problem! I learned a little bit about when it restarts so you can start collecting code pieces. I might make it a regular thing as I have that particular night off and there isn't much to do in the late game. I think I'll focus on Silo Bravo next week.
---
I’m already late game (Level 79) so should I just go on runs to a place like Sutton or locations like that and just strip the place then sell the items? I did that with Allegheny a few times.
---
Dude, if you feel 20 pounds lighter AFTER pooping, you need to see a doctor ASAP!
---
Why would you actively pursue ignorance? Isn't it better to learn something new?
---
I get that, but sometimes its easier to use the workshops than it is to Grind. I get that people want to pvp and thats fine its part of the game i get that. I just want to have a fighting chance :)
---
Will Ferrel quotes ftw.
---
Whh should I care about Fortnight?
---
I also had the fun side effect of (after getting launched all over the place) all interior cells being invisible. Walls and floors were gone but not doors, enemies, or junk. Had to restart my console to fix it.
---
Do people just downvote for no reason on here? 😂
---
Need t45 I have the mods to make them and have the jet pack plans but idk how to get the flux. So wait till some one dropped a nuke go to the blast zone and look around? Seems tough.
---
When the creation club came out I let it be as it meant the modders were getting a real revenue source. But this, this is far different, Bethesda, both devs and publishers, this is a message to you, either give up and make your game free and give us all refunds, or stop adding utility items to the atom store, your playerbase will leave you, because for many that is the nail in the coffin of a launch so bad that retailers had to give away an extra copy of the game with the game and console bundle, nobody wants this game anymore except the die hard fans, and now you are alienating them.
---
you want the servers to be paid for, then give us something worth buying in the atom store, not something we need, because when you make a game effect my real world wallet on a regular basis I leave that game behind, and many others share that sentiment.
---
Yes, I have different photos and loading screens in my two consoles. I don't know that they're stored locally but that would make sense. I save them to Xbox live anyway so that I can delete if more room is needed.
---
Depends.
---
If you only gain atoms from dailies/weeklies then no. However, the other categories like social or combat challenges can help you earn some easy atoms.
---
Don't farm your mats in survival.
---
People will say any utility item in the Atomic Shop is pay to win, be it a fridge or whatever. I like your idea because the first bit it's basically the same one I proposed. Put all these utility items in the game, available at EVERY vendor for caps. Your idea of putting a bunch of skins for these items in the shop is great. Love it.
---
There are photo challenges for each region. All the other regions except the forest have no additional requirements. Go to each region, spam photomode and delete.
---
Hmm yeah i've been doing this as well. Thank you for that detailed comment!
---
I'll have to confer with my stash, but I'm pretty sure I have at least one of those.
---
I point out that weapon repairs in this game are trivial once you get past level 40. The nearest I've gotten to putting effort into repairs has been when I was out of steel from crafting all the ammo it took to wreck the weapon in the first place, and I fixed it by punching level 5 scorched at Morgantown till I had the steel. Armor can be slightly more annoying, if you've been selling all your ballistic weave and black titanium, but I have not repaired my Ex Power Armor since I built it two weeks ago, and I basically live in it.
---
It's a solution to a problem that does not exist, making it a rather weak sauce QoL improvement for people too lazy to punch pinkies at the airport. Personally, I can't even imagine paying 50 precious atoms for a repair to a mere %100.
---
I don't doubt some poor saps have paid for and bought the damned things, and made Bethesda a bit more money, to which I say: Good. Let those who want to pay QoL in exchange for free content for the rest of us. Go, Whales, Go!
---
Check your effects/disease tab, there is a disease, "rattle hands" or "rattled bones" or something that reduces ranged damage by about 20% happened to me a few days ago and I was scratching my head over how my lever action damage took such a dive.
---
There's an abandoned moonshiners shack in the hills west of the munitions factory that might be the kind of thing you're looking for.
---
Yes I have the plan for jet pack and the mod for calibrated shocks for the t47 power armor. I've never launched a nuke. Seems complicated to farm this flux. Thanks for all the help guys. I'll track down a blast zone and look for it once the radiation goes away I guess that's what I have to do.
---
I always have my pipboy radio on, at level 2 volume. I can barely hear it, but i know its there...anyway i don't move until the radio starts playing, that usually means the world is fully loaded.
---
&gt;No idea where the game sent me.

Nifty! The Freddie Lounds’, Lois Lane’s, and Clark Kent’s of Fallout.

I would fucking HATE having a bicycle in a Fallout game.
---
What location?
---
Coming
---
PSN: Wolverine466-yar
---
I just want to be able to sell ammunition I don’t want to robot vendors
---
bro i done good work but there r like alot of legendary effect for major  u didnt add in vats crit shot +50% u didnt add that in
---
Exactly everyone is running around with a damn Handmade I would like to at least make mine look  a little different
---
Yep I just lost an anti armour Gatling. 100% did not sell it it was favourited and it just vanished.
---
Add my PSN, I am at the Colonel Kelly Monument
---
Cool idea. Along this line, I always thought it would be neat if you could craft a photo album of all your photos and place it in your camp or trade it.
---
See you soon
---
What's that glowing red on you ? that happens to me all the time
---
I really wish they'd just add things to the store  instead of the limited time only crap.  Limited time sales are fine, but the buy it now or never thing is annoying.
---
I just sold serums for 440 with maxed hard bargain after the patch
---
Already did, world is full :(
---
I feel violated. You did good though.
---
I scrapped my pearly peepers and I'm livid about it
---
Does it work for Excavator? May have to consider getting one of these...
---
Prisoner collar

close
---
Amazing how I never actually notice that MODUS is actively looking for something. Very plausible theory as well. There's gotta be some of the Enclaves that's not stupid enough to get rekted by MODUS. 
---
Would definitely be entertaining to see creepy robot overlord going against its own evil masters!
---
I've done this one a couple times. He seems to hang out for a while after. I got a few pics of him.
---
He's gone
---
I saw on another post that they are working on it.
---
Just sent u one
---
i did. i found the body. got the holotape, camera &amp; bucket list. when i checked my inventory the bucket list was no where to be found hence no quest prompt le sigh.
---
It’s fun with no fall damage. You can now basically teleport out of any situation without worrying of dying. Game might crash, but you won’t die
---
Ill be here for awhile.
---
I don't have a prison collar on my character hmm
---
It still involves menu juggling.
---
I like this idea. Well thought out. Didn’t know that about dropped connections but most everything he does seems to be about surveying areas or taking note of what’s around
---
At least for me, when I buy Atoms on my Xbox, the purchase is done through Microsoft and not Bethesda. I use my Xbox gift cards to buy them, like any other video game add-on.
---
The people who have bought Atoms are likely a minority in this sub.
---
I managed to teleport inside the vendor area at Sutton station when I activated the bug while standing on the chimney

I tried to do this with the legendary vendor location but it didnt work
---
They didn't break "their" word. 
---
Pete Hines is not BGS. He's marketing. He's one guy. 
---
And again. The official announcement of the Atomic Shop. The one actually released by BGS.... Not just the head of marketing.... Said very specifically "No Competitive Advantage"
---
Why you'd along to the word of a marketing guy vs the actual studio's official announcement is beyond me.
---
Some of us want to hold Bethesda's feet to the fire because we dont want them to get away with shit and start sliding downhill any faster than need be. I say let people call them out and stop calling them names like disingenous when it's obvious they care enough about the game to gather information -- they are spending their own time on this. Let them do it and hopefully you never know, Bethesda might take notice, it's possible. We don't like being lied to, or led down the wrong path. If this game is going to turn into a pay to win pile of garbage I'd like to know sooner rather than later
---
I did. once. And from that I learned to repair my gear before fast traveling. Take 2 minutes and save a ton of frustration.
---
😂
---
 Also, here's proof that it's a whole new weapon and not a skin: [https://imgur.com/gallery/FMC6Tay](https://imgur.com/gallery/FMC6Tay)
---
I checked my stash tonight because of the update and lost three magazines, two bobbleheads heads, and 1 armor off my main. I didn't keep track of any other aid items on my main so who knows what else disappeared. As for my mule, I will have to check later.
---
You are dead, blatantly wrong about that. Do you think a lvl 15 even has enough cards to put together a PVP build? Do you think he has accrued good armor and weapons? He can't even equip lvl 50 weapons and armor, which have MUCH better damage and resistance values. Do you think he has mods unlocked for his weapons and armor? How many good legendaries do you think he has found? I'll bet he doesn't have a lot of chems or stims to use. What about experience? Does he know how to deal with someone using a stealth boy or chameleon armor? Does he even HAVE either of those at lvl 15? He hasn't even distributed all his attribute points by this time. When your level is that low, fuck yeah it matters! It evens out the higher level you get, because THEN all the matters is your gear and card build. But wasting a lvl 91 player that got the drop on him at lvl 15 was either quite the accomplishment, his enemy severely let his guard down, or the opponent was about as bright as a sea sponge...
---
Slippery Slope Fallacy, mate. Not saying you're wrong, just think jumping the gun doesn't do anyone any good.
---
Can confirm this worked.
---
Just annoyed I wasted my time chasing a cargo bot across Apalachia &amp; used heaps of film on it &amp; it's virtibot escort.
---
I certainly will not buy or use repair kits another unbelievable disappoint to add to their rapidly  growing list. I feel bad for bethesdas stock holders.
---
I'd pay for them to fix the bug that keeps wiping out my ammo....
---
Edit: the armor was just a 2* Robot piece so I'm not too concerned with losing it. Just doesn't make sense why they keep deleting items.
---
That's not really true. There are other challenges. Lots of other challenges. One could focus on killing Scorched with a variety of weapons and get more Atoms, as one example. There's all kinda of super easy ones, like taking screenshots in each region.
---
I've only been keeping 2 star or above or any one star that's a really good prefix.
---
When beta ended, ps4 made new folder for photos and so i cant see photos from beta.
---
I’ve played quite a bit of this game.
---
I welcome a ranged option for the silent melee build. Melee is all well and good until you gotta hit something on a roof or wait for a scorchbeast to land. I’m hoping that strength still plays a role, maybe draw strength?
---
Even the mission where he drops the orbital strikes from the Kovac-Muldoon make sense. MODUS believes he's found his "vermin" and wants you to eradicate them. He can see an "infestation" there but he see what it is, so he nukes it from orbit, assuming it to be the rogue Enclave. And look at the language he uses when he talks about them as pests and infestations. Every MODUS event ties in with this concept.
---
Again, just a theory. I thought about it when reading through MODUS story. If the Enclave disabled his systems he wouldn't have been able to see them flee. He tried to kill all of them instead, but perhaps the saboteurs found an emergency exit and got out (which, again, ties into them emerging in that audio tape and not knowing exactly where they were or how bad the state of the world was in). And who better than the Enclave to know the secrets going on in the vaults around them, as well as planned opening dates?
---
I do understand OP's frustrations. But comparing it to Fortnite of all things? Really though..

Didn't need to data mine to see Watoga was undoubtedly legendaryless, My husband posted about this weeks ago and was met with nothing but hate and denial by the idiots who think they know every aspect of the game and touted how "Bethesda would never do that" or " I just got my 1st legendary explosive weapon at Watoga, it's not nerfed ...you are just trolling"..... We are Adults and have no time or interest to troll little kids or idiots in full and utter denial of fact because they assume they know everything there is to know about FO76 and they don't know shit...
---
I don't know how I'd feel about this tbh. Having a constant stream of:  
---
"WTB TSE HM G ABC ZXCTEA GTG ONO BBYZW" Or other such similar garbage, I would honestly rather they just keep it on the forums. Yes I could turn the chat off, but that would defeat the purpose and probably put anyone who did so at a disadvantage.
---
The lever gets used when firing. It's easier to see when in 3rd person.
---
u/valseek
---
Same here. Getting tired of crashes.
---
No, because the inflation caused by those 15 people has already arrived. They control the trade and set prices. Even when new gear comes out, they could possibly work to retain control by outputting their previous wares and caps to grab up new items.
---
The important thing is to let go. All modern economics is basically funny munny, with value derived from what others think is its value. This is why god-teir items don't sell for caps very often any more, caps have no value to the people setting the prices.
---
Instead, go for volume. get all the little shitty cheap/free legendaries while you can, because when the vendor arrives, people are gonna relaize those stupid 10 cap Mutant's Batons have more value than said 10 caps.
---
It was since launch, there was challenges to make many photos in photo mode. I always have one free spot atleasf, made photo, delete it, make another.
---
Camera will make photo even if you don't have space, so you can make challenges without deleting any of your old photos atleast, still you cant make more than 50 loading screens
---
If you look at the roadmap, Nuclear Winter has a badge with 5 stars on it(New Features) . I'm guessing that's when it comes out.
---
I would love for the Disciples handmade skin to be available. Wasnt a fan of that gang but the green and black was awesome on the handmade.
---
If only we could also actually set it down. I would likely set it on the counter in my kitchen so that guests could sign it and leave comments on the house.
---
There’s a roadmap? I guess I missed that part lol. I’ll take a look. Thanks
---
Do you think we’ll get more achievements/trophies as the game continues to update?
---
I was hoping Nukashine and Laying Lowe would, but unfortunately they did not
---
i believe they are coming out when they introduce the backpacks.  been reading up on what the dataminers are finding, and so far, no mention.
---
It would be great if there was finally some realism with arrows and they did absolutely nothing to someone in power armour except degrade condition slightly.
---
Yeah I expected some form of compensation. Cant think of a game that wouldnt give you what you missed. Maybe theyll still do the right thing.
---
I was born on these mean streets
---
This is not entitlement, you fool. This is a sort of "contract" that was set up from the beginning. Known from the outset. They would release new content for free, and make their money by selling cosmetic items. Those items could be earned, purchased, or a combination of the two.
---
I can absolutely get mad at them for this. And I'm not going to be groveling at their feet for the existence of the free currency. You can forgive them all you want, accept their shitty customer service, bugged game, and sloppy work, but I'm certainly not going to. As I stated before, other companies have stepped up when they messed up. I'd expect Bethesda to do the same. I'm not surprised they haven't.
---
I expect things to work that I paid for. That's not entitlement.
---
Yeah here's a link, just scroll down past the news.

 [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/)

Earn them by playing

Atom store kits are basic

You get advanced ones by playing
---
just let us craft them.
---
::drops mic::
---
On PS4 it is storaged in console hard drive even after deleting ingame, no need for this :) but you have only 50 photos that will apear as loading screen.
---
Connect Bethesda . net with your photo gallery to export them to your account. Then have the option to import stored photos (that have been taken in game) back into F76 in case you still want to use them as loading screen backgrounds.
---
Ignore caps. Invest in boolets. Ahhh, capitalisim, my friend. Whoever has the boolets has the market.
---
Joke aside, money is easy through normal gameplay, especially given the finite cap... er, cap that the vendors have. So have at it.
---
I think there could be a good way to set the game in the future/add human npcs or new factions. Similar to how there’s adventure and survival mode, the dlc could be its own “mode” with an updated map and npcs. And to get to this mode you have to 
---
1. Be at level 50 or above
---
2. Finish the main quest line
---
3. Complete any other “essential” quests to understand the dlc
---
The mode could be called “reclaimed mode” (or something way better) and it would basically be what Appalachia is like after vault 76’s brightest were released and possibly restored some of the factions or new factions have moved in and are introduced.
---
Not calling you a liar or anyone else here but this proves otherwise.

I needed your photography skills last week when I was being murdered on repeat by a Mirelurk King in the Wendigo Cave 😆

Camera will be checked in even if you have full galery, so challenges can be done.
---
Thanks man. If u ever need something lmk
---
Following this
---
ummmm, ok?
---
Which platform are you on?
---
On PC I have more than 125 or so already
---
Maybe the Sheepsquatch just photobombed you and you dont realize it. XD check the background closely.
---
It's not complicated just need the right blast zone and it's quick. Killing enemies for the mass n fluid will be the longer part depending :)
---
That's your competitive advantage? A one off, very specific insurance policy for stupidity? 
---
Not to mention no one with a sniper build is going to be going out with their weapon on the verge of breaking ....
---
Not to mention that the time it took you to apply that repair kit, is time you're not shooting the guy rushing you.....which is time for him to apply aid.... Close the distance....
---
So is it really an advantage? 
---
Really?
---
Also that's not a competitive advantage. If your sniper rifle did more damage to characters equipped with a melee weapon via a mod you bought in the AS? That's a competitive advantage. 
---
The kinds of competitive advantages that create P2W scenarios don't affect 1 out of 986637 encounters. They provide a consistent advantage.
---
You people are trying to make a case where there isn't one. Even in the rare occurrence you mention it's not even a clear advantage.... You still have a draw back.... Time. You have to open your pip boy..... Find your weapon....inspect....choose repair....
---
I run around alot and dont have the things loading in piece by piece. (I'm on ps4) but when loading into places and out of places I can totally agree with having to wait a minute befor I can actually do anything.
---
Eh, not pacifist, just not as tough as other factions. They’re still former cops, firefighters, EMTs, all of whom are badasses in their own way. 
---
Anyway, as for your idea, I think it’s a good idea! The Responders controlled many of the civilian areas, after all.
---
No problem man, thanks
---
I have 48 photos from my 500hours of gameplay, with people who don't play anymore, fastnach, glitches,.....

How do you choose what item you're repairing with?

The ranger district office?

I'm not quite to level 20 yet (almost), but I'd definitely be up for some questing/leveling up when I get to level 20 (which will hopefully be tomorrow).
---
EA and Bethesda is nowhere on the same level and if you think they are you obviously are on some sort of bandwagon. Downvote all you want but bethesda is 10x the game company EA will ever be.
---
You can get a few weapons up to 4\*, besides the blade mod, some guns can get things like Scorched Receivers.
---
Future content is one of the most likely scenarios. Every MMO has some sort of power creep in their meta as things move forward. Looks like they planned ahead in Fallout and left room to expand.
---
The other theory, back a few months ago, was that Bethesda knew there would be multiple duplication exploits so there was a large amount of wiggle room to create a stronger meta once the dupe bugs were patched to kill the meta of whatever was duped a lot (in our case it was the TSE).
---
Try using this.  [https://fo76map.com/](https://fo76map.com/) 
---
Not sure if you're wanting resources or a pre built area, but help me figure out where to stay.
---
Just in case: You must be close enough to the target for the name to appear when focusing on it, maybe 20ft away. Long distance shots do not seem to work, or at least not consistently.
---
I agree that they might still do what's right. It was such a glaring error, to see each day the loss of Atoms. I can't understand it.
---
Longer loading times won't fix this issue. All computers (including consoles) have a fixed amount of RAM, and it can be assumed the FO76 is most likely using all of it. Loading screens give time to load up the ram with textures, shaders, etc. The trick with making the game smoother when moving between emvironments is to optimize the process of deleting useless info from ram and putting relevant info into it. (Simplified, but it makes the point)
---
I'm kind of assuming that all the easy ones are done already. Either that or you'e not willing to kill 1000 robots with a weapon you've never used before just to get that 40 or 80 atoms
---
lol!!  +1
---
I think some one a while back datamined that power armor is supposed to get certain legendary prefixes at some point.
---
UPDATE 
---
Got a refund&gt; [https://imgur.com/a/wNOfFWz](https://imgur.com/a/wNOfFWz)

Well, thank you for the refund Oscar from Bethesda. I suppose also thanks for the item? I won't ever use it, but thanks I guess?

As an actual photographer dying to break into photojournalism I love this idea!! I've already got my character rocking the suspenders and slacks and the newsboy cap to go for that photography look in game.

Well I can respect that

This is not a dig on Wulf here, but having a cool idea and implementing it is wildly different. Everyone can have ideas, but someone has to make them work.
---
Ya I don’t ever want to jump to conclusions, was more wanting to see if it was just me. I’d love to see some proof either way before I make any claims, but I don’t know a great way to get the rates/correct numbers to test for myself. However, yes, I fully admit I’m probably reading into it.

Another post said there’s a wendigo head only, no arms that starts at same hotel... I read it here in this Reddit...

I have an issue where I can't repair my armor...says I don't have the materials when I DO.  Hmmm indeed...

I think you're probably most likely absolutely right. I'm running out of storage space on both my accounts for the 2 star+ legendaries I'm saving.

You have to find a tourist’s body and pick up what they have on them to trigger the quest! It’s very hard to do, as it requires a lot of server hopping. Some people have posted maps pointing at all the locations where tourists spawn. I hope this helps!

With marsupial mutation you can skip right to the wendigo right in the beginning of the cave if that’s what you were after. There’s a little ledge that’s just outside of normal jump height. Used this trick to farm for a decent Dragon
---
Imho the garbage 3\* junkies walking canes and crap like that are what you should save by the ton. They don't take up a lot of space in your stash and as far as we know to the legendary vendor, 3\* is 3\* whether it's a furious security baton or a TSE Tesla rifle.
---
Ye I jus want some skins for my camp.. I'm with vault tech now so I need to rep my employers lol jus want a deal from the atom shop.
---
Yea, that's just with the low level one, without boosting it with damage perks or so.
---
... five months ago. I realize this may be a shock, but they've barely even begin adding stuff due to the months long bug hunt process. It's gonna take time.
---
Seriously though. Imagine if you were a casual fallut 76 player. That doesn't know about reddit etc. 
---
It could be weeks/months or if ever that you would know about the camera. Its really ******* stupid way to implement it.
---
I bet more players bought atoms in the Xbox store today than any other time or planning to. I’m betting a large number will use them and just not say anything.
---
I have to wonder if they are purposefully mis-allocationg people on tasks because of some kind of higher up declaring they prioritize something else that is more lucrative. A lot of these things would be clear fixes to someone actually involved in development. BGS, as we know, certainly seem to have some odd minded folks up in corporate with their strings in hand.
---
**First:**  
---
I Upvoted this is because I enjoy healthy discussion..  
---
   
---
**Second:**   
---
As a potentially one of those traders I'm going to wade into this..   
---
Most of the traders I know either wouldn't  accept the known duped TSE's in trade or put a lower value on them when doing trades with them..   
---
As for the duped armor, personally avoided it, unless I know who it was coming from....   
---
But the problem isn't/wasn't most of the remaining traders, it is the trickle down from some of the people who have been banned already...   
---
Why should I deny a trade from a random Lvl 75 player with one of **those** items, when that person could have (and likely did) obtaining it from another random trade, a vendor (for 2+ weeks the dupers were "seeding" items to try and defuse blame".   
---
Personally when I see one of the known duped items show up in a trade I let the seller know I give it less value, and why, and for "God Rolls" I won't accept it as the "core" of the trade...  
---
    
---
**Third:**
---
As for getting those awesome items, you'd be surprised what I find on vendors every day, including Assassin/Sentinel, Weightless/Cav and bloodied swing speed weapons that someone didn't want, but it's great to purchase as it bulks up my inventory.     
---
      
---
**Fourth and Last:**  
---
Regarding the rebalancing of the in game economy...we've already seen some of that, and more will occur as the "Meta" changes and Legendaries get rebalanced (it will likely happen).   
---
Give it time...
---
i had the same idea.  i just picked a location near the nuka cola plant, where i get my quantums at.
---
i tell ya, nothing is more fun, than sitting in my pub, drinking vintage nukashine, with party boy 3 / happy go lucky 2 / professional drinker 1 / cola nut 2.
---
i keep expecting to wake up in the skyrim universe!!  lmao
---
Yes. Just don't buy them like everyone else...
---
Still super stupid its not just a cosmetic skin mod that you can apply to legendary assaultron heads. 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Yeah buddy!
---
Of course, you're helping - jus suggesting if your server be full or different platform :)
---
By any chance will we be able to print these pictures out in the future and hang them in our camp?
---
I agree that this is extremely annoying!!! 
---
They are making it harder and harder to justify taking workshops.
---
DC’d AGAIN
---
I mean I see it is a weapon, and I also see that you have the plan for the salvaged assultron head. So you video does not prove me wrong. 
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/u34k3J9 
---
As you can see what I circled, they state you have to have LEARNED the plans for the salvaged assultron head before being able to craft the imposter version. 
---
So while it could be twisted they are selling weapons in the atom shop, they have locked it behind a plan that is only available in the game. So you are really only buying a skin. 
---
Now if you post a video of a character that does not know the plan for the salvaged assultron head and they are still able to craft the imposter version, I will rescind all my previous statements.
---
I used a US Supply Requisition, ran to the circle, and waited. When the dliverybot showed, I ran up as close as possible, stopped moving, aimed until i saw the little identifying thing in the upper right, and clicked.
---
I found him at the giant teapot after 3 hours, looted him,  server crashed, no camera, had to start over.
---
Yea, hopefully they fix it to make it a skin and not keep it as a extra weapon. Don't get me wrong, I understand people wanted the ATOM store to just be all cosmetics, and then you got the whole repair kit thing going on (Don't really plan on buying or using kits, so it's not a big deal to me), but a "Cosmetic" that is a whole new weapon? I don't understand that at all.
---
Ppl kick my ass in pvp without the goddamn repair kits.. and I bet I can fekkin wreck alot of you in pvp now. DAMNED REPAIR KITS WONT SAVE YOU OR ME...go on and repair you shit while I waste you n sell you junk for chump change to vendors
---
Are you PS4
---
Platform?
---
Yeah I agree, once they start selling overpowered guns and outfits that give you better defense and stuff I’ll agree they went to far and it’s P2W. But right now you’re just paying for convenience and a time saver.
---
Yea its hella confusing.
---
Sent! Thank you
---
Best there is bud. Ive met some really awesome people in this game.  Theres a bunch of shit talkin about it anc bethesda or whafever..but man. Any other game after 350 hrs id prolly be done for good..but i feel like im just gettin started lol
---
It is what it is at this point. I mean I love the game, but I just don’t feel like it’s necessary to go back on their word about non cosmetics in the atom shop especially for something so trivial but still takes away from the survival aspect of adventure mode, gathering materials is like a big part of the game ya know
---
Thanks, keep being a good human!
---
No problem! See you soon
---
...and now you know I have to do this too (***takes off all armor and dies***)  ... I'll try to post some pics at a later date lol

No problem! Thank you for everything as well

There is a bug with many of the melee weapons were they failed to add a mod-Association keyword that would allow the blade upgrades to show up in the crafting menu, but the "MODCOL" is coded in, allowing for them to rarely spawn as a upgraded weapon..  
---
If one drops, especially a legendary version, don't every try and change the blade in the bench, you'll regret it.. :(
---
I can be. I just got off work. U on?
---
no the max you can have through lvling up is 15 in any stat(i think?)
---
i use unyeilding armor which gives +3 special for each piece you have equipped when under 30%hp.
---
Nah just roll it down the hill haha
---
Please no, let's not take the grey and brown wasteland game and make it look even MORE monochrome.
---
Thanks man!!
---
Just today I learned I could make my own adhesive after killing myself looking for duct tape...
---
Ammo factory, Poseidon plant and grafton steel yard all have a vertibot pad
---
If you say something even -slightly- negative about bethesda, there are fanboys who will nuke your posts/comments, yes.
---
I have forgotten ALL about BIV lol
---
RadalAnt lager is +50 carryweight but only for like 1 minute, also pretty useless
---
Tickblood Tequila gives you health regen when melee attacking, but risks disease. It also requires stabilized flux to make, making it an incredibly expensive stimpack that requires you to hit enemies to work.
---
Best bug I've seen In a while!
---
Couldn't say I have, the only people I meet in adventure mode are douchenuckles who come flying in through my walls like the kool-aid man and destroy everything in my camp after stealing from my crops and water purifiers. Lol
---
Consider the piper paid....lol
---
Get a prepaid credit card or use something like [https://privacy.com/](https://privacy.com/) to create virtual cards for each place you purchase online.
---
Very interesting post
---
No problem still here FYI
---
this gun's spread is stupid big, if you walk and shoot, the hit box literally is bigger than the screen, you literally need to be in power armor and use the stabilizer perk to have it be slightly decent accuracy
---
&gt;Unbreakable
---
&gt;almost unbreakable
---
ಠ_ಠ
---
Ty Hope you got a kick out of it
---
I was looking at those today, one of the challenges involves taking a picture of an alien...
---
Like, most of us are pretty solid in knowing the Flatwoods Monster is an alien, but that was a separate category in the challenge, sooooooo
---
Can you actually answer the question?
---
I'm just happy we can still arm or put away a weapon to bypass the whole crash landing animation. It inspires the same eye roll reaction as a breaking a Bobbie pin.
---
Half the time I go to the park I only get one daily quest instead of the three. Haven’t done the chow line in weeks
---
It was in the notes for the last update, they increased the material cost and decreased value for several outfits they felt people were exploiting for caps. They just didn't specify which. I think giving vendors a shared caps pool made that seem more necessary--they no longer have the counter measure of far travel costs to balance it. 
---
Sad for many of us--i finally got the witch costume 4 days earlier. I considered it less an exploit than a reward for finally finding the plan. Witch, Skeleton, and various civil war pieces were affected. Probably others.
---
Or bring back Vertibird Signal Grenades😂
---
Thank you! A million upvotes for that. Didn't realize there was such a thing. Like I said, I'm clueless.
---
Thank you so much!!
---
If you enjoyed your first play through go for it, although a new character might not be bad. It can be difficult getting back into a game otherwise. The new content has been pretty good albeit spread out.
---
Excellent!
---
Constipation could be a new disease where you get -20 carry weight.
---
Because other players are too hard to track down in Adventure.
---
But mainly because - people are jerks.
---
If you really want a laugh, jump whilst doing this. Timing it right sends the player into the air on an arc as well as the sudden kick of physics movement. 
---
Teleporting from Berkley Springs to Watoga was pretty damn hilarious.
---
Those are hold overs from Fallout 4, not actually specifically for '76
---
Darn. Was hoping to do it.
---
Save them for the raids. No need now really. Like even if my weapon breaks mid queen fight I just run to the shed switch perks repair and switch back and reengage. I guess if your favorite damage weapon breaks mid fight and you dont want to run repair and back again I guess you could use it. ;)
---
Just been disconnected twice in three hours after trying to claim workshops and then farm. 
---
If you think you’re going to need to claim workshops to maintain resources, it’s not worth it.
---
Or they got a beat down in PvP and acting out...lol
---
Another issue is sometimes when I die I get stuck on a infinite loading screen during the Sheep squatch imposter event
---
Pretty good weight savings.  Keep it tucked away as insurance for when something breaks unexpectedly. Since it so little weight it's no biggie.  I keep an Addictol in inventory just incase I get an addiction (grape mentats) rarely happens but nice to be able to take care of it instantly and move on.
---
Impressive.... 
---
So I assume you're in you're in your 60's (That's assuming you bought it at age 15)? 
---
Since prior to 75 (when a console was released that only played pong) there wasn't a home release. Before that it was glass top and stand up units ..... Which as a child would have been a significant purchase....
---
So 60+ year old man.... What does Pong have to do with 76? While they are both Video Games.....one is coded....one is not. They couldn't be more different.
---
Ah, thought it was recent stuff that was datamined showing it was coming? Whatever though, hope we get something, wouldn't mind some weapon weight reductions and etc on my power armor xD.
---
&gt; (MASSIVE SPOILERS)
---
How do you spoil an online game?
---
I thought we were all aware the key change was in anticipation of repair kits?
---
Preservatives from Cram and other canned “meats”
---
Thanks tips McGee
---
That started being an issue in Patch 6 my friends...
---
yeah that and the mystery meat was last week.
---
Not sure=/ discord cut out.
---
Thanks! Got tired of searching and everybody else that was holding the corpse was PS4 or PC, you're a life saver!
---
Id love to see this included for "legacy" characters. I've got ammosmith rank 2 standard, but ammosmith 1 animated.
---
Make sure you've taken off your under armors, the bug where wearing specific outfits reduces your total armor value returned in patch 8
---
Well I'm going to buy them in protest of this protest. You're right they're not a big deal, they're just a time-saver. Zero tactical advantage whatsoever.
---
I guess. I just know that I'm within like 5 of one thing, and 22 of another thing, and there are various things that if I committed to doing I could probably get 500 Atoms in probably 3-4 days if I just did those things.
---
Here you go. This is my level 4 character that has not even seen an assaultron nor have the plans to make the salvaged assaultron head. I even try to make it and it says I am not a high enough level to make this weapon. Now if it was a skin then it would appear as a mod for the assaultron head but it does not.

Im fairly certain thats the only named location with the word "Ranger" in it

Tsk tsk tsk...‘‘tis better to stay silent and appear a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.
---
"Additionally, the more powerful Improved Repair Kits will not be available in the Shop and can be earned by completing in-game content, like killing the Scorchbeast Queen."
---
SBQ FLIES OFF INTO THE SUNSET......TIMER RUNS OUT.....EVENT FAILED
---
It's been mentioned to Bethesda, especially for "endgame" 2*+ armor, especially 3* with weight reduction or DMG reduction just blows PA out of the water.
---
Give us more ways to sort our stuff and Please Please give us a New tab. I don't always get to see what I got for finishing a quest due to all the ads in the area. New page is only reasonable.   Let us sort weapons by "bullet type" so it doesn't matter what I named anything, when I need a .45 I have the all together. 
---
Please let us make Armor sets.  It would make organizing for different needs(ex. Troubleshooter build for nuke launch)  much easier and replacing old components with new ones a much less time consuming peocess.
---
Please let us sort armor by body part so that "all left shoulder pieces" are together. "All chest", etc.
---
Put the expiring food at top not bottom
---
No one knows man
---
Dang this sub has the best ideas! These threads just amaze me, keep it up!
---
Raider PA with a T-60 helmet using a Atom Store paint...  
---
But I'm that nut in RaiderPA at level 367
---
Before I left I was doing a sneak/sniper build, are those builds viable or are the broken melee builds still going on?
---
Any guarantee alien or flatwoods monster spawns?
---
I have a few things like that. I have a handmade with something like "standard color" instead of paint. I also have a scoped tesla gun. The attachment says scoped, but there is no scope on the weapon. In fact, when trying to inspect it, the sights slot doesn't even show up anymore. Only the barrel
---
Oh yea, all my armor has some type of weight reduction, with Weapon Weights reduced being the dominate. (3 Weapon weight, 1 ammo, 1 food/chem/etc.)
---
jesus man just get a friend and make a mule character
---
I do claim workshops frequently for resources, and I do remember constant drops and disconnects, didn't know those are still a factor.
---
I dont think you understand why people are angry, but okay
---
There are a lot of things that could be improved about the inventory, but THIS is a no-brainer!
---
There goes -1 karma already!
---
I can do that too!
---
selling in game items online for real money is also completely against the TOS
---
Do what?
---
Oh I didn't know about the Tesla Rifle scope bug, thanks will document for my bug roundup!
---
I stopped playing in December because of them, just started playing again a few weeks ago. Seemed stable for a bit but it seems to be a serious issue still especially with more than one workshop
---
I'm probably just going to be down-voted and abused like the last time I said this, but I still don't understand how this is a "P2W element". It has zero tactical advantage AT ALL, it's just a time saver options for those who have more money than free time to play.
---
"slippery slope towards full Pay2Win" is just plain paranoia.
---
This will blow over soon. Redditors love their hysteria-induced karma farming.
---
It is casual underarmor, for mod purposes. Is what people have stated who purchased it. So, yes. It can get defenses and stat bonuses.
---
They literally said if they saw it being abused they would get rid of it not entitled brats going “duh daterminers sed Dey saw lunchboxes and FRIDGES!¡”
---
Still here
---
Oh thank fuck
---
It's painful for me, I'm "endgame" at Lvl 367, but know I'm seriously under performing in nearly every way because I refuse to "not use" PA
---
Xbox one, I’ve got Ansel at Col Kelly Monument.  My gamer tag is Trixie Roo.  I’ll be on for about an hour.  I’ll be the chick in the bathrobe and captain’s hat.
---
To be fair, even if only one person buys them, it doesn't cost Bethesda anything to have these kits in the atomic shop. They'll still technically be making a profit, no matter how few people buy them. The best thing we can do is keep making noise and don't shut up until they respect their original promise.
---
Rightttt too much time between the messages it's an event gotchaaa
---
They are definitely still viable, only build I would say isn't is a pistol build
---
What’s the point of data mining? Nothing is certain
---
I think it was more this
---
-"All the content we ever put out for Fallout 76–all the DLC, all the post-launch stuff–is going to be free. That’s important. And to say, the Atomic shop is cosmetic stuff. To make sure folks understand–look there’s a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we’re going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works and what you’re getting for your $60. That you know, when they put out new content or features or whatever, I’m getting that stuff for free. That feels right.”
---
If you already played the game and finished the main quest I would hold off until the ever upwards quest because with the amount of content right now, you would probably get only a day of enjoyment with the level you are. I do admit that the new quest lines are good but there isn't enough new content to satisfy the game for another month.    (this is just with the content right now and I have no doubt that the game will be more enjoyable in a month or two)
---
It's about microtransactions in general.  The idea of repair kits and cosmetics for atoms isn't that bad.  I think most people would agree to that.  It's where its leading.  Some games are pay to win because you cannot compete unless you pay lots or money to buy the best gear or upgrades or whatever.   Nobody wants to see fallout turn into to p2w.  Not only does it make for a crappy experience but its already a 60 dollar game.  It shouldn't have microtransactions that affect gameplay.  While it's a bit of an overreaction I get where people are mad about it.
---
Plushies are life. My two plushies are currently loving each tiger too much.
---
That's a bummer! I've had rage moments where I spent good resources to farm and then disconnect.
---
Dunno but i got 3 mules full of trash legendaries jhst in case lol
---
melee is probably still the best build right now but you can do pretty well with a sniper build.
---
Dang. Got this one too.  BSG better take notes... This has got to be making them $$.
---
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD YES. I've been saying this since launch, SKINS AND NEW EMOTES, I might actually spend real money on atoms.
---
The Legendary Vendor specifically has the ability to provide the "Almost unbreakable" (x4 Durability) and "Low Weight" (Item weighs much less) Legendary Effects for Power Armor, as datamined a few hours ago.
---
I want to know why we can't have a welcome mat at our camp so we can choose our spawn point it's in the game.
---
I can't logically or responsible argue against what you or others you know may have refused to deal in as far as duped goods. I DO know that on multiple occasions, I have traded organic god rolls for things I had to "hold on just a little bit" for someone to "get". TSEs, bloodied/etc after the nerf.   
---
I wouldn't expect traders to not trade just because nearly everything valuable was duped. What I'm more referring to was the extremely widespread practice of trading worthless duped items at the cyclic rate for organic legendaries, saturating the market with these items, while hoarding the organic drops. Trying to complete a trade for a desireable armor piece (uny/sent/etc) is nearly impossible, because all of the trades are being routed through a select few individuals who are holding out for absurdly specific legendary drops. Once someone finally gets that item organically, it will be traded for one of many duped items, most likely, and then it's gone, forever.   
---
As for finding things on vendors, I haven't gotten that lucky, but I routinely buy junk 2 stars and 3 stars from vendors, in hopes that the purveyor will actually be a decent addition to the game.
---
Not what I was talking about however. You can’t run online games on $60 alone. Not sure if you know this but game prices haven’t changed in 10 years yet everything else has gone up. I gladly throw them money when I can for making such an amazing game 👍🏻
---
Also, while we're talking about this location. Perfect example of a big hollow lifeless building. A couple terminals and holos
---
FUCK REPAIR KITS :).
---
Yeah i think they will. On the road map , fall of 2019 has “ new main storyline” marked , so I’m sure you’ll get achievements from that
---
What's interesting is that doesn't happen for others who are already in game, it's just your loading is throttled. I have two systems sitting side by side and if one is logged in near the other's CAMP, once I log in with the other, it appears almost instantly on the first. The other, however, sees it loading slowly like you've described. So, you can at least rest assured that the slow loading of your CAMP doesn't happen for others, it only happens for you.
---
It's an extremely plentiful farming grounds. Don't worry about those quests for now, you will eventually get them done. The only other quest that will be sending you there at the earlier levels is for the Mistress of Mystery quest, but it's a matter of running in, grabbing an item and running back out. Once you get to the point where you can farm the Ghouls you'll be right there with them.
---
Didn't it originate from a vault though? I don't remember spore carriers being in the big mt at all, but I remember that there was one vault (22 maybe?) That it did come from.
---
Course, I don't know too much of the lore for them, so maybe.
---
Because legendary ghouls spawn there, and they drop legendary gear.
---
I’m not joking the fact that they’re mad I’m joking the levels of anger. Like you’d think they had wiped everyone character. It’s a repair kit. It’s convenient. It should be craft able yes. You should not have adults literally crying and uninstalling a game over it lol
---
Supposedly turn in legendary items for tokens. Use tokens to reroll on legendarys you already have. Sounds very underwhelming.
---
What weapon are you using
---
I’m still on the fence about buying it. I really like the way it looks, but it being under armor has me holding back. 🥴
---
They where a project made by the Big MT in the botanical gardens (you can visit it and see the spore plants) and then given to vault tec.
---
Oh I’m I guess “endgame” couple levels away from 190 (could of probably been higher, but I dropped this game and came back a week or two before the parade event.) I use to use PA all the time, but now I only use it when in a nuke zone. I also kinda don’t follow new metas like “full unyielding sentinels with 3* bloodied,” I kinda just take the game at my own pace and enjoy it as much as possible, recently found a team when I came back which makes it fun for me, but I’m currently specing to move points out of intelligence into charisma, for a medic type build. I only had 11 intelligence but that was only for power armor perks, but I’ve got tired of running around in it, I’d probably go back if we had some type of legendary power armor, even if it was just a minor boost to make it viable.
---
Do you have a  pine tree 🌲 air freshener in that power armor? lol
---
They take it.  If you're on Xbox you can have mine for cheap. Im pretty sure I still have it anyways.
---
I would’ve been ok if they added them in a couple of months, but this games still going through puberty , there’s still a lot of bugs
---
Yes. BSG you got $$ from me for this one. Bone Armor was free (in game atoms), but this one is on me... I don't mind dropping $14 for a skin if it's cool. Keep it coming. Ditch the kits keep this stuff rolling.
---
Submit a support ticket to their website
---
Forgot about the perk names in the post. Wow, didn't see this one coming from the studio
---

Here are some old screenshots I took of it a while back
---
HHaha honestly wouldnt hurt. Ol boy in there just stays in his boxers.  ...and the fas man mask. Its hilarious hoppin out to craft when people are standin around.
---
Thats fine and dandy, but dont claim it as "new" content and tie a questline to it thats horrific to acquire and mindless to complete...all I want is for them to tell us something, and have it be exactly what we get
---
All Rise (rocketed sledgehammer) and gauss rifle.
---
My friend, this same thing has cropped up every few weeks since the B.E.T.A.    
---
Hell someone reported in after patch 8 as if it was new, it's not, trust me, and there is no direct linkage to the Legendary vendor in the game files, as of patch 8 (out of town so not gotten to load the 8.5 patch in XEdit)
---
Okay. Thanks
---
I will dm you.
---
Thank you man! You saved me the headache of ever having to search for the tourist.
---
"Fashion finder" Rank 3 allows you to find armor in the same category as your equipped ones.
---
Nah i don't know.
---
As a rifle user, go fuck yourself with all your guns. 
---
Seriously though if they’d add a rifle weight reduction perk I’d never have to worry about forgetting to repair. I carry two guns, and they have different purposes. I can’t carry a third just in case.
---
I think it’s in damn good shape for their first ever online game. And an enormous one at that.
---
I don't know if it's a bug, but I'm also blowing through Cores. It's ridiculous. I used to be able to last a 3-4 hour gaming session on 4 25% cores, now I can blow through 5+ FULL cores in the same time. I actually got Poseidon for a couple hours the other night so I could farm cores, and I've NEVER needed to do that before. I got 11 cores, and the very next day blew through 5 of them in a sitting. 
---
I'm pretty upset about it lol.
---
You should  post this on r/market76 you’ll get more offers
---
They said they were going to increase the size
---
You will find something better
---
Yeah, OK, the people who have full-time jobs, families or a mental illness and barely get the time or opportunity to play and just want a casual and easy experience are "doing this game wrong". 
---
Cool opinion bro.
---
If you use power attacks or vats a lot they cost you or if you run that drains it or if you're overweight and move it drains
---
I've noticed some of my cores disappearing, and then reappearing after a a server hop, or after awhile. I *think* what is happening is when a new core is loaded in it'll make the whole stack vanish from your inventory until you load back in and you've burned a bit of the core. Like if you have a stack of two cores at 50% they will both "go in" to your power armor, but once you burn your core down to 49% and load back into the game they stack will separate and you'll get your one at 50% back in your inventory. Again this is just my theory based on my experience.
---
Open your bible skip to book of revelations. Thy evil serpent shall utter lies and be reborn into a repair kit, fear not as the righteous will resist temptaion but be wary that this is a gateway a breaking of all seven seals and hell shall flood thy atom shop with real pay to win items like 5 star items. 
---
You fools think the 4 horseman skins are just something they did? Read between the lines people!! Its the rapture and they are mocking us.
---
Exactly. Same here
---
I was playing around 430ish sunday and had an interaction with a Japanese player. Was cool but he hung around the church too long in Charleston i didnt really understand what he was doing. The church event was over and we didnt get really anything.
---
Yeah, the games in good shape considering it’s their first online game. But still in the grand scheme of things it’s in a good spot, but it’s not bug free 
---
On top of that . They didn’t even make those things pay to win enough for me to go out and spend money on them lol.
---
Another BadWolf 😁
---
Stuff disappears from your stash. It seriously happens. You just don't notice until you start paying attention. In the last couple weeks I've lost over a dozen items since I started keeping a log. Today after the update I lost many more aid items and 1 armor piece off my main. It really does happen but most people don't believe it.
---
I have a charging lobber tesla rifle that is marginally useful but fun to use. The mod can only drop on nonlegendary teslas, doesn’t exist as a loose mod, and is not currently learnable.
---
Its not about the repair kits per se but their statement about “only cosmetics in the Atom
---
Shop” being false.
---
I’m sure people aren’t pissed about them because, lets be honest, being able to repair on the go is more of a convenience than an advantage. Its just the gateway to having more non-cosmetic items in the shop.
---
Do you have a jet pack on your PA? I didn’t realize how much my fusion cores were being sucked away by the jet pack and I used my jet pack more then I realized.
---
I'll admit I'm a bit of the exception to the rule, generally being willing to trade high end gear for loads of low to mid range legendary items, and most other vendors won't do the same, but I will say I don't think it's a grand conspiracy, it's more about basic supply and demand.  
---
They have it, and are willing to accept another known valuable unique legendary in exchange, and they would be fools to not.
---
I literally looked at it and said “oh they’re here” and carried on with my day and bought the plushie and the sign. It’s not that hard lmao
---
It’s honestly the worst just glad to save a few people to hassle
---
Still here, maybe another 20 min
---
Why can't you? Plug a round into everything and go hide somewhere. Free exp. 
---
 Nothing even attacks you inside the hotel itself, so you can do the tapes easy.

Bethesdrone sported
---
Not that i feel i need anyones approval anyway haha. Im quite a fallout fan played nearly every game a thousand times but if you act blind to obvious problems a game is having, how are those problems ever going to be resolved?
---
Betheshater sported. I can do that too.
---
I’m on Xbox I’ll take it off ya. Thanks are you one now?
---
I was thinking this at one point but the bug was also happening to my friend who has the same weapon
---
Yes. It's happened to me a couple times with encryptid.
---
It's one of the only places to farm 1* legendaries now lol. If they are there then everything is dead. The ghost don't respond like they used to so if your looking for a holotape or quest item you could most likely not encounter any enemies if they are there.
---
It’s happened 4 times today 3 on queens and 1 on encryptid.
---
Im not a bad guy in this game at all..i trade 0-0 sometines..but if i had the ability to take shits on someones camp front porch or in the muddle of their bedroom? Id pay a lotof real money to unlock that perk card.

I mostly play with Australians and New Zealanders. Plus I've come across a lot of Japanese players in my travels, too.
---
Hello again, [old friend](http://www.thesidekickorder.com/bbs2/uploads/post-2-1469994675.png)! I’m glad you could join us here in Fallout, it’s comforting to have something familiar to hold on to.
---
Same lmao, I bet r/gaming is going to throw a shitfit when they all hear about this.
---
I checked right now and I have 5 total. I don’t disagree with repair kits in the shop at all anymore. Good implementation.
---
Some people are already freaking out. On this post 😂
---
Man alive, what I wouldn't give for a big mission where you go in to wreck the Enclave and take MODUS out, once and for all.
---
I was kinda thinking of like a cave maybe or hole in the ground with some area to build if at all possible to better define
---
FFXV actually had something very close to this, and when one wasn’t using it to create yaoi storylines, it was an interesting addition.
---
Also can hard-lock you if you die.
---
I'm "missing" pretty much 1 or 2 locations from every biome, which is B/S
---
Thankfully you’re allowed to give criticism to a game which, although fun at times, 
---
1. Breaks lore multiple times
---
2. Goes back on promises of “only cosmetic atom shop items”
---
3. Still has bugs which existed since the BETA
---
You started name calling and now I’m not going to read what you said bethesdahater (I can still do it)
---
They’re over reacting in my opinion. I’d rather spend my atoms on a cool skin. If you just do the daily’s you’ll get enough atoms for them anyways
---
Here's a reason: Because ever since this game launched, literally everyone and their brother have been hating on Bethesda, almost as bad as the Mass Effect 3 ending controversy. You guys have been so bad that I don't blame Bethesda for not wanting to communicate. You guys find any and every reason to hate on Bethesda, to the point of perpetuation misconceptions, and finding things that aren't Bethesda's fault, and blaming them. There is nothing that can be done, Bethesda cannot please it's community because they don't want to be pleased, they want to hate on Bethesda.
---
There is no reason Bethesda should communicate with the community. We lost that privilege.
---
Yes, message me on Xbox n1ckybeth82
---
This is perfect, thanks!
---
i don't play with pistols but the kellog one it's in the game? i played a lot with that one in f4 it was so cool in first person!
---
Same, I spent my Beta time exploring the map, I think every single biome has at least 1 bugged location, so I cant comeplete any of those challenges
---
Hello? It's not bitching about everything? It's bitching about one specific thing. You're chosing such an odd fucking hill to die on. Like, how fucking dare consumers express issues with a product they received. Oh, no. People are unhappy. They're talking about it in a public forum. That means they're whining, which I find invalid and irrelevant and annoying because I don't agree with it and I will support the big company with more money then I will ever have! Like, what's your point and problem and baggage? You're a hypocrite, you see that? You've done nothing but bitch all fucking day, you did it to me. You've even deleted several of your fucking posts which got downvoted,  which is fucking funny because your name is FakeInternetPoints.
---
&gt;I don’t know why everyone has their panties in a bunch.
---
Because the community does nothing but make mountains out of mole hills. Literally every single controversy, the duper being banned, the guy that was harassing people and claiming to cleanse the wasteland of homosexuals being banned, the nuka rum thing, the thing where they said that the beta shows your information to other people when it didn't, This fiasco, so on and so on and so on. 
---
Like...this is really a non-issue and people are acting like the game's going pay to win all because they added a fucking repair kit, for 50 atoms, which forces you to dig through your inventory, find your broken item, then inspect it, then choose which kit you want to use, and then a confirmation. You would literally be dead the moment you open your pipboy. It's not as much of an advantage as people think it is. Therefore, it is not P2W.
---
Farming mats is a part of the game. I work a full time job and only really get on during the weekends myself. If you want a causal experience that's cool, but you need to understand you can't just be running from quest marker to quest marker, you need to manage your equipment too, it's half of what this game is about. Part of that casual experience is making note of spots where you get certain materials that are important and do farming runs some times. It's no different then any other grinding game. And after so many hours accumulated, whether over a shot period of time or a longer more causal period you won't be wanting for repairs a begging people to buy your excess ballistic fiber.
---
I love how they listened to overwhelming player feedback regarding non-cosmetic items in the cash shop, and duly ignored all of it. Because fuck you, that's why.
---
yep
---
Downvotes for days aha
---
The info on the PA Legendary effects is not valid, it's been there since the B.E.T.A. And gets reported as "new" every few weeks (was reported as new in some of the 8.0 "data mining".  
---
These are holdovers from Fallout 4, and as of patch 8 (out of town and not gotten to open 8.5 in XEdit) have no direct linkage to the new Legendary Vendor
---
They do it because they don't actually give a shit about us.
---
That lead loss is squarely on Stott's shoulder.  He absolutely should have called a timeout in that push.
---
Didn't anyone tell you not everything on the Internet is true? ;)   
---
But seriously, thanks, posted more or less the same comment there.
---
Platform: PS4
---
First crash: Died, froze the game. Lost all my junk. Had to force close and start the game up again.
---
Second crash: Died, froze the game. Didn't have any junk this time. Had to force close and start the game up again.
---
Third Crash: I actually landed on the ground, then the game soft-locked. I couldn't fast travel due to enemies being "nearby" despite there clearly not being anything near
---
Fourth Crash: I achieved orbit, then the game blue-screened before I could land.
---
10/10 would continue to abuse physics bug for the hilarity.
---
I do, and they aren't.
---
A repair kit requires you to stop and use it, and it only repairs your gear to 100%. It's going to break as quickly as it would otherwise, requiring you to stop and use another one. Weapon Artisan and Fix it Good repair your gear to 200% and can be swapped out when not in use.
---
You need Gunsmith/Makeshift Warrior/etc. to make better weapon mods anyway, and they're still useful for making your weapons last longer even if you wanted to use repair kits. No one wants to stop to use a kit any more frequently than they would need to.
---
The repair kits are a trifling matter that do not provide any meaningful advantage. The only real arguments against them are anger at Pete Hines for lying or suppositions about slippery slopes.
---
&gt;Would definitely be entertaining to see creepy robot overlord going against its own evil masters!
---
Damn, I just had a thought: MODUS going against his own evil masters would essentially be a civil war between the remnants of the Enclave and MODUS. And the game's already got endless references to the Civil War in the state's backstory and locations, along with items in the game (black powder rifles, gatlings, union/confederate clothing). I always thought it weird they went out of their way to include things like that when they didn't in Virginia/DC (Fallout 3). 
---
The allegory is almost too perfect.
---
That’s ok, you can also give an actual argument as to why you think this is ok for Bethesda to do but your post my man
---
Oh well, I got enough karma anyway
---
Dunno why you got downvoted, last I checked that was true.
---
Anyone know where he is at the giant tea pot?
---
How high do you get when you downvote? Like 4/20 high or just Tuesday afternoon? Do you feel powerful?
---
Let me take a look and I'll tell you what you should sell to me and what you should sell to everyone else lol. Honestly you're lucky. I learned late and definitely off loaded a crap load of good gear because I didn't know. 
---
Key word to look for are "less damage while standing" or "less damage while sprinting" those are your sentinel and cavaliers pieces. Depending on the armor those modifiers are going for a lot if they have another star modifier. 
---
Anything 3* unyileding with the Cav/sent is golden in my opinion or any armor with the Sent/Cav prefix is a money maker for PvP. 
---
If you're looking to sell one of those pieces, I suggest doing an auction. List it with a starting bid and let the community fight over it. You will get max caps that way.  If no one bites then you know to offload it to the vendors or wait til the new update. 
---
Again, just my opinion. But I would like to see you're stash lol.
---
Holy hell! Yes you do! Lemme give you a bit more lol. I just started reddit like 2 months ago, first day I was at like -30 because I was defending fallout 76 ahaha
---
Not a bad idea. Even if it's literally just one atom.
---
Uhm. There’s a guarantee fuzzy hard hat spawn. Quarry site in the bog where the mirelurk queen spawns. Ports potty.
---
I can confirm all of these plus the ones the other guy posted.  Been following this for weeks on cap stash runs.  With cap collector at max I manage to pull between 3 and 5000 caps per total run!
---
Really? I thought there wasn't such thing as condition in Fallout 4. Kinda useless legendary if you ask me ;)
---
It happened to me once on encryptid, the only thing I was able to do is to click on my friend's nickname and press reborn here and it worked. Luckily we were together. Otherwise I was able to smash my keyboard. That hurt me more than disappearing 3 star legendary mobs(
---
A.) If you're dumb enough to carry junk into battle with you, you deserve to die and lose all your shit. 
---
B.) Junk is used for literally more items than just repairing your shit. Like, for instance, crafting armor, crafting mods, crafting weapons, crafting furniture and decorations and other C.A.M.P stuff.
---
C.) There's still reward in killing an opponent in PVP: Caps and the satisfaction of wiping the floor with the douchebag that tried to fuck with your shit. 
---
D.) Stop fear mongering.
---
Have an Instigating 50% limb damage Guass rifle for trade
---
Okay, sounds good. I'm p3ngu1n_assault.
---
I have a 3* berserker deathclaw gauntlet
---
I bought the tricentennial edition :/ maybe one day ill be sitting on something valuable lol. Kinda like the ET game for atari.
---
About as high as a 4 year old with a sharpie. Please make an actual point for whatever side you’re fighting for in the future or else it kinda makes you look like an idiot online
---
Yet you’re STILL doing it. Lmao.
---
Otaku's biggest tip in the video is that Auto Laser w/ beam splitter benefits from commando AND Shotgun perks, including the stagger chance from enforcer on each beam (staggering being one of the best ways to break a sentinel out of their Dr)
---
They're still available to drop just not for energy weapons
---
Amen man. I could see the consoles struggling with this game but...a PC? I mean I built this rig to run any game I throw at it at, at least 60 FPS. FO4 above 60 FPS, running at least 50 mods, graphics at the max and no issues. F076 freaking giving me issues...wut. I get an online MMO has to work harder but I don't run across a lot of people when I play so it's not like it's struggling to render a bunch of people like Elder Scrolls Online (though even ESO gives me no issues running on max settings).
---
What in the world is making FO76 perform worse then ESO?
---
Lemme give you some more to lmao. Just a heads up since your new here, don’t say anything good about this game on r/gaming or any sub that’s a mainstream gaming related
---
Coming to join you now!
---
Challenge accepted 🤔
---
The crossbow is very underwhelming so what use is a bow and arrow going to be?
---
Explosive weapons still drop, they just removed explosive energy weapons. I've seen quite a people under the impression explosive weapons don't drop any more... Who started this rumor?
---
:\\ Mine were still there earlier, but I'm on pc.
---
Chat me over reddit?
---
TL;DR I have no idea what i'm talking about.
---
If it bothers you that much don’t make a stupid post
---
Thanks,  
---
I do bug roundup and do consolidated reports to Bethesda, clips like this are awesome, as it nails the point home.   
---
In this case it's not even a "drill" but a complete lack of Legendaries..
---
Oh that is great news, I'll keep an eye out. Any specific times they drop or just random?
---
I would like to take a peek at your gear since you've been gone. May be worth slot more than you think now. The market is crazy right now.
---
Ummm...   
---
Power armor in FO4 was the only thing outside of Workshop items that had condition...
---
You’re the one on my post sooo
---
In that case, got any uny/sent/any light/sturdy combat, light metal, or leather left arms?
---
I'm not buying them no matter what, cosmetics only.
---
I just posted about how much I love this game and how much better it is.
---
Oh that is great news, not too fussed about explosive energy anyway. I don't know I just heard it from other players in the game and I may have read a post on reddit I don't quite remember.
---
Any specific spots they drop or are they just random?
---
Never mind, my camp couldn’t be placed and no way am I giving up all the work I put in
---
I actually never finished the main quest, I just dropped nukes like crazy
---
Or what happens if your bowel hits critical stage.
---
fuck that were my marine assault helmet god dammit
---
Most of these fanboys should go back to fo4
---
I know, I read all your bug roundups. I'm the 900 hours guy, now close to 1300. All I do is play this game and I want it fixed. The best way I can do that is with videos.
---
I'm gonna clip every single fail legendary I get. Also I'm gonna post the biggest exploit/bug I know of once I find a server with a nuke zone.
---
Neat.
---
Got my vote
---
Yeah I don't have a clue what I'm talking about either..
---
Unfortunately they are gone forever. It's in a save file locally stored. I recently did an initialize on my ps4 and all of my photomode pictures got deleted too. Perhaps the save file which contained these photos got corrupted and the system replaced it?
---
Uhhh you can just come here, go to the stand, then go to a different world.  Your camp will still be where it was
---
Random like everything else
---
I got a vampire exploding black powder rifle from sheepsquatch event so they're here
---
Can I get your legendary weapons and armor?
---
It doesn't erase. It just can't be placed.  You just can't have the camp in THIS world.
---
Out of town, but welcome to check my spreadsheet (check my post history), I've got over 2,000 2*/3* Legendaries so can't remember them all..   
---
But I'll warn you, Generally that, AAE and BE weapons come in and go out fairly quickly.
---
I’m praying for you brother 🙏
---
I'm logging in to check things out, got some very good input and once I see how things our I night start over and try a new build. Thank you to all who gave me your two cents on the matter I appreciate it tremendously 👍
---
Good idea! I'll check those out tomorrow.
---
I'm on XB1, and I have pictures from about 2 / 2.5 months ago.
---
Laser Pistols, Laser Rifles, Plasma Gun^^[1], Missile Launcher, Chainsaw, Ripper, Flamer^^[2], Grenade Launcher^^[3], Axe^^[4], Shishkebab^^[5], Gamma Gun and definitely the syringer with it's various barrels.
---
----
---
[1] Either Plasma Pistol or Rifle variants as well as the Plasma thrower variant which adds a flamer style attack.
---
[2] I guess, there really isn't a proper equiv to a plaguespewer.
---
[3] Sort of an equiv to a blight launcher
---
[4] Sort of not really like the Bubotic Axe
---
[5] Sort of like a Plaguesword but not really.
---
😂😂
---
Slow and steady changes and "patch" that actually make more issues for them to offer fixes for in the atom shop 
---
Like the rates that items decay at now has been "bugged" for a while and is super fast but oh look at that the refrigerator is on the way i wonder if it'll go back to normal before that turns up :P 
---
Just because its not at the level of blades yet doesn't mean its not going that way. If you give an inch they will take the whole ruler.
---
Lol k dude, peace. I'm personally gunna pre-order the SHIT outta ES6, Starfield, Doom Eternal and more. While continuing to support and play 76.
---
How much, My GT is VS Arachnos
---
Happened to me the other day when I looted the imposter sheepsquatch and I died while in the transfer menu. I got the rotating screen death and it would not let me respawn or open any menus at all. Had to close the game and restart it. Ps4.
---
I got a Vampire 50 cal from a Scorchbeast Queen, those Vampire weapons are sweet
---
I guess being that I am in PST it does make more sense to get put on a server with Japan players. I ended up seeing a few more players that I suspected were from that neck of the woods based on their usernames. Was a fun experience. 10 out of 10, would fo again.
---
Classic
---
Always compare the Fallout76.ini to your custom INI post update and copy over any changes
---
A guy I play Fo76 with is on the fence about continuing to play, and thinking of quitting over their twisting of words and putting up repair kits. The litmus test will be if he lets me have his power fist.
---
It's been this way?
---
Just saying , if your post just says vote instead of it having a number it means it’s a negative karma
---
I am just sick of the fucking hidden nerfs not included in the patch notes. I mean come on dumb ass we can and will find out about them and we will be pissed.
---
I'm literally just looking for an unyielding sentinel left arm that isn't the super duped Marine arm. I want to be able to not wear an outfit, and it's the last piece of my set that's ruining my aesthetic.
---
I’m at an even 0 😭
---
Oh haha I completely forgot about that. I never wear PA and I'm so used to no condition in fallout 4 I looked past how it actually did .I'll remove it from the post
---
Welcome back!
---
Sorry I have zero memory for names / usernames, due to my type of work.
---
Awesome and am very curious to see it..
---
What kind of gun to trade? Bloodied melee weapons with Swing Speed should get you pretty well anything you want.
---
This game does not feel like battle royale
---
I will you know they changed if you don't play?
---
Thank you for the tip I'll keep a look out
---
How’s 1k? I paid 1.5k for it, just ended up not fitting my build
---
Have heard other people also saying it's blank.
---
It is featured in the game's startup News screens though.
---
Images here: [https://imgur.com/a/x8QBp1g](https://imgur.com/a/x8QBp1g)
---
you do realize you're only making the problem worse by enabling them, right?
---
or do you honestly think Fo76 is perfectly fine as it is?
---
Does it just become unplayable? What would happen if I were to do this while overencumbered and get thrown out of bounds?
---
Could of sworn it’s always been like that
---
Ok then I’m otw. Always been afraid of that
---
It’s a natural Yao Guai attractant and your AP and HP are lowered! 
---
Or you eat bad food and you short circuit your PA from losing it...lol
---
Haha , you should subscribe to r/gamingcirclejerk it just makes fun of r/gaming
---
gaming news... it's a thing.
---
I do think it is. It has steadily been improving and that's okay. It was their first game like this, and with a new studio handling it to boot.
---
I feel you, check my list, but Unyielding/Sent is also a rare'ish combo, so if I don't have one I'm happy to keep my eyes open, but it might take a while.   
---
For context, I just got my Weightless Raider set, with Int or Luck as a secondary stat (mostly 2*) and everything but the torso as "Heavy"..   
---
Only took 4 months, of insane amounts of grinding and trading to get it...
---
It's SUPERCUTE) And I wanna the scorchbeast sweet chibi-version too))
---
If still need help I’ll be on in 15
---
How god, how great would that be? You smell so bad you attract wild animals. I would find that hilarious as hell. Let your hygiene meter drop and halfway through a Scorchbeast Queen fight an enraged radstag charges at you because of how bad you smell.
---
No joke it’s your camp that’s placed where mine goes 😂
---
It always takes me at least a minute to load in on ps4, too. I just stand there watching each individual piece of my c.a.m.p. appear, one by one. And I can always hear my turrets going wild over the bees near my camp before I can even see them. I'd much rather have a loading screen.
---
Upvote
---
U have to exit and then go back to trade menu it will be there
---
Ha, totally get that!    
---
Love PA myself and collected it in FO4, but only wore it back to my settlement as a "Trophy" and displayed it.
---
Joining! What location is it on this server?
---
sure, have fun.
---
you're obviously not fed up with this bulls\*\*\* yet.
---
Do you know if bethesda checks this sub for bug reports or does someone have to send an actual one on their website or something
---
Sure!
---
Just added to the body :)
---
Am I the only one who keeps getting a frozen stealth bar? It'll be unmoving in the mid-range of \[caution\] for ages with nobody around. It's annoying. You can quickly test it by moving around, as it normally wobbles. I've fast-travelled half-way across the map and still been on \[caution\].
---
Also: I agree with the repair changes being annoying, and add that they are broken on Xbox. If you repair one item of armour and back out, none of your armour has the left info box (the one with condition) at all. You have to quit the bench and start again to see if the next item needs fixing.
---
I hated my secondary weapon unequipping, but I think they fixed that. It nearly got me killed a few times.
---
Cool story bro
---
I have stopped playing this game , but just because everybody is crying im gonna log in and buy a shitload of repair kits today !
---
I can identify with that. *ALL* I do in game is farm legendaries, and I still haven't come up with the drop I'm looking for, or managed to find anything that someone will trade for an uny/sent left arm that's the type I'm looking for. Between what I have and all the inventories I've looked at, left arms really seem to be the least common piece with that combination.
---
Not sure about out of bounds but if you are high enough where it kills you on impact it'll drop all your items then freeze the game. The only solution I had was close the application then reload it, losing all my items.
---
HOWEVER, that being said; it may be only frozen until it properly loads the surroundings, I didn't give it more then a couple of minutes to see if it unfroze.
---
no wonder gaming is in this sorry state.
---
Cool, are you on now? I’ll be on shortly!
---
Oh god not another one of these dumb ass posts about how sones boo boo tears. If only the mods actually did anything on this forum,
---
So sick of posts like this.
---
Great minds think alike
---
It's never not been this way?
---
I am indeed
---
I have no clue. I just keep adding to posts when I see them hoping they will see it.
---
So if Vault-Tec has them, and a vault confirmed has them, why can't Fallout 76 have them?
---
I might find a way to stash all my junk and then just mess around with this for a bit
---
My only concern is, what was the state of the camera BEFORE they postponed it if this is what we have now?
---
Lmao nah
---
Mine were still there on PS4. Check your photo gallery on the PS4 to see if they are there, if not then it's most likely that they got corrupted somehow and the system deleted them.
---
You are possibly the saddest OP I've ever seen. Like I remember at launch week, people would come in and try to be all "middle ground"-y and say shit like "it's fine if you ENJOY getting your ass blasted, that's for *you*, but us GAMERS can't *stand it*". 
---
And then there's you. Idk how you anyone could sink any lower into unwarranted self importance, and general ass backwards stupidity, but here we are. 
---
For the sake of discussion though, I'll just say my piece. 
---
No one gives a shit about your karma, you projecting yourself not caring just reveals how shallow you're being.
---
The inherent advantage of repair kits is on the fly repairing, while the advantage is minute, it is still an *advantage* (IE, the advantage of saving time, resources and junk, and the convinience of it). The ability to repair mid fight with a SBQ is really really good for certain builds (I run an automatic energy weapons build, so the kits already come off as exploitative of me).
---
Repair kits on their own aren't a big deal. The item is fine. The fact that they come essentially out of thin air is inconsistent with the rest of the game, as they take no materials but impact items directly. Shits weird, and the fact that you get *charged* for it is asinine. The sad thing is it answers a complaint the community has had, *but with a payment plan*. The precedent this creates is an absolute slippery slope because at this point for this game, "competitive advantage" is completely defined by bethesda rather than the actual advantage it provides.
---
Repair kits are EZ PZ to use and you don't even need the pip boy according to rumor, as you can quickslot it. If on the fly repairs over someone who cannot repair on the fly is not an advantage, I do not see a reason paying for an item that doubles my damage would be any different of an advantage over someone who can't. If it's a consumable that's quick slot avaliable, it's not a competitive advantage to bethesda, so it's fair game. That's the type of slope we're on, and the concern and criticisms and "whining" reflect people are self aware enough to see that, regardless of how much they like the game.
---
Deflecting an issue to "When can I"*decorate* LMAOO am I right all you **REAL** fallout fans? 😂" reveals you are childish.
---
I mean, it's not like you could just take a little care to avoid that. Like if you spend 300 plastic bulking things you can keep that in mind for a few minutes before running to the next workbench you see and scrap all.
---
See... I’d literally play the game more if that stuff happened! Ha! 
---
Double bonus if you’re reading a magazine in the can while taking a dump...lol
---
Jt wouldn't make sense to have two separate vaults test the Same thing. Also it's a diseases similar to the scorched plaque so it would be a double dip
---
It was patches I think 2 patches ago now it's back greeaaattt
---
Think you can also buy them from the BoS vendor? Either watoga shopping center or white springs if I’m correct.
---
Yes since the first update it has been this way...
---
Manbabies: "WAAAAH GIVE US CONTENT WORST GAME EVER"
---
FO76: "Jeez, OK, were rushed it for you..."
---
Manbabies: "WAAAAH THIS CONTENT IS BROKE WORST GAME EVER"
---
New Patch Note: "Players will now be allowed to add magazines and books they find during their travels to the portapotty in CAMPs."
---
Anyways it’s pretty late, so goodnight fellow epic gamer
---
If this game is in such a horrible state then why do you play it? And then come here everyday just to drop turds everywhere?? Just move on if you don't like it.
---
People are trying to make “refund-gate” a thing? Dumbest thing I’ve read in a while. 
---
“Never patch their games”.... on the date of patch 8.5
---
This is too much
---
Gaming today is better than it has ever been. If you really, truly hate the gaming scene nowadays: get a new hobby. Don't berate others for liking and supporting what they wish to.
---
I’m assuming you were whining about two posts above mine right? I mean why else would you write a novel?
---
If the shoe fits wear it I guess?
---
That would be awesome. So cool to see others sharing stuff around. Feel free to give solving a go too. Have fun nukin
---
Goodbye friend. See you on the other side.
---
So hey Bethesda just kinda wondering what the logic is in offering the new horseman skin that makes all your various models of power armors  look like X-01 and  you still have the audacity to charge 1400 atoms for this pile of shit !!! So to be  clear for all of us not in the know , if you have t-45 or excavator it will look like the X-01 power armor only with your armors stats???? WTF IS THAT ALL ABOUT??!!! This is a whole new level of greed!!
---
*huuuuuuuugggggeee faaaaaaaarrrrttt*
---
If there, Ansel is laying over the picnic table to the left of the teapot. Very easy to see.  Got him there a few hours ago on PC.
---
It's super fun.wish they would patch more of these quests. Can't wait til the next patch.
---
Finally found a real use for all the plungers and toilet paper around! Maybe this is a plan? Ha!
---
Nope, and won't be. All of this exaggerated outrage won't stop me from playing, enjoying, and supporting whatever i wish. And Bethesda has earned me as a lifelong fan, come sun or rain. No storm lasts forever.
---
at which point did I shed boo boo tears?
---
just stating facts and what I intend to do.
---
Thanks friend! Appreciate you posting about this :)
---
I literally didn't use antivirus for the last 10 years or so. I really doubt it is the antivirus.
---
Shit okay. I suppose I’ll try posting it in bethesda forums or just submitting it as a bug or sum. This really sucks.
---
I'm on Xbox and having the same issue. I think it's something with the way the consoles handles patches and it's really annoying! Had some great load screens for all of a week.
---
I hate console limits on save files, and this is extra annoying to me since I recently lost all of my old screenshots from other games. I like the idea of taking photos everywhere, but if I have to stop and delete files from a menu then it becomes as irritating as STASH inventory management.
---
Weeeeell, they did say you'd be able to decorate your camp with junk/loot you can pick up in the wild, so soon you really will be able place every plunger and roll of toilet paper you find in your CAMP. So, technically, you be able to place your magazines and toilet paper to your CAMP's portapotty.
---
I would love a way for us to display our photos in camps and workshops as well! Kind of neat way to leave behind little memories.
---
So real.
---
Facts my ass, sir. "Never patch their games"... 8.5 dropped today LMAO.
---
Indeed, they make life so much easier 🤣 
---
But fo real, i would skip the demo cards and explosives ( not that good imo, unless you get explosive on wepons for that extra crisp and aoe output when you fight multiple enimies at once. I would say go sneak and pistol first if you are to spread, after that mutations, the rest is basicly a taste of What you want besides that ( if you are pve fo life) Carry waight resuction us strongly recommended if you like that farm going 🤘
---
Sign me up!! I need a mothman plush too!
---
I mean seriously how many nerves did I strike? 
---
Also WHEN CAN I DECORATE?!
---
I’m done in 10 exactly. Goodnight
---
Oh, that would be  nice too!
---
If the game crashes every 20 minutes or so, what's the point of doing anything that takes a bit of time?
---
M.j
---
My personal favorite was announcing to my teammates, "Gonna yeet myself off the fuckin map" listen to their confusion, they see me emote...and then suddenly I'm dead
---
having contact information visible to other players is a serious violation of data protection laws. so, yes refund-gate is a thing. That you don't care about it doesn't matter if other people do
---
patches: skyrim, 10-year old game, last release on switch had the same known bugs it had on the 1st release. fo76's patches: mostly additional content for a "live service", and minimal engine fixes. My point stands. But feel free to disagree.
---
I only know about this oneb

yeah. You can't do some quests and longer events. I was playing my heavy gunner whith uses mainly a Gatling Laser. It was impossible to power Up any plant and wait for the cores. Most of the times i couldn't even power the plant. In the couple of times i've did i was disconnected/game crashed minutes later.
---
Wut??? Lmao
---
I've seen people commenting about losing good ani-armor weapons as well. Guess I'm just lucky I haven't lost anything really important yet.
---
I am really sorry that your game crashed as it has happened to me and i know just how frustrating it is but you don't actually have to be friends with someone to join them - at least not on xbox - as long as they are not listed as offline - you can just view their profile and select "join game" 
---
i know it's not the best solution but it's one of the few we have when the game disconnects. i think a "join on recent server" would be a nice change as well.
---
Know how the legendary vendor is going to work? Specifically the re-roll? All stats or chose 1 to re-roll?
---
Haha yeah, I’m planning for the worst :/ oh well continued farming it is...haha
---
Might try that tonight.
---
The holotape you should be able to complete as those are separate for everyone but the ghouls you will need to try to server hop for as it is one of the best places to just grind levels by killing ghouls.
---
Score!
---
Excavator PA so no jetpack.
---
Oh snap. Yeah I think I might have sold some really legit stuff before I knew what was going on...lol
---
Idk about you but the image in the atom shop doesnt look like the x-01 armor. it looks like an armor that is plagued? also this can be placed on the x-01?
---
It's disappearing from my inventory (or being used up), not my stash. But things disappearing in general could potentially be related, idk.
---
For the record: absolutely 100% disagree. You are missing the bug fixes, content additions, and QoL improvements. Basically, ignoring all the progress the game has made to push your agenda.
---
Thank you guys
---
Gotcha, was just curious because when I used power armor it was a problem I had, and I figured I just used my jet pack too much and that’s why they are gone
---
One time I was hiding in my portable from somone hunting me, he blew up the toilwt and all that remained was the door and seat lol, I still had my dignity dammit!
---
Not a problem!
---
As a coder and ex QA guy,  this kind of big is very difficult to catch in testing.  It looks simple, press x then y. But there are so many possible x and y combinations it comes down to dumb luck if you find it.
---
To quote President John Henry Eden from Fallout 3:
---
&gt;Our intrepid leaders *\[Bethesda\]* had everything they wanted! Power. Wealth. Prestige. And it made them lazy, America.
---
i really wouldnt call patch notes that actually explain what you are doing a privilege. Many and i mean many people were supporting bethesda this entire time but they have done more and more to alienate the people who did by not being transparent with specific changes
---
The stuff I'm referring to was on a mule and not in the stash per say. Sorry if that was miss information. I just leave everything on the character so I don't have to bounce to a stash box
---
trying to find a nuke. im on oceanic so its middle of the day wednesday. im nuking something now to make a clip.
---
I think it will be a good system with tokens. You probably won’t be able to generate legendaries from crafted weapons and armor, but if you can, it will be nice to have a super high intelligence for the durability aspect.
---
Supposed to get some legendary PA pieces as well, so that’s exciting. I hope they have something to reduce VATS AP from firing automatic heavy weapons.
---
Xbox, so of course we have a cap. It’s bullshit, same with Fallout 4 mods. Fallout 4 should have at least 4 gigs of mod space on console, which Skyrim gets, but FO4 doesn’t. Shit like this is why I want to move to PC but I don’t have the money to build a proper one.
---
Yeah, if it's actually using them, then the rate is drastically increased. Sounds like your numbers are similar to mine, so that makes it seem like usage not random disappearances. Seriously, if Bethesda wants us to buy their new shiny PA skins, maybe don't up the fusion core usage like this. I just hope it's a bug and might get fixed.
---
If you relog at the Pen, you are placed right in front of it.
---
Server hop wise, yes that's an efficient route, but nuke zones are inherently not a server hop area.
---
The pen is more RNG based than grafton steel though, since it isn't guaranteed SM. Grafton Steel is. However like the pen, Grafton Steel + Dam aren't super popular, so you have them all to yourself after the initial 'death from above' warning wave if you're inclined to respawn them.
---
Oh the defense missions at the workshop get boosted level enemies too.
---
Killed the queen. Game crashed before I could get to her to loot her. Started the game again, joined encryptid event, died, infinite black load screen. Started game again (this time on my alt), died, had no places to respawn. PS4... Yea... No 😑
---
Yup me 2
---
as one of those people who was saying that it hadnt happened, without the information that the datamining provided a lot of people would refuse to believe it.
---
I have still gotten two black loading screens tonight since the patch.
---
Didn't work for me
---
Everyone knew this would eventually happen in this game. The whole point of this game is to inject microtransactions wherever they can.
---
Xbox and PC dominate mate get rid of the shitty ps4 PlayStation has had it's day it's dead now the only good thing about a sony is there sound systems that's it! 😂👍
---
It was like the only ranged weapon I use. There’s no way I’m playing until I know shits not gonna disappear.
---
not gonna lie i would nut over a weapon like that. is there such a thing?
---
I didn't know about those bugs. That's something I hadn't thought of. I am wearing shielded Forest operative under armor now, whereas I wasn't before. So that's a known / previous glitch?
---
It is very nice of you to do this!
---
Me as well pls
---
Whats even more of a joke is that they didnt have any camera dailys for today.1
---
Even if cash shops are just cosmetics, its still bullshit to charge full price for a game and then put cosmetics theat could otherwise be in game loot into the cash shop.
---
This game is cancer
---
No problem! Took me forever to find. Glad I can help
---
They will never add vehicles, however I’d totally be down for pack-pets that carry loot for you and can fight similar to the Morrowind packskeever from the expansion. Fallout style we could have small robots that have little health but can be repaired for steel when they die. Giddy up buttercups-liberator-eyebot. Give them a small combat ability so they can kill like mole rats/roaches/animals but die in 1-3 hits from actual enemies. They have to be repaired with metal either where they fell or at your camp.
---
 Monster Muffler, haha
---
If they had made it a craftable item you can unlock through the Atom shop I doubt there would be as much outrage. But no some marketing executive thought "Let's go whaling" and made it a single use consumable.
---
Believe it or not I just had a level+50 build my base because I never did in 175 levels. He did a good job. I tried a few times but it kept getting destroyed so I stopped early on. Just kept the basics plus I'm just not in to buildng stuff I guess
---
I quit for two months, came back for pvp in survival mode. The game is better than it was
---
Ok I'll look into it
---
I dunno. I’m on PC and I’ve had about 3 maybe 4 crashes in the last week or so. It seems pretty stable to me. Been playing for the last couple hours trying to find that stupid camera and haven’t crashed once.
---
I'm usually on the bandwagon of hating companies that make shitty games and lie.  I dont understand all the hate for this game.  I really dont
---
It may be because of the random spawn. If you build your base on/around the random spawn then it won't trigger the event. Which can be pretty frustrating for people server hopping and for them it's easy to just destroy your camp and keep hopping.
---
Lvl 40, not so much....   
---
Level 50... Yes
---
You’re factoring in shit that 90% of players don’t bother with. A basic battle over a workshop in adventure mode is far from pvp in survival full of dedicated pvp players with god roll items and 20 mutations. You’re giving the situation more thought than what actually happened.
---
It's the best way to alert the dev team without other players knowing.
---
Nice theory, the only problem being the orbital station, it rather takes the fight out of anything.
---
"Oh! they are massing to attack me, let's nuke them from orbit before they can do it!"
---
;)
---
Killed SBQ yet?
---
Real close
---
First I've heard of it. Nobody showing off or selling it on the market sub either.
---
Yeah I'm pretty much done too. It's about to be summer, the weather is nicer outside, so the time is near that the ole Xbox will be collecting dust until Winter. Maybe the items I saved that didn't mysteriously disappear will be worth thousands of caps lol
---
Yup, a number of under armors would for some reason lower your total DR/ER...  
---
Check it with it on, exit PA, take under armor off and hop back in the PA, you should see it normalize...  
---
In rare cases people have had to exit the game without the under armor on and come back in..
---
It's sad that this can actually be taken as a serious.
---
you still have this body?
---
Yep!
---
If the quality of any of the new content is an indication Wastelanders will be 3 quests where you hunt down and kill the last 4 people playing the game.
---
omw
---
Sure, it’s just a god roll, so super rare. (The bloody+explosive part). I have high hopes for the legendary vendor though!
---
But that's exactly what happens in the Enclave quest "A Real Blast".  MODUS detects that a mass of "pests" have gathered in a certain spot. He can't see exactly what it is, and sends you there to activate the comlinks so he can call down an orbital strike from the Kovac-Muldoon.
---
MODUS can see things happening, he can detect groups, but he can't launch attacks on his own. That's why he needs Enclave players to finish the tasks for him. He can't directly control the orbital strikes or the nukes, and that would be up to the players to do.
---
Alright, nice man. 😂👌
---
They definitely should be in your Ps4 gallery, it saves every picture you take. You might never get them back for loading screens tho. That’s a bummer, you have my sympathy.
---
They changed/broke something with patch 8 for sure, don't know what.
---
I didn’t know that about energy weapons. People must wtf when I pull out my Ultracite Laser pistol that does explosive damage. Must have gotten it before they broke explosive damage for energy weapons.
---
Haha hopefully. Yea fallout gets boring just farming ghouls and queens. And I gotta start thinking like that😂 been quite sunny here for a while I should start getting out right about now.
---
I'd be much more likely to complete events, even if it was as low as 5 (or less) atoms for events
---
I’ve killed I think everything in this game. And no matter what my situation is, how well prepared I am, fucking Yao Guai are still the deadliest things in this game for me and unless I see them from FAR away, I HATE fighting them.
---
I think they stealth nerfed legendaries because people are whording legendaries items and putting them on mule accounts ( mabye even multiple ones). Then those guys are gonna be able to re-role till they get their god drop for their build.
---
I'm pretty sure there might be. Not sure what it would be, though. Why? want to give it a go?
---
It was stolen from the dev room on PC then duped. I don't believe it's modifiable and it's not supposed to be in the game because it was a minute men thing, I think the dev room was just full of assets from FO4 because this is essentially FO4 with a different map.
---
That could be it
---
I've hopped there ten times so far with nothing. This is a seriously stupid way to start a quest.
---
You’ve enlightened me😂
---
I would use a repair kit......To repair something I could not otherwise repair easily.  Like, say...a radiation shower, when I'm low on flux.
---
Then again, depending on what they're priced at I may not bother to unlock them at all (that's going to be a big sign of pay to win, if those things cost 1000 or more)
---
It's pretty nice to have and they go for a lot now
---
Cool
---
factually wrong. technology might be better than ever, but gaming itself is at all time low. and it's only gonna get worse thank to people like you.
---
True.
---
I wonder if the ALS can target orbital objects, that would be a way to equalise the situation for the rebels.
---
That would be nice. I usually start axing the air around me (especially when spawning at the golf club) because enemies spawn and attack before you see them. Sometimes I'm lucky and killed  a few legendary gouls without knowing it. Only a few moments later when the piles start showing... but still would be nice to see what's coming at you.
---
and you're ignoring the absence of patches in non-live-service games to make your point.
---
I guess we're both fudging the data to make our points.
---
Would you feel better if I removed that point from my original post?
---
Yup still here! Everybody can still join now
---
Stop carrying around fucking bulk scrap. It only reduces the weight of lead and aluminum and even then you should never be carrying around enough of either for it to be significant enough.
---
The amount of enemies is shit too. And the vendor will probably be op and get instanerfed anyway
---
Just goes to show how minute a proportion of overall players this sub represents.
---
I like the game. that doesn't mean I'm gonna pretend it's anywhere near decent or give Bethesda a pass for all the ludicrous things they've been doing.
---
mods, which previously worked fine, went unfixed for 2 weeks. that's nothing short of a joke. and just one example out of thousands.
---
If anyone’s gonna do it, it’s gaming heads.
---
Adding and joining
---
I think the most MODOS could do is send a few bots to attack. I assume that's why he wants Bot Stops hacked when he can - they're his weapons to use on the front line and for scouting. MODUS probably lost all most of his higher functionality after the Santiago loyalists set off the explosives. He's still powerful, but unable to take care of things without the control of his Bot Stop army or his eyes in the sky.
---
Yaaaaaaaay you are the best!
---
Still here! See you soon

---
I've lost my camp twice since Sunday to idiots just wrecking it for no reason. The update to prevent camp damage can't get here soon enough.
---
One of the problems of that is vendors only buy scrap in bulk. Correct me if I am wrong. I bulk scrap I don’t use for anything to sell to vendors.
---
They cost 50 atoms each. So you have the option of grinding out the daily's for a free repair. Personally I find the decon arc utterly useless, but to each their own.
---
No ones knows.....
---
https://imgur.com/veRbqvP.jpg
---
I'm digging the bunny head.  I feel like I'm in the Purge movie.
---
Please do not buy those kits. :)
---
You can Google that, no need to ask me. Seriously, if you change your position or even break a promise, it doesn't make you a liar.
---
You’d think the 2 and 3* enemies that often spawn during events would draw people.
---
On Xbox, Found Anne at Bolton Greens lying in the fountain outside the main building.
---
Hello there!!!!
---
Nice - will be trying this next time I have the mutation.
---
i saw bear skull gauntlet, but it's probably just deathclaw gantlet skin
---
I just got a TSE handmade and it breaks really fast compared to my gatling.  I'll stick with my daily beater gatling and use the TSE for fun stuff.
---
How 180 i got 109 with all rifle cards what am i missing
---
Would be better. Right now even if you farm atoms you're capped at 600 a week approximately, so when there's a "limited time offer" at 1400, it's quite impossible to follow.
---
Not to mention some challenges are borderline impossible meaning you can't really get the 600 a week aforementioned. But well.
---
It wasn't this way at the games release. 
---
In February when they added a fix to prevent mods being used as components if you didn't have enough.
---
That February patch was when the bulk gets autoscrap issue first appeared.
---
**** STILL HERE ****
---
So your an ass bag?
---
Thanks! :D
---
Ah, that's probably it. That would actually explain why that person also had a white T51b skin. I thought maybe it was just a limited time skin that I missed while I was taking a break from the game. I know the dev room has everything in the files, including unobtainable gear, but I thought everybody who was caught accessing it got banned
---
Repair kits aren’t in any way a pay to win, it’s a “pay” to be lazy on farming materials. It’s not even pay because you can get atoms so easily. The only time you ever have to pay of you want something is when there is a limited time on something. 
---
Example:
---
Ah fuck I have 500 atoms and this dope ass skin costs 1200 with 7 hours left. Guess I’ll throw down some cash. 
---
So moral of the story stop spending every moment you play for 3* god rolls and spend some time getting the things to repair your stuff. If you don’t want to fix your item then don’t use it. Kill the queen and get the other repair kit or use the atoms you earn playing if you REALLY want that repair kit.
---
Yup, neither regular or improved repair kits can be given away, so says the bethesda
---
Not when I’m just gonna get my thirtieth drill or hundredth one star wooden armour.
---
you should look up peter molyneux.
---
Repair Kits should not be on the Atom Shop! Don't boycott your own product! It doesn't matter how subtle the advantage may be, convenience should not be purchasable in a game! Like everyone said, it destroys one of the core mechanics in the game!
---
Also, here a list of old bugs and QoL requests that should have been implemented in the game since the beginning:
---
\- **\[BUG\]** \- Hooded Rags taking up all armor slots, not counting as outift
---
\- **\[BUG\]** \- Weapon magazine always empty after loggin
---
\- **\[QOL\]** \- Possibility to change the quick slot hotkeys
---
\- **\[QOL\]** \- Separate throw grenade key from bash key
---
\- **\[QOL\]** \- Prevent player from scrapping favorited items ([there is a HUGE problem with the current solution](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bbdyg4/the_favorited_item_protection_against_scrapping/))
---
\- **\[QOL\]** \- Quick eat / drink / read button ([https://imgur.com/gallery/ALXbj5S](https://imgur.com/gallery/ALXbj5S))
---
\- **\[PLZ\]** \- Perk cards loadouts
---
\- **\[PLZ\]** \- Fast travel mat at [C.A.M.Ps](https://C.A.M.Ps)
---
I don't want to sound rude, I'm just trying to do my part at sending feedback and trying to improve one of the very few modern games that still captivates me!
---
It’s designed that way specifically to get to us to buy atoms with real money. If they add new ways of earning atoms, they’ll lower what we can get through challenges so it’s still at or around 600 a week.
---
@ Doctorshats (your comment is gone) - I'm only an ass bag to ass bags who come to claim it from me. 
---
I don't go attacking other players, but I'll defend it when they try and take it from me. 
---
The real ass bags are the level 150+ who see the level 50 who owns a workshop and try to take it from them.
---
Oh lord, as cute as it looks I'd be terrified to see you hiding behind a tree nearby
---
you can also look at all the promises peter molyneux made about...all of the games he's ever been involved with, and how practically nothing actually happened.
---
Either that person got away with it or got the weapon off someone before that someone got banned. But it’s still weird because it’s not hard to just remove all weapons that are supposed to be unobtainable.
---
Posting on this subreddit is a losing battle. Bethesdrones can’t agree with valid points and still like Fallout at the same time. It’s just downvote galore if you have any negative criticism on what they’re doing
---
And the challenges have gone from  'something to do while playing normally' to 'spend all day on these and you may just have time to complete them all'
---
Sure it's a bug that Beth needs to address, but couldn't you have shown how the goo pile was found, and how to reach it? That would have been more beneficial
---
If it can be bulked, then bulked is the only way the vendors will buy it. Some scrap items can be sold individually, and because of this can't be bulked.
---
Nothing on Vault 51 huh?
---
So your telling me this community over reacted to a small feature by mislabeling it play to win spamming this sub while carrying on like spoilt 4 year old children. I don’t believe it.
---
Everytime I hear about First Person Bow and Arrows I think of all the characters I made in skyrim that were built to oppose the idea, and one by one they all succumbed into stealth archer mixed with their original role as hybrids...  The monstrosities I've created...
---
Thanks for this reminder!
---
The only way to hit them is to quit playing altogether. I'm out on both of my accounts.
---
&gt; Bethesda is backtracking on their previous statements
---
no, bethesda is backtracking on a statement made by a single person working for them. pete hines is not the only person there who makes decisions.
---
I haven’t been since patch 8, but considering the legendaries are better suited to people under level 40 maybe they reduced the amount of enemies so under 40ish have a better chance. 
---
I remember doing it once around lvl 40 with a teammate and we were getting our asses handed to us by the huge swarms.
---
Exploring is pretty cool. I find all kinds of stuff even stuff not on the map. Seeing 5 typewriters and 6 office fans in the newspaper building in Charleston was a great find for me.
---
Greek player here! This game is a nice opportunity to better my English and accent ;P
---
Yeah.
---
Player A gets crap from dev room, Dupes it, trades to player B, C, and D.
---
Player A gets banned.
---
Players B, C and D are innocent and still got unobtainable items.
---
&gt;  content that nobody asked for,
---
you sure about that?
---
because i remember the first month the game was out, everyone and their grandma were demanding repair kits.
---
Thanks! Found it in the second place I looked - Landview Lighthouse near Vault 76. Body was at top of lighthouse.
---
Don't know about PC, but on PS4 choosing to use a repair kit opens a menu giving you the option of using the basic one (Atom Shop) or an Improved variety (queen drop).
---
So, yes. You're paranoid.
---
&gt; Using the shop to sell things that effect gameplay is one that they've said they would not do
---
it's one thing one person said. not the entire company, and he certainly isn't the only person who makes decisions at said company, either.
---
Add can do, travelling pharmacy, pack rat, good doggy, and thru hiker. Those are all good cards early level, in my opinion anyway.
---
The lowered weight of weapons, ammo, junk etc is valuableish. Not everyone will buy them so you need to find the right person. I have like 20 or so pieces, possibly full sets, but haven’t been selling lately. When I did a couple months ago I got about 1-2k for them each piece.
---
The best roll on armour is either sentinel/assassins/ap regen or the cavalier equivalent. Sentinel reduces all incoming damage by 15% while standing still, cavalier does the same whilst sprinting. 5 pieces = 75% reduction. Assassins reduces damage from players by 8% each, 40% with whole set.
---
The sentinel/cavalier and assassins effects are multiplicative, not additive. This means instead of having invincibility (115% damage resistance), you have 85% total damage reduction BEFORE armor resistances themselves are applied. Makes you a serious tank and you need that stuff for bloodied builds unless you’re smart and a sniper build. The ap refresh effect helps with vats.
---
A regular sentinel or cavalier piece might go for a few thousand caps but coupled with assassins will get you way more. Add ap refresh and you’re sitting on a goldmine. You’re better off trading for a similarly amazing weapon or whatever that suits you.
---
Flatwoods, vault-tec agricultural center, pools behind the building
---
Ok... what am I missing. Full crit bar in VATS and I can't do a crit hit. On PC. Tried hitting Q instead of mouse click to attack but nothing.... help
---
Cue "Bethesda is selling weapons in the atom shop" comments
---
Well... that’s why I don’t bother with the sheepsquatch. I got wood armor the first time and a syringer the second. May as well run Whitesprings. But we both know good stuff Does drop... about once a month.
---
This sounds like someone from Bethesda would say... 🤔
---
&gt; Additionally, we probably shouldn't thank them for fixing things they broke to begin with
---
Heh, are you serious?  I mean I know I didn't put in a /s but come on...
---
I Think they should add mstchmaking pvp om maps in the fallout universe, shure openworld pvp is fun, but i want a que system for it aswell, so it wont matter wich server you on, you just que and pop into a pvp map, and get rewards for completing a match,  100% reward for winning and perhaps a little price for the Ones that looses. Hope they add somthing like this in the future !
---
Aggro the Mirelurk King then shoot the Wendigo. After that just run and go stealth and watch the fight. If one of the enemies is about to die Kill Steal it.
---
VATS and especially spamming Q eats through your cores like candy. Press Q to start VATS a few times and you can watch the core drain down.
---
Yeah spend real money
---
It doesn't count if you ran a big heavy crossbow, right?
---
Would be great if Bethesda worked on making this game work better on PC bought this day 1 and haven’t been able to play since. Also those key binds. You think after waiting half a year I’d at least be able to play on a 1070...
---
Not only are other commenters correct, but they fixed the weight of scrap. It's a benefit across many item types to bulk.
---
I found Ansel at the...  er...  big ferris wheel location.  I can't remember what it's called.
---
Anyway he was sitting in the foldout-chairs facing the animal enclosure, on the East edge of the place.
---
Yo, it's going to have to wait until tomorrow. Cool? Just left the blazers game and am in no condition to trade lol.
---
There are a lot of commenters with old info. To help, bulk did work in recent patches. It made almost everything lighter (personally tested) and could be carried around without it separating. Bethesda has been doing great work lately and reading the details of the bug fixes has many nice surprises.

I've said this in another thread, but I'll repeat it here. Entitlement is expecting something for nothing. What we expect is compensation for something we would've done had we been able to. It's like using the warranty on a broken item. Anyone who thinks its entitlement to want some kind of compensation for a broken system has probably never used a warranty before.
---
On pc, game never crashes.
---
Sometimes on my way to a vendor, a fun event starts, I get ambushed, or side tracked. So I have new junk mixed with bulked junk occasionally.
---
There is a black excavator paint coming, but they aren't listing the nukashine stuff.

---
Anybody have the tourist in their server on ps4 , tired of hopping
---
I unlocked the poster during the bucket list quest.
---
I was just thinking this. But with tiny nuka cola bottles.
---
Nope, bulking has been working well lately. See other commenters, I'm not alone.
---
As I said.. take a little care. And since all vendors share a cap pool now just go to a vendor that has a tinkers bench at it
---
Let us know how you like Avengers! I'm hoping some more of my friends see and and then I can find out how it is by asking them what they thought about it after they see Avengers.
---
Game is fun. Could care less about all that whining. Bye Felicia.
---
Pay-to-lose!
---
On PC, it’s either 2 bethnet accounts run simultaneously (you don’t need 2 pc’s but you do need 2 games) or using a friend. 
---
On console it’s either 2 consoles/2games or using a friend.
---
It's RNG. The dataminers would have found something by now if it wasn't.
---
*^("faaarrr out mannnn")*
---
He counts I used it earlier on XB1
---
So you need 2 copies of the game then for that way seems a rather extreme way to get around a issue I know the game got real cheap but still
---
Yeah thank you captain obvious. What I meant was that it is not enough to hold their promise that everything in the atom shop' could be bought with Atoms obtained in game.
---
Curious- is there anything they could do on ‘their side of things’ that couldn’t be detected? I’m not a programmer. 
---
Also where are you reading what datamines find? I only see the bits people retell here.
---
At my work we use the dreaded Scrum approach all the developers input into the entire backlog. You see a bug you bring it up for it to be worked on for next release, if there's time/capacity then do it. Test every change then test whole release a few days before push. Dec tests changes and then QA does testing too. I can't see how a QoL improvement didn't get through like this again but a increase cost of plans at whitesprings ticket did (all plans gone up by 2-100 caps irritates me). The fact we had to wait so long again to be able to MOD weapons and armour was also ludicrous as it's what's been a key part of the franchise mechanics.
---
Just found this bug out by accident. Its had my friend and I laughing our asses off teleporting all over the place.
---
I only found it through joining someone else who had found it at miners monument.
---
Why not?
---
i used a few of the hanging bone traps to make my own bead curtain :)
---
People have done that to me... I cried... Not even going to lie. I cried and quit the game.
---
Griefers are the worst.
---
Hardly extreme. It is cheap. And this game doesn’t have monthly subscription fees. I haven’t bought atoms yet but I have gotten hundreds of hours of enjoyment out of the game, I’m happy to toss down 20 bucks for a second account.
---
It’s actually way more p2w than any atom shop, since you can have the second account running all the time, sharing perks, giving mutation benefits with Strange in Numbers, easy group challenge completion, and growing/selling lots of crops and water. Also if one client crashes you always have an “anchor” to get back to the same server. Plus the vast amount of storage you get with 5 more characters.
---
u/stealthymoth81
---
Yep, I just found them at the top of the lighthouse
---
Hold up... Takimg pictures in game replaces loading screen art???
---
Yeah just did it again and got swarmed. Idk
---
This is just terrific work Dwellers! Anyone know if this is still getting updated i.e New Event plans or is it now complete?
---
they've explained that the improved repair kits are drops from legendary creatures and the like.
---
The dataminers post all the juicy stuff here, so all that stuff on the front page right now is what they've been able to find. And sure there is a chance Beth knows how to and actively blindsides dataminers, but after this long and nobody has offered definitive proof? Unlikely.
---
I know this is gonna sound kinda dumb. But you have to pick up two assaultron head plans. One will be normal armor helmet. And the next plan you read will unlock the imposter assaultron helmet weapon you can craft after AS purchase.  in question.
---
You saying that is the entire point of this post
---
To be fair, nobody knew the drop rate of repair kits. I personally thought it would be a horrible idea if there was no way to acquire them in game... and getting the better version in game easily makes the atx item useless tbh.
---
It does sound contradictory to what they said earlier. I wouldn't call the repair kits 'pay-to-win' but it does get me worried if it inspires them to add actual P2W items in the shop as well. Hope they reconsider this strategy
---
 Signs and letters is 10k base game cost, you might be thinking of the "small letters set"
---
Yeah, the same thing happened to me a few hours ago, I thought my Gatling Plasma fucked it up and made the body glitch, I never could find it again.
---
I don't see what all the complaining is about you can get repair kits just as easy as stimpaks in game, I've got 27 already which I'll never use as I like my gear repaired to 200%
---
improved kits are drops. Not to say that someone could sell them to vendors maybe?
---
Why would anyone need quides anyways?
---
And what kind of quides do you mean
---
That’s what I thought. Thanks for clarifying.
---
Look at the history of the company, and realize that Bethesda is  fully responsible for all the fucked up  anti consumer shit it's doing.
---
&gt;their main weapon breaks
---
So your telling me the dude who bought the repair kits is going to fiddle around in his menu to use the repair kit and then die.
---
How is that an arguement?
---
Group vs group? Faction pvp? That all sounds like it would need to be set up before time and you should repair stuff before going out.
---
Also, fiddling in menus in mass pvp still equals death
---
-1 agi -3 chr, your armour degrades 10% faster than usual
---
Just you wait, the regular bow is going to be everything I wished the Crossbow was.
---
or, it'll be about as good as the crossbow, which will disappoint basically this whole sub especially if it gets hyped
---
It doesn't matter how subtle the advantage may be, convenience should not be purchasable in the game, it would open the door to start the P2W cancer that kills all online games.
---
I thought the same thing for a while, until today. I did 2 runs and was lucky enough to run into 5 legendaries, all hail my 3* assasins pool cue. But it seems that it varys widely. I can do multiple runs in a within a few days and only see one legendary, and a few in one day and see many.
---
They did suspend the cheating dupers. I'll give em that.
---
When in Beckley, the tourist is against a car in the parking lot in front of the Beckley Mine Exhibit building.
---
Would spend more time playing the game if modding was allowed with private servers, anybody?
---
They basically make a problem so they can monetize the solution.
---
Its divide and conquer marketing. Its introducing p2w in tiny little baby steps so the backlash doesn't come all at once. Right now its just the hardliners complaining, but whats the next step gonna be? 
---
You can't deny they've already broken their "cosmetic only" promise, so when exactly do non-cosmetics become a problem? What is the threshold for non-cosmetics to become "true" pay-to-win items? For some us its already been crossed.
---
I'm level 109 and I'm willing to help. I basically got nothing to do and wander around doing nothing. psn name is Deamonium_Diebus.
---
My main is using only gatling lasers and plasmas. I literally can't play properly. I have only fully charged ultracite cores and loosing one after another constantly is game breaking. I need to use backup ballistic weapons only.
---
Im referring to people asking for help or just general inquiries. Ive seen numerous redits where people ask simple questions then the next thing you know there are all these people with bad attitudes shitting all over people for asking questions. I can only afford a basic data plan good enough to play my games and you wouldn't believe how many people tell me to surf the web or watch youtube. So i come here because its saves my data. Being called ignorant because i dont know something despite the fact i havent been playing for even a month yet is retarded to say the least. Internet is hard to get where i live.
---
If you go into the quests section of the pip boy and press RB (xbox) while highlighting the quest, it will show you it's location on the map
---
To quote a character played by Heath Ledger, I would say "It's not about the money, it's about sending a message".
---
These kits are the second test Bethesda does to see how we react to "pay to win" market.
---
The first was the "unstoppables" item that provided a very tiny bonus IF you played in a team, which meant that most people disregarded it as detail. 
---
The current one, the repair kit, is at the cute price of 50 atoms a kit, 250 for 6. That's approximately what doing all your daily challenges would bring, but it's not much money. 
---
The in-game bonus however is a bit higher than the previous : this time, if you are taking part in the ScorchBeast Queen event for instance, you no longer have to lose a huge time rushing to a workshop to repair your broken weapon : you can do it instantly, where you are, and resume tagging along all the additional mobs.
---
Or if you are more of a PVP player, you can avoid the dangerous stations where people tend to camp.
---
And this is but the second one currently, yet they have already warned us that they would bring others : fridges so that you have an additional places to keep food and other consumables in, in a better state.
---
Ammo converters, so that you can finally use those loaaaaads of .38 that every other player has longe since dropped.
---
Auto-stash bots, so that you can keep on farming that sweet sweet flux or those precious ores of lead. 
---
If the playerbase dismisses those repair kit as "nothing important", I guarantee we will end with some VERY annoying features being "atom shop exclusive", like "a bycicle that allows fast travel when over encumbered" or "Tokens to enhance your chances at the legendary vendor".
---
But then again, it's your money.
---
I think i do, ill be on 24 hours from this reply, probably 2-3h before and after. 50 caps and pm your psn id
---
Todd Howard is responsible for all of Bethes'duh's decisions.
---
Aim for it will have to be a curve and power has to be less than a crossbow so I'm not optimistic but I love flavour  so I'll use it regardless
---
FR Sent - Ramblingpaul
---
So everyone has three or four copies of their most powerful weapons?
---
I have things break in combat.  We are going to see longer larger battles eventually.  The difference between your 3 star Legendary and next best weapon can be huge.
---
And as I said in a group on group battle you would have time to fiddle with a repair kit, especially if you practiced - with cover provided by your team you could duck back behind the group and repair versus leaving the battle to find a station or having to use what might be way less powerful armor and weaponry.  People on the other side aren't going to chase after one guy who runs behind some cover while the rest of the group is still fighting them.
---
I am assuming the strategy would involve going behind a wall while your team continues the battle.  This is a perfectly feasible and potentially effective strategy.
---
The main point though is that there are situations which might arise, depending on strategy, where it might not make a big difference but can.  And if it means you don't lose a team member while they leave the battle to repair it might actually become a big help.
---
Yes i saw your other post. I didn't know they were drops, i just figured they were plans or something.
---
Just you wait. They'll soon start selling weapon and armor skins that will boost durability when applied. And give the same QoL improvement reason again.
---
I'm right with you on this one!. I'm colourblind. Most games have a setting for this now.. reddead2 and Witcher 3 for example. Light yellow on green is REALLY hard for me to see. My girlfriend usually finds my markers 🤦😂
---
Where did you get ingame repair kits? And where are they located in inventory?
---
Yeah not sure what that would be on PC but I'll take a look
---
You can get them from the queen, they are a new event award (you dont have to loot the body for them). I've only killed her once since the update, but it gave me 4 repair kits as a event reward.
---
&gt; Change the way that the items in lists are done:Using the index of the array of items in the list as an identifier is a terrible way to do ANYTHING when it comes to client/server connections. It's SO simple to just generate a unique ID for each item that way people don't accidentally scrap/drop the wrong things when the lists are being updated.
---
   Is this something they actually do, or are you emphasizing ? 
---
I'm a software dev too, and I honestly wonder sometimes how the fuck some of the bugs in this game happen : why in the hell would your camera ever be related to your character's position, where all it has to do is switch to first person point of view then deactivate the player's model (something already possible in "classic" camera mode) ? 
---
How the fuck would "Drink water" and "consume bobblehead" be switched ?
---
But if what you say about identifying things by the fucking array cursor is real, this is INCREDIBLY bad. I can't think of a single reason why you would do that instead of use a specific identifier for your items.
---
Scorched earth event and I believe they're under misc, they weigh 0.1lbs so will be getting dropped as I run a very tight weight budget.
---
I will only accept this first excuse they gave us, that "it's just a test". If the repair kits don't get removed in the future updates or even worse, if some other non-cosmetic items are added to the shop, them I will declare this game P2W.
---
I'm kinda expecting bethesda's response to be to sell you a "get back into the same sever token" for 100 atoms, then say it's what the players requested
---
&gt;longer larger battles
---
My gear last *days*, so are you suggesting that we will go from 1-2 shot combat to a system that has 4 day long skirmishes with constant combat and no C.A.M.Ps?? Then if so, maybe you got something
---
Damn it.. Beat me too it..  
---
Oh well ... *Neat.*
---
Very, very poor decision making. I think I'm going to avoid shops until they do something to allow pacifists to opt out. I'll get the plans the hard way if I must.
---
I think a build your own approach for basic vehicles 
---
body could be literally anything (plans purchased from atom shop 
---
tyres another plan
---
and accessories
---
each individual plan can modify the vehicle
---
e.g.  a couch (for the body/cabin) or a bathtub (someone mentioned this in this thread and I lol'd) or perhaps a deluxe plan to use an existing vehicle body
---
If you’re on Xbox I could build one for you.
---
How is this different than going into the Burrows during a nuke event?  I tried it, was able to wear normal armor but got absolutely bombed by the radiation from the ghoul mobs.  It got so bad I just put my hazmat back on.  I suppose it could work if you are never in direct contact with the glowing ones, but I do not recommend trying this if you run melee, assuming it works the same.
---
Were they fresh level 2s?
---
I went there as well and got plans for the chest and arms (arms today, chest a few days ago).  Brick building with the corner blown open.  I also got the legs plan from the Grafton Monster from Grafton Day event.
---
People use words they don't understand. I don't know what that other guy's problem was.
---
Bethesda offered us something. That something was supposed to be available to us. Then they essentially reneged on the deal. It's as simple as that. But, it's something they can totally make up for. Do they *have* to, no. *Should* they, yes. 
---
However, you can't just create some other world where we aren't owed "nuttin'." And besides, is that the level of service he expects or wants to see from a company he'd do business with. Low standards people. 
---
Sometimes people complain for good reason. Sometimes companies are wrong, and should *want* to do better.
---
I think that other guy was just bringing his warped world view into this conversation where it didn't belong.
---
Yup. The camera "weapon" makes it easier. The menu-system photo mode is really slow and clunky.
---
Now try to make it to the top of the tall power line structures
---
Wwwhhhaaaaaaaattttt
---
My gear breaks all the time.  I am a melee non power armor user.  Not sure if dying and respawning makes it happen faster but it is a daily thing for me to go through two or three of my melee weapons.
---
No all good
---
I do workshops and complete so many for claiming defending and retaking.
---
And not to mention all the others SBQ and what not.
---
But it would be nice to see more people at all the odd events. It is kinda lame when you have a Legendary Strangler Queen for yourself.
---
Right! I see they're there for the weeklys, but you're absolutely right, no dailys. Though, I'm kind of OK with that. Still have to find my cam! Lol
---
I completely agree with you, they track what sells and what doesn’t sell, that’s why they have clear outs of the things that are not selling much and discount them heavily on their way out, if the numbers show we are buying lots of cosmetics but not repair kits it will send a clear message
---
Also a new twist on sheepsquatch, he goes invisible when he dies... so, that’s fun to try and find after he blows up.
---
I agree we need more role playing pacifist builds.
---
I have 11, I get 2 or 3 from the SBQ each time
---
It doesnt cost them anything for the repair kits, no production, no resources, no outlay...ffs its a digital item, they dont care if you dont buy it because you will buy something else off the store...its money for nothing as far as Bethesda are concerned.
---
It would just be spammed by bored children and a-hole griefers
---
It's like that with everything. But I agree, if an item is in your stash, it should reflect it's default weight not the weight if you have weight reduction perks
---
YES joining now
---
The patch notes say that the queen is the only place to get them right now.
---
*Has Graham and is holding him*
---
*Wont let you fast travel to them* 
---
Chaotic Good
---
Beauty is relative, why you assume people want to donate you because you got pretty (in your opinion) camp? Really, this game needs better changes and bug fixes than this...
---
Not only that, but the 10mm pistol has the option to go with either 40% Armor piercing or 20% armor piercing, the Perforating Magazine and Stinging Magazine in that order, so with an automatic guerilla sneak build and with a Perf magazine and Armor piercing legendary to stack on is basically gg, and having one with the VATS reduced cost per shot and increase VATS crit damage, and it's basically unlocking a god weapon that's so easy to maintain and the ammo is extremely plentiful. 
---
Then you look at the revolvers...no Fan Fire option, no ammo change option, so all of them, besides the ugly pipe revolver, is stuck with the pretty rare 44 ammo, There's no silencer (obviously) option, there's no dual wield, armor piercing, burst option. It's a slow, clunky weapon that cannot deal enough damage to bypass tough armor. It has to rely on crits, and it's generally slower to popping crits with it.
---
Good job hiding player name. Infinite tacos
---
So sorry bro, literally as i was alt-tabbed making the post the fucking game crashed on me. I tried to delete post immediately.
---
Lol look how mad you are. Bethesda didn't offer us anything. They didn't say, hey here's free atoms!  They have daily challenges that they added and are free to remove any time they want. 
---
You never deserved them in the first place. Yet you're demanding compensation over your lost free hand out.
---
Entitlement. 
---
Plz reply and cry more too.
---
I will have a CAMP off with you..
---
I just want to check out your camp, I spend alot of time on mine as well. PC?
---
Or simply doesn't cry over not getting free things that aren't owed to you?
---
Ronthorns. In the UK in the early 1990's there was a Channel 4 News sitcom called "Drop the Dead Donkey". You remind me of the poor cameraman "Jerry" who was always mauled, shot, and injured when filming with Damien Day. (Go watch the brilliant series).
---
Let's just say I'm avoiding you like the scorch plague…….
---
Find the dead Tourist’s body. It has many spawn locations
---
I have a second gamer tag but just one copy of 76. It’s downloaded on both my Xbox one and Xbox One x. Idk how I’m doing it, honestly..
---
BGS made fallout 76. BGS made the campaign save player one. BGS has made single player games and said they would only make single player games to save player one. BGS then betrayed that by making fallout 76. Thus the game was hated from the start. Bethesda Softworks only published the game but the full betrayal and hatred is directed at BGS. How clearer do you need?
---
exactly :)
---
yes, you ingame right now?
---
I can tell you have not seen true art, why don't you join me and witness my CAMP. I know you are on PC.
---
Yes!  There should be viable builds based on charisma (as well as intelligence, perception, and luck) that can still assist in combat.  One of these wouldn't require power armor, using a radiation suit if needed, nor a strong weapon other than their camera and toolkit.  These would perhaps have higher evasion capabilities through agility and stealth in order to stay away from enemies - and along with healing have a number of ways of buffing the team.  A battlefield reporter might take pictures of their team to create a buff for example.   
---
Can you guys think of any other neat mechanics for a pacifist to buff their teammates to become a powerful battlefield ally?
---
Had the race for the presidency not been added yet? I have a valid ballot item along with my hands now working on the court polls.
---
Beta messed with all my challenges and trophys so bad. Worked around it. Than just have to deal with the Recipe challenge after going out and finding all of them and it not registering. I can almost make every recipe out there and it registered 3 .... Now im at like 20 but i gave up on that it will happen there more to come. We did have some new caps challenges come out two months ago. Everyone should  look at all the survival and character challenges. Theres alot. Grab a board and go whack some 76  moles, robots or scorched for 80 atoms lol or 760 idk
---
The "c" key
---
Isnt there a website that does the work for you? 
---
I have only launched a nuke once and a friend gave me the code he said he got from a website lol.
---
&gt;Acting like a drug dealer is a bad business model
---
What? Dude your literally just jumping on the bandwagon calm down it doesn't ruin the game repairing isn't a huge factor in fo76
---
If the player you offered to sell the calibrated shocks for the T-60 doesn't buy them I am definitely interested. sleepy4792. Xbox One.
---
Seems like you've discovered the "Imposter Alien" 😆
---
Yeah it’s called Nukacrypt. However, my dumbass decided to check it AFTER we already went through the whole silo 😂 aaaaand it’s still unsolved
---
I hopped once there and saw him. As I was walking towards him, the game crashed. Hopped 10+ more times and nothing.
---
lol, who's trying to act tuff? you LIVE on the internet, nerd.
---
No worries at all, you have a good one :)
---
They should also sell TSEs from the Atom Shop.
---
Thank you. Glad to see there are other people who enjoy climbing tall things!
---
I’m on PS4 but the game runs quite smooth for me?
---
No, I'm not, I've been pissed about their lies since the news got out.  
---
Not having to spend an hour farming for ballistic fibre or aluminium to repair armour isn't changing the game mechanic?
---
I was mildly confused about that myself after taking a photo of Flatsy and that point not checking off. (Especially after both points being acknowledged when I killed my first Flatsy.)
---
So apparently the Flatwoods Monster is Shrodinger's Alien now.
---
(I don't a-think there's "regular" aliens in the game (yet). I just assume it's another bug that slipped through.)
---
That's one of the next ones on my list along with the crashed space station.
---
Okay guess I’ll have to kill her again to get mine thanks
---
Wait.. so you're telling me that they've got a WEAPON in the atomic shop now too as well as Repair Kits?...
---
I would very much like to see this camp. Do you have a theme? 
---
I enjoy building but mine isn't great. It is practical though. 
---
Looch_P on PC.
---
To me, it was obvious the Sheepsquatch will be part of the game later. The player hear of it, search the Sheepsquatch and find a false creature. He continue investigating, and eventually, the real one will show up !  
---
That's an interresting way to tell a story.
---
Thats weird i went to fast travel to an event and it put me under mama dolce...... Really messed up total opposite side of were i was going
---
Thank you. Glad you liked it. When I climbed up, the weather was really foggy so I waited a few minutes or so until the skies cleared. Was treated to a lovely view of Watoga and its surrounding locations.
---
I would say you are 90% right.  The only other reasons I can see for needing something like this are:
---
1. You were prepared but got into a much larger fight then expected, i.e. you started fighting a group of level 68 super mutants and 2-3 scorchbeasts decided to crash the party (this has happened to me)
---
2. Bethesda once again introduces a bug that makes weapons degrade faster then they are supposed to.
---
Now that said I don't agree with them being in the atomic shop.  I do think it is a slippery slope and they were very clear to us that it would only be cosmetics last year.  I won't be buying any from the atomic shop and only getting the advanced ones from in game drops.  
---
I do support the idea of having an item that can fix your equipment in a pinch but I don't support part of the way they implemented it.  It would be better if they were strictly in game drops.
---
Why accept it? The test is seeing if they can introduce (minor) P2W elements without losing too many players. And its succeeded.
---
Ooooh
---
not yet
---
Is Alien the dead one in a car (read somewhere previously)..?
---
If you're closer to watoga, go to the coffee house, then look around the other side of the river, multiple sets there.
---
I have no plan to buy any of them from the atomic shop.  I can't avoid getting them as I do SBQ and Encrypid but I will only have the advanced ones.  My atoms will only go to cosmetic items.
---
I got two off a SBQ earlier today.  (I didn"t get a notification though. They just popped up in my inventory.)
---
I'd get out of your Power Armour. Unfortunately armour with Legendary effects is usually better than PA.
---
Still here!
---
No, we bought the game on the basis that DLC would be free.  
---
If Bethesda aren't making the money they expected from the shop and need to introduce P2W aspects, maybe they should reconsider asking more than $10 for a single armour skin in an already full price title.
---
I agree with your frustrations, but to be fair as a once upon a time drug dealer, I assure you it can be *pretty good*
---
"[Everyone knows you run faster with a knife](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BcO2_CNi_k)" -FPS Doug
---
I would hoard workshops if that was the reward.
---
I found Ansel at Colonel Kelley Monument after 30+ jumps on PS4
---
Right now they actually are selling a weapon in the Atom Shop...
---
The Sheepsquash Assualtron Head isn't a skin apparently, it's a unique and separate weapon. soooOOOOOOOOO yeah Repair Kits and now a weapon as well in the "cosmetics only" shop.
---
There is a time machine by Watoga would be cool if it did something!
---
Warning before you read I do get a little “ranty”  with my comment tldr at bottom 
---
But honestly why protest in the first place. Everyone keeps labeling this as “pay to win” because Bethesda is exactly like EA or free to play mobile games companies. However in reality they are closer to hundreds of other mmo games that introduce a more pay to keep up structure and I feel fallout 76 needs it. I love this game and I play 3 to 4 hours almost everyday but my friends don’t have the same amount of free time as me. And eventually I pass them and the amount they have to grind becomes larger and larger until the game becomes this unenjoyable mess of recycling the same location over and over again. Other games like this it’s no big deal just slap down a few bucks and get some gear that’s around the milestone marker that’s around my character and away we go no harm no foul to anyone. 
---
Tldr: you can’t pay to win in a game that you really can’t win at. I know it may seem it’ll go this way but honestly they have a lot to change with the atom store before this even seems like it could happen.
---
yeah saw that two lol
---
yeah i was disappointed, i wanted a reason to use my 3 star assaultron head :( i really hope they change it to a skin
---
Superfresh level 1s.
---
You still need to have learned the Assaultron Head schematics to craft it, and from what I can tell it has the same stats. For all intents and purposes it is a reskinned head weapon, its just that you can't apply it to legendary heads you have.
---
It's a slippery slope!
---
Sorry, been really busy and forgetting to update. I have several more locations I need to add. I'll try and get to it tomorrow. I was also working with another user who I was planning on co-authoring an even bigger list with, but she had to take a long break, too. But fear not, it will eventually get done. :)
---
Kinda hilarious how you picked the one silo that hasn’t been decoded.
---
Good luck, I feel you will need it.
---
I can not attach my spiked pool cue mod, doesn’t show at the bench so I guess a few slipped through the net
---
It’s all good man!  I just figured doing an updated list and reposting might be super beneficial.  This didn’t get the attention it deserved!
---
Know nothing about what you do, but maybe many of the tickets is timewaste. Been to people who have never shut down their computer or updated any drivers for 3 years
---
Haha thanks
---
Giraffes?
---
Yes, luckily u must have the plans already known to make it so it's kinds/kinda not PtW pending on ur perspective of PtW
---
You’re the BEST. I want to give you something - brb.
---
It’s a quest reward for the sqb event
---
You online right now? My world is filled with people appreciating my camp, I will switch to a fresh world soon.
---
You can move the Camp thing to kinda change the spawn position but I agree on this.
---
Monster Muffler? Sounds like (and looks like) something to help power armor players sneak? Maybe it's a damage reduction from monsters, thus it's PvE focused? Walking Arsenal is definitely a general weight reduction perk. Fashion Finder...that sounds like a Luck based item, perhaps helpful in getting legendary drops we want? I dunno. Creature Crusher looks like a simple damage boost to all animals, so it could be a special Bloody Mess-style perk, maybe meant for Perception. 
---
Most curious one for me is Cowboy. What the hell does it do? Is it just a simple damage buff for revolvers? Does it increase the fire rate dramatically or allow access to Fan the Hammer action like a mod from Fallout 4? Is it fire rate AND armor piercing? Maybe a triforce of Fanning, armor piercing, and reloading speed? If so, holy shit, Revolvers may finally be useful! If not...well...RIP.
---
Oh it must be good haha! 
---
Unfortunately won't be on for another 3 hours.
---
Some mods still aren’t attaching or showing in workbenches, in my case it’s the spiked pool cue mod
---
So you never played Fallout Dlcs before? I would love to get Dlc Content that is actually worth my time :x If they would spend more time on their patches with actual quality content, because they can afford their time to do this, im going to spend more money for them, but **definitely** for reskins from items already in the game, thats something i can mod in my freetime by myself.
---
As somebody who last enjoyed FO76 with friends several months ago, I will say the argument for a craftable repair kit was made, after realizing the number of times we'd break weapons while on longer excursions.
---
Destroyed second wall, and power conduits attached to it, I am now running for my life as I type this as the owner is now shooting to kill for my pocket full of Caps
---
I blame you all.
---
Marine shielded lining drop from Creenberry bog event i got 4 times \~800 play
---
Thanks mate, game used to run a bit better just haven’t played in a couple months got on recently
---
No problem! Thank YOU for everything too!
---
I'm not gonna make that, hopefully I'll be able to show you some other time :)
---
I'd be irritated if I wasn't irradiated
---
** STILL HERE IF ANYBODY NEEDS **
---
It’s 2:30 AM here I can’t stay up much later 😂
---
No worries. Hopefully catch you another time. 
---
Goodluck out there!
---
I'll take some of dat 556 haha
---
hmmm... so this is basically a new nukashine =)
---
I will be leaving the area, but I am still in the world if you want to stop by! The tourist is next to the flagpole, you can’t miss her.
---
I'm at work now. But even if you camp is nice, why would I pay for seeing it?!?! I also have nice camp, people enjoy it while visiting me, but donations?!?!
---
Interesting. Dead or alive? Dead one totally didn't count for me on PC. Got it from wise mothman instead just like OP.
---
I’m fine with having to repair my guns. I’m absolutely not fine with not being able to use parts from an exact copy of my gun to repair it, and getting less scrap from that gun than from a desk fan if I scrap it. 
---
That is what feels tacked on, or designed to force you towards microtransactions.
---
Warning: a band of raiders on tricycles are attacking your camp, do you wish to retaliate with your wheelbarrow?
---
Palace of the winding path
---
Jesus... is everyone that plays this game like 10?
---
hmmm... so we have a new nukashine? Blackout to random location.
---
I mean that’s not saying much.
---
Seems to be a random encounter. I met him near the Pumpkin house and this sentry bot scared the crap out of me at first. Then I saw he was friendly instead of hostile. So he started to follow me after he mistaken me for authority. He helps me kill some enemies including a scorchbeast, and when the dust cleared, he saw through my missing authorization clearances and turned on me. So I had to finish the sentry bot off. Beware if he should turn on you at any moment.
---
&gt;So you never played Fallout Dlcs before?  
---
How did you get that from my response??
---
I'm 34.... And bipolar 2. I was minding my own business on a cliff somewhere. And three level 200s came and broke my whole place after I spent an hour getting to work right.
---
So no... I'm not 10. I'm just easy to make cry some days... Why can't adults have emotions?
---
awesome now i get to worry about food more, is it water too or nah?
---
Was any info about the new mode coming in there?
---
Before the inevitable shit storm this comment is likely to attract, I'll say you are absolutely right.  There are a few things to take away from this is. Thing 1, dont take Bethesda's word at face value, they are a for profit company. There is nothing, not even public backlash, that will prevent them from saying or doing whatever it takes to maximize their bottom line. They dont give a fuck as long as they are making money.
---
Thing B, if they reach a point where they've sunk enough money into this game and arent getting possiitive returns, the will shut down servers and move on to another project.  fallout 76 will become that game we played way back when.
---
Thing 4, Profit.
---
Tldr: make money, fuck glitches.
---
Server hopped 10+ times so far and that toilet is looted every time... bleh.
---
I hear you there. Blue prints would be nice to just a way to save it. I would like join a team and build Wshops and share resources and what not. Beats getting shot by my invisible tse visitors.
---
Since apparently you never learned how to read or the definition of certain words, I'll help you out :) 
---
Here is Bethesda's whole take on the Atomic Store:  [https://bethesda.net/en/article/2a4GTCpUPyEsGCGYWyM6Q2/welcome-to-the-atomic-shop](https://bethesda.net/en/article/2a4GTCpUPyEsGCGYWyM6Q2/welcome-to-the-atomic-shop) 
---
In which they state that daily challenges will be available for fun and Atoms. This is what the challenges were advertised BY BETHESDA. Expecting them to keep to that is like expecting your car dealer to be upstanding with your car warranty. If they tell you that if the radiator goes out in it's lifetime, and they refuse to replace or fix it in the future, are you just going to let it go, or cause a fuss? Because by the way you're acting you'd probably just buy a whole new car.
---
This isn't whining btw, it's constructive criticism, probably another thing you've never learned about. It means to give an opinion on something with your honest opinion on how it can be made better.
---
You dont HAVE to pay, its a DONATION box. You can leave something if you want if the camp has convenienced you. I have a camp right outside west-tek and right outside silo alpha that lets people easily stash their newly acquired lead/loot and fast-travel away.
---
I've also visited other peoples camp near nuke areas that helped me save a lot of time by providing easy access workbenches and stash boxes. I want to leave them rare drinks / junk / whatever else I don't need, but dropping a paper bag risks de-spawning my gifts. This is why donation boxes are necessary.
---
I know its not important, but since bugfixes are far and few in between why not introduce some more stuff that actually helps give us a sense of community?
---
 Just killed the SB Queen, and I got 3 advanced repair kits.  
---
I really don't think we have to worry about the 100% one from the shop...
---
I had all my wanted mutations by lvl 70. And that's just one more advantage that guy might have had on a lvl 15 that I didn't even think about, even further proving my point. You can't equate a lvl 15 to a lvl 90. Trying just shows ignorance of how the game actually works.
---
And as soon as I post this I find one... done and dusted.  Thank you.
---
(On PC if anyone needs to borrow a helmet)
---
Yeah it's easy, all you have to do is put in your credit card details in game and click purchase and it gives you atoms
---
Thanks for the encouragement and kind words. :)
---
&gt; Let's get Fallout fixed.
---
But it just works bro.
---
there is no pay to win in fallout 76?
---
I possibly have one.
---
I'm on PS4 in Aus I will be on on about 1 hour or so.
---
I'd take 2k for it 😜 
---
PSN is chronic_coit add me and just msg me saying who u r and I'll hit u up when I jump on
---
It’s post apocalyptic take a dump in the wasteland
---
I gotta try that :D
---
&gt; disadvantage
---
&gt;an unfavorable circumstance or condition that reduces the chances of success or effectiveness.
---
"a major disadvantage is the limited nature of the data"
---
Not really an Einstein are you?
---
I have a 1* and two 3* Berserker Lever Action. I can give you the stats on the 3* items in the morning in you’re interested.
---
say if you craft 20. .308's you'd only need to do that twice, as it would mean you've crafted 40 bullets. As with energy based ammo, craft two lots of 2mm electromagnetic cartridges and you'll be fine.
---
fallout 76 mezzanine level crash is still a problem.
---
FR Sent
---
Water too at my char. Have to drink a lot more.
---
Light weapons, I'm piling up on them myself, one handed melee weapons and various pieces of armor weighing less than 5 lbs
---
5 lbs is 2.27 kg
---
Or it takes a photo? That would be sweet.
---
Maybe it's different depending what you play on but for Xbox at least the game has been like this for a while, I want to say for a couple patch updates now.  nothing changed today.
---
How many times have you killed the queen since the update went live???
---
Booo
---
Oh, yes - it certainly does! Just take a photo in Photo Mode (or with the new cameras, I guess) and you'll more often than not have one of your photos show up as you load in or fast travel :)
---
fuckin great
---
Got it. The least I can do for this community :)
---
How about your travel caps are reembirsed? Seriously 35 caps is too much sometimes
---
I hope u still on world, i just saw post, joining roght now
---
Would love to see your rifle build dude. Trying to optimise my own at the moment, but 2 handed is too potent for me to want to change ahha.
---
? What you on about
---
They need someone to keep the coffee machines working and the fridges filled, I’d do it if I lived close to their offices.
---
Nine
---
Exactly!! On the same topic gamers are so much more demanding and entitled than they were before where they would just be happy for a new game to come out. Now the demand for better graphics, better realism, better everything is everywhere and the development costs are becoming so high, while the games are still sold for the same 60$ as 10 years ago.
---
Looking at the downvoters, I just see nothing but whining and entitlement.
---
Happened to me last night, it was hilarious, I ended up doing it on purpose multiple times in a row and didn't even care that I died twice. 
---
As a result, I have some additions: 1) all emotes launch you, 2) you do have to physically hold the camera, when i had it equipped but 'holstered' I was fine, 3) if you happen to be walking while holding the camera and emoting you're also fine. 
---
But yeah, annoying bug if you're not just doing it for laughs
---
Still might not be enough time since I need to find a Flatwood's Monster to photograph. :P
---
Top work, very much appreciated.
---
I must be blind
---
I hope you got to find her, my game just crashed. 🙄
---
Appreciate the response and I'm not having a go at you, but this should have been thought about prior to the release of the camera, especially when you release challenges to take photos.
---
A HAM radio signal that could be received by other players' pipboy's would be awesome, even a simple SOS.  Find one, get trapped, call for help from the tower.
---
I mean he is a Robobrain
---
Not worth the caps fast travelling to each location to take the pics. All I got for it was a lens (105mm) and a poster plan.....
---
Awesome, thanks for the info. Wasn’t sure if it would count each bullet or number of times crafting.
---
Dude thanks
---
How many pictures of me killing myself with my own shotgun do I really need?
---
Thank you for the couple of serums. I just reached the endgame still, with using Starched Genes after getting the Marsupial mutation randomly again. So it is very much appreciated.
---
lololololololol
---
thank you super easy if you set everything up in adventure mode only took me 2 minutes to craft everything once I joined survival
---
anti armor boxing glove with speed amp and either a strength bonus or a power hit bonus. Right stuff makes it hit for 300 damage a pop, but I wish dual wielding boxing gloves and knuckles was a thing with a 30%+ increase attack speed as a bonus.
---
Just a wrong assumption i guess. Someone who don't want to pay for Quality DLCs and instead wants a cashgrab game sounds alot like someone who never paid for Bethesda Dlcs :x Sry ma man.
---
Same here I have the galleria and harpers ferry but have been there quite a few times, another broken item.
---
Mutant is an all-around kind of buff so 10% is okay. If it becomes 30% there will be no point in ever using any of the vs enemy types weapons. 
---
Making it 25% it will instantly become better that Two Shot weaponry with no drawback at all. Heck, i would argue that a 20% mutant is better than the 25% from Two shot simply because of how bad Two shot is with that accuracy debuff.
---
mememememeem
---
See you soon!
---
Tyvm got it
---
Um how?
---
It would have been miles better if they were just event based so it persuades you to do more events.
---
50 for one or 250 for a pack of six
---
Even just hearing about this has got me to put away my furious plasma gat for the last ¼ of the queen's health.
---
Not to mention it's 50 photos per Xbox. My wife and I play on separate accounts on the same box and have to share the same 50 photo limit. 
---
There needs to be an increase and the accounts should not be linked; especially if that increase ends up being only arbitrary.
---
I bought 6x pack for 400 atoms and single is 150 i think May be 200
---
You having a good run of luck is far from definitive statistical proof. There is no formula found by datamining, not documentation in game and no proof that luck does except the occasional person feeling lucky after boosting luck. 
---
Its RNG. My squad and I keep records of our drops and we get roughly the same amount of three stars even with massive luck disparity.  Now what 3 stars are good in a different problem. But its not even proven or likely that luck improves 3 star drop chances, much less somehow magically figuring out what type of drop you want and giving you that.
---
But you've probably already made up your mind because you feel like its true. But feeling like something is true isn't a basis for a logic argument.
---
At this point anyone left is a real player. The jerks mostly left due to bugs shortly after launch.
---
Awesome!
---
I know I applied it to my excavator armour and lo and behold now I have X-01 but with the excavator carryweight
---
it's the same quest, it just gives you 2 chances to find them on any 1 server
---
Sounds great! I'll definitely take a look at that 3*
---
Maybe you have equipment that does that for you, or even a perk card equipped?
---
It exists on the consoles too, but isn't in game. The only reason it's in game on PC is because people broke into the dev room and found it there. Bethesda banned several people for this.
---
Nothing. Is there even a effect that does this? Invisible for just a second or two?
---
First, find the exact quote in SP1 where BGS promised to only make single player games going forward. 
---
Hint: It's a trick question. The quote doesn't exist, because BGS never actually said anything, Bethesda Softworks did since they are the ones behind the SP1 thing, and also because it was never said. In fact they even highlight how they (Bethesda Softworks) are leaders in multiplayer gaming. Furthermore, they say absolutely nothing about their plans for games going forward, the entire SP1 thing was an announcement on sales for a number of their single player titles and for a charity scholarship they were donating to. 
---
How you get "We promise we will never make a multiplayer game" from this, and furthermore get outraged that they broke this 100% imaginary promise, is entirely beyond me. 
---
But hey, if you find that quote in the SP1 information, I'll apologize for calling you an idiot. But if you can't be bothered to find and share that, then clearly I was right.
---
Have you picked up the Parasites disease? That will drain your food meter.
---
What activities are you doing? Do you do lots of vats? I just played a 4.5 hour session with 27 fusion cores at the beginning and ended with 25 cores.
---
What is that weird sound when I jump with the Power Armor anyway?
---
The issue is to stop fo76 flopping it’s selling for £6-7, they are selling it as a loss leader now.
---
So what can they do? They need to make money.
---
To be fair, when that kind of behavior was going on, it was usually done with explosive bobble heads stacked to generate massive damage output.
---
Yup bought this game at £6.29 or something outrageous. Bethesda has to make money someway
---
I think I'll just go fight a couple queens then.
---
Incisor max imo
---
I am level 260 and I have yet to see a piece of Sentinel Armour, never mind wear it, I use Unyeilding but I think while you are in the armour the buffs of said armour does not apply.
---
30 seconds is definitely a problem, it should be more like 5 - 10 seconds.  
---
How long is it if you launch directly from the game .exe rather than using the desktop shortcut which runs through the Bethesda launcher?
---
Same here, too. I've actually created new characters JUST to bee-line from Vault 76 to Grafton Dam in the hopes that this "discovery" will be the one to unlock that challenge, but it never works.
---
I'll go fight a couple of queens instead.
---
Explosive shotguns are a hell of a drug.
---
There's a crossbow
---
Noticed this as well
---
25% extra armor penetration or a mere 5% increase in damage. 
---
This choice should be obvious.
---
Now I'm lying u remember now 300 for 6 pack and 100 for 1 but yeah I'm lvl  27 i need them lo
---
Yeah it happened to me so far twice I could only spawn back at V76.
---
Running escape artist?
---
I'm just ignorant on how armor penetration works as far as dealing damage goes
---
Yeah, I'll have to ask my gf later today to see what she's running, but whenever she crouches she goes invisible for a moment.
---
Should be launch content
---
is Adventure mode still getting double XP this week?
---
 [https://www.player.one/two-double-xp-weekends-fallout-76-april-125143](https://www.player.one/two-double-xp-weekends-fallout-76-april-125143)
---
Indeed I am. That solves it. 
---
So is this invisible animation a signal for it?
---
Other guy solved it. Escape artist.
---
Looking for it still this moment? I'm on a world currently holding it as I idle.
---
Lol I know I’m throwing a up a shitty tin roof right now to hopefully make it through the shit storm. 
---
You put it the best way and that’s if we love this game and we want more content and for it to continue we have to throw money at the atom store. However they are losing money right now. A good example of how is one of my best friends T. Now T is a trucker and also a lover of the fallout series but he only gets one or two nights a month to actually play 76. He just threw $50 into this game. $40 to pay some guy to level his account and the last ten for caps to buy some gear. Just so hey can join me and another friend on doing all the sheepsquatch mission and take on the imposter. That’s $50 that could of gone to Bethesda to continue this game but it didn’t because there is no means for him to spend it. 
---
Now can someone explain to me why is that this community acts like Bethesda is a perfect saint that releases only the finest content. Like everyone when they through up rage when this game came out from it being broken and buggy.   Literally the owner of a company known for releasing broken and buggy games at launch came out on stage and told everyone that they glued there broken buggy outdated engine with a multiplayer engine. And said it just works. Last time I check that’s a synonym for it barely works.
---
I hoped Nuclear Winter... Was a real winter :/ U know, with campfire, heat to manage, low drop of ammo, low junk to scrap :/ I'm a bit m'eh atm
---
Gonna need those 160 atoms for dem sweet repair kits
---
Yes! Add me please!
---
Are water filters a one time use? I haven't crafted one just yet.
---
Sure thing.
---
Hey bud is ok if i join you two have 5 chars i need to get this quest for lol
---
IGN smokeyninjas
---
Or, free repair kits with every item purchase!
---
I think everyone is, as far as I'm aware nobody has worked out the formula.  
---
What we do know is that is your armor is high compared to the size of the hit, it negates a lot of damage. If it is small relative to the hit, it negates almost nothing. 
---
For example (made up numbers):
---
200 damage hit at 160dr = 100 damage taken
---
200 damage hit at 40dr (max incisor)= 175 damage taken
---
So negating some armour to drop it below the damage you're doing by a large amount, is a massive bonus. 
---
If I'm wrong about any of this (except the exact numbers, I know I made those up) someone please link me some data. I'd be happy to have it!
---
Yeah it’s the running around collecting mats that takes the time..
---
Pvp is horribly unbalanced. Getting the first shot will win you a lot of fight. If you're strickly melee thats your problem, if you are melee and pvp you wanna make sure to get the jump on them. 
---
You don't even need a competitive build to kill on pvp, just decent equipment and tactics.
---
Occasionally the ones at the back of the whitespring golf club, other than that no.
---
Sure thing. Just mind the server might get full, so you may need to swap around. I'll add ya in just a moment.
---
Adding you and bringing some friends.  Thanks bud.
---
No problem! Sounds good man see you soon
---
There is an alien in a dumpster and the one mounted in the taxidermy basement. Try with them.
---
Also tell me where i can find a flatwood monster,pls. I'm server hopping at the pink forest in the bog 'cause i saw it inside twice but no luck so far.
---
&gt;Just a wrong assumption i guess. Someone who don't want to pay for Quality DLCs and instead wants a cashgrab game sounds alot like someone who never paid for Bethesda Dlcs :x Sry ma man.
---
Huh? Bethesda, the people making the "quality DLCs" have said that it will be paid for by the "cosmetic only" atom store, that was part of the marketing for the game.  
---
It's all gone to shit because Bethesda released in an alpha state and it got crucified by the games media, it might have sold okay, but nowhere near the numbers they were hoping for, so now they're turning up the pressure on what sort of crap they can push through the atom store.
---
Sweet thanks mate joining now
---
I'm not the one acting as if my civil rights are being trampled upon by the big bad Bethesda over a 50 atom repair kit lol.
---
Just a guess, but would the taxidermied Zetan alien in the closet from the beginning of the Lying Lowe questline work? I personally doubt it will, but it's all I can think of without any confirmation of other non-Flatwoods aliens being given.
---
found an item... 
---
mysterious quill on a dead brahmin, it was junk but not broken down automatically
---
You're welcome. I did the Survival challenge this morning, can tell you right now.. Super Duper Doesn't count for the challenge either, unfortunately.
---
Why do I close my camp off? 2 reasons:
---
1) I have camp in a really good farming spot where I generate stims, disease cures, antiseptic, adhesive, lead, and nuclear waste. 
---
2) People are a\*\*holes. They attack your camp if you're in one of the good spots. They also kill your pets. I've lost 4 pets due to people spawning at the camp spot and they're mad they have to leave the world.
---
Thank you!!
---
Even that only does so much. You gotta fire in burst to hope to consistently hit something far away. Up close just spray and pray.
---
Oh wow, that's definitely an improvement. It loads instantly when I used the executable in the directory, it would seem the Bethesda Launcher causes the long delay. But I think I need it for updates?
---
Yeah, my thoughts exactly.  I run mostly melee with a ski sword, combat knife and 4 meat hooks.  I have a Troubleshooters for Watoga/Silos, a Ghoul Slaers for The Whitespring, an Instigating for most anything, all 1 star. My 2 star Mutants meat hook with power damage with even a buff to 20 would make all but the Instigating nearly useless.  
---
I also have a Mutant's Explosive combat rifle.  10% buff vs. 25% for TS, sitll works all around.  I would not complain if they buffed Mutants to 15, but no higher.
---
Damn, was hoping to avoid crafting quite so many Molotov’s. thanks for the heads up.
---
No problem ^^
---
It's entirely asinine we have to hop servers to find a new quest starter.
---
It could be a reason to take them down considering boycotts of players buying stuff with atoms.  
---
I don't even collect atoms anymore and only go online when my friends reeeeally want to play.
---
It just got "Meh". Especially with those not compleatable challanges those couple days back.
---
I've been having this issue as well. It seems to have increased with frequency since the update on the 23rd of April.
---
Thats true. Hahaha. I was server hopping last two hours!
---
i had the same problem, the mods were on my stash and i couldnt use them then I move it to my person and then I could attach them.
---
Same happened to me earlier this morning. However I shall hunt for Wendigo once again. The one in the cave for the daily challenge didn't count. I will try the duo lurking near Abby's bunker.
---
Tough guy ova here. Watch out! 
---
Crawl back into your hole where you think you know how the world works, troll. If sourpussing it works for you, you'll get nothing and you'll be nothing. 
---
I like to see things work out for the better. I don't know if I'll make it happen, but I can try.
---
❌*** STILL HERE ****❌
---
You have maximum no. of characters huh? Are some of them alts or mules? Just curious. I have five as well I started to make for the level up challenges, then I found out the 5 characters created limit.
---
Yeah, just use the launcher on update days.
---
All max lvl diff builds
---
Which fallout do think they started with?
---
i started it hearing after I applied telsa coils to my PA. so I thought it was that.
---
That people that are going to buy cosmetics and stuff for real money, deserve a buggy hell of a game in my opinion :D We would send the devs the right message by not buying that crap so they need to redesign their monetization. It would benefit the modding community too, because right now your not really allowed to add custom content to the game because Beth is selling Custom Content on their own. If they just would focus on Conten Creation like they always did, the modding community is going to fix everything else. This is probably never going to happen if you still need to buy a "cleaner" Powerarmor Skin with Real Money to help the Devs holding up the Server Costs.  (As i said every hobby/pro modder can do the same in no time)
---
Ooo il give that a try, thanks 👍
---
Only in survival because it's a game of hide and run away. So if you find a camp destroy it so the owner return home.
---
Other then that I'm respectful and love seeing people's build styles. Will even repair camps or help if it's getting raided. Done so numerous times.
---
I've hopped non stop for 45 minutes now.  Nothing except invisible Mr Fister robots who fancy my bum.
---
Is the assaultron head even fixed?
---
Only if they’re locked. What you got hiding in there huh?!
---
Maybe it is because of the loadscreen gallery?  
---
Make it selectable!  
---
Select the best photos of the taken ones, then your game does not have to load the whole bunch up for it all the time.  
---
That is a thing that got filled up in the B.E.T.A. already.
---
Can't speak for how the math shakes out exactly as the formulas aren't published by BGS. Every creature and player has a set of DRs (physical, energy, and radiation).
---
If the DR is higher than your damage output you will do little to no damage to the target. Your damage must be more to do significant damage, so do you try to buff your damage or lower their DR?  Incisor is majorly OP for melee, giving a huge 75% reduction in enemy DR, on top of any AA effects or mods to the weapon. The better your armor penetration, the more damage the target will take. The only case where damage increases are preferred over armor penetration are against unarmored targets like ghouls.
---
Have TSE, stealth, bloodied, heavy gunner &amp; handgun builds
---
No it doesn't work in PA. There is a power armour torso mod that replaces it though "emergency protocols" IIRC you take 50% less damage and sprint faster at increased ap cost while below 30% hp.
---
Yeah I heard of people destroying camps if a players has their spot, more so if they don't like it. I live in a hobbit hole after having my camp destroyed the 8th time. Players ruined it for others. It's also usually a lv 20-30+ that will try messing with my camp only.
---
Possibly? I have 2k let’s hear what it is.
---
Side note: apparently the Mythical Flatwoods Monster is neither an alien nor an actual Flatwoods Monster.
---
Just snapped him and it did not count towards the challenge in either 'category'.
---
There’s outrage over those things too for sure man, it’s just that those aren’t things they knowingly chose to add to the game.
---
This Sub would be filled with screens and videos of players in Survival getting snipped while pooping. I'm not sure how I feel about that.
---
if you want to get this quest sorted for your other chars i can hold the spot for you to swap chars
---
Nice. I usually make time to only play my main character now vs alts. After how easy endgame content makes it to level up and XP boosting actions/items.
---
I used to be a wastelander like you... then I took an arrow in the knee.
---
There. I said it.
---
they have to make money some how, I rahter them have timers on unique consmetics than to add more P2W stuff in the AS.
---
if you want it and dont have the free atoms well then you have to pay, use you atoms smarter and stop bitching becuase you can get all 4 off them, I cant get them either with the free atoms but thats the way it goes. 
---
you want all 4 then cough the 50 bucks, or pick one or two that you can get with the free atoms.
---
I'm in Europe -- almost everybody is from "another country".
---
It’s not really pay2win though...
---
I’m not gunna avoid them cuz their more of a pay for convenience thing. I won’t let them go over too pay2win without a fight but I’m not gunna flipping blast Bethesda because they aren’t making any money cuz dooshbags keep giving the games bad reviews! Probably all the people who want to play psycho murder hobo raiders online and blow up everyone else’s camps and workshops too. Bethesda hasn’t done anything wrong yet and don’t u dare tell me these are just signs that they are thinking of going full pay2win!
---
I hope it works for you as well.
---
Agree, sounds like a train crashing or something
---
Wow
---
Yeah still takes a long time when your lvling 5 chars tho
---
Because I do not like guns I am built melee fighting. I always have 3 bats.. Aaaaand 2  guns to switch to.
---
dude the vendor caps refresh every 20 hours not by server hopping. if you want more caps buy something from the vendors and then they will have some caps for you.
---
Did the enclave president quest line that got datamined ages ago get canned? Or will that be nuclear winter?
---
Cause I’m a beach boy that’s why. Xbox players who we’ve raided where u at
---
You’re just an asshat trying to win an argument by redefining [“out of context”](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.collinsdictionary.com/us/amp/english/out-of-context) :
---
“If a statement or remark is quoted out of context, the circumstances in which it was said are not correctly reported, so that it seems to mean something different from the meaning that was intended
---
Oh I'm fine. I'm just glad I got the quest started now. I only got my main and low as 23 alt I used to use.
---
Maxed lead belly + cannibal rank one perks and you can traverse the wastelands with minimum useful items for a mere 3 end points.
---
It used to do a fading animation, like you’d be semi visible to yourself but invisible to other players then they changed it recently to trigger like chameleon
---
Yeah, the upvote to comment ratio on this one seems rather telling, especially in contrast to their previous patch note posts.
---
Oh of course you have no argument and lost so now you're here to talk shit.
---
Must suck crying on the Internet over Bethesda not giving you 2 dollars of in game currency then being called out for a baby and losing the argument.
---
Cool well thanks again was trying for hours last night with no luck your a lifesaver
---
Have you tried it with the enclave scout armor. I think it goes with it really well, plus I wasn't a fan of the scout jumpsuit to begin with. Also, the picture of it has them wearing urban scout leggings so I think that says something.
---
Another way to trigger the bug is to exit and re-enter the nuke zone until you stop taking rads.
---
1 time use but if you goto a H20 source and use it. You get purified water and not dirty water an such.
---
Any of you still there
---
Mhm, no problem. Happy to help :)
---
It took me a handful of server hops to find this spawn, after I did Mistaken Identity when a Prison Warden spawned here instead.
---
You can stack so many buffs from eating and they last half an hour. I feel like we're pretty good on the buff front.
---
I did the same. Second character got the number from 2/5 to 4/5 with only the dam missing. Third character still couldn't get the challenge finished when discovering the dam.
---
I use a "friend" (random person friended online).
---
Ah you got me!
---
Thinking you have the right to free shot Bethesda doesn't have to give you isn't entitlement.
---
the belief that one is inherently deserving of privileges or special treatment
---
Getting refunded for not getting free shit is entitlement you moron
---
I believe you're entirely right. Further I think the Atom Shop is the **entire reason the game was made.** 
---
76 is Bethesda's experiment in Games as a Service and a 'Real World Cash Shop' is a vital organ for such a beast.
---
This was a line that was going to be crossed before a single quest was written. A year down the line from here, yes - we'll have new free content, but it's sure as sugar that we'll also have a whole bunker full Atom Shop items that are far, farrrrrr from cosmetic.
---
Same for me. I recall a team member saying it would be fixed this patch, too.
---
Still there
---
I'd love them to implement this but it will never happen. Bethesda have shown their hand.
---
this is how i see it.  beth already has a roadmap as to what fo76 is to become.  they "say" they are listening to the players, when in actuality, i think they listen very little.
---
it goes like this.  the players all say, "we want "X" content in the game.  if this happens to be part of the roadmap, they say, "we listened to the community and are pleased to announce the addition of content "X"", and every body is happy.  the players then think beth made some big change to accommodate what the players want.  when in actuality, they did very little.
---
or, we get a case like these repair kits.  the players said "NO!" but since the kits were part of the roadmap, we get them any ways.  they say they listened to the players, but actually, they are just appeasing us.  trying to make us think that we are part of the development of the game.  even with the landslide of unpopularity, these kits still came out as foretold.
---
then we get from beth, "if this does not work out as we thought, (and what has so far?) we will make changes."  my god!!  PvP is STILL in beta, and you think they are going to have time to fix this?  these kits were just another tightly coiled pile on the lawn.
---
even though we can get them for free, i still will NOT use them!  i swear, i am just going to drop them on the ground!  why would i only fix some thing to 100% - 150%, when i can do it my self to 200%???
---
being a veteran gamer, having been in on alphas and betas stages of game development, this is just......bad decision making on beth's part.
---
so we are left with two options.  grin and bear it, or just give up the ghost and spend our money else where.
---
gonna go steal my dog's chew toy so i have some thing to bite down on as i "grin and bear it."  :-(
---
I'm in the same server. The were in Wavy Willards emtrance. ign oscar_vault101
---
Ok thanks for your help.
---
Yeah people are saying flatwoods monster doesn't count as an alien
---
It doesn't look too bad with that one, admittedly. I'm more than a little reluctant to give up wearing my full set of long-sought and hard-won 3 Star armour pieces though, just to get something that makes the Ops suit look a little less awful :)
---
No, i just have a rad shower.
---
Never. 
---
Like you, my camp is open for anyone to use. Players are welcome to make use of work benches, bed and can help themselves to any crops/water they need. If I so happen to have an extractor then that is open too.
---
Crops/water/resources will have replenished by the time I return (if there happens to be no water I've still got a pump to make boiled so all is good, crops are only for adhesive or getting rid of trees/bushes as I'm carnivore mutated so no point eating them!
---
Nothing is closed off. I used to close off personal quarters but that was found to be the only time I got damage from players.
---
If I see a camp that is locked I leave alone (sometimes I try to get in though, leave doors open or a bag of something to show them their security isn't too tight lol). But I'll never cause damage to one. Pointless exercise in my opinion, cant steal anything anyway. Plus players spend time building them, I'm not going to knock that down.
---
It has the same stas and is non legendary tho
---
Thank you on my way
---
Don't worry, I got the game a month ago and I can't complete these challenges either, even though I've now been everywhere. It's not a "because you participated in the beta" thing. It's a "Bugthesda^TM" thing.
---
The only thing we can do to improve loadings, is buying an SSD. It improves for sure your experience while reducing loadings in about 20% in general. But the problem is the graphical engine itself, that is NOT optimized and OLD. Only Bethesda could do something about it..but i doubt.
---
I bought the game a week after release and have the same problem.
---
If you kill the Flatwoods Monster, it counts as an alien, so it should for the photos.
---
Same goes for taking a picture of a Player, it counts as a Human.
---
Just because they're listed separately, doesn't mean one doesn't trigger the other.
---
I'd rather leave some guano around, like scorchbeasts do xD
---
got my picture.
---
[https://ibb.co/6JLGDnW](https://ibb.co/6JLGDnW)
---
"I've covered wars you know!"
---
Yep. Sorry for the late reply.
---
&gt;Let's recap:
---
&gt;
---
&gt;\- bag-gate
---
&gt;\- refund-gate
---
No arguments here. 
---
&gt;\- releasing the game in a broken state
---
Wasn't fully broken, it could still be used
---
&gt;\- the atom shop, while the game is still broken.
---
&gt;\- incomplete patch notes
---
&gt;\- releasing patch notes only AFTER the game was patched, giving NO opportunity for discussion with its player base
---
Name one game that does, most games don't release patch notes until after a patch. 
---
&gt;\- lying about players requesting repair packs being added in the atom shop
---
You've spoken to every single player then have you? 
---
&gt;\- lying repeatedly about fo76 features: stash large enough to not be aware of any limits, playable in single player, not ever seeing a server (oups, disconnected from the s-word)
---
&gt;\- lying about the reasons for the item degradation (they want to sell repair packs), limited stash (they clearly want to sell more space in the atom shop), the poor game balance in single-player (because you won't buy costumes &amp; emotes if you play single player)
---
Item degradation is for immersion and because. 
---
Limited stash is to ensure that it doesnt fully break the servers. 
---
I can play fine without other people. 
---
&gt;\- never patching any of their games, always relying on modders to do it (unofficial patches in all bethesda games)
---
All their games from morrowind onwards have had patches. They don't catch all the issues and unofficial patches are created. 
---
&gt;&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt;Bethesda doesn't care about its players, and I'm starting to think its employees don't even care about games anymore. Bethesda/zenimax only cares about money.
---
Okay. 
---
&gt;Therefore, as it might very well be the only metric they care about that I can affect, I'm uninstalling fo76 and the bethesda client from my computer.
---
Don't let the door hit you where the good lord split you.
---
&gt;On top of that, I'm not buying elder scrolls 6 when it comes out, and I'm not buying ANY games from ANY of the companies owned by zenimax (bethesda, id, arkane, tango and machinegames) until I see some real change in the way this company is run. Yes, this is ONE company, and they're going to get the same treatment from me: pure and simple boycott.
---
Oh no. Bet you will. 
---
&gt;And I suggest everyone who is still here and fed up with fallout 76 to do exactly the same.
---
Spoiler: you will and so will everybody else.
---
That makes no sense whatsoever
---
It definitely doesn’t.
---
That was 4 weeks ago lol.
---
Fireproof perk or Dense chest mod fixes this problem.
---
Reimbursement on successful completion of the event? (Mind you accidentally traveling to the area rather than the actual event could effect that)
---
Apparently, it's from the new PA paint people have datamined.
---
Somehow (lol), it's ended up being implemented early into all PA.
---
It is modifiable but you can't get the mod recipes. If they were in the Dev room all of the mod items are still in the game. The musket is also 1/3 stronger than the laser rifle, so even without mods it still packs a punch.
---
Nah, they're just naturally a plague walker now. Not even a mutation, you can catch OP half a mile away down wind.
---
Have you personally done it?  Cause no offence but I don’t think it’d be listed separately if it did count.
---
One Atom would be enough.  
---
It is litterally sooo much better to go around with a group of friends and complete Events.  
---
If you go down the route of "But then people could farm indefinetly!" then slap a daily cap on event Atoms.   
---
It would improve the game soooo much!
---
https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Patch
---
Pretty sure you can play the game however you like
---
Read the text you do not read when you click 'I Agree' in any and all online games.  It will save you whining later.
---
Burrows is indoors. This is for outside nuke areas like SBQ.
---
Hopefully I will be proven wrong but my educated guess is that the vendor will be so ladden with RNG that even those like myself that have been hoarding legendaries since day 1 of B.E.T.A. will only have a marginal advantage over those who didn't.
---
The fact that have just killed Watoga as 'Legendary farming ground' only reinforces my misgivings; the vendor is just going to be an ever so slightly better outlet for unwanted legendaries than dropping them in the spot or leaving them untouched in the corpse if one has already 'maxed out' caps for the day or can't be arsed to crawl to the nearest vendor.
---
shhhhhh
---
A mix of photography, bear grills and jackass. I love it
---
I thought so. That restricts the immediate use to the Toxic Valley, no? For the bleach dogwood of three needed for one water filter.
---
Excellent work.  Reck those peasants my friend.
---
How is this productive at all? If it weren't for us players pointing out bugs they most likely would never be found.
---
Man that’s awesome
---
You shhhhh hahaha
---
I wouldn't thought it's possible, yet I know it's absolutely possible. Thanks for the info.
---
Try switching servers. It is apparently a bug for it to still be boarded up.
---
I'm pretty sure i server hopped yesterday and kept my cobbler 5% exp everytime.
---
with 2 legendary armour peices with the 50% less fall damage perk its very convenient
---
It's not boarded up. The door is inaccessible until a later time.
---
Yes,its really annoying.
---
Are you still there
---
Yup still here!
---
Pros: Random chance of 1-5 Atoms per completion of event, incentivises more events and teamwork, encourages usage of the Atomic Shop and potentially $4 [emergency]atom packs “just to afford this item I want that goes away in 3 months/3 hours”
---
Cons: players will start testing events to see which ones you can start the second you load in, either affecting the grind required(inevitable) or removing the ability to earn them from events in the future until they “fix” the instant event server hopping
---
But I do hope this becomes a thing, some challenges are ridiculous for what’s required vs the reward
---
you don't use the lever when loading (well, just once, to chamber the shell), you just shove the rounds through the loading gate.
---
Actually the animation is a bit broken.  When you fire it does bang, use lever to  eject spent case and load next round.  when you reload you shove in the new rounds then use the lever to eject the spent case and chamber the next round.  But if you're loading and the gun isn't empty you don't need to work the lever, and if you're loading from empty there shouldn't be a spent case to eject.
---
Also it should let you fully load the magazine, chamber a round then load one more round into the magazine.
---
I did the camera quest with my then lvl 13 character that went up to 16, much from just discovering locations while fast travelling to team mates. When at a friends CAMP I emoted and got a loading screen. I had no idea of what happened and then I appeared in the air, falling. Luckily I survived the fall with two crippled legs and the lvl 68 super mutant only had me at caution when I hid. Managed to get to hidden and fast travel back to my CAMP. That was a suspenseful moment. I might just do the Biv quest to have more of the same...
---
Make sure the name of the creature pops up in the view finder of the camera before you snap a pic.
---
You get the bleach dogwood in the toxic Valley but if you goto grafton and use green thumb, you will get tons fast. I think you need coal also. It's nice being in any location on the map and freely drink out of puddles. No worldly restrictions on its use.
---
your fact on point 1 is just your opinion not actual facts, the fact is that
---
something that you can buy in the atom shop that clearly gives the buying player an advatange over the none buying player is P2W. 
---
been able to repair you gear at anytime, anywhere you want is clearly an advantage.
---
Indy is taking a break from archeology to farm a large quantity of acid.
---
Nah team based Dungeons
---
Who was bothered by this?  We all clear out the vendor every day anyway, don't we?  Were people getting butthurt that some folks were managing to do it without spending 10 minutes clearing Harpers or something?
---
Ammosmith perk don't count! Only base count of ammo you craft will check in!!!
---
Energy ammo you can craft 2x fusions cells.
---
I did rockets and have 72of them now. (i have weightless rocket launcher so i will use them, but it is 2lbs per one rocket ....)
---
For molotovs you also need 40beer bottles, i found them in Elle's bunker.
---
No parasites disease or mutation speed demon on my level 50 char . Something not right after recent patch tbh .
---
We know Instanced raids are coming, though it sounded like the instancing was taking a lot of work.
---
bump
---
Thanks for the tip, this I didn't know.
---
needs it to smelt down all those golden artifacts.  ;-)
---
Makes sense. Sneaky Indy.
---
Thank you
---
How long you gonna be there I should be there in about  ten mins lol eating quickly
---
You may want to be sitting down for this.  If you find a post in a sub about a particular game, then it is likely that people are playing that game.
---
Ill be here for about another hour or so! Feel free to join whenever
---
I thin they aren't such a bad things. They were clear about it, this game will not have p2w stuff, and the repair kit doesn't seem to me such a things. You need always a workshop to repair stuff, so I don't see where is the problem. You can't use them in a fight, or isn't a smart moves, so I don't care about them.
---
When there was actualy doable challenges i could make 700 per week. Now you wont be able to do some challenges even with 456454lvl super op charracter, so... no you have no chance if you already did some part of those easy not timed challenges.
---
Maybe they added a random event with an alien or crashed spaceship,like in fallout 4.    
---
Or the frozen alien in the bunker with the ammo?
---
Well today you learnt something ;)
---
I am glad I stay subscribed to this sub so I can see issues like this, understand the devs still suck and know not to bother booting up the game.
---
The only time I ever 'raided' a camp, there was a wanted player hiding in his camp. Now usually, id live and let live... However they had locked all external doors with level 3 locks, so I couldn't use their workbenches. I took umbridge with this decision. 
---
So I started bombardment with mini-nukes. They left the server extremely quickly.
---
Had this happen to me once. It was incredible lol
---
My thought:  
---
\- Walking Arsenal : S perk : Reduce Weapon weight for each S point.  
---
\- Run For Your Knife : A perk : Increase speed with a one hand melee weapon.
---
\- Monster Muffler : E perk : Reduce the noise made by armor and/or reduce falling damage.
---
\- Hack And Seek : I perk : Allow to hack robot and force him to attack ennemis in the area.
---
\- Frog Legs : A perk : Bunny hopping perk  
---
\- Fashion Finder : L perk : If you wear a specific set ( Armor/ Outfit ) , allow you to find a copy or another part of the set.
---
\- Cowboy : P perk : Reduce the draw time for a .44 or .35 weapons and increase the attack speed.  
---
\- Clubber : S perk : Power attack with a blunt weapon deal extra damage.
---
\- Briefcase Bloodhound : P perk : Allow you to track the code-zombie.
---
So you have a sample size of 1
---
if you dont see how they are different, then maybe you should stop asking to get ppl banned without knowledge.
---
Emergency protocols is active under 20% health. It's a great tool for bloodied builds. That with dodgy mitigates damage down to 35% before armor is factored in.
---
Idk how about this guy, but i had 13 000 atoms by 500hours playing, so it is not about money only.
---
Oh I mean the mat collecting for the region. You can't get bleach dogwood anywhere else, right?
---
Once again you failed to read lol
---
It's not free. You have to complete challenges to get them, making them, technically, work. Unless you work for free, which after reading how you're stuck on one part of this, and not really adding much to the discussion, you probably do.
---
This was also advertised since day 1, and reading the article I posted, which I'm going to assume you didn't because reading is hard, implies they plan on keeping it in game for as long as the game is around, which in turn makes it a part of the game that we paid. Unless I misunderstand but that would make it something we paid for then. I'd use another analogy , but they seem to go over your head.
---
We mostly hang on the reddit fallout network discord  :) Loads of nice and fun people there to banter with and such, more than welcome to join it!
---
The guy in the picture on the atom store is wearing armour lmfao.
---
Maybe have a good look before you spend your atom points on garbage
---
Correct you are. I haven't found another location for them.
---
Serverhopping sorted it out fine for me. i wouldn't do it though. it might set of some flag.
---
If some kind lady/guy didn't let me join server with found corpse, i would be serverhoping until blood moon probably. It is insane!
---
And yours is not the only playstyle, so it doesn’t invalidate what the previous poster said.
---
Babylon is the passphrase for the Terminal in the Ecological Balance daily
---
Stand on edge of nuke zone, spam crouch button, now you don't get rads enjoy.
---
You say it like being better than 2 shot would be a bad thing
---
You know what's far easier to craft? Boiled water and beer.
---
Now imagine that 20 pounds turd...
---
Yes please.
---
I was actually just going to post about this as well. Switching servers still fixed it, but yeah it wasn’t border up just a glitch I guess
---
Another secret nerf.
---
It's like the mysterious woman for the Mistress of Mystery quest. You're not *meant* to immediately find it, it's meant to be organic.
---
If anyone finds that event please let me know cause I legit want to throw my controller out the window haha!
---
Dispite what people are saying, the game data says the Flatwoods monster won't work as it is flagged with the race "FlatwoodsMonsterRace" and the quest is looking for "AlienRace".
---
There are aliens in the game data (Alien Lieutenant, Alien Captain, and Alien Star Admiral) but I've never seen them in the game nor can I find spawning data for them.
---
Wierd, ok thank you. Where else are we going to find an alien to take a photo of? Lol. Don't know if that will work. But I'm gonna try
---
How on earth are they finding them and then mapping them *so damn fast*?!
---
[I posted about this a couple of months ago and not many people seemed to care.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aj7oc6/ok_so_i_splurged_and_upgraded_from_the_8mb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) Glad to see it's getting some attention now.
---
Thanks for the answers. I'll have to give it a go sometime when I'm roaming the Toxic Valley a lot.
---
well all have to say is, thank you for paying for me future content. 
---
(it wouldnt affect the average player). what is an average player? and how it wouldnt affect them?
---
buy your post tells me that you either will be buying them or you dont care until some fucked up shit happens to you and all you will change your mind. 
---
next thing we could get is armor and weapons in the AS and what would your post be like then lol. 
---
again thank you for paying my future content.
---
Just tested it again and this time it just disconnected me from the server. Fascinating.
---
This legit is what I figured.  There has to be some sort of quest that maybe they’re putting in but it’s so annoying putting these in the challenges if it doesn’t exist yet.  And oddly, today my Sheepsquatch one ticked off and didn’t see one, nor was I at encryptid.  So strange.
---
There were posts about this since beta.
---
Dude no way, that’s exactly why I was going there too lol. It doesn’t work unfortunately, FYI
---
Wtf is Nuclear Winter? A guy's name or name of a questline?
---
Send a friend request :) hope I can help
---
Dammit
---
Yeah I would say it might just be bugged again, like the base game challenge for killing an alien, but they also could have actually added one with this update and we’d have no clue
---
I forgot completly about the ban  to be honest but since today was the day it got installed, and the fact that just today there were 4 more post today, im sorry
---
❌** STILL HERE **❌
---
lol, bethesda ....
---
I usually go to grafton station and look for groups of houses. Most of them have 2 or 4 trees in every yard. Goodluck
---
do you have nukes unlocked?
---
also what is your PS4 name?
---
I have 72rockets because of this. It is so funny using rocket launcher!
---
I'm still shocked that they thought that this was an ok thing to do. I have literally not touched the game since the announcement of them.
---
I do indeed, psn is ThatBenjiGuy94 I believe or That_Benji_Guy94
---
Damn, you must have really speced into heavy weapon and explosives weight reduction.
---
That or you are a naked dude charging across Appalachia in a blaze of glory.
---
What sort of build are you using?
---
I am level 200, 8lvl guy with pump shotgun killed me in two hits. So yeah level is not everything.
---
I just screwed up my courage and sent 8-10 random friend invites.  Two nice people accepted me (and so I got the "make a friend" achievement, whee!)
---
The description says it is an under armour. So that part is your fault
---
Something that everyone will bitch about.
---
Best update ever, I salute your service😂
---
Place camp there, make stairs up to the pile. Adapt, improvise, overcome.
---
Still buying them
---
Could've sworn fallout 1 and 2 had repairing... Or maybe that was mods... Oh the skill was used for things other than weapons and armor. Still, it's been in, and since 3 has been part of gear. My point still stands.
---
Obligatory post, your photos are not completely gone when you delete them in-game. They are still stored on your HDD. You'll find them in the usual way you would find a screenshot taken on PS4.
---
Upvoted though, I wish the in-game limit was removed, OR we could select which ones we would like to add/remove to the in-game gallery.
---
The game certainly does not need to be made easier.
---
Initiate no longer is in any drop pool.
---
I will ride the Scorchbeast. Call me the Schorchbeastborn.
---
The Flatwoods monster is the only alien npc in the game. One of the tnt domes has a dead alien as well
---
Just wondering if this weapon is scaled on my character level when I complete all the challenges or it's always a lv 45?
---
It was me and yes its a brewing spotlight weekly. There are skins in the atom shop data for it now too.
---
Yeah. Why keep your promises. If they lock content behind paywalls will you still just blindy accept them ? Are you one of those guys who buys skip dlc  in Battlefield 3 ? This whole drama isnt about crybabies. Its about passionate fans who want 76 to be successfull. By breaking your promises you shine a very bad light on your game and company. They had more then enough bad press about 76 we dont need more
---
Yeah, for some reason one of the quest conditions for the lifetime challenge is (`does not have Keyword: ActorTypeMothman`) and the Mothman's keyword is `ActorTypeMothmanWatcher`. So some bug made the Mothman a valid target for the daily and the fix they implemented is also bugged with the wrong keyword.
---
It just works.
---
i would say anti-armor is the best but none of them are very good
---
Some of us who run those builds you talk about, have been running them since B.E.T.A.
---
I never use the cards that lessen weapon &amp; armor breaking. 
---
Thats a choice we have had since the beginning, repair kits dont have any impact on that choice.
---
Just because YOU run gunsmith 5 &amp; whiteknight 3 doesn’t mean everyone is running them.
---
It also doesn’t mean those players have repair kits either.
---
One thing that annoys me is when I try to attach wires, the character keeps jumping instead. Ffs!
---
They don't care. Sorry to say that, but it's the brutal reality. They can't fix the easiest issues.
---
They already have your money, so that basically does nothing.
---
Yes! I recognise your username. Ty!
---
I've been diligently learning recipes from Biv and have converted my camp into a brewery / chem den. Can't wait for that darn keg.
---
If it’s in my spot the whole camp is a goner
---
i find my tourist in the top of the landview lighthuose
---
im always downto help
---
GT is the same as here, should be on areound 2pm est.
---
I first learned of the item when it was just an image that someone had datamined. At that point I didn't know it was an under armour.
---
When I found out that it was an under armour, I was still ok with that fact, as I clearly said.
---
My problem comes with it looking rubbish with almost all the sets of armour in the game.
---
From what I can tell the beer keg and the punch bowl are going to be dispensers. No idea what for yet though
---
I’ve never seen XO1 plans, only mods.
---
I did have a good look and thought that the suit was alright looking with the Urban Scout armour as depicted in the store.
---
On finding out that it looks shit with all the other armours in the game that I _actually_ use I am disappointed.
---
That's all there is to it.
---
In the camp misc section, when you highlight the keg it say it will dispense "Mixed drinks", so maybe you can choose s specific mixed drink or perhaps it comes with one type as standard.
---
How much! Nd it's just the outfit or the head piece too?
---
Under armour looks shit full stop. It's covered by armour and then an outfit. What did you expect jfc
---
No effect when done by few only. A total differnet story if the majority follows.  
---
Have 15+ friends that bought the game, of which I'm the last to leave.
---
This dude made some damage calculator, not sure if it’s 100% accurate, seems to be pretty accurate, but it’s cool to play with to see what works best and you can compare two weapons 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bemnww/weapon_damage_calculator_and_comparator_webpage/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
Just the outfit for 3k. I have the set, but I would only part with it for a good trade or a considerable amount of caps.
---
Oh, too late, have already bought a dozen. Have won the game now too, thanks to these.
---
Don’t know, but assume so?
---
But it’s an American car and the driver seat is literally on the other side.
---
If I can remember correctly they were a Lv 58 and a Lv 156, the 156 left when I came back and I got blasted by a Two shot explosive automatic weapon... I combat logged and was ashamed to do so but I kept my junk to repair all that they messed up but I need to collect some flux to repair my decontamination shower.: Cobalt, Violet, Yellowcake, and Crimson. I'm on console and if anyone can sell me the flux i need that would help. Will be willing to pay 150\~250 caps for each flux.
---
You don’t have a clue...
---
Half of the fun is to snap the shot and then kill the object if you are alive.
---
I was only replying to the person who said they were never griefed. I don’t mind it. I’m js that it definitely happens a lot. I decided to not play survival until I’m at least level 100
---
I thought it was a skin for the assaultron head gun?
---
I think they do care if we don't buy repair kits. Imagine if in a month, Bethesda finds that they made, say 5000 dollars off of selling repair kits, and made 100,000 off of cosmetics. They'll probably consider if it was worth pissing off alot of people and getting alot of bad press for what's essentially just a drop in the bucket.
---
I don't use power armor often myself and I also don't use any armor related perks.
---
Necropost. This is relevant again for survival challenge. I think :)
---
Pretty much.  He was probably bait.
---
No.
---
open chat in an MMO with any sort of progression persistence is always a cancer filled spamfest

Like honestly there 6 more post about this today and im the one that gets flagged
---
If you dont like it, dont buy it.
---
More for me then
---
Are the other heads like the scorchbeast queen etc not unlockable in the game yet?
---
Well yeah, but most people have left way before this. I don't think this incident, isolated, will hurt the playerbase too bad, but if this kind of monetization continues it is possible.
---
We have Megathreads. For example, there was a Megathread around here somewhere about Repair Kits that was supposed to hold all the complaining after 24 hours but it got lost and no one bothered to do anything about it.
---
Ditch nocturnal
---
Less annoying would be nice . Is putting on power armor with calibrated legs “hard”?
---
There are only 1-2 glowing ones at the prime nuke site every 4-5 nukes. They’re very rare. Mostly it’s scorched, dogs, giant bug things, honey beasts, mirelurk variants and the odd hermit crab. Probably a few others.
---
I wish the dungeon had random good loot drop chance like the sheepsquatch to make it worth redoing. Also, it would have been cool that they copied divisions tunnel dlc were the map random generated so it would be hard to memorize and every run would be new experience, especially since all the entrances of it just end up at the same starting spot for the current one.
---
If they changed shit with out telling you then chances are they dont want to tell you
---
If bethesda would release player vending  i would sell it dirt cheap.
---
it would have been not long after the beta, a couple of people had said that they were in the enclave armory vendor but i had not got that far at the time so don't know for sure
---
It's the Millennium Challenges. You just opened the wrong challenge tab.  
---
Weekly challenges costs 15000 atoms to unlock.
---
This is such a cool idea. You could charge 100 caps for an hour or something and send e everyone copies of the pics via messenger or probably easier on PC love it
---
Apparently there’s a way to use a broken weapon if it’s favourited but I don’t know how. As much as I’d hate to see everyone using exploits again, it’s probably the only way to get Bethesda to buck up and take some responsibility.
---
Does super duper count towards this? If I craft one gun and triggers super duper, does the challenge say I made two
---
I've spent multiple lucrative sessions in the past two weeks holding single workshops for significant resource gain, even when one of them kept getting attacked by Scorchbeasts. Maybe you are trying too hard "securing up the workshop."
---
Nice. People often drop their extra plans and ammo for low levels or at the overseers cache. Some people like me go a bit further and mod level 1-5 weapons like hunting rifles and pipe guns as well. I’ve even bought some legendary weapons like a level 15 double capacity handmade to give away. Feels good.
---
Flatwoods Monster is an alien.
---
Your post wasn’t removed. It was just a reminder to users to check the wiki before posting. We feel that more conversation is warranted because of the update, but we don’t want a repeat of two weeks ago. A few of the other posts (that hadn’t hit the front page) were also flagged.
---
This is the reason I carry lvl 45 3*picnic baskets
---
Why do I get downvoted? I didn’t say anything offensive.
---
 Have the plan for the targeting hud for the x-01 helmet but I can’t craft it. Even after the fix for crafting or adding mods with this patch, it just makes the sound but does nothing. Not sure what’s up with that.
---
I mean while it's good for the pesky dailies, it's even better for the Luck perk "Storm Chaser" as now it can actually get some use.
---
I was hoping it wasn't underarmor so I could use that marine helmet with it. We really need an option to change underarmors to hide armor. Also, the atom shop items would really be nice to have a way to mod the colors to add more value towards them rather then having to buy 5 different paintjobs or outfits of the same item.
---
did you get the plan from the vendor?
---
I wonder if I’ve just never encountered it or if it was added with the last patch. I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s the first one because I’ve never met the insult bot either.
---
I feel you. Just happened to me yesterday. Plus when it comes to PVP, although I am relatively high level, with good guns and armor, I usually get my head handed to me. My guns seem oddly ineffective towards other players.
---
Good to know. I wonder if you can find both tourists if you start the quest?
---
Do we need to take picture of the alien, cause I thought we could just do the other cryptids? Also, there might be alien statues in the game that might count for the challenge.
---
try getting your hands on a bash damage minigun, for whatever reason that increases the shredder barrel damage
---
It’s annoying and very awkward considering a lot of the map is a similar colour.
---
I am kind of waiting to see what gameplay and armor alternatives, especially for later level PVE and PVP, that they will give us that do not require power armor.  I wouldn't mind a harder to hit agile character that can move a lot faster.
---
Currently I am a melee and explosives build.  I think it would be neat to be able to run around quickly setting traps that both damage and slow down enemies and to be able to strike suddenly then find cover.  It could show the power armor users the downside to being slow and tanked up.  
---
Ideally we will also have other non combative means of helping a group out in a fight (other than as a medic).  One who can strategically move around the battlefield to set mines and traps at strategic locations the team can lure or push the enemy into, and be able to provide buffs and healing to various team members all while evading damage.
---
It’s all 9/9 for the challenge to complete.  I’m not sure I’m going to try tomorrow but it seems like the photos have to be of living things cause I tried doing it on dead stuff and it didn’t work.
---
Honestly, I'd be happy with an option to preview a paint scheme or item!
---
At the end of the encryptid event the Sheepsquatch goes invisible when it dies... I guess that is new?
---
Then block said spammers like you would in an app store game.
---
Just assuming it might be a statue since the bucket list was all static stuff. It could be possible there is an alien hidden in a dark crevice that is random generated event like how fo4 had alien crash and then appear in a cave.
---
All I want is a Bomber Jacket but with a Vault Suit ...that is all
---
Or buy the EXACT same thing for vendors in the game for caps, it’s a secret but it’s called bulk
---
I hope when the bow and arrow stuff drops we get a bunch of mods for all those "ancient" weapons like spears, crossbows, bows and so on that currently have no mods to improve them at all.
---
I don't see any reason for the Watoga Legendary nerf, I feel like it's my fault it happened to begin with because I posted some videos proving they have a green aura and their name instantly get's the Legendary Title. 
---
It was by far the absolute best "sleeper" location to farm Legendaries that I ever found outside of a Nuked Area and now it's a ghost town and there is no reason to visit the location for anything except a couple of Public events that are a waste of time and rewards are laughable.
---
I've spent 80% of my time in game @ Watoga because I felt it was a waste of time to go anywhere else. I know Watoga better than anyone and tried put the word out that it was Nerfed and nobody wanted to hear it and were in complete denial that Bethesda would do this to the game/players. I was absolutely right, no data mining needed, only observation and server jumping numerous times revealed this sad truth. I couldn't believe it either at first, but when you run a 100+ laps around the city and you NEVER see a Legendary...it's the only logical outcome. 
---
I loved when people said "It's just RNG" or "You are just unlucky"... I don't think most of you can comprehend how much time I've spent in that city &amp; it was hilarious to read the responses from the "know it alls" of this sub who are absolutely clueless or just trolling.
---
I never put out false information and was trying to get this Watoga Legendary Nerf some attention weeks ago....The "know it alls" made sure my post got buried in the abyss because of simple ignorance and self-inflated egos from people who can't be told anything without getting upset or offended. You all were wrong, time to swallow that pill now.
---
I plan on being that one asshole who has their camp there just to stop other camps from being placed.
---
It'd just be my camp system. Nothing more.
---
The hotel would have everything I need already.
---
It's perfect because no building to draw ghouls out, no building for the salty farmers to destroy, and I'd have free fast travel to Whitesprings.
---
If you think that's a bad idea for any reason, let me know.  
---
I just can't stand the sound of missile turrets killing my spawns or anyone else's.
---
Don't they usually show multiple pictures of the items which is kinda a preview?
---
nothing wrong with asking donations so you can keep making your video aslong as your fans are ok with it.
---
honestly id rather be a patreon then be forced to watch youtube ads. that way i atleast know the person im subbed to gets the money and not just a miniscule portion of it.
---
Could be a console restriction about how much space a game can store data. Nothing Bethesda could do in this case.
---
Before I can even pull out my gun... it was over. All I wanted to do was have fun and adventure with random people and maybe make a friend but there are THOSE people who have to ruin my faith in humanity.
---
There are many different sightseeing locations at which there is a random corpse with a camera in its hand. Loot him and it will be triggered. I searched on YouTube for "Fallout 76 Last Wish Quest" then there we're different Videos with different locations of corpses. I had to search them ingame for a while. I couldnt find him at Wavy Willards Waterpark even though he ocasionally spawns there. I did find him how ever at the Pioneer Scout Camp.
---
Wow, I been farming SBQ for serums since my first recipe was from SBQ. I had a gut feeling BGS removed the loot from her and finally sad to see its true. Thank you for this information! Are the serum recipes even lootable now from any kill?
---
Road Leathers look great with Leather Armour and most forms of Combat Armour.
---
Brotherhood Fatigues look great with all forms of Combat Armour, some kinds of Leather Armour and the Enclave Scout Armour.
---
Raider Leathers look great with Metal Armour, Raider Armour (which makes sense) and strangely most Combat Armour.
---
I could go on, but what I'm trying to say is that the existing under armours in the game all have a certain look and 'grimyness' that lend themselves to making a set of armour look good. The Special Ops set does not, with the possible exception of Enclave armour.
---
What I expected was an under armour that looked good - that, in fact, looked _better_ than other under armours from the game, because I bought it from the shop. What I got was, in my opinion, not that.
---
it worked for me, on PA and weapons
---
Did you lose items or does the op just mean losing junk because of dying?
---
Check the road map. They are adding a customizable backpack earned through a new quest line that is supposed to add up to 100 Lbs to your carry limit
---
.
---
Thank god for my acrobat armor haha
---
I gotta agree, unless it's a power plant for fusion cores or the three acid workshop there's not much point in using one with the current risk of disconnecting or crashing and not having a way to reconnect to your previous server.
---
I had to pick up my junk after dying, yes, so I think they mean that - I did not notice anything missing either when it shifted me just a bit to the side or even when it fasttravelled me to another location
---
Yes, you aren't wrong in that. I mean a preview like where I could 'try it on' kinda thing. Actually view it on my character and see what it looked like before taking the plunge and spending atoms.
---
Ah, so wearing goats or acrobats legendary/ power armor then this bug will be a lot of fun, who needs fast traveling loading screens when you can fly lol.
---
True, because they don't show the sides, or you get the outfit then notice the clipping in the hands or hats.
---
I saw someone mention that the bug didn't happen while they were in power armor but goat legs should help keep you alive yeah. I kinda like the random location aspect of it tbh :D
---
Yep happening to me and cannot find the damn thing! Everyone else gets it fine but I can't! I search everywhere, I got it this morning but not right now. So annoying!
---
Nuclear Winter seems more like it would be a prequel sort of thing based on the dialogue, especially given the Enclave would be very aware of the outside world.
---
Sure, but very rare exceptions are just that: Exceptions. The rule still prevents this 99% of the time. Let me guess, this guy had a god-roll 3 star bloodied explosive shotgun given to him by his alt account? You weren't armored or running Fireproof? Seriously, people need to quit holding up rare exceptions in extreme situations as statistically significant. You sound like a bunch of anti-vaxers and flat-earthers trying to build a worldview on single arguments instead of the big picture that matters.
---
Its nukashine without loading screens lol.
---
Or they could change it were perk cards effect stash weight too and if you remove perk cards then your stash will go over 800.
---
It's intended to be discovered exploring, but we all know no one has patience for that. Server hop for life 😂
---
Last one I experienced was in Beta.  I legitimately thought they were removed from the game.
---
A Dark room :-)
---
Now THAT is very interesting... Please elaborate, as I am trying to give accurate information. Is it bugged and currently unobtainable? Or just no longer in the "Forbidden Knowledge" loot pool? Where did you get this information so I can reference and check it? Sorry, I'm just trying to not fuck up and give out false stuff. I'll happily credit your contribution and make a correction to my post. :)
---
I think this is what Bethesda want : you are a casual player, you are wandering across Appalachia and then you find a camera. Hop ! New quest ! "Cool ! I don't see this coming !"  
---
We, the "hardcore" players, who are waiting for every update, are server hopping because we don't have anything to do, other than discovering the new items and quest. Bethesda know that we eventually find the camera (because of posts like this - thank you OP !) but we are not the target.
---
maybe you guys can focus on fixing explosive weapons/buffing explosive weapons as well as giving Boxing Gloves and Knuckles an overhaul? The one-handed crap on them looks so...bad.
---
I don't run them and was called a noob for not running them. So you guys should make up your mind. Which is it?
---
so been able to buy repair kits from the AS, that makes it possible for you to fix your gear anytime/anywhere its not giving you an advantage over the player that doesnt buy them?
---
I know who he is, you should look up who owns the place he works. They can't fire him when he owns the company.
---
Yeah, I forgot about that.
---
Reddit is a little minority here. Upvotes means nothing. Reddit is useful for read arguments, but no for support them for the amount of people talking about them. Remember, Reddit is a echo chamber.
---
sounds more like you got the mod for it then.
---
That's good, but as the guy before you posted said "it's a slippery slope".
---
Was supposed to be 100% cosmetics only, then talk of Repair Kits, and now a weapon out of no where.
---
Just has me concerned that this is the beginning of them 'testing the waters' with what we will accept in the Atom Shop. I'd bet money if they don't get huge backlash from this weapon then there will very likely be more to follow. Currently the only one is identical to the in-game version as far as stats go and just has a new look. 
---
That I'm... not fine with, but okay with. Technically it's still only a cosmetic at that point, but if they add any extra effects or something then we will have to really start worrying about Pay-to-Win. Hope they're smart enough to not go that far.
---
We don't KNOW know yet but given the teaser images on the preview screen it's going to be some sort of slapdash cobbled together vending machine that we build at our CAMP and load up with junk and set prices. It'll also probably function somewhat like the fermenter where the stuff exists in our stash until it's sold.
---
Adding an edit after getting called out is obvious. Its why you have the edit astericks which gives you away.
---
No no, you're right. My apologies
---
I thought mine were broken because I had explored a number of places before those challenges were in place. So I made a new character and made a beeline for a few spots. Discovered one, got a challenge, cool. Went to the next spot, confirmed the exploration, no challenge. What the hell.
---
It's still really early days for 76 - maybe when they get a few of the actual, serious issues sorted out, they can afford to spend time on very niche quality of life stuff like this :)
---
ROFL, so you don't understand the game, without needing gunsmith 5 therr is zero reason for them to run 5 intelligence. Without needing the gunsmith perk you can repair everything to 200 with only 3 points. Thus giving them freed up special points.
---
All hoarders should go back to fo4 !
---
The bucket list quest is done. I was wondering if you found other side quests on different corpses
---
The whole thing is one big dam boo hoo Bethesda please look st me! I need attention boo hoo!
---
Your opinion that Bethesda doesn’t care about the players is one big childish opinion. NOT A FACT. You entitled feelings aren’t facts. 
---
Here’s a fact. You should delete this. I also suggest some personal therapy. That last part is my opinion. But it’s a good one.
---
Best Love Story ever
---
Indeed. It's a nice way to start the quest if you're starting a new character NOW, but for people with pretty much no other quests left (save for golfer ghouls) roaming around for hours to get to play the new content or resorting to server hopping is really frustrating. Maybe they saw how quickly everyone played through Lying Lowe and wanted to make this one last even a bit longer by adding randomness?
---
Randomness is never a substitute for content, just a placeholder for more detailed mechanics.
---
It takes a lot of effort to make new and unique skins that people want to buy that gets purchased exactly once per account. 
---
On the other hand, you put some effort into making a repair kit once that can be purchased multiple times over indefinitely. 
---
In a way I don't blame them for wanting to develop a recurring income stream but the history from horse armour through to the controversy with Steam paid mods to Creation Club to mtx in 76 and Blades, it speaks volumes to Bethesda's morals and ethics.
---
We just have to accept the facts that without some regulatory intervention, this is the kind of company that Bethesda is and will be for the foreseeable future.
---
the Irony,
---
bitching about a group off people becuase they(we) dont agree withyou, what makes you then if not an other millenial per your post. 
---
P.S thank you for paying for my future content. lmao
---
Yup. Can be triggered simply by having the camera equip and doing any emote.
---
No. It seems they are releasing certain heads at each update. Was wondering if they released any new ones. Only have 5 unlocked so far.
---
HAHAHAHA.. just choked on my coffee laughing.
---
I was wondering the same thing myself actually. Last week we had 2 new events that unlocked the windigo head end the recipe for mystery meat pie but I was thinking that every Tuesday going forward we get maybe another 2 of these unsolved events where we could then unlock more things but apparently it looks like I was wrong. I hope someone can prove that they're out there!
---
The robot guided quest schtick is getting old.
---
I don't even know what repair kits are. Got the game with an xbox one x and havnt played in 2 months maybe
---
tell me  a company that does not do that, 
---
i will wait!!!!!!
---
Oh shit. Yeh it is
---
I personally hope it is a sort of "Delivery system" where you pay caps, and a caps shipping fee if you do not find the owner's camp to buy directly from them (10% increase in price) if you are at someone else's camp you do not pay the fee. but only for their items
---
No but i could imagine that there will be some in the Future that have different lenses as reward
---
It is a bad thing from a balance point of view.
---
Drolls with excitement, good data mining man
---
I don't know if this is going for anyone else but I have been taking pictures of dead things after I've killed them and they do count towards taking pictures challenge.
---
I.. thought it was a hat?  :(
---
Huh what is this?
---
True,true.
---
Challenges have been bugged from the start. I'm missing out on way more atoms because half of the entry-level challenges are bugged for me (eg fully levelling a perk card). It's even more infuriating if you keep in mind that the challenges are the officialy provided free way to earn atoms.
---
It was always intended to be the dead tourist you had to find. Nothing to do with making it last longer. Just the chosen way to start the quest and why you're on that bucket list. I really don't think it's that hard to find or time consuming. I've hopped way more trying to trigger events haha!
---
Post like these get completely ignored by the community managers. You're better of posting a shit picture about your camp and then including this info after
---
It's a rad storm. I've actually noticed them a lot more since patch 8 show maybe they up to the frequency
---
Okay,
---
Digging in to 10 gears when setting up three Junks wouldn’t be an issue if i didn’t get shat out of the server every hour. 
---
But I am glad you haven’t had to deal with people swinging through to flog workshops or just grief you, I’m sure it has something  to do with your level. And while I’m at it sorry for wanting to hold three workshops to farm the resources I need and to have fast travel stops. 
---
I didn’t realise that the problem was me, not Bethesda servers shitting out on everyone. Maybe the problem is people like you. 
---
Good input mate.
---
I can’t add ya because of your privacy settings! Feel free to send me one. My psn is sadluna ☺️
---
It’ll launch you so fast and far sometimes that you’ll still get a loading screen basically saying the game can’t keep up. And other times the game crashes entirely. It’s fun to mess around with though!
---
*That's a no from me dawg.*
---
I fought two queens since the Patch yesterday and each time I've gotten 2 of the improved repair kits. To be honest I'm never going to use them unless I'm in that fight because it's the only time my weapon ever breaks. Other than that though I use weapon artisan and fix it good to get to 200% durability so using them makes no sense
---
Awesome
---
Now that's a good idea.
---
Good call. Sometimes it's easy to make simple tasks more complex in this game
---
I'm did this today to give it ago, I endend up from flatwoods to lewisberg in lickety split (and a crap load of freezing and stuttering) and I didn't die. Instant fast travel.
---
I'm holding a workshop right now.
---
Just saw a post that when the sheep scwatch is eventually added it will drop them as well
---
Nice, jealous of you for going to that concert! :)
---
Sorry if I seem stupid for asking this but how does datamining actually work?
---
I’ve tried googling it but I just don’t really understand what it’s saying. Does anybody have a simple explanation on how it works and how it’s so easy to get lots of information from companies like in this post?
---
dafuq ?
---
Biggest bug right now is with the camera. Just equip it and do an emote to go flying across the map.
---
It's all good, thanks for doing that. :) 
---
If we all work together, we can hopefully get these issues fixed.
---
which one is wwr armor?
---
I hope so. I was thinking the same thing. They always like adding stuff without telling us.
---
I find a bunch of tar berries in the cranberry bog at many of the glades that are marked by trees on the map. There is usually water in most of them and in them you do find tar berries alongside normal non diseased cranberries
---
I’m level 25, happy to tag along with ya for quests. I don’t have a mic either so that’s not a problem. My psn is sadluna 🙂
---
weapon weight reduction
---
Weapon weights are reduced by 20%. Wearing five pieces places you at the maximum 90% reduction.
---
Any dumb metric you wanna base that statement on?
---
Weapon weight reduction legendary effect Im assuming.
---
Now thats an idea.
---
It'd be nice, if they removed the items from the legendary table, or at least put a slot for legendary mods on them. A little extra damage on a syringer would be cool. As for the drill, make it be able to repair your camp and/or work like a ripper.
---
You'd keep finding tapes saying stuf like "Fu*k you ni**er wh*re" all over the place. So no, bad idea
---
My money is on you getting a vending machine at your camp, like the ammo / medical vendors and then place your camp in a high traffic area.
---
I’m happy for you
---
*chuckles and lights a cigarette under my fedora, turning away to be silhouetted against the light of the moon at my office window as I gaze up at the stars*
---
You don’t find the Flatwoods Monster. It finds *you*. When you least expect it, it’ll appear.
---
I’ve encountered it several times in the Forest and once in the Savage Divide, but I think it can turn up pretty much anywhere.
---
Couldn’t*
---
So because a few people will make stupid ones then no? That’s happens in every game,
---
Your tag made me spit my coffee. Thank you for brightening my morning! Hahaha
---
Keep Zealots. I could see that being fun for chaff clearing in a nuke zone.
---
I'm going to blow a few of your facts away. 
---
Bag-gate. Those package products are put together by the Marketing department. At some point they found out they couldn't get the canvas bags they were expecting. You or me don't know why. So they replaced it with a crappy nylon bag and didn't tell customers this was happening. This has nothing to do with the team that makes the game. When the shit hit the fan, some higher up at Bethesda told them to make it right. That's a department in a company making a fuck up, and someone higher up telling them to do right. 
---
You can't prove that a single player *never once* requested repair kits. I've seen people request a variety of things to be put in the Atomic shop that weren't cosmetic only. So people have requested non cosmetic things be put in the Atomic Shop. And I bet you only read reddit. There's several other places that people go to post ideas and suggestions about the game. Unless you can prove that no one has ever publicly asked for them, it's not a fact.   
---
How is the Atomic Shop a fact that Bethesda hates it's players? (by the way, if you can't use the correct name, it's generally a sign that you are reading more about the game, than actually playing). All you are basically saying is that because it exists, thats a fact about Bethesda not caring. HOW? No you just hate those kind of things, because as a gamer that is really just a follower of *other people's opinions*, you've decided that it's bad. How totally unoriginal of you.  
---
Never patches any of their games. Which you posted on a day they had a patch. Which makes you sound very stupid. Now there's a fact for you.
---
I'm new to reddit... looking for fallout 76 marketplace to sell legendary and get good reasonable pricing to make good deals.
---
Any advice or suggestions?
---
No idea why you got downvoted. This is 100% what would happen haha.
---
Crazy thing...it is already in game but only available for workshops. Makes no sense.
---
On a PS4 Pro and having same issues. Each update has been smoother until the last one. Now in the horizon I see blocks of color while textures slowly load in.
---
 Bethesda is creating a superior gaming experience for players willing to pay them more for it. if this is not P2W then what is it?
---
If you’re referring to the camera launch thing, I’m sure they’re well aware.
---
Clearly gonna sell fusion cores in the atom shop! /s
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but to become a master you mustn't use /s.
---
*I'm a human being, and this action was performed manually.*
---
Which would both be dropped in survival mode as they are aid items.
---
Stealth isn't super useful in the bigger events, but sure someone could go that way. It also breaks too often for my liking.
---
You could crit-fish, this is true. That at least is usable in nearly all situations. Not as good with pistols as w/ a SMG to my mind, but everyone has their opinion.
---
best guess player camps will appear on the map and you will have to travel to their camp to trade, like with the  med/ammo vending machines at train stations, a trading hub in whitesprings where you could just use a terminal to trade with any players camp on the server would be best rather than spending a lot of caps travel around individual camps
---
Good idea!  I think it’s actually marketable too.  Have you entered it as feedback on their official ticket site?  Please do if you haven’t.  That will get it into their system and at least have a shot (no pun intended, lol).
---
Yeah, but you can craft them and drink them extremely easy and then just not carry huge quantities of purified water etc with you.
---
I'm hoping that since everyone is focused on the camera challenge right now that in A-day or 2 once that cools down and people have gotten that taking care of Maybe someone stumbles across something. I think someone posted on here that the last quest for the wendigo head pointed you towards some town but I honestly don't remember which one
---
I hopped for a hour also and couldn't get it either so my buddy said go to colonel Kelly monument,  wait there for 10 minutes then hop again , so I did that and it was there on next server hop lol not sure if conincidental but that worked for me .
---
a sort of post apocalypse amazon, we already have those cargo bots flying around
---
There one in my server if you're on xbox
---
I have 5 different weight reduction pieces but they all seemed to be working yesterday. Maybe unequip all, reload, and then put back on?
---
Any info on vault 51 in the forest and a way to access the presidents room in the enclave bunker?
---
Mine was crashing and I rebooted everything, including my router, several days ago.  No crashes since.  PC.
---
Ok thanks for the tip
---
I’ll be on in 20 mins gt is milkmonst3r626
---
Which is why he suggested making filters. They're not dropped on death. Collect filtered water from any puddle then immediately consume it. 
---
There's endurance perks to offset the rads and disease chances of drinking unclean water as well, but OPs suggestion doesn't require any perks and risks nothing on death.  Personally, i would just drink dirty water and eat corpses in survival.
---
I have played since beta day one and got to the enclave within the first 3 days after beta. Still never seen it. Not saying your wrong, I never met anybody that had it or never seen it on the bazaar for sale.
---
I would pay for a quality DLC. I just don't trust that it would be quality
---
I think in your photogallery.
---
I've been saying I want this for a while, though mostly just in general whining to my friends not anywhere Bethesda can see. Yay! My mind beam complaints worked, clearly!
---
I have two actually! One is anti armor bash damage and the other is nocturnal. It helps a ton and with basher 2 it’s even stronger
---
Us Europeans meet people from other countries all the time.
---
I doubt I'll ever use them as well. I use the same perks for repair and I run max level GunSmith + Luck of the draw 1, and I don't remember the last time something broke in combat.
---
Gunsmith doesnt need to stay on now when in action. None of them do. Those perks are to make armor more durable. Repair kits makes durability not matter. You just throw another kit at the armor and enjoy not having the worry of armor repair. It frees up all those perks for better things.
---
ok thanks, i mainly use power armour so is this a legendary effect or a mod?
---
This is the most fun bug since the headless glitch.
---
It's really fun trying to get around using it. Just point yourself left in the direction you want to go and cross your fingers.
---
It's an unreliable, unpredistable fast travel system and I love it.
---
a couple of notable items in these perks; 
---
\- briefcase: repair kits or briefcase nukes or G.E.C.K? 
---
\- Walking Arsenal: the animation includes the bow and arrow, is this the start of the introduction of the exotic weapons? 
---
\- Hack and seek: we already have hacking perks so is this like pharma farma, an ability to search terminals for extra info? 
---
\- Frog legs: is it like the goat legs perk, so the ability to jump higher without marsupial? this is particularly interesting as the map has been designed with normal and marsupial jump heights in mind already so is there other areas that will only be accessible through the use of both? do they already exist or will they be added?
---
\- Fashion finder: outfit/outfit plan finding perk, possibly operating like the homing beacon system? 
---
all guesses at this point but interesting to see how these will play out
---
Spent half an hour server hopping but no dice. You may be right and it can be just how it's designed for some other reason. Still, I think putting new content behind randomness gates is seldom a good design decision. I don't claim to know the thinking that went into making the quest start like this, but would like to know what was the main reason to put a separately advertised feature behind such an obscure mechanic. 
---
At the very least they could've added a guaranteed tourist at the watoga spawn so you could still run into it at any point, but if you'd reached that far just get to the content without retreading old paths for hours or resorting to server hopping until you luck out.
---
Not trying to be negative, or come across as demanding. I'm just having trouble seeing the rationale behind this design decision from a late-game player's perspective (still consider myself a casual).
---
DOOMGUY WANTS TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION
---
Team based dungeons fam
---
You need to have the plans for the assaultron head in order to apply the skin.  It won’t work if you just have the weapon itself.
---
It seems like it makes more sense for it to be a ping for items in the world (like magazines, etc) or possibly a search function (like for chems and ammo)
---
😂👍
---
I got disconnect from server sorry. Good luck!
---
As a raider, i should not have a pip boy and would like a sack instead
---
Probably just lag Chief, it happens to me when I'm laggy
---
But Kelly monument is where I found him
---
Yeah but dude the thing is that they can do both kinds of repairs repairing one thing is cheap but if all your stuff breaks that’s a shit ton of material
---
I took pics of dead sloth, didn’t trigger, same with a snally and brahmin in the forest.  And made sure the top right had the name in the photo otherwise it doesn’t register what you’re taking pic of.  You must have a horseshoe in your butt!  Haha
---
I agree. As soon as I saw the repair kits available I threw my PS4 out the window and it got run over by a FedEx truck. I have since given up video games and sold my house and now live under a bridge in a cardboard box where Bethesda cannot get to me.
---
Probably not. :( The design choices of the two games is to purposefully do what they do to make the gameplay more distinct. Maybe with mods, one day!
---
Got one thing wrong. You don’t need to emote and then aim with the camera. You only need to have the camera in hand and then emote. It’ll send you flying to your left every time, well left and forward. For example, if you’re facing north and emote with the camera in hand, you’ll land northwest of your location. You can use this strategically if you have armor and/or perk to reduce fall damage.
---
You'd probably feel a lot more than lighter after not shitting for half a year
---
Robotics Expert hacking it makes it a base defender...
---
YES THIS.  Bloodied Grognaks hitting level 1-5 and it not killing anything or registering damage.  Did something go weird in patch?  Nothing else laggy for me but this.
---
L      ag
---
It’s point is that it baaas when fired
---
I'm sure they were speechless with joy.
---
Wtf this game is just all over the place.
---
I edited my post immediately after posting it, never saw your response. If you still prefer half-assed one-liners over a real counter-argument, I'm done wasting my time here, dear troll.
---
From ingame
---
Open your map ... then open the left menu (not the social one)
---
Then click the option Photo Gallery =)
---
May the pink be with me then...i got this feeling it just won't happen eheh.
---
I'm missing almost all discover locations atoms, yet all map is discovered.
---
yeah i started with the beta as well but lost a month not long after launch when the internet went out, i was told by 2 different people that the plans where there, it could have been a bug that only some people got or the plans got added by mistake for a short time, it's just strange the plans didn't get put up with the update that added the others to the vendors
---
Your strength effects melee stats. It's like a +5% increase to the base damage per point iirc. I'd just get the weapons and check what your damage is.
---
Briefcase bloodhound helps you find more nuke codes hopefully.
---
Yeah I read an article on how to get the camera that came out before laying lowe which is also how i found out it was delayed. Also I'm lvl 98 260+ hrs so not a new character. Also a casual and I like retreading old paths. Always something I haven't seen or forgot about. Each to their own, I really don't think it's a big issue. I get people want it now, but it's not going anywhere. I didn't even finish the bucket list right away. Just so I have something to do later tonight haha.
---
Loading into the game when I'm at my camp takes so long. If I try to pull my gun out before it loads my camp (it's not in a very safe place without my turrets loaded in) all I see is the parts of my gun. 
---
It's more annoying than game breaking but it is annoying.
---
iya a legemdary effeect
---
 if it was in the game somewhere I'd go get it but because it's an atom shop item I just don't see the point of getting it.
---
The wetsuit and BoS officer both look better and they are black too.
---
Both of those probs have better stats once maxed aswell than this item, it just seems like a waste of atoms
---
I am pretty sure I found the Holotape mentioning the "arrival of our first guests" the other day on a mountainside. At least some of the dialogues seem pretty familiar to me. Can it be they've already been in the game for some time?
---
Your talking about the fog room with every item in the game from 4 correct?
---
I think you’ve overestimated the percentage of people who would go to the effort of leaving holotapes relative to the portion of those that would do so for the sole purpose of saying stupid shit. 
---
They set up an entirely seperate game mode to seperate griefers, that should give you an indication
---
You can do that with renaming. No need for all this other stuff. With my power armor I just put "PA" in front of the name and they all stay together.
---
Found mine the first try at the waterpark. There is a guy laying dead near a car in the parking lot
---
akarnokd made quite a nice website for this purpose.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bemnww/weapon_damage_calculator_and_comparator_webpage/
---
Didn’t work, tried both.  😢
---
Same. I've never actively collected Atoms and I think I accrued around 6,000 before I started spending them.
---
thank you
---
Buy repair kits because they apparently make you a God in this game. No but seriously climb towers to find new locations, I tend to scrap ALOT I'm like sandford and son over here. Tag scrap that you find useful to you at the time to make it easier to watch your weight. Find a couple of guns you love and start moving perks around to add to their damage and such. For me I absolutly LOVE to try and do the daily quests and weekly quests it adds an element to the game that let's you explore more. Dont forget to get that extra XP from being well rested. Good luck out there !
---
Thought I would let everyone know, I let a diseased strangler mirelurk beat on me for over half an hour and did not get a disease of any kind.  The only other mirelurk I could think of was a diseased mirelurk spawn and that did the trick, I was in Wendigo Cave with 2 other people, they also got the woopsies from the diseased mirelurk spawn.  I hope this helps someone:-)
---
Didn’t count for me.
---
This has been happening too on my PA on ps4, it's super annoying and gets on your nerves very quickly.
---
So much in fact I've for goed wearing it for the time being, hope they fix it soon
---
It’s because they couldn’t find a way to put the unique sound effects on the old assaultron head due to its model sound sequence program having been ripped from FO4, and because it wasn’t fully altered from that it didn’t work with skins and alterations.
---
It’s really a skin anyway given it’s just an updated model with a new sound effect... stats are actually a bit worse despite being the same (I think it’s solid state, so perks and mutations don’t effect it).
---
Also no legendary modifier.... so it’s just a pretty party trick to scare people with rather then a weapon. Seriously a regular took 2 hits on a high level mutant... same level of the imposter head took 10 shots to kill a similar mutant.
---
It’s hilarious how people don’t look into the facts and get mad for stupid reasons.
---
I ended up finding it and staying an extra hour to get other people on that server. Dumb.
---
You get the plans to make ultracite pa from a pc in Fort defiance
---
It will probably will involve the atom shop, where you can only buy things for Atoms.....haha
---
JK :)
---
I was in that group. It was pretty high up - I don't think anyone reached the loot that I saw.
---
I won't use my laser towards the end also. There was also a normal sb that showed up soon after and I shot upwards with my ultracite laser and the sb vaporised in mid air.
---
Weird shit.
---
They shoulda made it static or gave some indication of where it was gonna be like a missing poster for ansel that you can find statically or have in your camp that makes you go to his last known location or something along those lines
---
I’m gonna buy one every time I feel like it just to piss you all off... I make almost 200+ atoms off daily and weekly events alone so one a day or week should be fine...
---
Let the rage consume you
---
&gt;As a roleplayer, I love to imagine my character as a survivor of the Wasteland, not a Vault Dweller,
---
 Then you have to role play without a map, without an inventory, Without a radio, without somewhere to keep track of your quests, ect ect.
---
 All those things are done through the pip boy.
---
[Yeah](https://imgur.com/MELV0sS.jpg)
---
Damn. I tried taking phots at the bunker number 2 but nothing. At this point either someone datamines something,or we hope the challenge unlock by taking photos of other creatures
---
Aliens do not exist in game as of yet, but gamefiles for Aliens have been in the game since launch. they seem to be coming in several different types including Captain, and Star Admiral.
---
Nocturnal is ass, it's probably my least desired legengary prefix.
---
Also that stupid thing when you load into the world and some quests are not appearing and you need to hop servers, so annoying.
---
Same collected camera quest and everything was running smoothly for  then suddenly Mr bloatfly said not to day buddy!
---
Ok it’s all right
---
Level up cards that have 3 stars. That challenge  works now
---
It would be funny if you turned on a ticker on the pipboy. Peoples messages would scroll across the bottom of the screen. Id enjoy that.
---
Bye bye don’t let the door hit you on the way out!
---
Happened to me last night.
---
Upvoting for self awareness!
---
It's almost as if they didn't think this through too much... Or test it too much... Sounds familiar?
---
I don’t think that’s what he was asking
---
I have a locked room that has my generator and decon shower inside. I usually open it up if somebody is at my camp. The rest is totally open.
---
How are they "shoving repair kits down your throat"?
---
Where does it say you HAVE to buy or use them?
---
How is it a competitive advantage when using one in a fight would get you killed instantly before you can leave the pipboy screen?
---
Stop going on about something that literally makes no difference to the game. After a few level ups you can get perks that work better than repair kits so all they do is save you resources for a worse repair?
---
There's a lot we could complain about in this game so why are we arguing about this non-event?
---
Tbf he could be a behemoth
---
I think Bethesda should start selling weapon and armor skin one time use kits which will improve max item durability upon use.
---
Or just ask or look for posts of people on here saying they have him
---
I do drop ammo, plans and health items into the church overseer's stash too. It is much reliable than a paper bag on the floor. (Interestingly, not many people I encounter on servers did this, I could have used the extra ammo when I started a new character.)
---
Those repair perks are redundant if you have a stack of repair kits. Dont need to worry about durability now. So repair kit guy now has those 5 gunsmith perks to put into damage perks. Gotta pay for the advantage.
---
??
---
I'm not going to be able to provide anything better.
---
You can’t drop them
---
Absolutely. Any game mechanic that forces you to hop servers is broken. Considering the achievements are on a timer, we don’t have much choice if we want to get them done.
---
No new info yet.
---
I’m hopping that the vending machines you can put in your camp are all linked, so you can see from there what everyone is selling, kinda like a grand exchange. Also fingers crossed it has it own weight limit so your wares in there aren’t taking up the stash limit!
---
I've been doing sheepsquach non stop since the update no issues with bugs other than it being incurable when you kill it ypu have to wait a bit but it does turn into a metal pile and reappear. I'm on Xbox.
---
I waded through a swamp of Repair Kit Bitching and time wasters to agree with you.... and I’m stealing your bike.
---
Atoms should be rewarded based on difficulty levels, like claiming a workshop would be 50, fertile soil about 10,.. etc
---
I found an AA Auto Grenade that I gave to my wife about a week ago, she has since gone full on demolitions/explosives after using it against her first SBQ (listening to her cackle as she stealth grenades things is wonderful =).
---
No! You must have hope! Stealth Archer build is the master playstyle that will transcend all games.
---
Here is an [image](https://i.redd.it/f229p35jprm21.jpg) with all the paints.
---
Also, here is the original post.
---
Still might be something that happens to a degree. We have verdant seasons, we might see famines too where open world crops and animals pop less.
---
Yes we NEED this
---
This is why I leave my toon somewhere safe with a knife equipped and swap over to my rifle as soon as I am sure my game won't freeze trying to bring up the pip boy.
---
really the repair kits are kind of silly and actually under power people who use them as the 200% repair abilities actually give you a boost to weapon stats making you less competitive - honestly the only people I could even see using these are people who use 1 weapon and don't have any perks to keep said weapons durability loss in check
---
Now we just need craftable pepto bismol /+1 endurance,- rads from eating, cures one random ass disease
---
We're thinking nuclear winter.
---
Rainbows and unicorns
---
Tbh, If I can do it, I'll do it ( waiting for the bag x)
---
And I already play without radio :'o
---
That was my thought also. Other than that I couldn’t see hanging on to them. Thanks
---
yeh i finally.got.them working..i.had to.unequip them..log.out and.log back in then equip them...thank the overseer it worked
---
So many new bugs
---
I hope one day I can get a nice legendary fat man. Apparently I missed a really nice on last week for a survival challenge. I was irked when I found that out.
---
"... dont forget super duper..."
---
did not work for me. Likewise the ammo smith perk was not calculated.
---
The only thing that got me was that I had 48 instead of 40 molotov coctails, but I still had to do 40 pieces.
---
For the bottles: biv and the two student houses were sufficient.
---
I went on tour in adventure mode and then just crafted in survival.
---
So Everytime the game updates files, often times there are scraps of things being worked on in the backend that wouldn't be visible in world yet but things like new scripts that reference currently inactive quests or point to models not yet in the game etc. So similar to how most mods were created by going and digging into these files and finding new ways to use them, currently lots of people are spending the time to do that now for the sole purpose of seeing what new content might be in the pipeline moving forward.
---
Craft/scrap 20 melee and ranged weapons, craft 40 energy ammo, explosive ammo, and molotovs.
---
Yeah, not sure how exactly happened to me. Logged in, switched to it and it had all the .50 Ball ammo:
---
[https://youtu.be/wp5Rr-XXTDk](https://youtu.be/wp5Rr-XXTDk)
---
You can have multiple characters on the same account. Up to five, I think.
---
 The guarantee is nice, but my troubleshooters 90% reduced weight fat man makes gutsy go bye bye
---
I'd be interested in getting into the white springs conference rooms while we're at it
---
Wait, what's this about toolkits?
---
Not just you.  Also why does my melee weapon not swing more often than not when in vats? It's like it gets stuck and won't swing unless I exit vats
---
I’ve experienced many rad storms.
---
Oh but the guarantee is instigating. Would love that for clearing out mods at SBQ &amp; imposter. I normally have 10 mini-nukes on me. If they did double damage, that'd be even funnier.
---
yeah that was added later, you get the X-01 armor plans form a terminal next to the vendor in the bunker but you can't get the mods plans at the minute 
---
you get the ultracite mod plans from killing the SBQ
---
From last couple patch, the target hit box has become much smaller. Essentially you must center the target before successful hit. And hit distance becomes calculated &amp;  fixed (if you are too close, the melee hit will miss. And if you are too far, the melee hit will miss too).
---
Didn’t you post this yesterday?
---
That’s what I ended up doing. Although when I sold it the damage was 504 at that moment. Thanks
---
This too! I was ok with the vats thing but even using normal attacks won't even do damage now. 
---
There's two choices of build, how does BGS fuck one of them up this bad
---
Yeah but it didn’t get enough traction so I thought I’d try again
---
Hey man you need to repair your gear,
---
Have you considered getting some of those new eepair kits ?
---
Any evidence of This? I don't take random information from reddit comments anymore
---
I'm on today
---
It's better than whitesprings farming imo
---
Your forgetting the problem that other people shoot at the enemies dropping them, and if someone is using a explosive gun and the radius even slightly damages a enemy instigating is worthless, hence why instigating and explosive don’t mix for wave clearing
---
Sure, but also a lot of people just flat out ignore the mobs in both events.
---
I have two xbox $ two TVs.
---
Did they win?
---
Adding confirmation as well... the “impact sound” is heard signifying contact, along with rending an image of tissue damage on the adversary, yet, no damage bar movement to the target.
---
I refuse to accept that there’s 4 builds, I deliberately ditched my OP vats crit auto staggering handmade build for a far inferior  vats crit 44. Pistol build, the crux of course is I still have sent assassin but I find myself killing just as many people and often cleaning up the “best build in the game”
---
That's how my wife and I have ours sorted.
---
How is gaming at an all time low? Show your work. 
---
I don’t know how old you are, but gaming is better now than it has ever been. I’ve been gaming since the Atari 2600, when you’d pay $40-$60 for a game that, once you knew the layout, you could complete in as little as 30 seconds. Now you spend the same amount of money and get at least a few hours of entertainment, if not much more. I’m ~240 hours into this game, with no intentions of stopping. Tell me how that’s ‘an all time low’.
---
That's not how it happened this time, but good to know. This was just me running around in Hazmat suit, then I noticed the "&lt;1" rads notification thingy had gone away, so I said screw it and got naked. Lo and behold, it worked
---
But you can just jetpack there with barely any effort? 🤔
---
Exactly. I run around 15% health so the vats lockup is really annoying, it always happens at the worst times.
---
Warning, possible unironic use of Chad detected.
---
C ya.
---
I remember them saying something about that being patched recently. Maybe in patch 8 notes.
---
So you're saying you've experienced this too?
---
No issues here, did it last night (Xbox)
---
So your fat man, fair enough right since it’s explosion deals full damage to anything caught inside it, so you don’t need to worry about your splash damaging enemies arround your target since your splash is also full damage, it’s really just instigating explosive that are bad, let’s use the example your farming whitesprings, you shoot 1 enemy and deal double damage thanks to instigating  and your crappy 4 damage that splashes only to everything in a 3m radius also does double, yaaayyy u now killed one enemy and did 10 damage to everything else, completely destroying your main legendary effect as you can no longer get your double damage
---
We're talking about melee here bro.
---
I know but I don't use a jet pack. Plus it felt like much more of an achievement doing it without one.
---
Was this in the patch notes or an observation? I don't recall seeing that, but I only glanced over them.
---
Yeah it's bodged as hell. I'm almost certain I've unlocked *every* fast travel node, and I'm missing something like half of the "discover x" challenges.
---
Interestingly, discovering places again on another character did push some of the numbers up. I don't know how it's working but it's truly Bethesda'd
---
Almost exactly what I came to say. Though his argument on this point is also valid. People will ruin anything they can simply because they can however I do believe for the vast majority of players it would just be something neat to do and provide an extremely unique aspect into the game.
---
Not what OP asked
---
Correct, same as you outlined. Swing, hit, no damage bar movement. Occasionally takes 3 hits to register damage.
---
Fair enough
---
The friendly fire perk that states "fire weapons" no longer works on the shiskebab either. It randomly got changed a few patches ago with no mention.
---
Weapons implies more than one not just a flamer so I assume it's just another bug they aren't responding to.
---
Explosive weapons still drop.
---
Yeah, I got you. Wonder what a two shot mirv would be like. Bet that would chug the framerate.
---
Idk 1000 caps? That's way more than a vendor would give you. I'd honestly love to have that gun. You on PC?
---
Yes! That's exactly it! You've summed it up far more eloquently than I
---
Currently I have the owlet, radstag, wendigo, wolf, and yao guai
---
Have you played the game from the release date? The change is very obvious if you play as melee. Melee built, feel free to chime in :)
---
I also have a melee build, a 2 handed one (bloodied grog and AA super sledge) and a unarmed (Bloodied powerfist and AA DCG) And I can confirm I’ve noticed the change, particular ywith the hitbox of the DCG and super sledge, comparing them to my powerfist and gorg it’s laughable how little times they hit. On the topic that I brought up I’m intrigued what you think is the 2nd good melee build if were only talking melee and not ranged. As IMO my 2 handed build is only useful with PA and in PVE While the unarmed is best for PVP and cavalier armour although the 2 handed one struggles in pvp the unarmed is still very VERY competent in pve at times 2 or 3 tapping Scorchbeasts etc
---
Good thing it’s early, my late day alcohol driven rants about the game can get pretty spirited. 🤣
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one, thanks for confirming
---
Considering the huge stink people made about super mutants being in 76, I don’t think they’d like Spore Carriers in 76 wither
---
Got kicked off. I'll try you tomorrow 😄
---
Damn, y'all salty as hell
---
I've been playing since day one. It wasn't like this a week ago, or even yesterday...
---
Like i tell everybody whinging about having their forest camp blown up. That's prime raid turf. 
---
Offhand I can think of a few reasons someone would camp blast at the overseers camp. 
---
1. The random spawn as others have pointed out. 
---
2. Frustration if their camp couldn't be placed. 
---
3. Newbies to pvp cutting their teeth in adventure. You were likely the bounty rack up for them to bait bounty hunters. 
---
4. Raider role play, the forest should be full of responders and vault dwellers, the most "civilian" factions. Raiders would have hunted in these areas. "Down the mountain to prey, up the mountain to stay." 
---
And save yourself the headache, if its expensive to repair like the decontamination shower, move your camp an inch and everything gets stored and repaired.
---
Well as it happens I had a TS 10% damage while aiming, Faster reload mirv launcher I sold a while back, it was glorious seeing 16 mini nukes rain from the sky, each one doing 600+ damage for the right builds, was truly, a sight to behold
---
I have in my server now my ign tadeo1
---
I mean there's melee or there's range. 
---
Count with me - melee - one 
---
Ranged - two. 
---
Two builds. 
---
One of them is broke
---
Dying Light.
---
I've got a beserkers LMG. I think it's 3 stars. I can look at my mule and give you the details on it later today if you want it. I'll sell it cheap.
---
Yeah, that sounds pretty delicious.
---
I call no one daddy!  And I can be as uncultured as I want damnit.
---
It depends on what your exact stats are. Running a [couple of values](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html), Incisor is generally better (+4% .. +23%).
---
I've had this issue just this morning. Tried with VATS and no VATS. I can hear contact being made from the sound but enemies aren't taken damage.
---
Perfectly fine before yesterday's patch kicked in. It's definitely not lag as everything else runs fine.
---
Fun is also a subjective concept, and the intent behind convenience additions such as this is generally to try and broaden the appeal to people who find particular aspects of a game undesirable.  As someone who has played games like this for ages, I find no real issue with collecting enough scrap to always maintain my armor and weapons (and often those of my friends too).  However, I have seen requests for repair kits since the BETA (and plenty of those were asking for them to be in the atomic shop too, some would even reference the ESO kits) because there were people who found that less managable.
---
Repair kits don't need to be broadly used and necessary to be successful in earning added revenue.  Even if the only people using them are "lazy or stupid" then those individuals are still playing the game when they otherwise likely would have stopped.  This means they are creating more social interaction for other players, and they are also likely seeing other things offered in the atomic shop (especially if they visit it so frequently) and likely purchasing those too.  Just because something isn't universally useful for players doesn't make it inherently bad design, especially if the intent is to broaden the player base itself by appealing to more casual players.
---
&gt; Don't popup the news popup if the news has not changed since the last time. Should be pretty easy to just cache that info. 
---
Better yet, have a "Do not show again" checkbox
---
It'll probably improve overall, I think the PS4 takes advantage of higher speed drives, there are probably hundreds of videos on YouTube benchmarking the difference.
---
But first loading time for fallout 76, as it was in GTA V if we're being honest, depends on a bunch of online "conversation" between server and game client, so this gain kinda isn't that great of deal.
---
But it'll probably increase texture loading speed and whatnot, so texture pop-in will probably disapear, if you're also having that problem.
---
Even with a decent PC, sometimes, I see textures being properly displayed closer then it should. And the load time for me to enter into a "world" (because we won't even see a server, according to Todd's words when showing the game, so we use the word "world"), is stupidly higher then I think it should be, specially considering thelat once we're in, we can still see the game loading stuff.
---
This really works? Like just inside, or just outside?
---
Nobody knows exactly how it will work. We know it will involve tokens. That's pretty much it.
---
Totally agree. And it's not just workshops - the number of times I've lost nuke zones or SBQ fights...
---
As I've said before, I'm willing to give Bethesda a *lot* of leeway here, but missing such a basic feature despite the universal demand for it is just inexcusable, even before considering how famously dogshit the servers are.
---
Men can wear dresses too, its the end of the world. Social norms are thrown out the window
---
Its sure made trading for regular people harder. If they have everything than all they want is a lot caps or things an average player doesnt have.
---
It is pretty good, nice one.
---
No I just noticed it there when I was trying to add the red headlamp. They’re not supposed to be available, but I think some people got them back when you could get into the dev cell. Ive been playing since the beginning but I never even looked up how to do that so I’m not sure. Think they had access to everything in the game though, even stuff that wasn’t meant to be available.
---
Well their both broken but in different ways and meanings of the word
---
At first I thought this was input lag, I was trying to pick stuff up and it would take a little time to register, but after it stabilised again I could pick things up and not have the couple seconds to wait. 
---
Although this might not directly be connected I did think the lag could be causing the no damage, but after it sorted itself out I still couldn't do damage- this is why I'm leaning more towards a bug rather than input/server latency
---
I don’t have the mod itself, it’s definitely the plan. But I assume it’s a glitch because I can’t actually craft it and it shouldn’t be available. I have screenshots if you want to see.
---
I came across that the other day. It woke up a well of emotions in me.
---
Also, keep in mind that if the textures are not loading at all, it's probably a defective hard drive or, most likely, some files could be missing, maybe corrupted during the installation.
---
I'll stay here in hope with you, in solidarity.
---
Are you on every forum that talks about this game, on every website? You can’t say players didn’t ask for it otherwise. Regardless of how large this sub is, it doesn’t encompass every player in the game. If reddit represents 49% of the base and said ‘no repair kits’, and the other 51% of the internet said they wanted them, then players DID in fact ask for them. 
---
I’m not saying you’re wrong, just telling you not to assume you’re right.
---
Repair kits are not modding your gear, making ammo (especially ultracite), and building your camp.  Sorry, but there will always be a need for junk/scrap in the game.  Repairs are not the driving force behind endgame scrap use for the majority of people I have encountered, nor should they be.  Claims that repair kits remove all need to collect junk or risk involved in losing it are utterly absurd and shouldn't be given by anyone that has actually played the game for a reasonable period of time.
---
[You must have missed the roadmap posted in February.](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-our-roadmaps) "Nuclear Winter" is the name of the Summer 2019 expansion/game mode. Speculation is that it will be an alternate survival mode where, instead of PvP-focused, it will be a winter-themed map with fewer resources.
---
I mean, there is a rule against giving away private information on this sub. And since this game forces you to use your account name instead of a customized player name... ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
 Ok i gotta ask, why stalker? The 100% vats hit chance while out of combat doesn't affect the damage dropoff at range, so even if every pellet hits the target, the damage dropoff makes it moot beyond maybe 2 car lengths. If you're going for a sneaky shotgun build, recommend instigating rather than stalker.
---
It was there but OP removed it for some reason.  
---
/u/TheGeminaii  care to share why you removed legendary PA?
---
Same here, I just got killed by higher levels so I would avoid them. At level 5, I had a level 200+ follow me around and kill me around a repeatedly kill me. I’d rather help the lower levels.
---
 The way players have been setting up waist height bars is usually through manipulating the build layers, or using furniture like the shelves.
---
No :) I’m playing explosive build. And I found that it’s kinda cool to shoot in grenade while it flies to enemy) my stalkers is 35 lvl I need max one
---
Just walked past one at the Whitespring front door on the ps4 server I'm on. I stayed on the same server for hours yesterday so people could get one.
---
You better call him daddy or I'll buy a repair kit...
---
Yep starting to give me the 💩s.
---
Yes, non-explosive in perk description means not the big launchers. But weapons with the explosive effect also benefit from demolitions expert, since the explosion (not the bullet) will gain damage from that
---
I'll bet they won't. That falls in the realm of repair kits they literally just introduced.
---
But you can get for free....right now. It's in a terminal.
---
Happy to help.  :)
---
This is what I was also asking- unless I see a tweet or patch notes I don't believe anything I read in this sub 
---
People just make shit up all the time here
---
It’s all good man I’m on Xbox
---
Happy to help!
---
No problem, enjoy  :)
---
 A single rank of fire in the hole gives a big green throwing arc, and high arc throws explode on their fuse, not hitting the ground or anything. 
---
Blew a guys head off last week using a frag mirv and fire in the hole. Basically went off on his head like a hat.
---
They'll make the durability boost skins one time use, to compliment repair kits.
---
Buy both in the Atomic Shop for a great QoL improvement!
---
Why nuke grafton?  
---
What level are you? 
---
Do you have a hazmat suit or a complete set of power armor? (if you are under level 15, you cant use PA yet)  
---
If you dont have PA or a hazmat suit, you will likely not survive a nuke zone.
---
If you are under L15, you should probably still be in the forest.   Grafton is in the toxic valley, which is more appropriate for L15-20.
---
Datamining is when folks dig into the game files to find references to unreleased content. Some of it's as easy as finding new 3D model &amp; tricking the game into loading it; others involve combing through config files or even compiled files to look for changes and pulling out the changed information to see what's there.
---
Aw, I would have paid for them.  If you have a spare healing factor, lmk. Have caps, will teleport.
---
Haven’t seen any acknowledgements. 
---
I’ve played MMORPGS a decade ago where you can literally stay logged in for days, I’m not suggesting they do this but server reliability should not and cannot be a major issue especially when it is gameplay critical
---
Thank you, I’m aware of the second part there, thanks for clarify that would’ve thought that’d be pretty dirty of them to remove the point of having a explosive legendary prefix on a heavy gun
---
Most likely it is decided on the server side so nothing to find on the client side. (Otherwise, you could mod/patch the chance bytes to have it always 100%.)
---
We have the leveled lists of items that can drop but no distribution data afaik.
---
Also I've noticed its affecting pvp to, it's like trying to kill a midget with marsupial and bird bones.
---
I love that people are willing to do this.  It's so much fun to have most of the server in one spot and I get *awesome* pictures.
---
what platform?
---
Reddit is only a small % of players, most will have never visited trading forums
---
The Sims: Fallout
---
Every single aspect of gaming has improved in the past 10 years. You can't cite microtransactions when 90% of them are avoidable and pointless. Plenty of games don't have them, excellent games like God of War, Horizon and Nier. The previous Fallouts and ES. Graphics, performance, gameplay, community, all have improved and saying otherwise is being obtuse.
---
Yeah the whole game is an exercise in patience for real.
---
I plan on buying 100s of these, I'm sure this amazing play 2 win repair kits will push my lvl 267 toon over the top.....give me a fucken break...if you think this is play to win then your doing it wrong.
---
I'll bet my 76 character data that never happens. It's pure paranoia and over reaction, just like when people first heard 76 was multiplayer and flipped.
---
So far I've found them in the carpark at Wavy Willards in front of the entrance, at Point Pleasant next to the Mothman Museum and on a car bonnet in front of Whitespring if that helps any? I think they're generally in obvious spots at each spawn, it's just finding the right one.
---
Clubbed and cowboy are using thre same picture as one of the baseball damage perks and gunslinger
---
I thought so at first,then realized can’t eat rotten meat. 
---
Before eating them you can see there’s a % chance of catching a disease.
---
How is this different from a repair kit?
---
Don't carry so much.
---
Carnivore/herbivore doesn't provide any disease resistance for spoiled food. If you look, you'll still have a 4-6% of disease for each spoiled item.
---
You've just been lucky so far.
---
Does your black power weapon do extra damage to “whitey”?
---
I think slugger is for 2 hand melee weapons and incisor applies to both 2h and 1h weapons.
---
Incisor ignores armor. 
---
IIRC, slugger increases damage.  
---
But you can't damage if armor is in the way....
---
That is one of 8 recipes I am still short on. Trying to get them all.
---
Or you know, shit anywhere because it's the apocalypse and who cares.
---
Sure wish this happened to my Bloodied Explosive Dragon lol..
---
So Bethesda puts these things into the game but doesn’t activate them until they need to for a dlc or something, and then people go into the files and manually activate them themselves to see what they are. And that’s basically what datamining is?
---
Ok, I understand that. Thanks :)
---
Yeah that was cool. Other than Fasnacht I don't think I've seen so many group photo ops.
---
Yeah except something’s not right with it. I have a 3rd claw DCG and a Puncturing power fist. On my melee character they both have the exact same damage (~305). On his page the DCG is listed at roughly 15% higher damage.
---
How do we get the beer keg?
---
We do have appalachili
---
I think I understand it better now. Thanks :)
---
Food and Water. Really glad it's not just me, i knew something was up
---
But you need to use a second person to move stuff between characters.
---
Oh yeah 100% I have this issue on PS4. I want to say it showed up at patch 7.5 or 8. I switched to a 2 handed melee weapon because of this issue. Just gotta run right to them and start swinging. Might be something to the comment about having to be more precise with lining up your target. Either way it’s definitely costed me a few stimpacks when I run up to them and just stand there.
---
Cheers for clarifying that, I guess I have been lucky with it because I've been eating rotten meat for ages without repercussions and just wondered if this was a new thing lol
---
Not sure if you’d be able to answer but is the poison sheepsquatch attack going to be like the megasloth and it’s shaking attack?
---
Comic relief spot filled yet? I’d like to audition for that role. Send the script to WTF productions LLC
---
Have you done the mistress of mystery questline yet? If not, it's a great low-mid level thing to do
---
If you're on ps4 that could have been me lol. I drop stuff in that area often since I get stuff like plans that I already know often.
---
Same.  I would love Bethesda to open that player hub that gets pitched every now and then.  That would open up so many possibilities for players.  Plus it would be easier to give stuff to low level players.
---
If BGS had a list of 1,000 important things to be prioritized, this would be #99,999.
---
I'd prefer better cap rewards personally.
---
But workshops shouldn't be included, obviously, nope?
---
I have the same problem. Bethesda blames microsoft, microsoft blames bethesda. Meanwhile my sound still doesnt work right. Hasnt since patch 3
---
I have this on quick dial ;)
---
 [https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10)
---
Don't be stupid. Kits allow you to repair already ingame items, for convenience. A suit with stats is pay to win, not convenience. You are attempting to strawman and It won't work.
---
I'll do the same thing but for free.
---
ye i dont think its right because on the powerfist with puncturing it says 20% total armor ignore   
---
but as soon you add the incisor 3 + 75% total armor ignore it says 80 %  
---
 and 75 + 20 = 95
---
If he's climbing out of a crate it's likely he hid in the automated delivery system until he was taken away. There's a logistics conveyor room I can see that playing out in, in the bunker.
---
Definitely, I’m on PS4
---
What apparell is that? Not the mask but with the backpack n shit
---
Hmm thx for advise about big arc didn’t think bout it
---
Perfect excuse to have attackers have limited time to "siege" an area. Ex-enclave would know how long the targeting protocols would take. Well we gotta do this boys in 3 mins. Or else MODUS will light this place up.

Only taking a shower or jumping in a body of water to wash of can remove the smell
---
you have to buy the heroes you chimp. grinding 20 hours for one champion is exponentially more pay to win than a repair kit in this game.
---
It's been happening to me.
---
Kind of how I see it too, however it would be nice to have some male versions of some outfits. I mean this is the swimsuit on my main character! 😅 I am still unsure how I feel about it!

That’s.... really fucking stupid. Wow.

did you kill a glowing one while in it?
---
Haha yup. Numerous times. I’ve heard the caching sound when they die before there health bar even drops .
---
Also, it helps to find a few places you regularly go to and not where the duct tape spawns (this is how I have kept my stockpile filled since just after the beta).  If I could recall any specific places I'd offer them, but mostly I don't even think about it when moving through the game anymore.  Though I do believe that digested goo from the pitcher plants in the cranberry bog break down into adhesive too (and collecting it is impacted by the green thumb perk card to get extra too).
---
I have a gun with durability 100. I buy a one time use skin that boosts it by 20% as long as it's applied. I apply the skin on my gun. It now has 120 durability and I can shoot it a bit longer before it breaks.
---
* I found a gun (say a TSE handmade) 
---
* I can buy a repair kit to fix my gun when it breaks. 
---
* I can buy a skin to make my gun shoot longer before breaking. 
---
* I can use both items to increase its max durability (repair less often) and buy repair kits to fix it when it eventually breaks
---
Both do the same thing in principle. Decrease annoyance of items breaking. Neither provides a competitive advantage.
---
You obviously don't understand what P2W means, it means those who pay cash can get something people who don't pay cash can't get. You can get every champ in LoL without spending a penny. The only thing you can't get on LoL without paying cash for is the skins, which have no effect on gameplay at all.
---
For me she is so bugged that I haven't defeated her even once out of 5 times...
---
"Should we put the camera in one spot on the map?" "No ,just have it able to spawn in like 15 different locations so they have to spend an hour just to find it."

The "edited time" shows you edited after I posted. Want to keep making up easily disproven lies?
---
Huh, interesting
---
&gt; We, the "hardcore" players
---
Sadly, us the "hardcore" players are never the target audience.Most people will be using a random 10mm auto pistol and be like "This new dungeon I found is hard" where as you'll sit there with your TSE "meh this is boring".
---
Had this happen to me last night  3 others that were also in the fight had the same thing happen.
---
i like to call it a fun feature
---
That escalated quickly!  I'll give you a compromise, I'll call him duddy.
---
repair kits can be earned in game, wtf are you talking about....
---
Only time the flatwoods monster counted as a alien for me is when it was a fabled variant all others didn't. Now I have only encountered one fabled flatwoods monster so far so for all I know it could have been a glitch.
---
Yeahhhh but plans to build ultracite is not anything like "mods for x-01" it is a good alternative I agree, but I would assume OP knows already of that
---
Mainframe cores?
---
I ran my first nuke recently, nobody around. Ran to end terminal, stick in card, stick in code, launch, boom
---
Is there more to it? Did someone half do a silo then give up??
---
Not the ones they sell on the ATOM shop.
---
Sorry missed "mods". I'll see myself out
---
Except they also added improved repair kits, ingame drops, that boost durability over 100%.
---
that and the reading recipes challenges were bugged for so long that I had discovered everything by the time they fixed it and it was never retroactively rewarded
---
Agreed honestly they have very few cosmetics I'm interested in so I've been saving my atoms.
---
They need to fire the art department coming up with this crap.
---
\[xerrofoot has died laughing\]
---
Which silo did you do? I went to the Alpha site silo, it might be different in each silo?
---
yeah so you can buy the shit ones and earn the better ones
---
&gt; Bethesda also clarified that only the basic version of the Repair Kits can be purchased in the Atomic Store while the Improved Repair Kit item will only be attainable by completing in-game content.
---
i lock my most expensive/pain the ass to build, the DECON shower. I had it open for every one to use, but after been destroyed many times I decided move it and lock it. 
---
out side from that everything else on my camp is open to use.
---
That’s sucks, yesterday was strange for me too, playing with a mic in my ear because reasons......
---
I used to be a raider like you, till I took and arrow to the knee...
---
MODUS did have that conversation with Zax...
---
That Nuka-shine paint job is going to cost me actual money, and damn straight it is going to be worth it
---
I'd love an ability to mark targets (like a recon scope) , laser designate, etc. Could be multiple perks.
---
 \- Everyone gets a pip on their HUD
---
 \- Improve hit % on target (laser designator, whatever)
---
 \- Reduce armor (weak spot)
---
Not so innocent.
---
Same problem on Xbox One S friend.
---
Lol cool things? I think we have massively different idea of cool "stuff" they have like 2 underarmor suits,  maybe a few masks or heads, same with the other categories. Tfoh.
---
I've also had it throw me under the map, immediately disconnect after landing, and immediately disconnect after throwing me under the map. *This is awesome*.
---
I haven't tried it in awhile, so correct me if I'm wrong, but 4 or 5 patches ago it had not worked. Shame too, it be useful as a heal. But the flamer fuel tweaks coming hopefully make them more viable for 'Friendly fire'.
---
I have a set of ear buds that stopped working. I cut the wire off and only use the plug. Still works and doesnt drain your controller batteries as much
---
*Looks at the Blackbird PA skin that was available for only 24 hours*
---
I never said they were my dude. I was only answering the question. That said, you should never defend a multimillion dollar company. They’re not a person, they’re not your friend. Maybe they make games you like, but at the end of the day, all you are is profit to them.
---
Pretty sure each silo layout and the tasks are the same.
---
I've run it a few times solo starting at level 50 and once you have the sequence down the whole thing really only takes about 20 minutes, at a leisurely pace.
---
For the mainframe cores, you can find them tucked away around the area where you need them, but you can also craft them at the nearby tinker bench (using the broken mainframe cores that you pull out).
---
Nah, someone probably cleared it for lead, I've come across guys doing that but not planning to nuke.
---
Damn..... Oo
---
That’s a strange but good solution, thanks!
---
I think that makes the point Beth missed early on.  Here you have a series of games that have a huge fan base that encourages hoarding and collecting all different types of weapons, armor, aid items, etc. with the freedom to try it all.  But then that group gets into 76 and everything is immediately weight restricted and foces many people to start out doing strength builds just to haul your limited amout of stuff in fast travel as you explore.  I know that was a huge shock for me at launch and frankly a big negative when trying to enjoy the game because half my time was spent in inventory management trying to shed weight.
---
That is less of an issue as you get higher level and get better items/perks but it is still something a lot of players have to deal with constantly.  Especially those who want to be traders or want to try different types of builds.  Backpacks and stash increases are steps in the right direction.  I guess I would be more ok with hard limits if that whole argument of "we need to do this for game stability" really seemed to apply but we still have so many stability issues and games like ESO can do inventory management so well.  So it's possible to do if you put the right resouces to it.  Beth doesn't have to invent the wheel.  They really just need to go to the parent company and ask how do we use what they already know to make 76 better.
---
So I agree with the OP and it's not about complaining or making it easier to "win" the game.  It's about allowing everybody to play how they want to get the Fallout experience without the annoyance of constant weight issues.  But in the meantime we just all keep doing what we need to in order to have fun and support the game.
---
If ur on xbox, I need flag and tent plans
---
Good information to know, thanks I'll keep that in mind for next time.
---
Holy shit. And I was proud of making it from The Whitespring to Sutton...

The datafiles list a couple of 4th and 5th star entries but either they are not implemented or enabled yet. Also given that Scorch Killer's receiver and the Sacrificial Blade mod also adds one star, these could be simply effects on unique legendary weapons or Test/Debug weapons:
---
&gt;!For example, !&lt;
---
* &gt;!4th \* Bleeding is on a debug 10mm!&lt;
---
* &gt;!5th \* +10 Action Points is probably added to create the Civil Unrest shotgun via script.!&lt;
---
and these power armor skins and some of the bundles are going to make me actually spend money on them. and tbh, I am fine with it. I just wish there was a faster way to earn atoms or the price of the items were lowered to be a little bit more reasonable.
---
No one is going to downvote you, they’re just going to vote with their wallets and you won’t see shit.....   :|
---
I am from South Africa so everyone I meet is from another country. Only once met a fellow South African in Adventure mode and almost crapped myself.
---
I'm not going to be on till after 5:30 PM Pacific time. I'll check if I have that when I get on. Do you know what specifically those let you make?
---
I think it is a bug, but i can make any PA left arm into an Excavator bone armor. (PC)
---
I just put it up when I want to use it and store it when I’m done
---
Call me later
---
With weekly resets /s
---
So 
---
Robotics expert let’s you have an camp sentry?
---
Please tell me this is so 
---
I’d spend the money for a sentry not or assaultron to guard my camp then turrets.
---
I cant wait for the T-45 d War skin
---
I did two SBQ s last night and it went smooth. Got 3 repair kits each time. Ps4 tho
---
Not sure if your PC or console, but the Text Chat mod recently got fixed and is up and running. The only bad thing about the mode is you can't use Reshade/EnBs with it because it uses the same .dll file unfortunately.
---
I know exactly who they're targeting. Mid-game players like myself who want to spend more time killing and last time scavenging for ballistic fiber. 
---
I actually downgraded my armor because ballistic fiber is so hard to come by.
---
No, you are spraying someone with gas, not flames. gas is never friendly.
---
I server hopped once and it was right there as soon as I loaded in
---
I get that when I don't "trade" with someone. I get chased and followed like they are an angry 10 year old that got told no.
---
Where have you been man. Lots of things are changed silently &amp; not necessarily in the patch note. That is the way Beths works. Some changes like the target hit box is so frickin obvious, I just accept it as part of the mechanic. I want to whine all over reddit &amp; Beths, but I am just too lazy.
---
The improved repair kits repair the item over 100%, like weapon artisan perk (kits do 150%, perk does 130/160/200%). They don't boost base weapon durability, which the skin would do.
---
I got the BOS arms plan in the middle of digging about 600 treasure maps so it can happen. Of course I needed the legs plan...
---
I wasted 2 hours last night and still never found it.
---
But repair benches need cards and points spent in INT , with repair kits you can spend those INT points elsewhere increasing damage and sustainability. Its an Advantage. Boo hoo, 50% less durability.
---
Yup noticed that too. Was stood in my camp fir a short period waiting on a friend and they were almost dying of both. I mean I know I have lots of purified water but the amount my character drinks and eats now, he'd be sitting on the can all day!
---
Meet some down to earth people in this game. It's refreshing not hearing fuck your momma all the time.
---
Because it wasn’t just ‘given to Vault-Tec’ it was manufactured specifically to be used for the experiment of Vault 22. That’s where all of it went. These things are way out west, and Vault-Tec/Big MT would have had no reason to ship some of the plants to Appalachia.
---
And if that’s not enough reason for you, Bethesda also has a history of being hesitant to reuse or reference anything that came from Obsidian’s game.
---
Want a hurt feelings report? 
---
If your that upset check atom shop
---
Have they released the keg yet?
---
I kill sbq 10 times a row and got * and ** shit legandary so you dont loose nothing
---
I've done over 100 SBQ battles and only gotten 1 Serum recipe, so I don't think they will be missed.
---
Found mine at the Colonel Kelly Monument after server hoping a bit. Didnt take long. Usually I wait for things to not be 3fps when I load in, but I ran up the stairs and on the second bench on the right was the dead old tourist. No lag there in spawn. Hope that helps some
---
Maybe you ate some mentats lalety? That could be it
---
You've accepted the light of our lord and savior the Flatwoods Monster. You shall give into his power and become his thrall willingly. Your light shall spread unto others and his message be spread. Hail our lord and savior! Hail the Green Monster!
---
Ah. Let me ask you: would you riot over these skins? Your own concept?
---
No. I don’t do chems
---
Where is this frozen alien?
---
yea its arguably my favorite feature in 76
---
In past it was working like this. Inside of nuke zone, you still get rads from queen or being hit by ghouls. I am not 100% sure if crouching still trigger it tho, maybe you can start this bug in some new way.
---
God yes I burned through a whole roll of film trying to get my first quest shot before I realized this.
---
I've noticed the same problem
---
You'd wager they are only the beginning? Bethesda have said they are going to introduce more utility items to the AS.
---
What the other people said about it having the same stats/non legendary, BUT ALSO you need the assaultron head plan to craft it, so there is no advantage except once receiving the plan, being able to make a cosmetically modified version of it.
---
Don't understand why it's not a skin. The "slay bells" death tambourine had a different audio I think and it was a skin
---
Even if there's an official response there's no guarantee it will be truthful.
---
So they just change shit all the time and don't tell Anyone? 
---
##thats not it chief
---
It's ok...I just tuck it behind and put on a wig. The deep voice gives it away though.
---
The Name's Brenda...Brenda the transgender...*cough*
---
Mainframe cores sometimes don't spawn or you can't pick them up. If you have circuits and a bunch of steel, you should be able to craft them from the broken ones at the Tinker's Workbench in one of the nearby rooms.
---
If you spend some time finding cores every time you launch, you eventually arrive to a silo with 15+ cores already repaired and just replace them in-place. You can then repair the rest outside in a safe space for the next run.
---
Hmm, maybe a radiation effect, sorry I can't help you either :/
---
I was interested in doing stuff like this.  If you're on PC I'm game.
---
No they didn't. They said they might, based on feedback.
---
Do you have mods
---
Nice 😂
---
I can't reallu say it's a frozen alien but it should be given the context.
---
Anyway it's in tnt bunker number 2,and i just tried taking photos of the pod but nothing worked. I guess it was just another failed attempt.
---
I was trying to be... Whats the word, poetic? 
---
Regardless, its going to get worse. They already nerfed white knight to incentivize buying these kits. Whats next?
---
From the last time I played, it’s pretty story driven. If your not into reading stuff listening to stories and the likes it gets monotonous cause all your doing is running around killing things locking up and running mission in a wasteland with little to no life except mutated animals and occasional players that want to kill you or be your best friend. 
---
The map is HUGE and beautiful. I guess the one thing I still have a issue with playing is the actual survival aspect of it with constantly eating and drinking water to maintain yourself as you travel through the wasteland. Not a big fan of tedious things like that even though you can maximize the time it takes to deplete. 
---
Other than that rent it at a redbox or something and give it a shot. It’s truly going to be a work of art but just not my cup of tea.
---
Hope this helps
---
I'm pretty sure they did when they said about the fridges.
---
I run a low health VATS build. I’m also not going to say it’s perfectly optimized (3/3 concentrated fire is probably overkill; I’ve been told some of my luck perks are redundant). I also normally run in a group with someone who has Empath, so my Charisma perks are different than listed.
---
Gunsmith is great but I just love nerd rage so much that I never equip it lol
---
I didn't mean any offence I meant no one would wager against that as it is sure fire gonna happen.
---
Oh damn.  How'd that get there? Lol
---
Being Portuguese, other players are always from other countries :)
---
Makes me think of Overwatch, which adds in trophies for their new heroes, so it is possible.
---
FO4: There are too many rad storms! Take out the rad storms!
---
FO76: There are not enough rad storms! More rad storms please!
---
Were they scorched variants? Maybe it needs to be the basic/ standard
---
They didn't. Go check back. Nothing confirmed.
---
did that for a while, I just want it to have it displayed.
---
A lot of people were starting to come around on 76 as well.
---
If you can find it on sale for 30-40$ I'd say go for it. The story is okay, the environmental storytelling is great though. PvP is very bad, you just have players wearing assassins sentinels armor basically becoming invincible then using explosive weapons and 1 shotting you. The current p2w isn't that p2w, its just pay for convenience. Its funner with friends, but you can still have fun without.
---
What the hell is the “low self esteem” about?
---
You can run the same copy twice on separate consoles? Wow, yeah, that’s kind of broken.
---
Yes, for example, food consumption rate, fusion core drop %, etc. Like I said, *where have you been man*? Do you really play this game from release date?
---
Nope, it was just new guy i interupted in his camp, yeah i didn't kill him, because i thought it would not be fair. When i noticed how much damage he is doing, i was already dead.
---
Also 19lvl killed me with few bullets from handmade to my back. 
---
Bethesda did one great thing, you don't get any bonus from level up, only perks cards and s.p.e.c.i.a.l.
---
And because i have some mutations, only 3endurance i have exactly same HP pool as level 1 ....250hps. 
---
Well if i had 5/5 assasins BoS heavy combat armor, it would be probably imposible for him to kill me, but with regular gear no min/max it is fair fight.
---
I've always just taken the pics for photo challenges (even before the camera was released) and then immediately deleted them.
---
Now that’s valid feedback
---
I know this is 4 months later but such to a different weapon then switch back. Reloaded instantly.
---
Innocently purchasing duped weapons from the aftermarket is an oxymoron. 
---
If you know enough about the game/community to be a part of the trading then you know that a huuuuuuge percentage of meta end-game equipment is duped. The rolls on the TSE and others are supposed to be much too rare for that many of them to be moving hands
---
So the most hyped gameplay update of the spring, the Burrows, turns out to be kind of a letdown.
---
And then a plot twist!  The boring camera update that follows it is secretly a super exciting minigame!
---
I wish horses weren't extinct in Fallout. Would make for some pretty cool gameplay - feel like it would probably be a bit more like Red Dead than Skyrim, though. Could be pretty awesome for story / setting, too.
---
If you have armor to negate fall damage, it’s a huge advantage. You can do this glitch at any time without fear of dying (but the possibility of the whole game crashing is still there). 
---
You can also pretty much fast travel this way too, even if you’re over-encumbered or have no caps. It’s more unpredictable, but you’ll generally get flung to the left of your character. I’ve successfully traveled from the hill on top of vault 76 to deathclaw island this way without dying. And from the land view lighthouse to the overseers camp without dying. Both with just the goat legs perk card equip.
---
Did you read the latest patch notes? They addressed this.
---
[A NOTE ON UTILITY ITEMS IN THE ATOMIC SHOP](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/64xBDO2aEDqzWOsXuWPtle/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-patch-8-5-notes-april-23-2019), about halfway down.
---
I can help you 15 min i will be on
---
Ok
---
Unless you have solid evidence that these changes have happened then I doubt it. 
---
I had 76 on pre-order I've played over 700 hours and have played MMO's for more than half my life. Yeah dude they make changes and don't tell anyone sure
---
Same here.  Not as often as rain, of course, but often enough that they don't feel "mythical" to me.  I think it's just a matter of being in the right place at the right time
---
When was White Knight nerfed?
---
Stolen from Dev room and likely duped. What a wonderful player base we have to enjoy this game with 🙄
---
Yep. They're going to keep going.
---
I really hope for instanced dungeons, but they must put a stop to the farming there then so that people can't just server hop and re run them endlessly.
---
Either a timeout after entering or a maximum number per day you can go into one (both need a respawn point inside).
---
I don't see the point in this, and how is this roleplaying?
---
Several patches ago.
---
I didn't play the Beta, but started from launch.  The plans would be so nice to have.  I looked and farmed  (spent almost 10 hrs. server hopping 1 day) and prayed for calibrated shocks for around 130+ levels before I got lucky and found both in 1 day a couple of hours apart.  I have found all available mods and have multiples of many, but  they take up a lot of stash weight.
---
Yeah, problem is that stash only takes one or two weapons... I drop all my 1*Legendaries around Overseers Camp
---
It was a beta wave emitter but I think you mean Wasteland Workshop instead of Wild Wasteland? That's the trait that made silly stuff happen in New Vegas.
---
Sure man ;)
---
Photography does take you all over the world after all
---
All I'm asking is you to point me in the direction of where you found this information.
---
Please, I'm asking nicely
---
Had a lot of fun with this "feature" of the camera last night
---
Same here. Hopefully they add more soon. Very soon.
---
My calibrated excavator set is now only used as a teleporter.  
---
Finish looting, killing, etc, pop out the excavator, swap in 9 points worth of weight reduction perks, fast travel, collect excavator, swap perks back to damage and carry on.
---
Ooooo, that's a really good point.
---
Have you tested whether different emotes affect the general direction you are thrown?  I've seen a few comments that mention this but they didn't provide any details.
---
Okay thank you, I figured it wasnt just me I had heard some people talking on the mic that it had happened to them.
---
Thank you, that sucks....
---
I would be upset, yes. Instead of enhancing the experience by improving the game (balance, mechanics, new things to do, etc), they give you an option to spend money on diminishing things that annoy you.
---
It's like locking stuff behind timers and selling gems for real money to finish the timers faster.
---
Instead, why not create a mechanic in game to allow us to remove an annoyance. Make it something you can quest for. A new reason to do stuff in the game. Even if it takes long to improve a gun this way. Once you're done, get that one time skin that boosts base durability. Do not sell that in the Atomic Shop... 
---
Even the improved repair kits are kinda bad. You get them from bosses only (imposter sheepsquash and SBQ). You go through guns like candy on SBQ fight. So often you use the drops to reset your guns durability after the fight. You can't craft them yourself, so you can't build a few to have available during adventuring. I get it that it adds another reason to fight the queen. Actually, that's one of the three reasons to do it... Ultracite armor mod plans, improved repair kits and prime receiver plans. Her legendary drop is as likely to be good as from any 3* enemy, so that's a moot point. 
---
Btw did you know they removed serum recipes from SBQ loot table? You can't get them anymore from her, you can only get them from the enclave vendor for the ~20,000 caps they are sold at in the medical wing.
---
First, thanks for insulting people who you want to be on your side. We all like hearing we have ‘0 brain cells’ because we don’t use your build. 
---
Second, this is the same problem everyone has, and it’s been posted here ad nauseum. Find one of those posts and comment there.
---
I don't think I've ever seen rain and I've seen 3 rad storms since beta...
---
My ultracite explosive arrow heads beg to differ, tin man!
---
The Lord of Light!
---
It looks like the Union uniform. I wore it for a while, I liked the look of the backpack but with actual backpacks coming I switched it up.
---
Ok I’ve had this happen a few times and best I can tell it’s a server issue basically way too much spawns way too fast then you have a million explosions. Unfortunately the only way I found to get my loot is to wait until the server catches up and depending on how long that takes sometimes it’s better to give up
---
Its used to exaggerate a point and it's not "my build" it's anyone who uses the Rifleman or commando perks.
---
3 points in int is enough to swap in max rank fix it good or weapon artisan. And you can use those points for something else that will increase survivability when not repairing, like first aid or nerd rage. And along with that doubled durability comes a pretty decent boost to damage.
---
There is no case where basic repair kit are an advantage over repairing. People are complaining because if they accept this, Bethesda *might* put something worse in in the future, but I'm just like, if some dummy wants to fund development by paying 50 atoms per item repaired to get an inferior repair, I'm ok with that.
---
All in less than a day? You move faster than using a repair kit in fo76!
---
What’s this Enclace faction you speak of? Is it new DLC?
---
I think we're about to have a nice 300million gigabyte update !! Cant wait
---
It is. I was fixing to buy a second copy for my wife until my coworkers told me about this trick. Works for all digital download games apparently. I'd gone years without knowing it.
---
its supposed to be a skin but when you got to add it to a salvaged assaultron head its not popping up at all. its popping up as a weapon that you can craft. heres a video of my level four character showing that it is a weapon you can craft.
---
If anyone wants to test this on PS4 with us tonight, I'd love to get a big group of people together to try some different things.  The direction we face, the emotes we use, and then compare teleportation results.  I'm curious to see how random the results are.
---
I love the absurdity of this glitch so, if you come hang out, please try to bear with me if I break down into hysterics again.  PSN Neojinnx.
---
I did it myself at like 65.  I haven't done it alone since, but when I did it you would login to a terminal and stop the robots, because they escalate after you kill them.  It was tedious but not hard at all.  That helped tremendously tho.
---
If you want - to - destroy - my ro-bot, pull this wire as it walks away.
---
If it’s ps4 and you need a guy that rushes in without thinking and dies I’m in
---
50 atoms would be great
---
Really?  It rains on my ass all the time
---
It really doesn't enhance the game at all. It's just an annoyance... like mole rats.
---
I actually run both in the field and swap to whatever at camp for craft and repairs.
---
I agree with this.  Clean up the rest of the field, go back in a bit, stuff will be there. It will be Shit, but it will be there.
---
This outrage is so dumb. It’s repairing a weapon way below what most players usually repair all their gear to. If someone had to use one while fighting me I’d probably just stop and drop them some 200% repaired weapons because they obviously don’t know how to prepare correctly. Stop raging about this.
---
Want something to legitimately get mad about? How about the new camera launch glitch. If you’re fighting someone now, they can just pull out their camera and dip out real quick, basically teleport away to avoid dying. Yet there’s no outrage about that? People can basically fast travel without using caps or do it while over encumbered now. And all just by doing an emote with the camera in hand. This is game breaking, repair kits are a non issue
---
Doom guy would be fucking proud of my build. Explosions and dismemberment all day every day
---
Is it me or the drops and rewards have become a lot worse?
---
I don’t give a fuck what this condescending elitist prick is asking people will 100% use Alts on their own internet and with phones with zero fear of some supposed all knowing corporate marketing department threatening their job over it.
---
Call him daddy or else I'll buy the $100 atom pack and buy a million repair kits
---
It *is* far shinier than the other Brotherhood rank paint jobs. Inappropriately so, it doesn't look proper Brotherhood.
---
I know it's too optimistic to think it but it would be nice if it was just *temporarily* removed from the pool so it could be given a rework to bring it in line with the rest of the paints before it came back.
---
If someone in the near vicinity has taken Berry Mentats it will give you a purple haze around you, (and the enemies they’re trying to highlight) there’s also a bug with the targeting HUD on power armour and that can make everything glow red if someone else is using it nearby
---
Fully agreed, if anything it’s irritating and distracts from immersion.
---
If I hadn’t a friend giving me stuff I think I would give up on the game.
---
Just let me sandbox how I like! What’s the problem of having **OPTIONS**?
---
I'll check again. It's possible I overlooked them since they switched from showing the "known" plans on top to an eye-straining alphabetical list. Thanks for the help though.
---
It's absurd and I fucking *love* it.
---
The repair kits are the first step in all this.
---
Its not just going to stay at "oh you can buy a repair kit"
---
Ps4 😖
---
What is your perk/mutation setup? A level 45 Hardened Handmade with Bloody Mess 3 and 3 x Rifleman 3 has a listed damage of 103, both before and after patch. Adrenaline 5 with 6 kills buffs it to 157.
---
Both times I ran into the Flatwoods Monster it was up around the converted munitions factory.  But that is the only 2 times in 600+ hours of gameplay that I've encountered it
---
Live in the Mire. I'm rained on daily.
---
Same
---
I think in future they will push it to the atomic shop leg weapons 100proc like they do with nerf spaw place balistic fiber 2 weeks later repair kits
---
SBQ gives 2-3 every time . I have 6 from 2 fights with her.
---
That's an awfully progressive line of thought from a sith lord.  But I try to help people out when I can.
---
Just stumbled about this comment. Countryroads_wanderer greets you 🙌
---
You already have the option to negate most of that via perks. And even though I just have slow metabolizer, I found hunger and thirst becomes less of a problem over level 30, as one starts to explore into the savage divide. Dog food and nuka colas are everywhere.
---
100% an a photo album item is coming to the cash shop, +10 photo budget, 750 atoms.
---
I'm literally wasting 3 skill points on thru hiker because water weighs a goddamn tonne... seriously pointless.
---
The defend event is an event (obviously)
---
&gt;and archery. Archery is interesting because there is a bow and arrow weapon that has been in the files since launch, and it looks like its coming with this update. Keep in mind there is obviously more merit badges than these. 
---
Fuck YES!
---
I wanted a working bow and crossbow (and ideally throwing weapons) in 3, NV and 4 since forever and hoped 76 would deliver it but it didnt... this would get me as an avid amateur archer to play again :D
---
"Interrupted in his CAMP"? what does that even mean? How do you even start PVP without breaking his built objects or shooting at him first in that scenario? And you weren't even trying to fight back? Of course you died. This still makes no sense and can't be used to make the argument that someone who isn't even out of the teens in level is on equal footing with anyone else of any level. It's absolutely absurd to try making that claim. I have facts and statistics. You have an I-witness anecdote and admission of not even trying. A judge would throw that out in court, and a scientist would laugh at you. I guess there will always be a few people who's personal bias prevents them from seeing the truth, even if you ram it down their throat...  
---
At low levels, below 50, LEVEL MATTERS. The lower you get, the more it does. The higher you get, the less likely it is to matter. FACTS.
---
Sure, but I have to get there first, and I don’t like that road.
---
But yeah, at least I have that.
---
Hi Countryroads_wanderer!
---
I keep hearing people say this, but it never works for me :(  I always get a message stating the person has to be my friend to join their game
---
That is what they would like you to believe. "We removed all of the duplicate items and left the player one item".
---
This is complete BS. Never happened.
---
Make a quick post here when you want to make a silo run.  There are almost always people happy to help, in any capacity - they'll clear it for you to stroll through, or hang back and assist when needed.  There's a great community here and if they know what you're up to, someone will lend a hand!
---
I’ve used most of them and they have the same effect, forcefully throw you to the left. Well, left and forward a little. Like, if you’re facing north, you’ll end up slightly north west. However, hitting objects and walls seems to then launch you in other directions as well. Like a golf ball hitting a tree, you’ll end up being tossed at the same velocity but might end up in slightly (or vastly) different spots. But I can’t definitively say that all emotes produce the same results. 
---
One other thing I’ve noticed about the camera and being able to do things you couldn’t before... When you sit in a chair or on a couch and had the camera out before sitting, you can now do emotes while sitting down. I’ve been using this in my shop, sitting behind my shop window spamming the sell emote or signaling players to come over to me. It’s a welcomed glitch since I roleplay a shop keeper
---
I feel like this is a significant portion of the game to be disabled on a whim, and while I agree that being thirsty / hungry at the wrong time can be an irritant, that's the point of it. 
---
 
---
I don't support the idea.
---
Damn...... it truly is, what a waste.
---
I'm just curious as to how far I have to go into these locations to find it.
---
Yea, few server hops if possible might have them show up.
---
You run into flatwoods monster? Eat some mentats? Forget to update your ini after the patch? All of these can do that!
---
This is how it starts, with something smallish. 
---
Pretty soon the atom store will be indistinguishable from the ESO crown store.
---
Bethesda: We've got a better idea! Everyone - come buy our new "MRE field ration" consumable in the Atomic Shop which completely disables hunger and thirst for an hour! We feel you will find that they are a convenient option you can utilize during your adventures. If we find that MREs do offer any sort of competitive advantage once they are available, we will make any changes necessary to ensure that advantage is removed!
---
With all due respect I’m not looking for your support.
---
I just want the **OPTION** so I and others can use it.
---
There is an alien corpse located in the back of a dumpster or a truck somewhere. I can't remember the location exactly but at least it's a clue lol
---
That’s happened to me as well. I won’t trade with people I don’t know unless I’m buying or selling something, and we agreed beforehand to meet up. I’ve had people look just to see what weapons and armor I have so they can try to kill me. So I’m leary if random people wanting to trade.
---
I've been playing since launch and have around 1000 hours into it, lot of late night's and early mornings. I got my first explosive drop at level 145. Since then I've had a number of them drop but the only TSE has been level 35.
---
If you consider that the story line and side quests are designed to bring you up to level 50, thats about three play throughs worth of time.
---
And for what it's worth, none of my explosive guns have come from whitesprings. Didn't find a single one until I stopped going there.
---
So the plans for sale are still randomized? I've been wondering if that was the case...
---
There is at least 1 location that has a dead alien in it though. I can't for the life of me remember where. It's not the mounted Zetan either
---
So true that it hurts!!!!!!!
---
But me consumer, me dumb. I have rights!
---
Legendary 4 star 4 ply toilet paper for 1 trillion caps
---
Same, on PC.  Two SBQ's on the same server, in sequence.  Both went fast with a group that was there for business.  Nothing special dropped, but the loot was there both times.
---
Wait... so i can run around a nuke zone in my underwear? Gotta try this ASAP!!!!
---
With all due respect, you posted this in a non official public forum, this is a public response.
---
Yep, many are experiencing your described HP bar / damage register in game delay.
---
It doesn’t matter to them because at this point if you’re still playing, you’re “invested” and will keep playing. 
---
It’s a win win for them. If you don’t like it they lose nothing, and if you like it they make more money.
---
45 is the max level for a .50 cal machine gun

Really hoping that the legendary vendor somehow bestows legendary effects onto crafted weapons. Otherwise this is a waste of atoms, even with its sound effects. This was legit the fastest atom purchase I've ever made and now I'm feeling shorted. Heard I even have to learn the plan a second time
---
Well written and done. Had a good time reading it from beginning till the end ! :)
---
That's be much better. I was going by the pip boy animation with the red radioactive case really

thnx  good solution :^/

*Everyone keeps playing anyway.*
---
Yea. That’s the sad part. I do like the game but man... they make some poor choices. I guess misery loves company lol.
---
I admit I was fooled, but I won't let it happen again by these lying sacks of crap. I feel betrayed.
---
good post... and i agree entirely. i don't care if it's not the first time someone has mentioned this; it's the first time **I'VE** seen it mentioned. it's not like you just can't ignore it and move on - some people just have to be unpleasant and leave a snide comment... strange
---
You can have a versatile build. You may not have all the perks you want, but effective none the less. I can use any melee, shotgun, or heavy weapon cards and have my handmade or sniper rifle for long shots. It's what makes the game challenging
---
Do you even play this game? I’m 700 hrs in and am well aware of the implications of utility items in the shop. They aren’t crucial. They aren’t pay to win in the least bit. They’re not even practical because they don’t repair to 200%. Even if they added mutation serums or stim packs to the store, I wouldn’t care because I know how to obtain that stuff through gameplay or the market.
---
Well then don't buy it. Problem solved. Does that satisfy you? No, because you people will find other things to whine about.
---
I only stuck to parking lots
---
Colonel Kelly Monument, ansel laying on a bench on the wooden pathway in front of the monument. Thanks for the map
---
Same for me, killed them first then took photos and it worked
---
And? It seems Bethesda interacts here? So they might see?
---
Like I said, and I’m serious, not trying to impose my opinion or looking for player approval, I’m just posting a suggestion for an **OPTION** that would greatly improve the game for many people.
---
Has anyone else noticed ghoul corpses in the Burrows getting up and walking away through walls before you can loot them? I lost a legendary drop like this.
---
I haven't checked if this still happening after the last patch.
---
You have to either chase them and loot the walking corpse before they go through a wall, or come back like 10 min later and a rotting meatpile should be back in the area you originally killed them.
---
Also, the ghoul corpses also sometimes don't drop where they were killed and instead teleport several feet away.
---
The area I've seen this the most is near the Southern entrance, the first rooms to the right and left of the first hallway where you see ghouls.
---
All silo layouts are basically the same as far as ive seen, and you can repair the broken mainframe cores you get from taking them out of the terminal for the door.
---
The survival to a degree, no?
---
the game launches you when you emote when standing still and also when in photo mode and change your pose
---
I do. I nuked harper's ferry a few hours before the patch. Friend and i were killing glowing ghouls for loot and whatnot.
---
Again, repair kits are the first step. What you say about them may be true. They may not be the most practical. But its not just going to stay at only repair kits.
---
They're going to add more stuff. More useful things. Things with more clear advantages over the non cash shop versions.
---
It can be annoying, I agree, but I used to just set aside 5-7 minutes of playtime just to make 12-15 corn soups. It would last me awhile, and if I was heading past Flatwoods, I'd go into the diner and pick the lock on the fridge for pre-made stuff (plus the can of dog food under the counter). I'd also just cook whatever I killed, unless they weren't edible. Sorry it's such a drag for you, and I get it; I used to get annoyed about scrounging for mats to make ammo.
---
Do you want [Barrens Chat](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Barrens_chat)? Because this is how you get Barrens Chat.
---
I have the same issue.  Definitely have the X-01 Targeting HUD plan, but I cannot craft it.  I can select it, and the power armor station makes a noise like I've crafted it, but, nothing.
---
There are hundreds of posts like this one and they all just get the same response: Buy it and try it out yourself without having any expectations, you may like it.
---
No, I hated the survival mechanics at first but once I got used to it I actually like it. 
---
If BGS does this valuable time and resources will be wasted. It will also fragment the player base. Not to mention we are all on the same playing field no easy passes for players who can't take a few seconds to manage thier hunger/inventory.
---
At least you got to kill her. Last one I tried, she flew away, off the map, never to be seen again...

Poor Biv. There he sits, talking to his brick buddy, waiting for his bestest friend to come back
---
*Everything* can, but that doesn't mean you can buy *everything* that comes out.
---
For those of us who have a lot of materials stored away, this was a ridiculously easy challenge.
---
For ranged weapons, I simply killed Scorched and Super Mutants around the Charleston area, picked up their guns until I had 20, and then scrapped them all.
---
For melee, I crafted 10 boards (just wood and leather) and then scrapped the 10 I'd created to check those off the list.
---
I also did 2mm for the energy ammo and missles for explosive.
---
The only thing that was a little tricky were the molotovs since I didn't have any beer bottles in my inventory that hadn't been scrapped into glass.  But I went to the frat house in Morgantown and picked up 20 from a single run through all the rooms. Disconnected to eat dinner, logged back in and hit the frat house again to collect 20 more and finish off the challenge.
---
I would say that it was added to please the "All this food and I don't have hunger???? UNREALISTIC!!! CANCLLED BANNED!!!!" crowd. Ya know, the type that seem to forget that video games aren't like real life, at all?
---
what system do you play, 
---
I would gladly take your stuff lol,
---
what is trash for someone, can be agold mine for someone else.
---
Thanks for feedback.
---
I’m glad you talked about time, because the number of minutes you point out can represent 5% to 10% of my playing time allocated to Fallout 76, and I would much prefer to be doing other ingame stuff.
---
But thanks for sharing again.
---
I found him many times but it's impossible when you need it.  If you server hop an absurd amount of times like i'm doing ,you can see it in creekside geove. The problem is that it bolts without fughting
---
Both problems we have on xbox to. So i guess it's the gome overall that works crap. But it could be worse, 5 updates or so ago i pritty much crash everytime i fast travle to some place, so that's doesn't happan anymore. ^-^
---
Exactly! It’s the same as repair. Pay a little to avoid a slightly burdensome mechanic.
---
An Improved version that works for 1.5 hours will have a chance to drop from SBQ event, these will replace the Ranged Explosive weapons currently in the loot tables.
---
It shouldn't be about if i buy it or not. The fact it exists as an option is the issue.
---
Selling repair kits 1 for 10K or 10 for 90 k. Already sold 600 of 1000. Get them while they're still at the great low price. PC username trollposter
---
I would rather pay 5-10 dollars once in awhile for a subscription fee, than see crap like repair kits in the atom shop. Adding things like this muddy the water.

#COINCIDENCE  
---
I THINK NOT
---
*Oh myyyyyy*
---
So? It's just one item. Calm down.
---
While I get and agree with what you say on the lack of preparation, and the issue of the camera needing a hot fix sharpish, the repair kits are still a sketchy concept because it may well pave the way to further items that are non-cosmetic. They may not but I will wait and see what happens on that. 
---
You're right on that people should complain about the impact of the camera glitch. People voiced concerns about the repair kits but that's gone unheeded. Time to move on and try something else if people want to protest about them. 
---
People on that would be better not using them to prove a point as it is evident Bethesda can see things like what is the most popular food item, answer is canned dog food, so they could monitor repair kit use as easily. 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Good you like it, I’m not trying to change things you like, I’m trying to have an **OPTION** for people like me.
---
Wasted resources it’s a moot point as the recent repair kit debacle proves.
---
Its just one item, for now. It wont stay "just one item"
---
Yes. [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bfsfnf/psa\_which\_enemies\_are\_affected\_by\_versus/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bfsfnf/psa_which_enemies_are_affected_by_versus/)
---
Atoms aren’t really worth anything though, right?
---
Not sure what caused it, but I read yesterday someone had a couple hundred rounds in their shotgun.  They could reproduce the bug by switching from the a high-capacity weapon like a gatling, logging off, and switching to their shotgun during the loading.  The weapon carried the ammo count from the weapon they switched from...  I might have the details a little fuzzy but it was someone here on FO76 yesterday, so you could probably dig it up if you're interested.  Might be a new bug from the timeline.  Enjoy the extra shots!
---
What ever you say.
---
Don’t do it
---
I know you probably don't want to hear it but... power armor rarely ever needs repaired, and there are some sets like T-60 that require laughable amounts of materials to repair. I think to fully repair my T-60 set, which is a good end game set of armor (though I use it over other sets mostly because it looks badass IMO), it takes me like 10 aluminum and a few steel. Then I don't have to repair for a good month or more.
---
I installed the drive last night and ran it for about 2 hours in the barrows a few times and surrounding areas. The loading screens were significantly faster but as expected the server side still needed to catch up. Overall its better and also when I fast travel to my camp or even spawn in from a new world it does seem to populate my camp faster.
---
I also didnt see the world building itself around me like I did with the PS4 version as of recent like many others have complained about. For the price I think Im going to keep this SSD and consider buying a larger one for my primary PS4 so both my son and I can play together. I am going to run a few tests with both my PS4's tonight to see how much difference the loading times and world generation times are improved.
---
I only see rad storms in flarwoods.
---
Oh right!
---
Because when I play a videogame, the first thing I want to do is waste my time in real life issues instead of having adventures!
---
Again, talking about having an **OPTION**.
---
I agree, the first 3 times my  team and i tried the burroughs, each time it was totally empty of enemies, they were all dead and the final assaultron was already dead
---
fun!
---
we would try once a night for 3 nights, each time the same
---
finally we found an instance where there were enemies, and about 1/3 the way in, 2 lvl 200's rolled in and jsut slaughtered everything
---
If you have the OPTION as you so cap lockedly put it how are you on a fair playing field with everyone else?
---
Havent you seen all the new camp stuff like the deathclaw hide and the power armor paints and some weapon skins that look amazing
---
We should also be able to turn off incoming damage as I don't want to use stimpaks.  Plus my gun should shoot magic bullets since I am sick of finding regular bullets.  Also I want to fly.
---
Especially to the Jews between 1939 to 1945.
---
Well, right now I doubt anyone will be able to buy the three next power armors without spending cashmoney.
---
1400 represents a bit more than two weeks where you'd have done all dailies and weeklies without missing any, which we know was impossible. For 4 armors, that's at least two months of constant play... a bit much.
---
Dont think it happened with items that dont stack, but it couldve happened with bobble heads and such. Guess it never happened to me so I cant really speak from experience. But in practice it wouldnt be that hard.
---
Still need help?
---
The Burrows dungeon is short.  It's only about a half-hour long.  It's not a raid dungeon - it's basically another West-Tek, only with Ghouls and robots instead of Super Mutants.
---
There is nothing in the game currently that is 2 hours of constant battle.  The closest thing would be the Scorchbeast Queen which tops out at 30 minutes.  I've taken a 150% Super Sledge down to broken in that time with Makeshift Warrior 3 I believe (not 5 - so 30% durability boost instead of 50%), but that's using it non-stop for 30 minutes straight.
---
Needless to say, that's a *lot* of hits.  If the same Super Sledge kills most enemies in one or two hits, that amounts to well over a hundred enemies.  And that assumes it's the only weapon you use - in practice, you typically rotate between a handful of favorites based on the situation.
---
My current build is viable, true. But there are dozens of perks to choose from in one perk tree that don't make you over powered but instead make your character uniquely you that you can pick, but the game mechanics force you to pick only one maxed out perk for 3 points (which seems to be their average maxed out perk number) instead of a few, after picking the damage perks and the tank killer. Adding the changes I am suggesting would simply make it more fun and feel less like I have been pigeon holed into my perk choices and armor mod choices.
---
So you're saying bethesda *wont* add more non cosmetic items to the shop?
---
That’s simple, make a new “mode” for it, call it sandbox or whatever, maybe remove PVP too because some like me don’t care with that either.
---
But I would be glad with survival removed, and I use caps and bold for **OPTION** because some people see it as me imposing my view of fun, it’s not that.
---
I just found it at the top of Landview Lighthouse
---
Go to that Brother hood place with the STAMs and set them up, get a few shots in they’ll go down fast
---
I've been wanting the ability to ride bikes since fo3 :(.
---
Maybe a syringer
---
Theres also an event for the dogwoods that gives you a fat stack. I spent one day CAMPing in the area and had so much dogwood that I couldnt handle the extra weight and dropped the majority of it.
---
Not hard to maintain a steady flow if you incorporate it into your routes.
---
Yeah it says so in the description.
---
Previous Fallout games have an Easy Mode, the only viable way to satisfy your request would be to create an entirely new set of servers like they did for Survival Mode. There are many Perks that can minimize Hunger &amp; Thirst issues, and even one that allows you to drink dirty water with little to no consequence, you just have to move a few more points over to Endurance.
---
It means you should avoid purple people eaters.
---
Oh I was there for that, it really sucked!!
---
I did it last night with no issues.
---
Here we go again with the conspiracies
---
Yes, it seems the solution is to endure that road.
---
But this is not a solution that pleases me, enduring irritating gameplay, I would prefer an option/mode/server whatever, and I’m not alone.
---
Nah I'm good
---
Same reason I posted it, never seen it posted before. Granted I haven't been extremely active on this sub, I'm relatively new but still, if it was posted a lot I should have seen it somewhere.
---
Shotgun with enforcer lands them nicely.
---
I see you didn't fix the re-spawn issue. Received so much heat for posting it.  
---
I know you're busy, I know you've got a long list. Get some help, please! 
---
The list keeps getting longer and longer.
---
50 atoms for doing 1 event?
---
Lmao no.
---
It's a confusing world out there
---
No one sees it as you imposing your view of fun we see it and you removing key mechanic from the game. 
---
If you don't have to abide by the key mechanics in survival in the game and then switch over to a regular server where the rest of us play it means you leveled in an easier mode than everyone else and are no longer playing by the same rules.
---
No cheat codes are needed in this game. TBH it's not a hard game.
---
And as I said a new "mode" will further divest resources and player base to another server.
---
Seems like TS is very desirable on the AGL. I love blasting lightly armored fodder with just a basic version of it, but seems like the TS will really help with ammo efficiency and lack of damage. Wondering if an instigating M79 would be worthwhile to have for clearing packs of fodder during junk runs. Was having a blast last night with a basic M79 and an AA pump shotgun to not waste 50 cal ammo on trash mobs.
---
While, personally, I'm not a huge fan of TSE; its still a great set of effects. I actually miss my TSE 50 cal at times, but find a basic 1* AA 50 cal to be more effective mid-long range and just recently got "The Action Hero" TS, +reload, +firerate 50 and that thing is a monster for close quarters heavy action without the risk of blowing yourself up.
---
Very well done research and written post. However, I would recommend Johnny Booth's "Fever Dreams" for the 50 cal rather than the highly technical and well timed "Bleed". Nothing technical about blasting something full of 50!
---
Yeah, she took off like a bat out of hell. Waka waka!
---
Mean wile I had a low level player assaulted me, so murdered him. Then his huge power armored level 200 monkey came at me. I just left the server.
---
Lol just let me make 1400 events so i can buy the new power armor paint
---
Power Armor negates regular armor buffs, yes.
---
Should have been released with all this then maybe it would have more active players
---
I use Gunsmith, but it's more of a "I have nothing that I need to spend these points on" kind of thing. If there were things that I really wanted in other trees, I'd drop it and get them. As for lucky break / draw - the amount they repair after the nerf (long tim ago) is so laughable that it isn't worth using them at all IMO.
---
Yeah, except all the other perks in intelligence that aren't gunsmith that almost every build uses.
---
She sure did, maybe its me? :) I think I need a rabbits foot or something...
---
Who needs that just use an RK and you win simple
---
I think both would be great. Just link the vending machine in your camp to one at whitesprings.  I am going to enjoy roaming around and checking out peoples shops, but when you are short on time it would be nice to just hit whitesprings.
---
then how come in the news section and in the bethesda atom shop update it says its a skin?
---
Look for the event at Charleston Airport. I forget what it's called, but you kill a bunch of low level Scorched and a Cargobot will spawn in to give you some goodies.
---
I would just let the argument go.  Everyone has picked their side and you aren't going to change his opinion.  You can tell when he says condescending stuff like "you people will find other things to whine about" that he isn't hear to listen.
---
Does equipping the 'cripple limb' perk work on their wings?
---
“Team” dungeons such as the way The Burrows is designed should require two separate people at least to turn the valves necessary to open the doorway grate covers.  That would have required cooperation, but as it is currently designed, you can effectively solo it.
---
Really, the only things in the game that require a team effort are Enlightenment at the lighthouse, Dinner Guests at the other golf course, the Scorchbeast Queen, and the Imposter Sheepsquatch.
---
Wait until somebody with a plasma weapon get the last shot in and it just vanish in the air. 
---
I have a plasma gatling ,but make sure that i change to another weapon when the SQB still have half of her second life left.
---
Sorry, but I don't agree with this at all. Just because you can't maintain your own thirst and hunger in the game doesn't mean you should have an OPTION to turn it off because you "hate" having to stop all the time because of it.  It's a part of the game, It's supposed to mimic real life...   
---
100% disagree.
---
I'm going there now lol
---
i got it to and even with a second plan for the slavaged assaualtron head its not letting me make it as a weapon or a skin. heck its not even letting me even add a skin to salvaged assaultron heads.
---
I’m not removing anything because the option would only affect the ones that choose it.
---
And it’s not a feature, it’s a detriment.
---
Dude I play for an hour a night maybe 3 nights a week and I have no problem with it. Smh
---
Haha, it's apparently been a new issue. Add it to the list...
---
So, the last I heard, swing speed didn't apply to the Mr. Handy Buzz Blade's hit rate, so both that perk and Martial Artist didn't matter much with it.  That may have changed though, because there was a point where Vampire didn't apply to the Buzz Blade either, and now it does.
---
A Bloodied Mr. Handy Buzz Blade has the potential to be pretty amazing.  I have a Vampire's one and I basically end up taking no damage versus whatever I use it against.
---
Fair enough.
---
They included fridges in the same section about repair kits, nothing confirmed or denied.
---
The repair kit isn't the only thing you get from nuking fissure site prime.
---
This would be pretty handy, especially for people looking for things like, I don't know, a fucking corpse with a camera.
---
Yeah true. I hope everything works out as there is a solid game there I certainly enjoy it. Personally I don't think the repair kits are p2w but they aren't far off.
---
You mean shoveling free content at you? lol. Get mad.
---
I always make sure my power fist is repaired to 200% before going the SBQ fight.
---
As a bloodied build, I confirm it is amazing with jumping ghouls :) crowd control too
---
Funnily enough, I was just thinking about how quickly the health of the economy had improved. 
---
Caps are still valuable, which surprised me.  You can farm up about 2000 a day if you have a couple of hours or so.  Hitting the 25k cap shouldn't be an issue.  At the moment, there are a fair number of cap sinks - serum recipes and plans, travel costs, and keycards.  They seem to be pulling at least some caps out of the economy.
---
Good legendaries are selling for reasonable prices.  1 stars look like 500-1000 for the good rolls, but darn solid god-lite rolls can be had for 5-20k.
---
The premium stuff is a bit of a nuisance, but duping really loosened the market up a bit on them.  They are gettable.  Yes, a few folks hold out for specific trades but there seems to be a willingness to trade for more liquid items and keep items flowing.  Add in speculation on balance changes and I think things are going ok.
---
Can confirm - for me Anne was next to the flag on some rubble, as you enter the cemetery, near the empty grave used in the Pickett’s fort quest.
---
Ansel, of course, is Ansel Adams, but I’m wondering if Anne represents Annie Leibovitz? Maybe Anne Geddes?
---
Ok.
---
XBox One X player here. Should expect great performance with one of the most powerful consoles out there. Loading screens take forever, and I also experience lag/stutter for 20-30+ seconds after arriving in the instance. Honestly I don't understand how this can be so bad when there are tons of other multiplayer games that have been released over recent years that don't have this issue. Especially considering there are so few players allowed in one instance. This is made worse because of the ongoing random server disconnects.
---
It's a feature because survival mechanics were clearly stated at launch. No free passes learn how to watch your food/water meters.
---
Why should you be able to ditch 25 poinds of aid when everyone else is carrying that weight? How is this balanced?
---
Sorry friend you couldn’t be more wrong.  They are both products being sold to consumers.  Nice job avoiding the whole argument I made though Jr.
---
Is your health around 20% or below 20%?  Perhaps Nerd Rage is going off and on.
---
Seconding this. It tends to happen with the bigger events, where there's lots of people &amp; monsters in the area. The game takes a while to actually load the loot after a kill like that. Just hanging out for a bit will usually fix it, especially as players leave the zone.
---
I fully agree, although I like the separation of the Survival/Adventure modes, FO76 does not need an "Easy Mode", certain aspects of the game are already less than challenging and very un-rewarding at higher levels.
---
While I fully support any changes that would make the Workbench UIs, and Perk Card management less cumbersome, The need to "Survive" is an Integral part of the game.
---
Just a reminder about the TSE Flamer, you can get 100 fuel by crafting and dismantling a normal flamer.
---
I've had this happen also, it's a rather odd mechanic.

---
Really think they fumbled the syringer in 76. I'm guessing its more for future expansions. But currently imo its kinda meh
---
Worked for me a couple of hours ago, however, I don't keep it equipped all the time. Maybe re-equip it and/or relog without it?
---
You can wager all you want.  Most of us will keep playing because we like the game.  If your wager ever pays off, that's great.  You can scream "I told you so" if it makes you happy.  Meanwhile, we'll have invested another hundred hours into the game, made friends, and generally enjoyed our time with it.
---
Can I have your legendary weapons and armor?
---
No problem friend, like I said to another Redditor I’m not looking for your approval.
---
My goal is for Bethesda to see this, not to have approval from the people that are ok with current options.
---
Yikes! I was doing this loads having too much fun
---
It’s like drinking nukashine without the hangover!  Glad I’m not the only one getting flung around the map using my Pro Snap.
---
Because people want a free pass in life. Quite simple really.. If they can't conform to the rules, then they have to make it easy for themselves because they can't learn/won't learn to play the game. Instead whinging/demanding change for something that doesn't need changing.
---
thanks!
---
Thank you for the info Tobi, I didn't want to come off as whiny so sorry. All that I wanted was to a a helpful dweller but I guess I forgot that its a survival game, only look out for yourself. I didn't know that if you move you can reuse broken items. I have moved my camp to a more scenic spot and downsized to avoid people. I guess I'm going to be a solo survivor and try to keep people away.
---
Bye. Don't know why people are crying over something that impacts nothing
---
Don’t try it might break your game or get you banned
---
I don't know what the kerfuffle about White Knight was. It was absolutely 100% overpowered and needed tuned down. A 99% slower degradation on armor is insane. People could go weeks without repairing gear. It needed nerfed but now people have connected it as some sort of grand conspiracy to milk us for cash.
---
Yes!!! HAMMMM
---
Breaker breaker 19 she's a big old flirt
---
Once your gear is modded you don't need to continue to do so, and there are ways around that already in the base game anyway. Many builds don't even need to consume ammo at all. 
---
And quite frankly I don't think the people that are going to sink tons of money into kits are going to care about making a nice camp. 
---
Repair kits absolutely can remove the need to collect junk and I have been playing diligently since beta, so needless to say opinions can vary.
---
Psa don’t do it guys

I’m used to 750 damage at about 35% health from this weapon.
---
I believe that this is a bug as I also have the ability to 'craft' this for X-01 I know I don't have the plan for it. I never exploited the game so it didn't come from the Dev Cell either. The craft doesn't work so assume it's just a crafting bug due to the changes made to craft and modify. Especially when the craft requires no special perks to make...
---
Another one of these post?
---
Nice!!!!!
---
What did I say, the feasibility of obtaining “free” repair kits will be extremely hard to get. 
---
“Currently can be found as a “rare” drop from quests like defeating scorchbeast.”
---
So not only do you have to kill the scorchbeast you have to get lucky enough to receive them as a drop.
---
Look up FO76Edit on Nexus mods and start from there
---
As you might have noticed it loads you with a game error flagging your account to Bethesda , now imagine doing it to avoid paying caps for fast travelling ...
---
Like I said, I’m not talking about you having an issue with it, you’re obviously ok and I’m glad you are, seriously.
---
I’m the one that would like to have the option.
---
&gt; It is litterally sooo much better to go around with a group of friends and complete Events.
---
There are some events that feels like you really need a team to complete it... Path to Enlightenment [collecting firefly goo for the light house] i've only been able to complete w/ other random folk helping.
---
You make a good point there
---
Hi, these are the two 3* Berserker Levers I have:
---
Berserker’s L45
---
25% fastest fire rate
---
VATS fills 15% faster
---
15% faster reload
---
Bash Damage increased by 40%
---
Feel free to make an offer on either.
---
No problem friend, here's a decent observation for you. Bethesda won't see this, and they won't make changes for you, just because you can't play the game the way it's intended to be played.
---
By all means if you want to play Fallout, go Play Fallout 3. Pretty simple, no irritating eating or drinking required.  There's your solution for you.
---
These were in FO4 so if they made us pay for them i'd feel somewhat cheated since they haven't made those assets recently for this game, they'd just be re-enabling them and charging for it. If it was entirely new assets then it's more justifiable.
---
It’s likely they were sold to that vendor by another player.
---
I read that as "Bread Curtains".
---
That's like wanting the racing taken out of Forza, that's kind of the point of the game...
---
I mean you gotta Prove you’re quitting by giving your stuff away. Otherwise you’re just a shill
---
Here’s a video of what not to do.
---
I did without knowing this was a big bad bug

Two minutes no more no commentary no bs no drama just a friendly warning
---
How old are you? I shit you not my 5yr old son knows when my character  eeds food or water he'll tell me. Are you saying a 5yr old has a better mastering of the survival mechanics than you?
---
Because it sounds like it
---
Yes, as someone who uses heavy energy weapons almost exclusively, this is very frustrating. Not only do thay have longer reload times than the gatling gun, but then the one shot spool, release, respool. And it lies and says you have a max clip but you don't and it will jump from 800 shots to empty all the sudden cuz it loaded a nearly depleted core.
---
Awful and clunky.
---
On top of that, gatling laser needs a damage boost.
---
I've always wondered if the graffiti on alien abductions points to some deep dark ritual we have yet to learn
---
Thanks but I know what the word means.
---
I’m asking you to explain what the disadvantage is, in this specific case, Einstein.
---
Thanks for asking.  I thought I was going mad.
---
Theory whoever finds and kills flatwoods monster should be a bro and posted in here , corpses count so there you go 
---
Flatwoods monster counts as alien and flatwoods monster
---
You don't always get to choose your battlefield.
---
All those other junk uses are 100% optional and not a necessity to keep playing the game.
---
There is not always a cap penalty to the person killed. More likely to be encountered by people bot participating in the game economy. Even if they do have caps the person with junk in their inventory is still risking more than their opponent no matter how worthless you think that is.
---
Keep the insults to yourself please.
---
Why should you be able to buy repair kits too?
---
Don’t start with morals in the game industry.
---
My way of enjoying games shouldn’t be your concern and vice-versa, and if it’s an **OPTION** no one is impaired.
---
Happy cake day
---
I got 3 of them from one SBQ last night, i think they are pretty dope, not sure why people are so salty about it.
---
Did i say i was going to stop playing? I've enjoyed the game too. I'm just not entirely happy with the way this could all be headed.
---
Who obviously doesn’t use these forums.  Who tosses away anti armor and sentinel to a vendor where they might end up getting lost to the digital abyss?
---
Can I get your stuff ?
---
I used to feel like you. It was a fucking hassle and seemed like a useless activity with no upside. You drink your water, eat your pre-war packaged food, but no actual benefit was to be had. 
---
If there was an option I probably would have turned it off. 
---
Then I discovered the wonders of cooking soups!
---
Soups stack, provide food and water, and have some pretty awesome effects. 
---
I'll pop one of each, Carrot Soup (+PER) Corn Soup (AP REG) Tato Soup (+ Max AP)  before heading out to do whatever, whether I actually need to eat or drink or not. Normally this will top off my bars and give me a boost, then I'll bring along a couple of each to have in the field. I don't usually pick up food anymore unless it's something rare or I want to sell it, and I use all my purified water to make diluted stims. The only disadvantage is having to pump all of that dirty water and boil it. And you tend to go through wood pretty quickly too. 
---
The soups I use go well with my build, but there are many different types to choose from. 
---
It's like popping chems you don't get addicted to, and the only things the bars do now is to remind me to eat for the positive effects, it's not so much about hunger and thirst anymore. 
---
If I had knew about soups when I was a lower level, and considering how easy it is to setup a small garden (something you can do right at the start of the game), it would have saved me such a headache. I was pretty mobile in those days too, didn't have one of these static grand CAMP setups. But a mobile garden would have been perfect for my play style. Just plop down a few plants, water pump, cooking pot, and your good to go. 
---
Side note: I feel like if there was an option to turn off hunger and thirst, it should also negate the positive effects of eating cooked foods. Seems only fair since it would be shutting off the negative effects.
---
Just use the power armor/spring board glitch , I stayed number one for a while till I ran out of fusion cores
---
/u/recession "rare drop"
---
I just killed one for the challenge and it didn't count man. Only counted for flatwoods monster
---
**Hogarth Hughes:** You are who you choose to be.
---
**The Iron Giant:** Superman.
---
11 million years
---
I enjoyed this, good job!
---
It says in order to apply skin you will need other plans before hand
---
I lock the bottom part of my camp due to the decontamination shower &amp; fusion generator. But if you hop up on my roof, you can use my workbenches &amp; stash boxes. I have multiple water purifiers and keep 2 unlocked for people.
---
Only reason I've seen people don't hop events is because of the cap costs. Atoms would be a nice incentive but give anyone event hopping free travel and they run all events on the map.
---
Yay!!!!!!!!!!!! Nobody cares!!!!!!!!!!
---
Thanks for the tip, for everyone else she is at the top of the light tower.
---
Horrifying thought , what a waste
---
Won’t they? Why? Because you say so?
---
And how about all the other suggestions? Including remove repair kits from the shop? Will they see that ones?
---
I don’t get all the hate you have in you just because someone enjoys playing differently from you.
---
I can confirm it doesn't count as Alien. Only as Flatwoods Monster.
---
Found Anne ( Tourist ) on the fountain outside the main building of Bolton Greens.
---
You could also be potentially be marking yourself on the system as a person that is not using intented game mechanics as they’re supposed.
---
Even if it’s a bug , that people are warning not to replicate.
---
I could almost hear people crying ban wave hahaha
---
For me the point is exploring and combat, just like other Fallout games.
---
And like I said, it’s an **OPTION**, not an imposition.
---
So there was a time when Weapon Artisan was broken and some weapons would break super fast no matter what you did. Stack people who are unprepared into the fight and sometimes even bringing extra weapons wasn't enough.
---
It is easy to tell people to be prepared, but it is very hard to predict what Bethesda is going to muck up each patch. Additionally now the question is is going to become "Dude, where is your repair kit?"
---
i'm having the same problem, sometimes it works after i wait for a little while but it doesn't work always
---
nah im just trying to make the point that they lied is all
---
Did it also contained about 7-8 extra purified water? If so, you're welcome.
---
At 400-500 hours in, the new content and changes aren't grabbing me to keep playing.  I don't blame them for trying, I did play 400 hours on a $45 investment, great job on their part.
---
Bethesda needs to evolve the game.  That might mean that early adopters, who already invested hundreds of hours, drift away.
---
Same thing happened to me.
---
I’m 4, sorry, not their yet.
---
Crap so before this challenge killing a flatwoods monster will count as both ( as they’re no aliens )
---
Sorry PS4
---
And how are you missing my point that it likely wasn't a lie?  Do I have to put it in crayon?
---
#BOOM  
---
#EVEN BOTTOMER TEXT
---
They've let this subreddit turn into entitled screeching whatever the fuck they're doing. I'm genuinely convinced 90% of this subreddit are under the age of 16.
---
That’s impossible, but would love to see someone do it. I have a 1* lvl 30 hunters wooden right arm for anyone who can.
---
Wait.... whaaaat?....... *suddenly  feels like atoms are burning a hole in my pocket and a purchase may be made lol
---
I would have thought Flatwoods Monster, but I read down and you shot that down yourself.  I already have a picture of me with a Flatwoods Monster I killed awhile back in my album, but I haven't started the camera quest yet. Is that a Bucket List challenge?
---
If you think that's going fast you ought to see the fusion cores drain. . . Logged in last night for 1 hour. Started with 25 cores, ended with 16 cores. 9 cores in 60 minutes! Holy hell I thought I was hallucinating.
---
If you’re on PS4 and looking to save some caps I have a few of those that I sell you.  Example:  the 50 cal machine gun plan is about 3k from vendors. I sell it for 1k.
---
 Not new, not to me anyway.
---
Given how often I have to eat/drink I have placed food/drink in the 'quick slots' (or however they are called).
---
FC drain is OK as long as you just walk/run and use the relevant INT perk to extend its durability. Sprintig can get expensive unless you equip the STR perk. However if you use power attacks or Todd forbid VATS you are going to have a doozy of a time with your PA. No perks mitigates this and is like 4-5% per activation.
---
The entire point of the limitations on SPECIAL points and Perks, is to force you into Balance Decisions, so essentially this is just another post asking to make the game Easier. I would very much like to see some changes that would make Perk Card management less cumbersome, but the gameplay is plenty easy enough as it is.
---
Back of a truck near Big Bend West. My teammate and I took several pics of him last night but none counted towards the challenge.
---
Fuck everybody else, it's great so long as you don't let whiny fucks get in your head with there bullshit opinions
---
Let me be honest with you friend. It's not hate, it's being realistic with you. If you can't understand the "SURVIVAL" elements of the game. Then I'm afraid to say Fallout 76 isn't for you.
---
I enjoy the fact you're trying to change the subject.. but no. It's pretty simple, you're entitled to your "opinion" and its safe to say, most of the other comments that have been made do not see eye to eye with you.
---
I wish you the best with your *opinion* but I'll say it once again... you're barking up the wrong bleached dogwood tree. Good luck to you friend.
---
Every person i fought the SBQ with got 3 improved repair kits, that doesn’t seem rare, not nearly as rare as the serum recipes. I have fought her and beat her dozens of times and never got a serum recipe.
---
Thanks for the tips and positivity, will take them into account.
---
Sure, other adjusts should be made if this option was available.
---
I don’t really care with being stronger than other players, my single goal is coop PVE.
---
You can literally buy full fallout games for the price of a skin.
---
How damn disconnected from reality are these people?
---
Or how disconnected from reality am I if this shit actually works?
---
I didn't get to it last night but there's an alien animatron in the Lying Lowe's taxidermy shop, and I thought that might count.
---
Ye there's a few. We're getting The Bear Arms ( a gauntlet ), the Sheepsquatch club, the Sheepsquatch crook, and the sheep herder.
---
I have never ever gotten a legendary.
---
Idk what they’re worth but just an fyi the Tesla rifle gets its bonuses from the rifleman line of perks.
---
how hard is for them to implement the chat system?  
---
Are they too big to implement this?
---
Well fuck me with a super sledge, I thought that would have worked. I know there was a previous challenge I took a picture in Photo mode and it worked but obviously the criteria has changed.
---
Bethesda loves playing cruel jokes 😒
---
Odd, I’ve never seen it cloaked when I loot it. Must be a newer glitch
---
Pretty sure someone was talking about serum recipes being taken out of her drop table more recently.
---
yeah I heard about that, that would suck as well
---
Proof?
---
I'll keep this simple and use small words 
---
&gt;Why should you be able to buy repair kits too?
---
We all know this is a terrible idea however if you want to pay 50 atoms to instantly revive your hunger have fun you'll still get hungry again and have to use a consumable.
---
&gt;Don’t start with morals in the game industry.
---
Uh yeah I will not only does this put you at an really unfair advantage it will segragate the player base dramatically. 
---
Your OPTION server: sucky players who can't manage inventory or see a highly visible food/water meter
---
Adventure server: people who don't whine and are good
---
&gt;My way of enjoying games shouldn’t be your concern and vice-versa, and if it’s an OPTION no one is impaired.
---
How am I not impaired? Or at a disadvantage? Who in thier right mind would play the normal servers? If they do this and it stays fair I'm game at 50% reduced exp if you take that OPTION to make up for your inability to manage inventory.
---
Prolly farmed from the SBQ fight by a low level who couldn't use them and didn't know what they had.  I have seen quite a few good guns and armor there from time to time.
---
Nope. However, I think it's more than likely the vault in the wastelander's promo image.
---
With the plans learned and plans still in my inventory its still uncraftable and still not a skin but a weapon.
---
I gave up on joining random events outside of the best ones for farming when I spent 35 caps to travel across the map and see that the event had just timed out when I got there. I like participating in the events, but it’s just not worth the caps to travel to an event I don’t know for certain I’ll get *something* from. They really need to include a timer on the map somehow - maybe clicking on the event on the map to open the fast travel option can include the time left on the event above the option to join for X amount of caps. I can’t imagine it’d be that difficult to do
---
Found a aa, +power attack pitchfork in the enclave bunker not too long ago. Was like 22 caps, even if its just for the legendary vendor.
---
Mothman plushies exist in stores in west Virginia
---
Yeah but this thing isn't a rifle. It's an energy shotgun so it gets perks from those classes
---
I don't doubt this.
---
PvP players leave their junk at CAMP now, to avoid paying out a reward. So... nothing changes.
---
Gotcha, i haven’t fought her as much recently, did last night cause i knew the repair kits were suppose to drop from her, wasn’t expecting so many tbh

Did you read the part where it says don’t replicate you could brick your game ?
---
Troll ?
---
and that's the problem.   People cannot do the dungeon quests because others farm them.
---
Tried that too :( and the one in the dump truck... nothing
---
X01 mods are the only thing left that still requires server hopping and RNG, everything else is so easy to get. They listened to the complains and now most PA mod plans can be bought easily. If they even offer the plans for x01 mods, there’s nothing difficult left. Might as well make all plans available on every vendor bot and also lower the caps price so we don’t even need to fast travel around to get them. 
---
I remember when certain t51b mods and plans were so rare, I played and hopped really hard to try to find them. As soon as they made everything easily available at Phoenix bot, I sold some junk, walked in and bought them and stopped trying. No more morning play for me since I got everything I was looking for. All games are like this, when you listen to the complains and make the game easier, there will be fewer people playing it. And those who complain will keep complaining until they get everything easily and stop playing too.
---
It's an atom challenge for the week
---
If that's the case, BGS goes on my blacklist and I will never purchase anything from them ever again. I will stand on the highest mountain I can find and denounce them as loudly as I can. If they do that, or even worse - offer legendary tokens for real money, they will be 100% dead to me. A game company cannot commit a sin worse than going full on pay to win in my eyes.
---
I have an instigating one but it's level 35 and i'm 90. Still should be doing around 600 if it procs
---
Weekly cryptid challenge
---
Eventually there will be Private Servers that will allow you to play any way you like with Mods, and modified game/environment settings, until then you just need to Survive.
---
I pvp pretty much 100% of the time. Your legit concern you just made up is dumb. If you really pvped you would know to bring 2 of your powerful weapons. I carry 4 weapons and if I'm down to 1 it would just be plain amazing. If you carry 1 weapon and it breaks and therefore you die. You deserved to die.

Well she is a bat out of hell.

Maybe some of it is your ridiculous hyperbole. An hour farming ballistic fiber and aluminum? If by an hour you mean a 10 min run through Fort Defiance that will give you enough ballistic fiber and aluminum for multiple repairs, then sure.
---
So if you’ve learned the salvaged Assaultron plan, purchased the Assaultron plan from the BOS vendor last week and seen the message “you already know salvaged Assaultron head - imposter Sheepsquatch Assaultron head unlocked” message top left of your screen, should I be seeing the item in my workbenches or do I still need to purchase it from the atom shop? I had a look in the weapon bench this morning but I can only see the salvaged head available to craft. Any advice greatly appreciated.
---
3 from a single fight seems to me to need a bit of balancing. I thought it souldve been a chance for 1.
---
It’s still a rifle
---
Did he switch servers too?
---
What makes you think I can’t understand? I’ve played tons of games during my life, it’s not a matter of understanding, I flat out hate them and see them as an utter haste of my precious time.
---
I do not agree, Fallout 76 has been changed a lot, including new modes and will continue to do so, so I have hope for such an option/mode.
---
Other comments don’t appear because some of you are raging in hate and are very aggressive toward different opinions from the hive mind.
---
But guess what? Check reviews, check the price, check population, the game isn’t perfect and we as a community should be open to different opinions.
---
Thanks! I will look for other venues to make my opinion reach Bethesda.
---
I wish I could prove this.  But I rarely ever record, so no there is no ‘proof’.  I was so tired of having broken armor for the past two weeks.  I finally repair it with a kit and see only 6 are appearing in the pip-boy
---
No, I just hunted him down and killed him
---
Yeah, but they're reaching their mid levels, so I just suggested the least perk/point intensive selections to keep them going until they get high enough that it stops mattering.
---
I would like to note I was able to get my Grognak's axe to 150% with the improved repair kit I earned from the queen last night!
---
Glad I sold the game while people were still willing to buy it. Nothing I have read has made me miss playing it.
---
You look at the world through some victimhood glasses, son.
---
Films? Hah. Get you through the door with an overpriced ticket, sell you overpriced food, overpriced drinks, overpriced snacks. People "stand for it" all the time.
---
Cellphones? Plans are designed to *DRIP* cash into provider's pockets. Phones themselves are plannedf obsolescence.
---
Music? Please... another business literally built around squeezing as much money out of your pocket as possible.
---
Just... don't. The issue is that gamers think that somehow their chosen hobby should be the only one that doesn't follow a modern tech business model.
---
Why? You can’t trade or sell them, if you drop then they are destroyed and only weigh .1 so it just saves materials after what is often a grueling fight. I like it just how it is, and see no problem with it whatsoever.
---
yep! That's a clue for the Sheepsquatch added in by BGS in Patch 8, and will be used as a crafting item later so dont scrap it
---
So it is. So it's technically 3 classes
---
Yep, I vendor stuff there daily. I'm one of those people who vendors everything. It's nice to hear people buy it or find it. Be sure to check that blue suitcase for plans and ammo.
---
I have seen this as well. No body to find and loot.
---
It would raise the viability of pistols as well, but given less than a week, pvp players would probably bitch about it until it came with a massive nerf....I would still love to see it a thing though, and dual melee, because I want to rock two combat knives lol.
---
Yup. I found a Striker red Sentry Bot with my cousin and it followed us around. We even took pictures which I will try to upload later today.
---
I havnt either. Maybe it'll be dropped when the true end to the dungeon is revealed in a month or so
---
Soooo...would you consider the LITERALLY SLOWEST WEAPON IN THE GAME THAT HAS A INNITIATE ADVANTAGE AND WILL MOST LIKELY GET NERFED FOR BALANCING REASONS a realistic example so you mention it at all?
---
If it isn't actuall raid content yet, it will most likely come cause that's what we where promised. Would a average weapon last trough that? Would it last trough several tries how it's normal for your average raid?... No matter how much you try to ridicule this topic, the reality is gonna stay a dead serious fact: that this could turn into p2w real fast the more we progress trough theyr roadmap.
---
I can vouch for the TSE plasma gatling with beam splitter. The only things not instantly melted are Mirelurk Queens, Scorchbeasts, Sheepsquatch, and players with god-tier gear and carefully selected perks/mutations.
---
He means the plans to build mods for them. The other plans should not even drop from the queen because you can get them from that terminal . The developers are bone heads for leaving them in which dilutes her pool , no one needs her to drop those plans , ultracite calibrated shocks is what she never drops , it's what we need to make that armor viable compared to others. It could possibly drop if they removed the schematics to build the base armor, as well as removing drills , syringers , and wood armor. The stupid bat should only drop mutation recipes, ultracite MOD PLANS, and a legendary weapon or armor. The moment they added that armor plan to the terminal those other plans should have been removed.
---
You’re a genius. never thought of putting new letters on signs
---
Took a photo of it this morning and it didn’t count unfortunately (head, body and arm separately and then all together in the same photo)
---
I got lucky then. Wasn't planning on doing it again. I only did it a second time to see if it could be replicated. I'm sure it'll get fixed soon
---
Yes, there was the time, and that was a while ago. It is reasonable to expect the weapon durability thing will not return, and reasonable to expect that if it somehow did it would be fixed in a week or so when they figured out what they fucked up this time.
---
And any mook who asks "dude, where's your repair kit" is not worth listening to. I've seen those sorts of end game morons in other games, and invariably they have been incompetent and incapable of realizing they were incompetent, but boy, were they good at blaming "those guys hiding in the shed" or other such garbage.
---
Watch me dismantle, I'll soon be circuits.
---
I'm fine with over rewarding tbh. Just didnt think it wouldve been the initial drop rate and we wouldve had to asked them to increase it. 
---
Seems to be not the case in this situation. Just means i gotta farm some sbq
---
I found it at the civil war cemetary....server hopped once
---
yeah i love the feel of the hunting rifle, but’s it’s obsolete aswell as the 308 ammo. it needs a buff
---
Or a really loud word we could shout at it, forcing it to land.
---
I'd expect them to treat it like a lobby that you load into, and not the random joining that happens today. Like, you'd pick the Raid Lobby from the main screen; maybe you can queue until the # is met, or you join as a group, but it would be separate like Survival mode etc.
---
There is a storyline, and a damn good one, but it's not given to you. You have to search for it and dig for it and really look for it. The people who say there isn't a story aren't listening to the holotapes and reading the letters/notes. Its not told in the same way as the previous titles, it doesn't feel as interactive as the other titles, and it certainly doesn't spoon feed you the story line like the other titles.
---
I don't PVP. At all. The problem is that it's based on a single player game where you get crazy powerful by the end of the game and no matter how they try to balance that vast difference in strength between beginners and end game players, they just can't. There's basically two types of people in the game, PVPers and PVEers, both find the others obnoxious. You'll have to figure out which one you are.
---
As far as I'm concerned, there is no pay to win system. If I ever decide that I need to spend real money to defeat the scorchbeast queen, I'll quietly stop playing and Bethesda will never hear about it. But you do not have to spend real money to succeed and progress and excell at the game.
---
I played solo all the way through the story, explored the whole map alone. Only when I started launching nukes and roaming blast zones and doing queen fights did I start playing with other people. It plays like the fallout games you're used to, with the other players filling the role of npcs. Some are nice, some are dicks, some will just ignore you. You can totally play solo... but it is more fun with friends.
---
Have an upvote for making my day.
---
One of the problems is this is not why most people are bulking their scrap. If you're vendoring shit you bulk it and head to a vendor, no risk of scrapping it involved. The kind of people complaining about this are just carrying around all of their scrap bulked at all times
---
So we are going to earn all kinds of skirts and helmets soon? Maybe even rainbow colored skirts as a reward? Are these new challenges going to last more than 5 min? Does these challenges include enemies that last at least two shots?
---
It’s a terrible idea for you and many others, not everyone and it’s happening (not saying I agree).
---
That’s your words, not mine, I could say the same about you, *”people that act like raging dogs just because they don’t agree”*.
---
I don’t care about getting gud nor any of that crap meta stuff, I only care about coop PVE and enjoying adventures.
---
If no one would play others servers you’re saying I’m 100% right.
---
Bye-bye.
---
You have never tried to reload two handguns or aim using your non-predominant arm have you.
---
I would love the hardened. 50 cal receiver to be added but I have a feeling it wont be because of how many .50 cal rounds you can make at one time
---
Dual super sledges ftw
---
I think if they were a super rare drop the calls of pay to win would be much more valid, making them more obtainable means the pay to win argument doesn’t work.
---
Kind of thought they had fixed it since it hasn't happened to me and my crew yet and we do this event as often as possible, but it has been reported as a bug since the beginning of the event.

 **\[BUGS\]ENCRYPITD EVENT: Sheepsquatch** 
---
Thanks for the info.
---
Send in a ticket.  They respond fast to Atomic Store issues.
---
Without my recording last night as I purchased them, I don’t see a way to prove this.  I’m just a casual lvl 35 who has been playing since day 1.  I’m more sad than mad.  Every time the game screws up, I get sadder over the experience
---
Guess we should start saving caps for the AAE Bow.
---
I mean, the vault in question are already in the game world, so I can't see them being accessed from the menu. Who knows at this point though.
---
Don’t, I just told you, but ask your mom, she knows.
---
People get fired for being rude more often than they get fired for making errors.
---
Seriously, if they are so desperately in need of money that they feel they need to break promises why don't they put faction items in the shop. People would go crazy for camp items that reflect their faction of choice.
---
Well last night I went to: 
---
Mothman statue
---
Whitespring
---
Camden Park
---
Wavy Willards
---
GreenBrier
---
Miners monument
---
Uncanny Caverns
---
Prickets Fort
---
Philippi Battleground Cemetery
---
Colonel Kelly monument
---
Berkely Springs
---
Watoga
---
And nothing.  After that I server hopped 8 times looking for him, trying both Phillipi Battleground and Colonel Kelly (because they are only 2 caps from each other).  On the 8th hop, I found Annie at Philippi.
---
"Cowboy" could also mean: bonuses to lever rifle, knives, double barrel shotgun, tomahawk, revolvers and variants a la the New Vegas perk.
---
Which would be AWESOME.
---
That’s awesome!
---
I mean the standard .50 is just as strong as the .308 hardened. .50 is cheaper to make so really everyone should be using it
---
Fuck.
---
Sorry I called you a "sucky player" here's a couple trophies 🏆🏆🏆🏆we good champ 👍
---
For now I have a friend that supplies water and food, kudos for him!
---
Latter on I’m hopping I won’t need any of this because of perks, or maybe I’m playing something else, who knows!
---
True. Have you checked to see if it works on PA yet by chance? 
---
That was a big concern of mine, as its repair is somewhat more expensive.
---
Omg yes to dual weapon melee weapons like death claw gauntlets, knuckles, and knives. But yea I can totally seeing pvp player crying about dual wields.
---
They could literally drag and drop items already in the game into the shop for us to purchase, and there are a ton of assets that would sell (like faction flags) that require no development time.
---
I use a nightvision gun to find the body when its cloaked.
---
Thanks for at least looking.
---
The hardened 308 always does more then the best .50 cal in my experience
---
I never killed an 8 foot tall GM lizard, giant contagious bat, or walked through a small nuclear explosion wearing leather armor before either. There's a whole lot of unreasonable/improbable to walk past before we get sassy about firearm logic.
---
Explosive arrows, sure. Regular arrows nah.
---
!? I was bout to get some legendary assualtron head from the market.... kind of let down.
---
I think? I could be wrong though. I know that's where I got my TVs though :3. Mostly shopping center before the whitesprings update.
---
My stepson watched me play for a bit the other day. People helping others and giving away loot and mats blew his mind. He plays a lot online, but he said no player base is nice, let alone helpful like the Fallout base.
---
Did they do something to that vendor?
---
I just server hopped until i bought all the X01 mods including jetpack.  Then stood in a puddle for 15 minutes to get all the mutations.
---
Then proceeded to solo nuke using nothing but the fists of a man and occasionally a baseball bat.
---
Then i got bored by like, November 20th?
---
Thanks, I'll make note.  If it's not the Flatwoods Monster, have you tried up at the Crash space station, there was a door there that no one could unlock I think?
---
Thanks friend! Make sure you keep some for you, you know, it might come in handy for food and drinks.
---
If that guy wants to kill my boi MODUS, he’s got another think coming. No one messes with my Robo Boi
---
Same! I want it as a costume not an under armor for Christ sake I already have the BoS Officer Uniform and most armors already cover these up so I don't see the point. It looks so cool and to be wasted on under armor is just BAD.
---
What? If your insinuating my Mother has had a relationship with you I'm afraid changing a babies diaper doesn't count as a relationship we were just sick of smelling shit.
---
One of these days you'll learn how to use the big boy potty
---
I would love it but find it hard unless its power armor exclusive using dual super sledges but would actually look cool. And power attack would be using both like a ground pound and if enemy in the way its getting decked but could be balance with a long animation.
---
It's on a 20 hour cycle if I remember correctly and all the vendors cap totals are tied together.
---
That’s the one thing lacking in FO76 compared to 4. I’m not saying all the time. The sound of those things always creeped me out.
---
Vendors have a shared pool nowadays. Since he had stock, I dont think it was the empty vendor bug that sometines happens when he is still loading in.
---
Maybe they messed up the timer while playing around in the options yesterday. Id check back today, and if its still bugged report it.
---
I've not been able to find it the last three times.  I suspect it landed in the pond.
---
Silly boy you can't eat a trophy. Though they make great beer cups
---
Isn’t the Fallout series a survival game? 
---
Not trying to bash but it is different from Fortnite/PUBG etc
---
Make sure you’re close enough to it that the name of the creature shows up on the camera. I don’t think the photo counts otherwise.
---
No idea but honestly i’m lvl 225 and haven’t had issues repairing due to lack of materials since i was about lvl 30. Have had plenty of junk stashed so the repair kits are more of a convenience for me, and not a game changer.
---
Thank you for the report (and the gif!) we're on the case.
---
This is a list of links to comments made by Bethesda employees in this thread:

---
I'll drink eat, then hide do I can smoke or go poo, and by the time I get back I'm half fucking dead from dehydration or starvation.
---
It's in Whitespring at one of the vendors.  I \*think\* it's down at the end (Responders?) or across the hall from Artisan's corner
---
I guess more than 1 player, i got a anti-armor gauss for around 60 caps and my melee char got a spare all-rise now :)
---
And just because it's not working as you expect doesn't mean it's so grand conspiracy to get you to buy repair kits, nor is it an indicator of some grand attempt to slowly boil the frog and get you to pay. If their goal was P2W or even close, it would have been from the onset, not some halfassed "the game was good but now P2W" horseshit.
---
You say decay rates are "bugged" to be too fast. I say they were too slow to begin with. Before, I could cook up a small pile of food and ignore the survival aspect for the day. Now (on a low level at least), I have to actually stop and cook rather than carrying cooked radrat ass in my pocket like a granola bar. Considering how trivial survival is to begin with, I don't see a reason to care, with or without a fridge.
---
Do you have an argument at this point that's not a variant of [the slippery slope](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/slippery-slope)? If not, I suspect our discussion is without merit at this point.
---
If we're talking straight numbers. They're exactly the same. My .308 does 192 and my .50 does 192. .50 ammo is more bang for your buck. The .50 was edited in a recent patch
---
Yeah sure but I mean when they just ambush you in the middle of nowhere when and you get interupted, you just wanna go aaahhh scream back at them to shutup then carry on your mission, hopefully a wee bit heavier from something you can actually use apart from broiled brains and ultracite.
---
Like the dart gun from Fallout 3 
---
One shot 25000 damage to limbs crippling them.
---
I used to use it to hunt deathclaws I shoot all that I could find and then walk slowly the wasteland while they followed me until I bring them to other creatures that have them destroy it.
---
I think they need to nerf every single weapon in game by 20% damage.  Everything dropped from then on are non-nerfed.
---
Zero reports of it bricking your game. It can crash it making you have to restart the application, but not brick (as in lock it up and make the game and/or console completely unplayable). It’s a wonky glitch but it won’t break the game or get people banned.
---
Used hunting rifles early game but they are only good for sneak sniping. Use all levers now and they are great.
---
Did you submit a ticket or was it just straight to Reddit rage
---
Lucky, mine's mostly 1 star, as I don't farm much.
---
[deleted]
---
....sick
---
I didn’t think of this for some reason.  Thanks for the advice.  I legitimately needed both six packs, as I burned through all 6 already.  Hopefully this is resolvable in some way.  If not? I’ll live and carry on in the game
---
Ok, good to know.
---
I'm 130 currently, and constantly running out of screws. But thats about it though. Run out of steel pretty regular too actually. But thats just a uranium fever with scrapper away from a solution
---
There's an annoying bug where the mentats glow and the poison green glow stay on your character until you log off. Sometimes for me it also makes my characters body phase in and out of being visible
---
I did not think of submitting a ticket.  I will tonight and hope for the best
---
Its still better then camera challenges without a camera
---
If your bowel movements weigh 20 lbs, see a AutoDoc immediately.
---
"I TOLD YOU, NO PHOTOGRAPHS!!!!"
---
No, but some of the challenges can't be done by older characters (like discover x regions) because the character predates the challenge.
---
Challenges are shared across the account.
---
Did you read a few patches when Bethesda decided to flag everyone’s account that loads in to a non playable zone ?
---
Well doing this sometimes will make the screen prompt you with a location that does not exist , tell me how that’s not a risk of messing your game (brick , corrupt , banned )
---
Well, at least he has a high chance of dying from a fall and you can report him for exploiting (if his account hasn't already been flagged for using the glitch to reach inaccessible areas).
---
im disappointed to since it would have been great on my assaultron head that i use as a backup
---
Just as  a heads up if you do have bonus explosive damage as well as radius they do work on the explosives from the gun. This actually makes it less viable as self inflected damage (seems to) ignore damage reduction, and 90% of the things in the game want to hit you with some thing from right next to you. 
---
If you want a .50, Action Hero is really easy to get, and quite viable.
---
It's quite simple Friend if you don't know how to eat or drink.. Then the game isn't for you. YOU don't seem to understand the NEED for this mechanic.. if you don't like it leave. Bethesda isn't going to change the game solely around what YOU want.   
---
Fallout 76 is making changes, some good.. some not so good. Yes there are new game modes coming.. Nothing in the range of "Make the game so easy... we're pansies" so you miss out there Friend, Sorry!  
---
Other comments don't appear because people are raging in hate? Haha!!.. That's cute Friend, they aren't allowed to make their Opinions clear.. Quite simply,  because you want something you cant have.. And are being very aggressive and rude towards posters.  
---
My opinion is quite clear, I don't like your Opinion. And I find it hilarious that you can't spend 5 - 10 minutes making food and drink because it impacts your game time.  
---
Here's a little a sneaky for you Friend, free of charge... Make it a daily routine and thus the issue of eating and drinking won't plague you. I am curious Friend, what is your current level in game?  Please enlighten me.
---
We can't even get a real response on P2W from them, good luck.
---
Yeah! That’s my point! They’re also good for cereals, therefore food!
---
How could you miss that!
---
I didnt necessarily mean Horses but it would be cool, kinda like the last of us...Because the world ended people reverted back to using horses as a main form of transportation...🤔
---
My stealth sniper uses a lever action.  I only use the hunting rifle to save ammo but I would love for it to have a damage buff
---
Select the fucking challenges. It gives you an exact list of what you need to take photos of.
---
Same dude...same
---
&gt; Improved Repair Kits are not available in the Atomic Shop. They are rare items you can earn by completing in-game content. 
---
Some people may not like the basic kits in the shop, but I think having better kits drop in-game is a fair compromise. We'll see where it goes from here, I suppose
---
Didn't realize they buffed the damage
---
Its an anti armour explosive
---
Which pisses me off, because what's the point of the 105mm lens if you have to be within punching distance? I've been learning photograph as a hobby recently, and the camera challenge limitations is so bizarre it's driving me nuts.
---
Btw that one guy said he’s doing it adventure mode to avoid paying caps so tell me how In a way that’s not “cheating”
---
yeah
---
Noticed with water too
---
I'd be happy if the more rare mods were made more common. Having the plans made available would at least help drive down the re-sell prices of the mods. Ideally, it would be nice if you were able to create the standalone mod so you can trade it instead of having to give a crafter your armor for them to put the mod on.
---
&gt; How is this different than going into the Burrows during a nuke event? I tried it, was able to wear normal armor(with no ambient rads) 
---
This is also unintended. It's awesome to nuke The Burrows, but it shouldn't be negating the Nuke Zone's Rads. We're looking to address this in a future update.
---
/u/Valseek Any tips for us here?
---
Nah, you must suffer as we did. Server-hopping dozens of times, if not over a hundred.....muAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
---
K
---
What im saying is i havent changed any mutations or perk cards amd my damage has went down all of a sudden.
---
Ok on this I can agree with you
---
Ever since they broke it a few months ago, I've been taking care not to scrap all.  Are you saying that they fixed it and broke it again?
---
If you don't want to deal with being hungry and thirsty, then go play fallout 4 in any mode besides survival. Definitely don't agree with this
---
I would prefer we learn some really strange yell that works from a Grognak comic book
---
Worth reminding, nuke zones supposedly now count as rad storms for the purpose of challenges. Have yet to test it, but was in the patch notes.
---
Hi! Caught a similar thread on this previously and we're looking into this. Thanks for the report.
---
if you are in CT or EST, I can help you with the bunker.
---
I have a AAE 50, cal my question is wether or not it’ll be affected. Are you just saying that maxed grenadier and demolition expert will affect how the heavy gunner perks will affect it? BTW gear isn’t my problem I have several sets of sent assassin and other Sentinal sets and a great number of dealers with amazing Arsenals
---
I can't believe its not ultracite!
---
Just like a real X-01.
---
Make a poopy build with speed demon and marsupial and make sonic look like a turdle
---
Take a video.
---
Was your camera out?
---
Don't emote while you have a camera equipped.
---
Oh sorry... everything I've typed here applies to PVE. 
---
The reason for the balance with turning it off is that it still does provide an advantage over someone who chooses to have it enabled. 
---
For instance, with it off you don't have to carry food or water which will free up carry weight. Or expend the time finding resources to satiate your needs. This allows you more time to grind overall, which gives you an advantage from a time management standpoint by increasing your odds of getting that legendary or something. 
---
By getting rid of the positive effects when you turn food/water off, it still gives incentive for people to leave it on to get the little extra bonus to still be competitive, regardless if PVE or PVP. 
---
Leave it on and you get food bonuses.
---
Turn it off and the trade off for the food bonus is a bit of extra carry weight, more resources, and more time to grind.
---
I used to love longdogs glitch, nothing beats seeing a mongrels head on a 20ft neck
---
Yes but I then put it away and it still happens
---
You're right. Still randomized plans. Looks like I'll be doing a bunch of hops. Thanks for the help.
---
*insert baby cries* 
---
Stop playing if it bothers you so much.

 &gt; Hi! Caught a similar thread on this previously and we're looking into this. Thanks for the report.
---
Not sure how to do this one or the Sheepsquatch photo. AFAIK neither of these cryptids are actually in the game yet. I’ve heard others unlocked Sheepsquatch by taking a photo with the Wise Mothman but I tried last night and it didn’t work for me. I also tried the Impostor Sheepsquatch and it only counts as an Assaultron. I really wish they would be more diligent with these challenges.
---
I seen a bunch mod on a vendor yesterday.  They where 6k a piece I think. Not sure what vendor it was though.
---
Dead ones count go to Van Lowe's taxidermy and take a picture of the one in the back
---
A certain "shout", to "rend" it to land you might say?
---
I had a refined 50 sniper rifle and for a while it did well for me being a faster weapon to my Gauss rifle but got rid of it as I wasn't using it anymore. 
---
I got a 1* legendary lever action rifle recently and while it doesn't do as much damage yet due to my limited mods for that weapon, it is a quicker weapon than both my Gauss and sniper rifles, and is stronger than my laser rifle. It fits a niche where I need to deal damage quickly and the Gauss rifle would too unwieldy or slow or when I'm am having to restock my supply of Gauss rifle ammo! 😅
---
I don't see them taking that step to selling leg tokens.
---
Thanks for the report! We're aware of this one and actively investigating.
---
Because I’ve done it for hours. I know the weird loading screen you’re talking about. It’s saying the game can’t keep up with all the environmental loading. You’ll for sure get stutter, graphics glitches, then potentially a loading screen, then death. If you survive with the right gear or goat legs you’ll live but might end up in weird spots, like under the map or in a mountain. Your game might then crash, but not brick is what I’m saying. 
---
Bethesda banned players that intentionally accessed the dev room and took items out. That’s a little different than being flung randomly all around the map. I think until you get a single report of banning or bricking you should choose your words more carefully cause you’re kinda spreading false information. It’s good to report on. But with facts, not scare tactics
---
If anything, that is the real issue. That time was spent on this instead of new content.
---
10 out of 10.  Sarcasm as it’s finest!
---
Same here :/
---
Positionable welcome mats enable traps that the builder can funnel victims into. That's not an issue for now because only your team can fast travel to your camp, but next month anyone will be able to if you have a vending machine.
---
No problem :P
---
They don't

I think I ate them. Don't recall what effects it had.
---
Well written and organized, thanks.
---
I regularly use a Primed TSE 50 Cal, and a Primed, Zealot's Exp. LMG, for SBQ battles, they are both absolute beasts when it comes to DPS, just have to work a bit for all that ammo, I also have a FE Gatling, that one is much more ammo friendly.
---
But like. Repairing my super sledge man. It’s convenient
---
Basically, how I’ve interpreted what your saying is that if I have grenadier and demolition expert maxed out it will stop heavy gunner perk cards from effecting my 50. Cal? If so that’s ridiculous
---
Pretty much
---
Correct. It was fixed til this past update. I've been walking around with bulk for a while.
---
There’s no need for it if they make a new mode, like I told you, [I’m not alone neither are you.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_consensus_effect) 
---
No, you’re wrong, look at how you guys are treating me, I’m loosing all will to post more, others read this and don’t even try.
---
I don’t mind that you don’t agree with me, why should that aggravate me in any way? It impacts mostly my enjoyment of the game, always being concerned with crap mechanics.
---
I think I’m level 6 and I’ve a high level friend helping out, he’s providing the survival part, thank God!
---
Changing servers is easy, doing something repetitive and mindless is not difficult it's tedious 
---
I think challenging content should involve problem solving and teamwork. Doing the same boring 4 minute vendor check over and over is the worst type of content I can think of.
---
Same here!  No body no loot! I was disappointed.
---
I'm on Xbox.
---
It's definitely exploiting. Would consider it somewhat cheating as well. I managed to travel quite far in the once instance. I bet you could go across the map after doing it a few times. Hopefully they will fix it pretty quick.
---
I mean, don't investigate *too* hard.  I laughed more last night playing this game than I have in a long time and alcohol wasn't even involved.
---
Seriously though, thanks.  :)
---
Ok thanks
---
Toilet paper coming to the atom store
---
For real, the fusion core drain is ridiculous even with perks
---
I don't think the instancing will work how you expect it to. From what I remember from the screenshots/recordings of people who had glitched into the vaults there are terminals at the entrance that ask if your party is ready and to select [Continue] to begin the raid. But i think, for example, if I get there first with my buddies and start the raid then you won't be able to enter because we're already inside doing stuff.
---
I sure hope I'm wrong, because if there's anything this game needs less of it is server hopping.
---
My lever action just out shines basically all my guns. Faster rifle rate. With speed demon its reload is really fast I pump out more damage with it then any if my other weapons
---
Likely accidently sold as they are on the top of the list being an A.  It's super easy to accidently sell an item at the because of how the list jumps around highlights unwanted items, especially if there's any lag between client and server.  I go super slow at vendors waiting for syncing, sorry for anyone waiting behind me.  But it still can happen, wish they had added the are sure you wanna sell this legendary item or even this favorite like they did for scrapping but maybe soon.  I get it would be slower to sell all the junk legendary items but nothings more soul crushing to sell an item by mistake and not notice it till you've walked away and when you return it's not there.  FYI when you sell it by accident it often won't be in the vendor list until you exit the trade window and go back into trade.  So it's not uncommon to lose an item to someone else getting into trade before you.
---
As already said in this post that doesn't work.
---
God damn it, they're learning to fly now.  We're screwed.
---
I was starting to worry for a minute there friend!
---
Have fun!
---
You need level 3 picklock and level 3 hacker as well as what the commenters mentioned above. Solo gets really easy once you’ve been through and know what the terminals and the locked doors are hiding. If I’m bored I’ll launch every three hours. 
---
Troubleshooter melee helps as well. 
---
Along with being level 200+, I get it. I didn’t do a successful run until level 80.
---
I’m at 70+ hours and haven’t experienced one genuinely did not know what this was a picture off or why it’s tinged green
---
When you start behaving unethically everything you do is naturally suspect.
---
Yep that's pretty much it in a nut shell.
---
Unnecessary and unexplained nerfs to white knight and pipe weapon durability perks, why? Because not nerfing these means there's no point to repair kits and hence to money in bethesdas pocket.
---
Food/drink spoilage has increased dramatically, why? So they can sell fridges of course ( I'm surprised they havnt nerfed carnivore/herbivore and cannibal yet)
---
Previous fallout games you could buy AND sell ammo, why not in fo76? Because they eventually wanted to introduce ammo converters, which as you can guess is also bought in the atom shop. (I'm placing bets that this also comes out before player vendors so we buy it and not sell excess ammo to players)
---
 Bethesda has purposely created a supply and demand, a demand of items/services because of nerfs and phantom nerfs which they will supply a solution for $£€ which back when the game was released  wasn't needed.
---
It's the equivilant  of increasing the salt on fries etc... to make customers thirsty and buy a drink
---
Sometimes you have to wait.  Usually after 20-40 seconds it can show up
---
I see no evidence that the legendary spawns were nerfed. There are people reporting that some legendary enemies get their names overwritten by Diseased title, but they still drop legendary items as they suppose to.
---
As for Legendary Vendor. Well, we have no info on his mechanics yet. Maybe it will work similarly to Kadala in Diablo 3, only with every item you buy will be revealed as a legendary. Some, myself included, are stocking up trash legendaries in case we will be allowed to dismantle them for a special currency/junk that is used at that vendor.
---
I think the mods agree with the posts and so they don’t feel the need to moderate. 
---
Something is lacking in this sub and it’s disappointing because there’s so much future content coming out and the stuff that’s already come out and all I see are the same posts over and over and over.
---
I gave up on my second X-01 calibrated shock long ago, but at least I got the one, and the jetpack
---
shouldn't have bought the repair kits lol..... but goto the support they will help quick
---
Wow, a constructive, great idea that would encourage people to play the game more and make the Atom Shop feel less cash grabby, gets 180 upvotes
---
Oh god, a post about someone who’s played the game for 2 hours and doesn’t get the hate or worse, someone thanking Bethesda for fixing the game, 3k upvotes,  Silver, Gold, Platinum!
---
It’s definitely a new camera glitch. It’s super easy to replicate so it’s been happening to a lot of people. Every emote with your camera out does this. Can be survived with the right fall damage resistant gear or goat legs perk card.
---
Lol free fast travel for me
---
You too, FYI I honestly don't think you'll ever see the option to remove hunger and thirst good luck with that
---
Haha. Maybe reserve questions of ethics for things like euthanasia, starving masses and climate. It's a video game selling repair kits there Captain Drama.
---
They do nerf things without telling us. That's not conspiracy, that's fact.
---
seems to pop up a bit behind the Pumpkin House.
---
Happened to me, the body is still there, just look around it’s not hard to find it even when cloaked.
---
[Here’s one](https://youtu.be/uoht2eytEJs)
---
It isn't done correctly though. An example is the steady aim and long shot combo. I am physically unable to have those and the damage perks and armor piercing which all work together for long range sniping. I would increase my perception but I cannot have more than 15. The heavy guns perks work fine because the perks are split between luck, strength, and intelligence so you can work with it more. Making us choose in this fashion, where 9/15 (12/15 in rifles) points minimum are used just to bring your damage to a reasonable level, is boring and also extremely restricting and forces constant perk shuffling which ruins fun and immersion. This doesn't help variety of gameplay when you are only able to choose from a few weapons out of dozens for each weapon type since the others aren't even comparable in dps or usability. (Gauss or lever rifle are only sniper choices late game, handmade for closer with non auto or full auto, super sledge for melee, power fist/deathclaw/mole miner glove for unarmed, etc). It's a post apocalyptic world where resources are supposed to be scarce and life is supposed to be harsh, yes. But your character is supposed to be from vault 76, where the best and brightest were saved and raised specifically to deal with post apocalyptic America. You are supposed to have skills before and develop more once out there. Your skills should be plentiful and usable to deal with all the other harshness of the wastes.

Yup. I even tried the maxed out perk card this morning. Didn't seem like it really phased it any.
---
does is effect all vendors or just the vendors at white springs?
---
&gt;~~dont~~
---
Maybe its fun
---
I would buy bulk screws from vendors occasionally when i was doing my daily sales but haven’t in a long time, had 250 recently and almost had to start giving them away haha, been using a sledge a lot which takes no screws. Ballistic fiber is the only material i still occasionally buy in bulk from vendors cause i hardly ever wear power armor (vanguard/vampire build).
---
I ran the queen yesterday not even 30 minutes minutes after the server came back up. Finished her off in 5 minutes and got 3 repair kits as a reward. 
---
I spent all day day think about them. I just couldn't let them go. Until about 4:30, I had someone initiate PvP with me. I was excited. As we fought his guns started to change. I figured they were all broken. Until he drops behind a truck and comes out with all 6 guns repaired. At this point all I could think was "wow, pay to win? More like, pay to give yourself confidence that you can win and still walk away with 27 deaths and 2850 lost Caps"
---
I’ve done Path to Enlightenment solo twice. It’s not easy, I think both times I had under a minute remaining, but it’s doable.
---
RNG
---
The wiki says you can’t be in power armour when taking a pic. Anyone care to verify this?
---
Can’t seem to get the camera to recognize the slither slide no matter where I stand.
---
Like I tell everyone TSE PG  is a portable carpet bombing machine!!
---
and QE Poon   Is  best! &lt;3
---
Awesome article man, thanks for sharing.
---
And cut into their profit margin, seems unlikely.
---
Suppose lol
---
I already played Fallout 4 and enjoyed it a lot, but thanks. Not looking for your approval, I’m asking for an option/mode for the people that obviously don’t enjoy the survival.
---
Dumb for you, I always enjoyed Bethesda games (TES and Fallout) without this crap.
---
I reply at the same level, sorry I know it’s not the best thing to do, but if anyone thinks he can change the internet, he’s dead wrong.
---
Well we were asking for a fast travel while overencoumbered option. Not sure I like the delivery though.
---
Saw tge title of the video  
---
Noped the fuck out
---
I always saw Death Guard use of energy weapons as "out of character"... never used them. I always figured low-tech weapons made more sense for a legion of pus encrusted lepers stuck in power armour and Terminator suits.
---
How did you survive the scorched plague?
---
My portapoddy is aimed at the river behind my shack. Im prepared
---
Finally I'll have my dual yield western pistol duel.
---
One scene I am thinking off is a few people all with Heavy weapons taking down a scorched beast or Deathclaw
---
Well, an Atom, my friend is worth a single US cent. An Atom Shop item, however, is worth nothing and should never be bought with a US cent.
---
Must not have been playing long, there will come a time you've got 10,000+ caps and fast travel isn't even a concern for you.
---
Well it’s up to the individuals, when I server hop I usually clear the areas nearby as well instead of walking straight to the vendor. It’s just like shopping habits, some people go straight to the stuff they look for, others browse a bit and while doing that they might find something interesting and buy that as well.
---
sorry PS4.
---
..... So you're telling me, you don't even fend for yourself in this game? Please just stop.. You've gone past the stage of embarrassing yourself.   
---
You're level 6.. and your complaining about a game, you've barely sunk any hours into. Why did I not see this coming?   
---
I'm so sorry, I though you were an actual experienced player simply having a whinge. I'm sorry this community has let you down. I hope for your sake, with this game or even Fallout 5. They remove the survival element... and you get what you wish.  
---
God speed lil' Friend, god speed.
---
sorry. PS4
---
They are becoming a little more common.
---
Haha lol
---
Yes it is worn under armor, by casual it means that casual linings are put onto it
---
Do you work for Bethesda? Why would you argue against free Atoms? Lol
---
Try selling something if you get "vendor does not have enough caps" then 20hrs has not passed
---
I didn’t imply anything, you’re imagining things.
---
Whitesprings: Mobs, and flourescent/yellowcake/cobalt flux
---
Harpers Ferry: Mobs and violet flux
---
Watoga - North of prime fissure: Violet flux
---
Watoga - South and including prime fissure: SBQ and Violet flux

---
 &gt; We're aware of this one and investigating. Thanks for the report!
---
Could be, but i often see more good Legendary\`s at the vendors. I actually got better legendary\`s from vendor than with drops. 
---
But ever since i sold the armor i was wearing i slowed down my selling at vendors.
---
It’s a survival game...
---
Yes it does. Main tech against the queen.
---
Yeah, that's not gonna happen. The game is about surviving in the wasteland and rebuilding, eating and drinking are part of that. Bethesda isn't going to change that just because you want an easy mode in their online survival game. Obviously, 76 isn't for you
---
This happens to me so much since I use discord. I open the game, check the fallout 76 discord for anything new, then I have to restart my PC because the mouse is trapped.
---
Guests seem to spawn in at the location that the CAMP device was originally placed.  To solve this, have your wife move her camp by moving the device to a better spot while keeping the build area positioned to enclose where she wants her camp.  Then she should be able to place it back down in the same spot.
---
Or you can just fast travel to the camp a second time (not to a faraway place).  You're materializing inside the floor because you're materializing before the floor does.
---
Ha yeah sure, they may not be ablt to swipe at you with them when crippled but they still take their sweet time flying around bad wing or not. That's my expeiriance anyway
---
Your problem with ballistic is essentially my problem with screws. Being a ranged build and wanting all the mods, I do mass crafting regularly. 
---
I only use pa for nuke zones being an unyielding and weight reduction build.
---
Yup I've have aae sniper &amp; be lever with long nv scope is by far superior 👍🏻
---
Oh thanks
---
Fair points, but does it really matter in PVE?
---
Anyway, solution is a mode then, everybody in the same level field.
---
Moving the camp device will only affect where the player spawns in, not guests.
---
I need the queen
---
It makes sense.  See my other comments.
---
Given how fast the meters drop I really don't think this is intended.
---
Here read

And video [here](https://youtu.be/KhQ4O4R60jg) 
---
Fair warning I believe doing this multiple or even a single time would flag you in Bethesda anti cheat system ...
---
So don’t come whinning afterwards
---
Not everyone is, but most are!
---
It's the lining type used by some of the "casual" clothes such as military fatigues, flannel shirt and jeans, undershirt and jeans, VTU tracksuit, and grafton tracksuit.
---
Unfortunately, getting the last two tiers of casual lining is neigh impossible ATM (quests that are suppose to give you the plans for them are bugged and don't award it as far as I know) and it's not very good compared to the other lining types (gives you a boost to C, I, and L).
---
I wish they would have used the Enclave/BoS lining type instead or had the option to craft an "Outfit" version of the Tact Ops suit instead.
---
The DLC was probably offered for free so as to not split the player base when it comes to online matchmaking. They probably would have liked to charge for it but when games get to the point that’s there’s been 4 DLC releases and different players have different combinations of those 4 (e.g historically Call Of Duty) you end up with a laggy game experience because you are not matchmaked to people with very similar ping just those with the same content pass that are as close as possible to your connection’s ping. Treyarch’a approach with BO4 was to only split the player base 50/50 with a single pass for content all year as they acknowledged problems with the 4x DLC way of doing it. Personally I have to think that in terms of game longevity and how it feels to play (lag/performance etc) the free DLC route is best as the game does not always run smoothly as is, just imagine what would happen if the player base was split between those who owned the content and those who didn’t. Also with the free DLC/Atom Shop microtransaction format those that can only afford the game and nothing else are not excluded from experiencing new content or find themselves not being able to play on the same server as a friend who owns the content they do not, while those that can afford to buy atoms (if they haven’t earned enough from challenges) can show their support for the game or particular items by spending their cash. The atomic shop could certainly be less expensive but it is a necessary evil if all the concept artists, voice actors and programmers are to be paid for all the new content coming our way without splitting the player base.
---
Yeah even that would do, anything man, to get them to shutup and get down here and say it to my face!
---
Are rad storms rare?
---
Hmmm I see why you’d say that, but you can’t exchange an atom for a cent, so I’m not sure it counts as worth one.
---
Are the Scorched Killer's receivers factoring incorrectly?
---
Using any Scorched enemy type and a lever action rifle; hardened receiver shows higher dps than the SK.
---
Hardened Zealot Explosive - 182
---
Scorched Killer Zealot Explosive - 162
---
Until I while ago I never seen a single one, now they seem way more common. In my experience they are frequent east and south side of the map
---
Can you at least load them up on different slots at the same time?
---
FYI I agree with you, but I have to try.
---
More, IF they introduce it I won’t be impacted, either because I’m high level or not playing the game entirely.
---
Oh well, I guess I’m asking for others!
---
For how long tho, you really think you wont come back when the legendary vendor comes out?
---
See I understand not lowering the card values for the combat perks because that is just a blind buff, making things easier, but for the passive perks like lock picking and crafting and green thumb I thinks it's pretty pointless since there is no limitation on where you switch cards. Making some of the non combat related cards passive or just have a special requirement such as 8 or 10 in a section would just remove tedium from the game.
---
And so does all the Whitesprings bots, including the laser turrets.
---
I almost always get more caps for successful completion of an event than I  spent to get there. The only time I lose caps on events is when I get there with too little time left on the event to complete it successfully.
---
Watoga was absolutely nerfed
---
There are a few different under armors. BoS, raider, VT, operator (enclave), and casual. Each has its own advantages when modded to shielded. However, there is no shielded mod available or casual at this time.
---
Prepare for downvotes but yeah, i like them to.
---
Just found out my quad harpoon is now a semi auto with a drum and 180 rounds in it...
---
I know I misread it in the atom shop
---
Or you are perpetually encumbered with junk and walk everywhere around the map very slowly.
---
I’m tired of spending entire sessions unsuccessfully looting for scrap to repair armor and weapons.  Atoms aren’t easy to get, but it’s possible by just playing the game.  I don’t like them, but they fix an issue I have had since day 1 so I’m going to use the heck out of them.
---
I’m hoping that sending a ticket in resolves this in some way, as I spent over half my atoms for the two six packs
---
I’m just glad I have something to spend my atoms on for once.
---
Growing my own pistols does sound nice but going to have to turn it down. #SpellcheckPolice
---
Seriously though that would look epic and plus give a reason to add western costumes in atoms shop.
---
My first 4 months I was selling every legendary to vendors, I remember looking at sentinel assassin thinking, why would I stand still when fighting in PvP lol, sold. How much of the best 3* that I’m looking for till today, I may have sold? Ahhhh.
---
Where in Watoga is he? The only info I can find places him somewhere near the transit center, which makes sense.
---
Imagine duct taping for super sledge heads together
---
this is a good suggestion.
---
I've heard some pretty nasty technical problems that come about from using this glitch and you could get hit with a suspension/ban from Bethesda (who knows what suddenly rocketing to another part of the map could set off) for using it.
---
TL:DR - /r/fo76  members get angry, start using [a bad argument](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/slippery-slope) to vilify that dastardly Bethesda, makes itself look like Tumblr.
---
hush hush, if Bethesda gets wind of this they might make some really shit pay to win mechanics
---
Hi, we're aware of this issue and working on a fix for a future update. I also wanted to say thanks for the video!

 &gt; Hi, we're aware of this issue and working on a fix for a future update. I also wanted to say thanks for the video!
---
Not all of us play at your speed.
---
If you don't have certain perks, then yeah this is all a problem. I have the speed demon mutation, with class freak maxed out, so I can go without needing to eat or drink for over 30 minutes. Just need the right perks
---
👍🏻👍🏻
---
It's like the red stove.  You still have to know how to build a stove first.  You can't apply the red stove skin to an existing stove, you just craft it.
---
You have to craft the Sheepsquatch Assaultron head, but you need to be able to craft a regular one to do it, so it's a cosmetic item.
---
I'll take your caps!!
---
It won't work til they fix camp damage. I have every table available for anyone to use and only lock my upstairs "living quarters". I've lost two camps since Sunday afternoon.
---
It seems to heppen if the pylons go inactive when sheepy dies
---
Hitting the cap cap removes their value. People start giving caps away because they feel like it is a waste to keep dumping items at vendors even. 
---
Most of the maxed out folks I know put more value on highly sought out items.
---
Embarrassing myself because I’m having fun in a game? What?
---
Because I played prior Fallout games 3 and 4 and non of this was a thing, and yes I know they said before for 76, but I didn’t know if I was going to like it or not, that’s why I only joined the party now, and no, I do not like it.
---
I do not need it removed for Fallout 5, I only need an option, in order to have fun I don’t need others to be sad.
---
Have fun friend!
---
See you when the next update rolls out!
---
lol that better be military grade duct tape then.
---
3 days ago i got a level 40 anti armour explosive hunting rifle from a whitesprings vendor
---
Id say 5 atoms would be ok teetering on too much but yeah it would give a better incentive to do them especially when you're 5 atoms away from that sweet paint job.
---
Any info on how prestige mode will work?
---
Arrows with grenades attached to them. You are welcome
---
This. I'm rather happy not having Warcraft's Trade Chat in Fallout. Nothing like giving proto-fascists and tumblr trolls an unwilling audience to liven up a game.
---
An "Abby-Normal" type Robobrain.
---
Perhaps they'll introduce a second one, female this time, named Bev - short for "beverage"
---
That's not even a valid excuse here. Anyone can literally run into Fort Defiance, grab the ammo bags and surgical trays, and be out in minutes. 10 minutes is actually overestimating, and assuming that maybe you stop to grab some straightjackets as well. And unlike your "hour" example, this isn't an exaggeration at all.
---
They gotta prep us by making Fusion Cores and food/water drop faster so they can introduce Overcharged Fusion Cores and MRE Packages in the Atom Store!!!  200% Food and Water restored, 200% power for your power armor!  Coming soon to a P2W Game near you!
---
😂😂😂 
---
I’ve been racking my brain as to what kind of situation they would actually be useful for, but after thinking long and hard with much pondering it dawned on me that if you broke a Excavator calibrated leg while in the middle of nowhere far from any P.A workstation  rendering you massively overencumbered and unable to fast travel then it would be quite handy lol
---
That would make farming them way too easy.
---
Same with farming for xp at the good course🙃
---
constantly, yesterday had around 6 different 3 star legendaries and no drops at all worse one being a lvl 91 3 star legendary boss.

Naw not many agree, cya
---
I might just have to wait till the 20-hour period is up
---
Lol this and getting instantly infected while wearing a suit of armor.
---
So sad TT.TT
---
Who's going to do that? More importantly, who's going to pay for it? Puntting in an official chat system that is not garbage would involve moderators and a flag system to notify them when dumb shit might be happening on a specific server's chat. Considering the supposed population of the game, you're looking at a crew that's probably bigger than the current crew in its entirety, now that the game is on "add small content" mode.
---
Really should be what the harpoon gun should be. Add innate insane amounts of limb damage. Done.
---
Who doesn't bring a backup anyway? I carry a combat + bowie knife - my deathclaw gauntlet - and my lever action just in case... and don't forget my mothman camera!!!
---
Thanks for quitting!  It makes the game more enjoyable with no whiners around.
---
Will see about that, [I’m not alone neither are you.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_consensus_effect) 
---
According to Bethesda promises, paid advantages weren’t going to happen too, and here we are.
---
That Yao Guai doesn't look as stealth as mine. 
---

Lol
---
Or, if you're running a bloody build with PlagueWalker, just drink dirty water.
---
Watoga is nerfed bra, you want evidence? Go farm the robots there and come back when you hit a legendary....
---
500 hours is a looot of hours. I thought I was doing good with 6000 atoms
---
Brilliant, think I’m going to have to steal that idea lol
---
That’s exactly why i figured a lot of coding were probably done overseas where people don’t know what the assignment was and didn’t care. People who downvoted my comments had no idea what it’s like to work with overseas subcontractors.
---
Again, they're not gonna take out a survival mechanism out of their survival game, just because it's an inconvenience for you. Get over it, and go play something that's not a survival game.
---
Please let the new perk card add dual pistols.
---
instancing is probably a bit of a technical challenge because when a group of people enter the sub-lobby to enter an instanced area, beth has to a.) reserve their places in their 'home' world, b.) spin up a server/instance and admit those users into it, c.) maintain some link between them, as those users have activities happening in the 'home' world (plants/quests/fermenting/base condition)
---
Yeah, I guess its personal decision. Not really sure how their flag system works. Id guess that as long as youre not calling new cells you should be okay. But that is my assumption alone.  
---
As someone who has called new cells and remains unbanned as well as trying to break this game to the best of my abilities, generally repeated multiple times. 
---
This is how I know old vault purple(51?) Is now empty, and vault 94 no longer has a loading zone for its doors. Its clear theyre watching us get places we arent supposed to and then just removing them as we find ways in.
---
Yup surprise that went inside uncanny caverns and stumbled in to 3 legendaries there even a 3 star glowing mirelurk 
---
My assumption is that they will rotate spots to prevent having a hot spot for to long ( to avoid making it boring )
---
I'm super jelli
---
Can you confirm this? Gunsmith &amp; makeshift warrior are like White Knight in they make thing break more slowly..why would this work without them equipped?
---
As a melee build I totally am right there with you.
---
I would also be okay with something that allowed me to jump on their head and punch them to death
---
He's not arguing against them, he's mocking the overly entitled suggestion of 50 per event.
---
Will see, time will tell.
---
And I never said for them to remove it, get over it.
---
I'll hold onto a few when I find them. It'll let me drop gunsmith for SBQ fights for PA/fusion core perks, and not have to worry about gun breakage.
---
I gotta admit i probably spent about 20 hours so far just server hopping at whitespring looking for good stuff from vendors, but thats by far the best
---
There are a few cards that I think are busted right now, like vaccinated and Power User
---
Not disagreeing with the "this should be a skin, not a weapon" bit, but your videos don't seem to show your perk layout.
---
Pretty decent weapon - three star, (Furious/Explosive/Faster Reload) lever action rifle w/inlay skin, night vision short scope, suppressor, short aligned barrel and the modded butt stock with the ammo strap, (can't remember name; adds range and dampens recoil).  I'm on Xbox though :-/
---
He has to be dead?
---
Hi there Captain Insult, ethics cover far more than warcrimes and killing people. Lying is absolutely unethical behavior.
---
Then they're not gonna just give you the OPTION to opt out of a survival part of the game. Either don't play 76 until they release private servers so you can play with mods that make the game an easy mode, or don't play 76.
---
Wish I could get that kinda luck
---
Since there bats anyway maybe it should be some type a high sonar emitting gun of some sort or maybe a gamma gun mod, kinda like Lorenzo's artifact but sonar
---
How about alien
---
I noticed the eyes are different on the X1 helmet with this skin as well(?) I like the way they look way better than the vanilla version, but the skin is..not really my cup of tea lol
---
Maybe they make a new mode.
---
Why shouldn’t I play the game if I’m enjoying all others parts of it?
---
Here is proof of your experience I just happen to be recording my gameplay for SH\_ts and Giggles ... [https://youtu.be/FpUrpbyAShk?t=50](https://youtu.be/FpUrpbyAShk?t=50)
---
I haven't been into the atom shop since the update (although I got three improved repair kits as an SBQ drop) - how many atoms are they charging?
---
Maybe you are blowing it out of proportion. They said cosmetics only. Now there are repair kits!! There iS nO jUsTice!!
---
Cause obviously you can't handle a survival game that requires you to do stuff to...you know...survive. Like eating and drinking. Lol
---
Well i tried alive and it didnt work but dead is just easier either way.
---
"Weapon is craftable at weapon workbenches"

---
It's even in all caps.
---
Might have to restart the quest. Pretty sure the trigger youre looking for comes from biv.
---
At my experience you can:
---
\- wait for a couple of seconds and legendary item should appear in loot window
---
\- if legendary item did not appeared in loot window, look around dead enemy, sometimes item just drops on the ground, this happened me couple of times 
---
hope this helps ;)
---
Do you use VATS or Power Attack?
---
Three star, (Furious/Explosive/Faster Reload) lever action rifle w/inlay skin, night vision short scope, suppressor, short aligned barrel and the modded butt stock that adds range and dampens recoil).
---
I actually didn’t know all that about the spore carriers origins! I just hope the vault has new plant based enemies, not just the standard enemies but a strangler version. I love the creatures they come up with and it’d be a shame to have no new ones that originate from that vault.
---
Alien and the beast in mire are my next stop. Havent seen either in awhile though.
---
I can’t or I don’t like?
---
Survive? What a joke.

Bye! Wait. Who are you?
---
And what's left will leave soon over "P2W" armor kits, which is the only reason I approve of them xD
---
Also being over encumbered drains it fast.
---
I got 3 legendaries yesterday -- zero legendary loot. :(
---
1 for 50 
---
6 for 250
---
&gt;  because I’m having fun in a game? What? 
---
Now that's a lie, and we both know it. You seem to be doing a lot of complaining for someone whose supposedly having fun in game?  
---
&gt; Because I played prior Fallout games 3 and 4 and non of this was a thing.
---
Partially correct. Fallout 4 did have a "Survival" mode for those who wanted a challenge. This is Fallout 76, a Live Survival MMO game. Welcome to change baby!
---
&gt;  yes I know they said 76 was going to have it, but I didn’t know if I was going to like it or not,   and no, I do not like it. 
---
I'm sorry you don't like it. But there is no need for an "OPTION" or a "Server" dedicated for those who don't like the Survival element. We all knew what we were signing up for.. Even those that just *recently* joined the game.
---
&gt; in order to have fun I don’t need others to be sad. 
---
And making this silly post isn't making others sad.. ?
---
I've never seen an alien lol
---
Pretty sure your entire post here is a joke cause, wow, dumb suggestion. Go play fallout 4 or literally any other fallout game. Bye ✌🏻
---
If you don't see the tourist you need to server hop
---
Great idea, think il do the same tbh, I’ve only got 6 in intelligence so it will be great to be able to swap out weapon durability perks for something else like,stabilised and nerd rage 👍
---
You got me worried this was a ptw move to add weapons to the atom shop, knowing that you need the plan to craft it it doesn't look to me like a ptw more like a bad idea.
---
 Why would anyone think making it a weapon instead of a skin was a good idea? I would have bought it if it was a skin, got a nice legendary for it too.
---
Yes, there are many many many reports of this stuff.. it wasn't hard to find some examples.
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/search?q=stealth%20nerf&amp;restrict\_sr=1](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/search?q=stealth%20nerf&amp;restrict_sr=1)
---
No on power attack. Occasionally use VATS, but zero changes on the way I play generally.  But drain seems to be working on a x10 multiplier now compared to before.
---
Yeah living mobile plant monsters would be cool like a swamp monster similar to the one in Black Ops 3 zombies.
---
\^yep
---
So does this mean you're also going to add radiation to the inside of Whitespring when it gets nuked? That would be super annoying.
---
Same here. I want her for the front of my shop to show it off.
---
I think so, but not confirmed.
---
That's the same thing that mine does and it doesn't seem right.
---
I noticed you missed that first shot. There seems to be a hit detection issue or something throwing the accuracy off. Missing a shot with that thing is brutal.
---
I don't know what your set up is but I can get mine hitting around 150 without any aid so a sneak critical should be doing somewhere around 6k damage.  To take  only 50% of the health of a level 65 doesn't add up, I've got a bloodied VATS critical black powder that drops that much health and it only hits for 4k without aid. The black powder rifle reloads on a fraction of the time and if I holster it's loaded when I pull it back out.
---
I'm not saying that a quad assaultron head doesn't hit hard...... I'm just saying that it's not a good weapon. I'd expect to be able to one shot a level 65 SB after spending that much time charging it and running around defenseless chucking grenades.
---
I don't understand how people think these are pay to win, all it does is save you some junk, who the fuck cares, over repairing is still significantly better.
---
Is it really reasonable? Did Bethesda tell you it wouldn't? Because they continue  messing up durability, food/energy consumption rates with updates. Some of these bugs have existed since the game started and creep back many patches after being fixed.
---
I think it is reasonable to expect we will be dealing with durability changes that are not in the patch notes until Bethesda changes the way they operate over at the studio office.
---
As far as the mooks asking about repair kits I am not sure that is the unreasonable option if all you are trying to do is apply max dps. I hate them because I know that they will end up the go to for endurance fights eventually because they are faster than running to a workbench if you have the need.
---
Its been awhile but i see atleast 1 mothman a day
---
guys, don't downvote someone just because they are unfamiliar with the lore, bunch of dicks...  I gave an upvote to help...
---
Seems new, had it happen on 2 of 4 runs last night.
---
Never mind I got it I just crafted like 5 nuka shine and he eventually took one
---
LoL proly true
---
Precise .50 receiver does 2 less dmg per hit than the hardened .308, with 180+ greater ammo production.
---
If you're already doing enough damage to 1-shot anything, why not lose 2-8 dmg points for QOL?
---
I keep under weight limit/personal carry limit. If I'm not under weight I'm using buffout, scrapping, selling or dropping.
---
The Watoga matter was put to rest a while ago: they added the keyword that blocks an NPC from spawning as legendary to the Watoga bots.
---
They just forgot to tell us, oopsie daisy.
---
Yeah I noticed that, thanks for the answer though. The zoom from the 105 mm lens, don't help either. It should be close and wait a few moments until the camera shows the name, it is not counted as complete otherwise.
---
Good to hear, GL in the future.
---
Not always, when they are going to go hunting absolutely, but some people get caught unprepared.
---
No? 10 mins? Christ man.
---
Dont know. I'm OCD about the numbers I guess lol
---
Mothman isn't an alien lol
---
Well i dont think it counts. Id have to try
---
Hell, I'm at 3k and could not care less.
---
Thanks. Seems reasonable-ish. Good to know that it'll be my cheapskate nature and not righteous indignation keeping me from buying them.
---
I have sold many 2-3* lvl 45+ items to vendors other people gave me saying "its a good weapon, keep it" but ran out of box space.. :(  
---
Usually weapons I don't see myself using, like melee or heavy guns.
---
They didn't buff the damage, it's been like that for quite some time...
---
You just need to be sure you're buying the standard 50cal receiver not the refined one. Only the standard one is equal to hardened 308
---
You can spend the whole day or two in Watoga trying to find a legendary robot if you need evidence.
---
Imagine that this happens in real life while doing a selfie. Peace sign &amp; you're superman :D
---
I had it happen again.
---
It's like the exploding legendary bots whose bodies go flying and you can't find it. Just wait and a meat pile will show up where she died.
---
I love it\~ and I'm so excited for that GO AWAY sign lol
---
I got a TSE 90% weight laser rifle at Grafton station yesterday 😂 makes me think that was someone's whoopsie
---
These weird.  I'll have to look into that I would assume standard would have the lower damage
---
If you're taking 20 lbs shits you might want to visit a doctor...
---
Oh wait, they're all dead.
---
Carry on then...
---
20 lbs is 9.08 kg
---
I do agree it has something to do with server lag, or could even be local lag on our end.  Very hard to say. 
---
Although, definitely not *input lag*.. that's an entirely different thing related to your TV.  (Typically noticed for example if you want to turn your character say 45º, you then let go of the joystick, and your character continues turning for another second or so, resulting in say a 120º turn -- making it nearly impossible to actually do what you want.)
---
Every "crowned" enemy has a chance to spawn as legendary. Most times people don't kill them once they see one and server hop, leaving it alive to take the place of a legendary that could've spawned for the next guy.
---
Definitely submit a ticket, they are great at sorting atomic shop issues, I had a problem with one of the items once, I sent in a ticket and they responded within an hour and gave me an instant refund of atoms
---
Well, it was worth a shot anyways. Thanks for testing it out either way!
---
I saw a video saying the Capital building is great if Ghouls are spawned in there
---
Same story here
---
Yeah I just traded my TSE handmade for a second TSE lever
---
A lot of complaining? What? I just asked for an option. And yes, having lots of fun, at least for now!
---
Yeah, I never used it, yes I know, that’s what I’m talking about, the irritating useless part (for me).
---
I will decide if I think there’s a need for it or not, recently Survival was added so there’s hope, but I respect that for you there’s no need.
---
Some are sad true, but there’s no winning scenario when you’re giving an opinion on something, specially when for some reason people feel offended by it.
---
There is a Manga where the MC takes a arrow to the knee so he has to step down from being an adventure.
---
it seems the quest progression doesn't register when I fast travel, is this a bug?
---
The flavor text for standard 50cal only says "changes ammo type to 50cal"
---
The flavor text for refined 50cal say "changes ammo type &amp; increased damage).
---
Refined is 2 points of damage worse than standard. It makes absolutely no sense but oh well....
---
I killed a super mutant and looted the body, then he made a comment about me hiding on him, then he did a death grunt, then the body exploded into bloody mess.
---
VATS is currently chomping through the charge of fusion cores.
---
Check yourself... Note the charge level, activate VATS, shoot a few times, check again.
---
We do have that special weapon. It's called "perseverance".
---
Happened to me, but I didn't look in my inventory.
---
Damn, this is a great tip.
---
So basically what you're saying is that you're entitled and expect people to continue updating a game with new content, while not being paid, just for you.
---
I noticed that for a few weapons that while hardened receivers says superior damage some of the other ones that just say improved have higher
---
I'll have to check that tonight. Whatever it is it's waaaaay off from what we've grown accustomed to.
---
What about the one in the vat in tnt dome?
---
I've noticed this too, but when it won't swing, I've also noticed that the VATS is 0%.
---
I got attacked by 2 players, one in the enclave officer stuff, and the other just wearing normal stuff, the one in enclave armour attacked my base, blowing it up and destroying it while his friend kept emoting me and started hitting me to try and get me to attack him. pathetic really.
---
I got really sad when I found out that the Crossbow reloads like a Shotgun if you have Quad on it.
---
I don’t think that one completes.
---
it should be next update instead of future. I appreciate the hard work everyone has done on the game but why not release hot fixes, especially on pc. I would rather have 15 small bug fixes per week and a big patch every tuesday than wait a week or 2 just to fix issues that are breaking or hindering game play
---
Level 200 drops me alot of legendarys and then server disconnects
---
Hey man, I am saying they said cosmetics only, which is objectively true, and it is also objectively true that the repair kit is not that.
---
You might not give a shit, but I never said what you are exaggerating right now, and personally I would appreciate it if instead of us trying to have a discussion where we exaggerate what we think of what the other person is saying that we actually address what the other person is actually saying.
---
People are still playing this shit? :)
---
Didnt say he was just pointing out i tend to find him alot.
---
I know I'm late but I'm confused as to why you'd think it wouldn't be popular in the U.S. I'd love to hear your thought process
---
I’ve been trying to link up with you for several days, haha.  You always goto main menu as I log on.
---
Happens for everyone. I don't think it's a bug. They've said that more of the main quest will release with Wastelanders. Or at least a new main quest
---
Smh how can something not complete?
---
Yea i see that but in the news and in this it says its supposed to be a skin.
---

---
Wait have you completed it ?
---
I’ve always wondered this myself. I’m guessing it’s open ended for anything that gets added later
---
I think it’d be cool to have something similar to a nuke zone but have it be a malfunctioning GECK zone instead and pretty much make it a reverse nuke zone, maybe with the plants in the area (the ones that’d usually become nuked flora to harvest) becoming some sort of spawn location for enemies/enemies themselves. The radiation cloud from the nuke could be replaced with a giant pollen cloud too if they wanted to make it as similar as possible to a nuke zone! 
---
Hopefully with details about vault 51 not being present, it could be added in with that vault.
---
OK, gonna have to draw a line here. I put up with people calling *required patches* "DLC", and calling resource extraction "data mining", but I will not sit idly by when people start to misuse the term "brick". It's a term used for hardware devices that are incapable of being returned to a powered-on state, usually due to firmware corruption. It is impossible, by definition, to "brick" software. You could corrupt a save or even the game executables, but none of that is irrecoverable. Words have meaning people.
---
Mine is stuck not completed since the first month from launch . I already found all the holotapes and journals , killed the husband but the mission is still there and no map markers . Challenges confirms o grabbed all the items
---
Hell yes, I bought this as soon as I saw it in game and placed like 50 of them.
---
Well we were talking about aliens and u brought him up... lol. Dont think we can do this weekly challenge cuz there's no alien
---
Someone was able to get to the Legendary vendor at somepoint last week if I recall.
---
I like to think of it as an Easter Egg reference to Skyrim than a bug. JK I am really tired and wish the game would load faster and was a bit less laggy but that will happen when I win the lottery.
---
yes, but it needs to be toggleable, also the new challenge tracker needs to be toggleable as well, NOTHING should impede my view of the map, I was so pissed when they added that, it's still annoying af...
---
That's wild! My FOV was maxed out when I loading in last night after the patch? (PS4) I've never touched the FOV before? I moved the slider back the other way now it's maxed in the opposite direction and barely any change? I hope thy fix this camera issue, FOV issue as well. It was almost game breaking trying to play like that with the FOV issues..
---
You didn't let him regenerate. 
---
There was an issue in the starting weeks that legendaries not regenerating didn't drop. This might be it.
---
I think what they’re trying to do is reward exploration by making things discoverable in the world. Results are clearly mixed. 
---
In some cases I like it—like the cryptid side quests. The idea of searching for information fits with that content. They’re also not heavily hyped additions, so you don’t have a million players hunting all at once. 
---
The camera quest should’ve been done like Nukashine and Lying Lowe though, or at least been available in a constant location. Server hopping to get publicized content is a terrible implementation.
---
Upvoted for, "Because bullets are bullshit."
---
A 20 lb shit huh...
---
The Sheepsquatch ticked off when I took a pic of a wendigo, I did the wendigo as my 1sr cryptic photo but when I looked to confirm it had checked off the Sheepsquatch was ticked off too
---
&gt;I will decide if I think there’s a need for it or not
---
Sorry, what? Didn't realize you worked for Bethesda.   
---
The reason why people are "offended" is because of how stupid this opinion truly is.. You're level 6 and you don't do anything for yourself, you've said it yourself.. you have a high level "friend" feeding you and giving you drink.   
---
Hopefully you learn to survive for yourself.. Because if your not putting in any effort then you'll end up making yourself miserable. And hopefully your "friend" doesn't feel like your abusing his generosity by expecting food and water from him.. Take a little intuitive Friend and use some of this information people have provided you with, and grow to enjoy the game for what it truly is..
---
How about they also fix the broken challenges for location discovery? I still have several locations undiscovered according to the challenges menu like the galleria, even though I've been there several times.
---
while i do not show my perks when i go to make it you can see that on the right side i do have the required perk for it.
---
I mean, if you want to, by all means go for it. It's your money and i'm not here to tell you what to and what not to spend it on. I personally am not really too jazzed about repair kits but if you like them, more power to you my dude.
---
With games the days it is very dangerous to try to remove code from the game, so they try to put as little as they can into updates without breaking something.
---
Use terms that people don’t know , and your open to be misunderstood , some are no code monkeys bubba
---
Unless you have protection from fall damage.  Then emote like a madman.

---
So because its not blatant in your face full bore tencent P2W "horseshit" its not a problem. They said cosmetic only mirco here is a quote from Pete Hines
---
  “All the content we ever put out for Fallout 76–all the DLC, all the post-launch stuff–is going to be free. That’s important. And to say, the Atomic shop is cosmetic stuff. To make sure folks understand–look there’s a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we’re going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works and what you’re getting for your $60. That you know, when they put out new content or features or whatever, I’m getting that stuff for free. That feels right.”  
---
They are in the process of crossing that line 
---
I would say boiling the frog is a correct way of putting it.
---
Agreed. The player experience of new content is really uneven. Much as I appreciate the new content, it's hard for casual players to find. 
---
On the other side, there's the new content that gets flooded by Reddit users. The Encryptid event often requires server hopping to find a capture site that isn't on cooldown. I guided two friends through it, and the mandatory repeated server hopping meant that it really didn't leave as good of an impression as it should have.
---
Yes pls! With LFG system trow all maps(servers? not platforms). Just check your other game pls Elder Scrolls Online! I liked there the tons of dungeons!
---
So what are you asking for it?
---
Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!  This is why we can't have nice things.
---
In the second video my level four character character doesnt have the plan for the salvaged assaultron head yet the game is showing i can craft the imposter version.
---
As long as everyone can be a jack of all trades in the game, I don't think player vending will work. Why buy anything from another player as long as you can make/repair everything you need.
---
I wonder if the guy in the Nuclear Winter holotape is the one in the Overseers holotape. Where she encounters a masked cloaked man that badly injures her and is found in the Mountainside Bed &amp; Breakfast.
---
I have such a great collection of armor and weapons that I really can't keep extra stuff even if it is really good. I often sell Unyielding armor even though I use it, because I just keep the best pieces I find. I end up selling a lot of really good pieces to the Watoga vendor. My teammate makes me laugh when she sees them there and asks me if I want her to buy them for me.
---
If you are dumping 20 pounds at a time, I suggest you visit the nearest wasteland doctor ASAP...
---
I just lock my doors to feel like I have a since of privacy I keep my ine water purifer locked but my extractor is free game as I have no use for steel anymore luckly it's a single foundation build so I can move it anywhere should I find a better resource to farm
---
The Welcome Mats you can get work for workshops and settlements, but sadly not the camp itself. I would love a welcome mat for my actual camp.
---
Lots of the Enclave equipment seems to been a last minute design effort.
---
* Forest scout armor left arm ballistic base DR is still bugged. 12 instead of 25.
---
* Plans were put in for scout under armor mods, but not for X-01 and scout armors mods.
---
* No plans for crafting any Enclave related gear (under armor, X-01, scout armor, uniforms, etc). 
---
* Scout armor mods are not labeled correctly, necessitating the need to purchase blindly and hope you get one for the correct slot. ie. Three different mods (arms/legs/chest) all called "Scout Armor Polymer"
---
* The only legendary version of scout armor is the chest piece you get when you gain access to the command wing of the bunker.
---
* X-01 prototype paint disappears from the paint options seemingly every other patch.
---
* No Enclave forest/urban paints for the X-01. The Atom Shop X-01 camo is different from the scout armor camo scheme.
---
* Equipment acquisition gameplay for the Enclave is server hopping and running to two vendor terminals in the bunker. Enclave missions rarely pop and rarely reward Enclave equipment. When they do, it's equipment that can also be acquired from a MODUS terminal.
---
I experienced this too, but in The Mire and it had red paint. It was following me for a little while until a group of high level super mutants took it down. Ngl I was pretty sad, felt like NPC companion died but wouldn't be coming back. I was heart broken
---
Yeah. Part of the problem is I've already explored most areas. Now I'm having to go back and comb over places I've already been, as the new stuff gets steadily drip fed.
---
Would have definitely preferred the camera was in a set location. 😑
---
Haha.  Sorry man, not trying to dodge you.  I should be on later today after 5pm EST time.  I’ll look for you when I’m on.  Is your PSN the same as here?
---
Waiting on the anti-Semitic joke in a reply
---
Plus if you’re game gets corrupted useless badly executed or anything along those lines I doubt the company whose terms of services are clear and use such method for and to avoid things...
---
Just don’t try to be over everyone else saying that this should be called this or that the point is understanding the risks of potential damage
---
The pupils light up when you turn on your lamp too.

I have a TSE Minigun, I fully equip it out with all relevent heavy weapons perks + demolition 5, its an absolute monster

By upvoting, can I steal this idea?
---
100% they should have toggleable map icons, I regularly want to look for only mines or only caves only towns ect...
---
i gave up trying and am sticking with the T-60 at the minute
---
sounds like you dont know the definition of pay to win actually.
---
I'd rather they simply carry more than 2-3 mods at a time since they don't have the plans. Keeps them rare as intended but hopefully won't require as many server hops if you go looking for a specific mod.
---
No.  But search this forum, you’ll find some answers.
---
It progresses everytime you correctly take a photo.
---
They specifically left it open for expansion pretty sure.
---
Nice any new info?
---
😂😂 haha I just have them scattered in my lawn and on every shelf in my camp
---
He's getting downvoted because he's being a dick about a spelling error. Not anything about knowing the lore.
---
 Weightless gets in the way of better mods for BoS Combat Armor. I have decided most mutations are not worth it. Some sure are but many are not. A piece of Chameleon in my BoS Heavy Combat set allows me to murder Harper's Ferry with my Combat Knives. No problem and little damage. ;)
---
Wasn't going to try to jack with your deal or anything since it was your post, but I'm on XBOX and that is a nice gun.
---
How about a big net gun like the ones they use to bring down drones but obviously much bigger and the legendary effects could apply to the net like electrified, poisoners, extra heavy, fortified so it breaks slower as the SBQ tries to get free/throw it off. It could be designed to last only for a short time requiring it to be used more than once and net ammo to be crafted for it 🤔
---
Lying Lowe itself was pretty decent, but the start points were clearly placed at train stations. Hell, you could start it from your own camp from the, free atom store poster. Same with Nukashine.
---
I've taken a break from trying to get the camera as my last hop ended with a server disconnect. Standard.
---
😔
---
Finished it with my second character by finding them in perfect order. Otherwise the quest is stuck with my first character and cant be completed :x
---
i'm somewhere in the 80's just server hopping and i check every time i log in which is every day so that would be well over 200 server checked
---
Yessir!
---
Guess I don't know what the difference between the alien and flatwood monster is supposed to be. Guess I don't need sheepsquatch.
---
Every time I see someone on hear say conspiracy, in a smart assed way, the next week data miners show it wasn't conspiracy, but fact . Watoga was nerfed , fact, proven. Everyone that talked about it was attacked and shamed. But then a week later proven to be correct . Ignore the trolls. Or better yet block them .
---
Honestly I'd like to see more Wacky Wasteland stuff and unique legendary weapons/legndaries. I would also like to see a buff for energy weapons so they are actually useful. 
---
The rest of what I’m gonna say is me just spit balling so keep that in mind.  It's also crossed my mind that there could be legendary mods that a person could find and attach to their guns at a bench. Like how about an explosive receiver with the negative being reduced range. How about Ghoul Slayer, Scorched, etc. receivers being interchangeable so that a person could go to their camp before each location? Get rid of the overabundance of 1-star legendries and actually make them significant?
---
I have completed almost every challenge and now my only income is daily and weekly.
---
Before they make daily so hard, or bugged i could do 700 atoms per week, playing 1hour daily.
---
I believe that the repair kits are indeed a slippery slope. But they have to make money. And I want to keep playing this game and I want the updates to remain free. I am in the group of thinking that it's not as big a deal as many people are making it out to be. And that entitlement and complaining and taking every screen shot and quote from the developers as promises that mUST be kept. 
---
This gs change during development of big projects like this and getting all worked up and calling things 'unethical' is juvenile and silly to me. 
---
In the end it's just a video game. And the only people super upset  it seems are hardcore gamers. Casual players like myself dont get that worked up about a video game.
---
Tbh I agree with you, I dont see the point of player vendors. For 1 the vendor would have to be at their camp, you have to find it first and player camps don't stay when the player logs off. You might get the odd player buying your wares now and again but most of the time you won't be selling anything unless your camp is on a common area with heavy player activity
---
It does seem to work on dead stuff, though, if you want to kill the thing first .
---
/r/fo76bazaar
---
/r/fo76marketplace
---
I believe I made a soup with them.
---
I was being playfully facetious!
---
I know, just too lazy to Server hop til I find it myself
---
Tbh I have not really thought of anything else, all I been looking forward to is the player vending so I can watch players go into the wasteland drunk on nukashine  and blowing everything up.
---
if thats the case then that sucks, im not gonna stand there waiting for it to regen to full while it knocks the S\*\*\* outta me. guess im gonna be stuck with my 1 star instigating powerfist forever then.
---
yeah it's risky giving a random stranger you power armor, prices on the market can get really high
---
The normal Assaultron Head plans are now kinda buggy as well.  
---
I was at the BoS vendor in Whitesprings. Saw he had a plan that I didn't know: Assaultron Head. I was like weird, I am pretty damn sure I already know how to craft that, but it's been a few weeks since I've logged on, so maybe I'm wrong. It was only 1200 caps and I was too lazy to run to a weapon bench first, so I said screw it, and bought it.  
---
When I read the plan it gave me two messages (and the wording may be a tad bit off, it was like an hour ago): Cannot learn plan, Assaultron Head already known. And it also said: Learned crafting plan - Imposter Assaultron Head.  
---
I then ran to the crafting bench, thinking I just got a free Atom Shop item, but it wasn't there. Soooo I spent 1200 caps on a plan I already knew, which isn't a big deal to me, but I'm sure it'll piss off a lot of people who don't have a surplus of caps.
---
That switch from helpful and open to closed off and alone sounds super sad :( i havent ran across anyone actively trying to destroy my camp but im sure there are more helpful and appreciative (such as myself) people for what you tried to do than ones just destroying for fun.  
---
I wish you the best in finding friendly adventureres.
---
As a non power armor user i like it this way, but I understand.
---
Awesome vid and summary. Love the harpoons, I had hoped they would fix the Lock n Load perk which is bugged when using harpoons. Apparently it’s not a priority like the repair kit.
---
That's another question.  I understand the trade off for deep pocketed vs. Ultra light build with carry weight less the reduced armor weight but does going deep pocketed negate the weightless piece? Meaning, am I still getting the benefit of the mutation allowance albeit the armor weighs more? Remember, I have no mods/plans to bounce between ultra light and deep pocketed. How I trade for it will be what I run.
---
You exchange a few cents for a few Atoms and Atoms are used for goods and services
---
For me, I didn’t think I had to explain that.
---
If I didn’t had my friend help I probably would have quit the game, that’s what others might do too.
---
Stupid is the way most of you replied to me, it’s beyond stupid and really immature.
---
We’re friends, not only game friends but friends. I doesn’t care about helping me, in fact he enjoys it, he also enjoys the game more if I play with him.
---
I also help him in other games like Dark Souls, we’ve been playing together for many years.
---
I think I’m going to continue to enjoy the game, I’m just sure I would enjoy it more without this crap.
---
Thanks and have fun friend!
---
&gt;Heard I even have to learn the plan a second time
---
Interesting, because i noticed a week or two ago that even though i've learned the plan long ago, there's an plan for it marked like it's unlearned in vendorbot inventories now (think it's BOS vendor)
---
I am assuming it's being left open as we haven't found the Overseer yet and they may be adding to it later. Or could just be a bug :/
---
I've seen them already on etsy.  But yeah, I'd like an official one if it's completely accurate.
---
Thank you all!
---
Been having an issue with enemies not taking damage and then one hit killing me. I recorded it last night. I couldn’t do damage to a glowing ghoul and when it hit me, I literally exploded. When I re-spawned, I was inside of the nuke zone, totally naked, and my hazmat suit was nowhere to be found in my inventory. 
---
I’ve also noticed technical data dropping (but not able to pick it up) wherever I load into the game for the first time and enemies that hit you can teleport you far the hell away. I was hit by a scorched last night at Valley Galleria and teleported to the Burrows North.
---
Having trouble joining you
---
Impostor Sheepsquatch doesn’t count. It only registers as an Assaultron. Flatwoods monster pic also doesn’t register as an alien, and neither do the taxidermy one or the dead one in the truck bed. So I don’t think this challenge is possible to complete. Thanks, Bethesda!
---
i know me too
---
Give me a laxative syringer and I will welcome you to the waste land!!!
---
This idea I like:)
---
(taps forehead)
---
It's not stealing if nobody knows you stole it
---
But...
---
that imaginery person must not buy repair kits because Bethesda promised.
---
I don't quite see the connection how someone is bent over what someone unprepared and impatient is doing, or not doing.
---
You missed Tyler County Fairgrounds - that's where we found him yesterday.
---
I'll stick around for a little bit more.
---
Thats why PvP in this game is cancer. 
---
Why should i play in a PvP environment where everyone in PvP is using Assassin/Sentinel/Powered gear with 300+ DR, Dodgy, Serendipity, Born Survivor and Stealth boys. While also only using AAE/Vats/Vats-CR Auto rifles, QE Doublebarrels, AAE Combat Shottys or Legacy TSE's. 
---
The only way pvp is going to be fun is if we get the following:
---
1. Legendary Power Armor.
---
2. One-shots reverted. 
---
3. Endurance to give WAY more HP per special point. Like 15.  
---
4. Increase Full-Auto Rifle vats cost. 
---
5. Need Rock-Paper-Scissors Perks/Mutations. Example below. 
---
* New Intelligence Perk; SCRAMBLER: Anyone within 10/20/30 meters of you cannot use VATS. 
---
* New LEGENDARY Mutation; Dragon Scales: Take 50% less damage from bullets. Take 50% more damage MELEE. 
---
* New LEGENDARY Mutation; GIANT BOY: Deal 50% more damage with Explosives. Take 50% more RAD damage. 
---
* New LEGENDARY Mutation; Radiation Man: Deal 50% more RAD damage. Take 50% more Energy damage. 
---
* New LEGENDARY Mutation; TANK Man: Take 50% less damage from Melee. Take 50% more damage from Explosives. 
---
* New LEGENDARY Mutation; SNOW Man: Take 50% less damage from bullets. Take 50% more damage from Fire. 
---
* ETC, ETC. 
---
* **CAN ONLY HAVE 1 LEGENDARY MUTATION. CLASS FREAK DOESN'T REDUCE NEGATIVES.** 
---
The point of above is to have people running different Arch-Types to provide some variance in the people we encounter. 
---
For now pvp is trash.
---
The Weightless effect doesn't care about what you mod the item with.
---
Well thats just fucking perfect. No wonder it wouldnt work.
---
I was referring more of his stint at lionshead.
---
if even a little of what he said would be in the games actually was in the fable games, it probably wouldn't be a dead IP now.
---
Great to hear you're aware of this. Looking forward to having it fixed.
---
Anyone know where the tourist can be found in Whitesprings?
---
They are for bitch about P2W, LIES , “Slippery Slopes” and creating content for you tubers. *Seriously, they are there for convenience.
---
 My BoS Heavy Combat with Dense on the Torso and Strengthened on the Limbs is practically immune to explosives. I laugh at Muties tossing Nades and will use my Auto Grenade Launcher as a melee weapon. ;)
---
Everyone always says that the Atomic Shop is a cash grab, but let's face it...Bethesda has to earn money on this game.  They've gotta pay the devs who work on the new content and fix the bugs, not the mention the expense of running and maintaining servers. I know someone will say, "meh, Bethesda can afford to keep these things running on their own", but that's not the way businesses work.  The whole point of a business is to make money, not to entertain us;  and if something becomes too much of a resource drain and becomes a liability, you better believe they will drop it.
---
I do agree that there needs to be better incentives for people joining events; I just don't think an influx of free atoms would be good for the game in the long run.
---
I had a kind soul post that they had it on their server- like people call out the Grahm or the special vendorbot.
---
He was on survival because 20% xp boost. I jumped on roof, because i am mutated.
---
And didn't kill him, because i didn't know he is threat, so he took his chance and was fast egouth...
---
Survival is not duel, you may not know location of your enemy.
---
Yes you can kill everyone in duel, because most 50lvl builds are twohits=kill, but when you don't have first shot, you may lose.
---
bullshit is thinking you are the best :)
---
that might be what they are planning long term, short term it seems unlikely
---
Damn, what a find. Explosive doesn’t drop on energy weapons anymore. I’m jealous lol
---
Have you tried popping an addictol. Addictions used to not display correctly sometimes.
---
Sorry I'm trying, keep getting disconnected from server
---
Then perhaps don't post silly requests for Options  that warrant no result or need on reddit. Pretty simple.  
---
In concluison: You're a level 6 who hasn't played the game or figured out to to survive. Go figure.  
---
It's 1:10 AM, and I'm heading to bed. I enjoyed verbally sparring with you, and I hope to see more of your "Opitions" on reddit in the future. 'Til then... Good-night friend. And Safe travels in the Wastes.
---
When he’s close to death just rush him and transfer all on death
---
Throw your keyboard! Relish in the shame!
---
People also had imposter Assaultron head plans drop from the event. Would be interesting if this was meant to be a free dlc weapon, like the Fixer. Maybe it *was* meant to be a reward and someone told them no
---
Happens to me too all the time on xbox. Persists between servers. Need to close fallout 76 completely to get rid of it.
---
I had the same issue. Two weaks long some dudes name wouldn't disappear then out of nowhere it just did.
---
This is perfect!
---
I'm really hoping, "Nuclear Winter" will have scheduled changing seasons, each with different effects. At a minimum, significantly increased rad storm occurances, shit along those lines. Anything to make the environment more like FALLOUT and less like FARCRY.
---
no it's one of the factions in the game, carry on with the main quest line and you will meet the or you could go to the Abandoned Waste Dump in the mire and start the quest there to meet them
---
Its in the shitty update section
---
This list doesn't have the Cryolator, Flamer, or Assaultron Head. Still a really good tool OP. Thanks for sharing
---
Tested, and this did it for me.  I was trying to get past the Mayor for a day question and kept picking up the holo tape evidence before I accessed the terminal.  Accessed the terminal first and it worked fine.  Cheers!
---
Like a tamed animal at your base that respawns? I'll need to try this
---
Happened two for two times to me last night.  
---
BIG HINT: Stick around, the imposters body will eventually "meatpile", which looks just like a melted protectron.
---
There finally, thank you!
---
My name does that sometimes. Even without a mic plugged in. Dont know a solution. It just eventually went away.
---
Omg thank you!!!! This has been bothering me for a long time. I always wondered why it had been like this but now I know. 
---
Too bad they don’t show up in effects for me.
---
NICE! Wish I could get those Manson Lamps without the gross looking skin LoL
---
*You have contracted bone worms.*
---
Id like to see if it would allow you to craft it or tell you that you lack the original plan.
---
Haven't heard anything about it since announcement, but it'd be stupid of them not to do it. God knows the flame brigade would be all over that like stink on isht.
---
I want some kind of bastard raider modded missile launcher that shoots a weighted net to bring them down!
---
Maybe...
---
Did you try the corpse or the X-rays in TNT Dome #2?
---
Report it to Bethesda, they should at least remove it.  Or set the damage to 1 on the weapon.
---
You take a stand againts repair kits, yet pretent as if you are defending Bethesda for implementing them.
---
I’ve been saying this the whole time. People will spend real money on nice weapon skins and PA skins not garbage hairstyles and emotes, it’s a shooting game ffs. I have several variants of each weapon, I’ll give them all different skins if available, so I know what I’m using at any moment. Bethesda has a gold mine staring at them yet they managed to ignore it, and focus on garbage fantasy items instead. The senior management team members are probably mostly 70 years old and don’t play their own games.
---
It's great if you're a nurgle fan.
---
i never got involved with all that, but if they were in the dev cell then they are or will be in the game at some point
---
Yeah even tried those too :(
---
It wasn't working atm, and then I leave the server to hop on different server (relog), it worked.  I had to do the server hop for the cabin.
---
 Yeah but its useless unless you go whole hog and that is not worth it. So many better pieces available.
---
No fix for the plasma gatling bugs yet 😒
---
:( I have no other ideas
---
Yep, nothing like loading into the game and being reminded of the fifteen times you were required to take photos naked for atoms.
---
more mods would be good
---
Can you grab a video clip?
---
oh, just noticed that, but is he really being a dick?  I mean sometimes pointing out syntax errors in jest can be harmless, he wasn't like "hey asshole you spelled Enclave wrong!", now that would be being a dick about it...
---
Thanks so much!
---
Try one of those fake alien statues
---
This whole thing is F'd up ... it's giving me credit for pictures of things that i absolutely have not taken.
---
I think when the game released it had a decent amount of content. But I do believe that they should have started rolling out additional content sooner than they did. But it seems that Bethesda had to handle getting the game stable and deal with hackers / dupers first.
---
Where are them?
---
For me, the questline not finishing is a QoL issue.  I want an empty inventory.  EMPTY.  Instead I have nearly 20 holotapes I've had no reason to listen to since November, and probably 50 keys and cards I can't get rid of.  NV had a key chain - what a wonderful thing that was!  Misc is a pain every time I have to check if something ended up there all because they can't re-implement something as simple as a damn keychain.
---
The quest can stay open ended, but do these tapes have to be permanently tagged as nontransferable quest items?
---
Thanks mate.
---
ok cool
---
It happened on my last one. If you find it, just hang and wave everyone over.
---
In the first video the lock symbol on "Science Expert" is on for both of the assaultron heads, meaning you need to equip that perk.
---
I've never had anything game breaking as this before. And that's really odd. A messed up FOV makes the game unplayable
---
Thanks! Between this list and looking for the concentration of people on the server, it should make it a lot easier to find.
---
It's fairly easy to get a full 1* set, but 2* &amp; 3* is a slightly different story
---
Oh, the irony...
---
There is a fake alien head in lowes taxidermy
---
Still can't find it
---
Use the markers from map provided. My plan was to start at one and work my way over to the locations provided. I got lucky and the corps spawed at the first location. 
---
The corps is dressed in colourful clothing green/yellow or green/blue I can’t remember. 
---
He looks more recently dead then most of the rotten bodied we commonly rummage in. 
---
1. Place ur market at the same spot that is marked at watoga. (Right at the y in the road). 
---
2. Go to the location you musk marked 
---
3. If the corps isn’t there. stop wandering around like a lost donkey, and either jump to same location in a new server or go to one of the other locations provided. 
---
4. He’s quite easy to spot if he is there the colourful clothing makes him stand out from what we’re used to looking for. 
---
Camera kinda cool if ur into that thing. Hopefully the upgrades are more then just zoom. An infrared/night vision/enemy marking like recon scope and the Pearly peepers would be cool. 
---
More likely it’s going to be Snapchat filters lol
---
Try that and if it doesnt work, id just look it up
---
“everyone who doesn’t have the same opinion as me and has the same rights to express it is a CRYBABY!”
---
you’re a child.
---
did you find it in the world or at the vendor
---
Maybe you have to kill the FW monster twice.
---
This is a great idea, i'm gonna check it soon
---
Just wear the dress like a man!!
---
Agree
---
Same. I have also never fast traveled out of an event simply to return to my base, repair my weapon, and then join the event again.  This is why we carry back up weapons. The only conceivable situation I can think of in which a repair kit *might* come in handy is if my PA leg armor breaks and I suddenly find myself overencumbered way out in the middle of nowhere. But my PA rarely breaks, so there's that...
---
Weightless is great, as the chameleon effects works any time you have a weapon drawn, standing or sitting..  
---
Get a random phone call wall stalking someone in PVP, np, if your weapons drawn your "moderately" ok...  
---
But getting a full 2*+ set can be a challenge..
---
username checks out
---
You don't shave?
---
The reload for the hunting rifle seems a bit better, it can also take armour-piercing magazines and recon scopes. otherwise, the lever action is better.
---
I have a VampE flamer that is nuts fun. I bleed fuel though, so there's that.
---
I'm actually not a huge fan of TS on lots of weapons (AGL for one) as the burn rate on your condition is just so painful. 
---
* You don't really need it for anything but the toughest bosses like SBQ
---
* A TS version will absolutely not last most SBQ fights due to the condition drain
---
Maybe you have to find the FW monster twice.
---
there are still parts of the bunker that are sealed, it's probably part of the new main quest line thats coming later in the year
---
it’s basically the same except it’s unfiltered and you can only take pictures in first person, other than that they just become regular loading screens and you cant even display them anywhere
---
I would be using it if i could find one. They're impossible to get a hold of.
---
^same here.  Just have to watch the sub.
---
Definitely, I was thinking about this earlier today. Idk why there wasn't one on release, there's so many locations and it would save a lot more time than googling the location
---
It's good.
---
Uh what, no. 
---
It's lack of ammo.
---
Awesome. I've been trying to recollect more maps again.
---
It's good to know I still have a chance.
---
DO IT FOR HER :')
---
I cant figure this out. All of my armor is legendary, and for some reason none of it shows up in my Sell items except for my left arm. I tried putting a different legendary left arm on, and still thats the only piece that shows for sale at vendors. (With the exception of my under armor and outfit). Would be nice if equipped items just didn’t show up at all.
---
Yeah, that's a really good drop. I'd hang on to that if I were you or if you really wanna sell it, I'd ask no less than 3500 caps, but I'm sure people would be willing to buy it for more.
---
With speed demon the lever action reloads fast as hell
---
that would be a lot more fun
---
Yes. Especially if you have maxed out heavy weapons perks. Would trade.
---
I think it would be nice to be able to hide it if you want or even to switch it to your other arm but there are still options - even if you're roleplaying as a wastelander that didn't come from a vault - you could always roleplay that you found it on a dead dweller (like the one in the port-o-potty at Dolly Sods) or traded for one from the friendly Dwellers of Vault 76!
---
Are the weapon stats the exact same as the normal Assaultron weapon you can craft?  If they're in any way better, then we've gone true P2W then.
---
Killed the husband ?
---
Poisoned points, explosive/incendiary tipped, field points for penetration, broad tips for bleed damage etc. Lots they could do arrows and bows/crossbows
---
It's the event dude that's all it's good for
---
I've literally said it from the beginning that the AWOL EVENT is good nothing else about the area or location being good for anything
---
my digital character should not have to groom his hair, imo
---
I want you guys to set up your camps across from each other with a nice shrubbery between.  Not too expensive, I mean, just a nice one.
---
I'm at 10k+ and I still pinch every penny.
---
Should’ve put some Alestorm on for the broadsider, otherwise, great read!
---
Good luck. I forgot to mention it was a savage divide map but I’m not sure that matters.
---
It’s such easy money for them since weapon skins require no new mesh or animation, just open photoshop and modify a few diffuse and bump maps. The ‘silver’ excavator skin really shows how lazy they are. With the amount of work they put into bone raider skin they could have made 50 weapon skins yet it seems so difficult for them.
---
The Sheepsquatch ticked off when I took a snap of a wendigo for some strange reason
---
This happened to me last night. Twice.
---
Stay around.  The body eventually Meatpiles.  It looks just like the protectron pile, so clean up everything while you wait.
---
5 to 7 minutes of patience,  and POOF, metal meatpile suddenly appears with your 1* wood leg.
---
He’s in charge of public relations, marketing, and is the Vice President over at Bethesda. He is a high ranking, highly visible member of Bethesda, and unless otherwise stated, his statements might as well be a statement from Bethesda, especially when they are directly in reference to one of their products.
---
If Pete is making official statements that do not reflect the thoughts and opinions of Bethesda, then he should not be making them.
---
Pro tip: Use the search feature been asked a thousand times
---
I don't understand why Bethesda is so limited. MMOs with exponentially larger player counts and only a fraction of Beth's budget can do all this relatively easily
---
Interesting. I took a Wendigo, Mothman, Snallygaster, and Grafton Monster pic so far and those are the only four that checked off. Ugh :(
---
I don’t remember does tnt dome 2 have a dead alien?
---
If you are on PC I'll buy it from you. How much do you want for it? IGN: jchamlin
---
If it’s painted with an atom paint you won’t, at least that what I’ve found.
---
Same friend. I did "cheat" but when we got banned they said it was only temporary... This is seeming like a really long temporary ban... It's like they don't care to unban us or never intended to. I've learned my lesson can I come out of time out now? No response though.
---
You mean like ESO where you have to pay another 60 bucks or buy a dlc to access them?
---
A.) true, you don’t. However you should always be one step ahead of your opponent. That is why they give you a stash box at every red rocket.
---
B.) we’re not talking about whether or not it’s a necessity. Junk is still used for other things, it still, 100%, has a use regardless of the repair kits.
---
C.) see point A.
---
I’ve only just got Reddit 😂
---
There was a repair skill true, but it was used to do things like repair generators to power up doors and fix broken down robots, not equipment.  Fallout Tactics had vehicle condition, fixed with the repair skill plus kits, but basically the same setup/use as 1 and 2 except for that.
---
But you are 100% correct that repair was in 1 and 2 :)
---
I read someplace that Nuclear Winter might be Enclave related in some way, so there is still hope!
---
&gt;!Something about some data mined dialog pointing to MODUS shenanigans. !&lt;
---
i can't kill the queen most of the time without the server crashing, getting ultracrite body plans are really annoying and a waste of ammo when we can just go to fort defiance and get them
---
Sigh....I really wanted to that second I realized what happened.  my last session ended with a server disconnect, so I am quite salty tbh
---
I honestly do like this game.  Sometimes I get emotional just running around my home state, visiting the places that I am unable to now through the game.  I just hope that one day the game will function as it should...
---
bet you anything that the guy in the nuclear winter holotape is still a fuckin robot when we find him
---
Yeah well I won't pity you for being too strong but I feel you. 
---
However I feel like it's cool to not play fully optimized in pve, as it doesn't really matter (even that deathclaw probably wasn't a threat) and it opens other possibilities. 
---
But I admit and agree it's incredible that this game requires us to NOT play at our max. Sounds like an edgy anime trope "I don't need to use my full power on you. This is barely 60% of my final form".
---
maybe it's just that this is new? all the other ones that do it already were new at one point, too. it's tough to be patient in the timeframe of playing the game, software is hard.
---
Okay cool. I bought it from the harpers ferry bot for like 400 caps. Didn’t know if it was a good roll or not
---
Silly for you, I didn’t know how the community would react, I will use official feedback from now on.
---
I’ve played tons of games including Fallout 3 and 4, I know what’s going on, like I said, I would prefer to be forced to use this crap mechanic.
---
Thanks! Same for you friend!
---
Yeah man that's a legit great drop. I wouldn't sell it for caps, I would try and trade it for a weapon that you could use.
---
Texture vortexs arent uncommon. But generally are along the world border. Most of the time you can pass through them if you look in a proper direction and move correctly. 
---
Its tricky, just takes practice. Without bird bones though, you will likely die from the impact as when you hit the bottom you tp up to the floor.
---
Gotta buy them serums son!
---
Yup. That checks out. My left arm is raider armor, i have no paint for that yet. Thank you!
---
But still would be better if equipped armor stayed off the sellable list at vendors.
---
Can you post a screenshot of your Holotapes inventory showing it with the Overseer's holotapes not being marked as quest items?
---
Destiny 2 does this seamlessly. 
---
Walk into a "Lost Sector" and it loads into an instance for you and your team, no loading times nothing. I think most places including Silos should be like this
---
Its how I turned all of the commie posters into positive propaganda. Down with these capitalists!
---
yeah ive had this alot on PS4, very annoying
---
Clarity.......when you say chameleon effect you mean the mutation. So,  if I go through with all 5 armor pieces being weightless and have the chameleon mutation I'll be invisible if I'm holding a weapon and I'm standing still or crouching?
---
If this is accurate I think I'm good with following through with a weightless set. I agree that 2* and above is tough but gotta start somewhere.
---
On Xbox unfortunately
---
yeah i was thinking the same thing, the presidential section of the bunker is still sealed so if we can be a general why not the president
---
Its the instigating with sneak bonus that maxes my damage out on that character.. if i cant kill it in 2-3 hits im a dead man.. i cant survive 2 hits from an 80+ deathclaw.
---
since it'll be instanced there should be timer based on the player's last time they went. Similar to how Vendor caps are.
---
Especially when you are an idiot like i have been (twice no less) and you unequip starched genes and lose one of the damned things.
---
While i do feel adventure mode should just eliminate good/water need (from a fallout prev games perspective), its a survival game.
---
What i would like to see is food and water decay at half or a quater of the speed they currently do, in adventure mode that is, to make it less tedious in general; as well as decreasing the spoil rate to half what it is, again for adv mode.
---
Im interested is it on pc
---
Hmmm...seems rather pointless. But I am personally ready for display stuff to be introduced. Specifically I want PA displays but who knows when that may come
---
Is not working! I'm gonna check the dome as someone else suggested
---
Fingers crossed it randomly pops for you with one of the others,I think the alien one is going to be my nemesis 🤔
---
God I wish the Tac Ops Suit had an option to be overarmor. I would make all of the FBI from R6 in a heartbeat.
---
Here i am with both science and gunsmith equipped and showing that when i go to make the imposter one i do not get it despite me having the required perks and materials. 
---

---
You would harvest fertilizer from it
---
all fun and games till they think your teleporting via hacks and get permabanned
---
That sounds like an improvement to me!
---
Would love if they added the plans.
---
So when is this happening and where's the stream at?
---
&gt; the whales don't have to have repair perks anymore
---
There is no way I would drop my repair perks in favor of a repair kit.  Repair kits actually handicap a player in that situation because you're only repairing to 100, or at most, 150 percent.  Perks let you repair to 200%.  
---
&gt; you'll still spend more time repairing and finding ballistic fiber than they will
---
This has nothing to do with repair kits.  Once you hit higher levels, for some reason, "rare items" become so much easier to acquire. I haven't had to farm ballistic fiber in a long, long time and actually unloaded about 300 ballistic fiber into a blue suitcase a week or two ago to clear up stash room.
---
I have never fast traveled out of an event to return to my base simply to repair a weapon and rejoin the event.  This is why we carry backup weapons (which have been repaired to 200% via perks).
---
Because of this, I think most high level players will avoid them. The advantage of repair kits would primarily be for lower level characters who haven't build up a decent arsenal or cache of materials yet.
---
Just my two caps.
---
What system
---
One-shot kills often result in no loot. Probably the system treats that as an exploit and doesn’t handle that well. Try to actually fight your Legendaries next time, it’s likely worth it.
---
whats sad is the freaking justification of it. they said the atomic shop was going to be cosmetic only and stay cosmetic only now they're changing their words up and the fanbois eat it up while negating the fact they had to change it to ingame advantage now. I'll give beth one thing they have a dedicated fanbase even when they get smacked around on a daily basis.
---
Only if they chop it down with a...….HERRING!!!!
---
a really nice drop i say.
---
That would be so cool
---
stats are the same but its still can but it does appear in the weapon crafting for new characters.
---
it would make sense all the other plans are in the game
---
why the downvotes? he’s playing fucking survival mode you stewed prunes
---
Gear stats are unchanged from 1-100% durability, anything past that will buff your gear which is why the upgraded version of the AS kit can only drop off the queen, and that takes you to 150% increasing your gear stats significantly.  I guess if you call a situation where 2 low lvls where pvping and one managed to destroy a piece of gear thats probably shit anyway and said person chose to repair that crap mid-fight then were all in serious trouble.
---
I'm lvl 160 and stopped counting a long time ago xD
---
Ran around with the better half last night completing the Bucket List quest. I took all of the pictures for the quest in power armor and they counted. However, none of the pictures I took for challenges counted. We couldn't figure out why she was getting challenge progress and I wasn't until I hopped out of my armor and successfully got credit.
---
Lmao nice
---
So quick explanation as why it's good:
---
Gatling gun shoot pretty fast to begin with but that faster fire rate will make it a littéral shredder. I have one with that affix (not the other unfortunately) and its insane how fast it shoots.
---
Combine to that the anti Armor permet which is legit top 3 best perks (with bloodied and furious) for a weapon, makes it a very great weapon. Furious would probably have been better with that fire rate but not sure and the math is out of my league.
---
And the bonus Rez while reloading is quite sweet seen how you'll empty your clips super fast. Better not fall under fire !
---
Good weapon. Enjoy it.
---
Last star on Incisor, unless you prefer having the flexibility of only having it consume 2 points.
---
got this bug yesterday
---
I don’t think I’ve seen either, since beta. 
---
I don’t know if I’m super unlucky or just don’t play enough but still.
---
No they won’t
---
in the second want it says that my character is not high enough level to craft it. if i had a character that was at level 25 that doesnt already know the plan i would upload another video but i dont. might just have to grind another character.
---
Thanks, that's what I had assumed.
---
If they're "caught unprepared", then they're probably out exploring and farming, which means *they'll have junk on them*.
---
Chill, this isn't pay to win, it's a bit of convenience for some players with more money than time.
---
"But it's a slippery slooooooope". Meh, We'll see. Til then, speculating about it is nothing more than a reason to pound keyboards.
---
Ps4?
---
It seems to happen a lot at random, could be a perfect lock and still not work.
---
You have to make and use film with the new camera.  I'm only going to use it for daily/weekly challenges
---
Happens all the time. Now if only I could get through a SBQ fight without a server crash. Might be able to pick up some serum of the recipes she drops.
---
im not sure an underarmor that noone will ever see is worth $7
---
it doesn’t matter how good hunting rifles are cause ive used lever guns for 40 levels and can’t go back
---
It is a "survival" game :)
---
What sort of reward do you get?
---
I have a stash full of 3* items waiting for the legendary vendor. So i sell lots of AA, bloodied, furious and the unyielding, etc... to the whitespring train station vendor. I know its stuff that other players will want. I would drop it on the floor, but it will disappear too fast. At least at the vendor, i know its quite likely other players will see it there. 
---
I have a feeling once player vendors and the legendary vendor gets added, we will be seeing a lot less good stuff being sold to faction vendors, if any at all. 
---
So take advantage of it while you can!!! 👍
---
i'm level 131, people have been posting that they are losing items when server hoping so it is a risky option
---
250 atoms for the bundle one, must say you need not worry about me purchasing them, If I earn 20 atomish every day I aint wasting it on a simple repair.
---
At least tell us pc/Xbox/PS4.
---
There is a bug that will cause the vendors to show zero caps.  Once you sell them something the value populates.
---
For me, it's not so much Ham radio as much as a general "I'd like to have some help!" / LFG alert that you could enable on the map.
---
camp mclintock has a server hoppable nice amount of ballistic fiber weapon pouches and some military grade duct tape
---
Your mileage may vary, I've done about a dozen SBQ fights from start to finish and I have yet to see a serum recipe.
---
Mostly just ultracite vent plans:/
---
What's more I've seen it mentioned on here before that the serum recipes were inexplicably and erroneously removed from her drop list within the last few patches.
---
My only TSE is a Gatling Gun. So i specced my perks to match and for the most part it just tears through most enemies provided i keep my distance.
---
Exactly, honestly Im thinking that Bethesda just forgot to add them to vendors pool and this might just be a simple oversight.
---
Very intresting. Could you provide the perks used, particularly intreted the damage one? I get the impression you got 3*3 on heavy weapon damage and 5 card on explosive.
---
Either as ingame screenshot or 
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
you can also use the camera in areas where the photo mode camera "cannot fit"
---
Bethesda -- the *best* bugs ever.  How do they do it?
---
Level 2-25 place your CAMP near a river, Between Flatwoods &amp; the Overseers CAMP is a good area, collect &amp; boil water, plant crops (Corn, Mutfruit, &amp; Tatos, good to eat and left overs make adhesive), use the workbenches in Flatwoods for your crafting &amp; repairs, a cooking station, Stash box &amp; bed is all you need at first, later when you can build Water Purifiers, then move to a more central location to minimize your travel costs.
---
The Tedious Grinding you have to do early in the game helps you learn to manage things as you level up, all FO games have always been this way specially when played in hardcore mode, easy modes, and too much help remove an important part of the overall game experience.
---
I like the feel of the hunting rifle but cant get past the higher damage and fire rate of the lever action
---
TS LMG with +25% faster fire, and 15% faster reload.
---
Also weighs 20lbs.
---
Yes, it shows the lock removed and the item lit up now. 
---
Only other possibility I can think of is the old bug that their crafting system fails when the crafting materials are partially in storage and partially in your inventory. Have you tried moving the necessary components to your character?
---
They had to take serums off the SBQ to make room for the repair kits I got after a SBQ fight tonight.
---
Any movie posters or magazines with a picture of an alien?  Its a stretch but I cant think of anything else.
---
The only time I wreck camps is when people have been hostile/rude to me/my team. People who grief while we're selling to other players by killing / harassing customers etc. I will find your camp and I will level it. 
---
Other than that - I would never mess with someone's camp other than for people who lock them, I always try to find a way in such as an unlocked door on an upper floor - workbenches by the windows etc. I don't really understand the point of locking your camp as no one can steal from it anyways other than your crops which can't be locked.
---
It's a bit odd, but I've had some real success using Pacify on them, resulting in them landing immediately a fair amount of the time. Doesnt always work, and they may just fly away and not bother you if you dont shoot it again quickly. Honestly though, any of those scenarios are better than dancing on the ground for 5 minutes.
---
they were the only ones not to get a vendor in whitesprings with the last patch so they may have just missed it
---
yeah its sad but true
---
Yeah, it's not content designed for a team of 2+ people if there are three different teams rolling through it.
---
Ya, I agree.
---
level 35 quad only as the legendary 60 points of damage with bloody mess and the three gunslinger perks at rank 1. if i were to get all gunslinger up, have the perk that increases crit damage and have a level 45 quad i might be able to one shot it but who knows. also ive missed many many shots with this thing even with vats saying 95% chance to hit even against a super mutant that was standing still i missed before. think the vats accuracy is off.
---
Yeah, but BGS has a habit of not doing things like the genre has normally done. If there is no limiter it will just mean "clear instance, server hop, clear instance, server hop, ad infinitum"
---
It's very hit and miss.  Sometimes I can go for hours.  Sometimes it conks out in the first 10 minutes..  But what I can say is that if you join a server that friends are on, you'll typically be able to rejoin them.  Meaning that when crashes and disconnects happen, they happen for *just you,* not the whole server.
---
Personally I am a bit made that the tub and toilet are in poor condition. I know it is the apocalypse but I would at least make my tub look presentable if I am going to wash myself in it.
---
Thanks for tips! I will try to use them.
---
Normally I don’t play hard or survival modes, I’ve got enough hard in mp games.
---
I needed water and food for my settlers in FO4 though, I have a huge farm!
---
Yeah I always like to repair camps that I come across randomly -  especially downed turrets.
---
Lol I’m interested. You guys build an arena for it? Also what system..?
---
Yeah. Nukashine and Lying Lowe were really easy to start. The server hopping issue is only related in that it's a "player experience" issue with new content, which might not have been apparent to designers on a test server.
---
Mine are normal, PC.
---
Won’t do it. I won’t be bullied! :)
---
TwoShot Explosive Lever Rifle?
---
Why do I lock my CAMP? I didn't get along with you people when we in in the vault, and now you want to interact with me. I have nothing to trade with you, I don't need your help, and I certainly don't want your "improvements" to my minimalist style home. I know my chair on the roof is an airplan chair. I dragged the damn thing half a mile from an airplane crash to put it up here. Don't try and replace it with you cushy lounge chair that's just gonna get ruined out here. Go back to Whitesprings where your biggest concern is a few ghouls. Lord knows you won't make it out here much longer. I built my CAMP in the far eastern part of the Mire, away from the train stations and deep in a higher level area, specifically to discourage visitors.
---
That being said, workstations are on the roof, which is open air. If you can find a way up there without breaking into my bottom floor (I will shoot you if I find you in my private space without my permission), you might as well make use of  the equipment. Also none of my purifiers are locked, and my resource collector is open. Steal to your heart's content.
---
All jokes/roleplay aside, I mostly play in survival, so you really never know. Sucks to come home beaten and bruised from adventuring only to be slaughtered while you sleep by some guy hiding in the corner. I have set up the helpful camp before. Had a little building with like 5 beds, several water purifiers, and access to all the workstations. Then I decided I wanted to make my CAMP more mobile, and actually kind of enjoyed playing the hermit.
---
I did two SBQ fight s last night got 3 upgraded repair kits both times. I think it’s gonna be a a regular drop from her from now on. Like the stable fluxes.
---
Weirdly mine got checked and counted when I snapped a whitesprings assaultron for the robot challenge. Specifically the one by the garage next to the service entrance. 
---
Also tangentially related: I took literally 50+ shots of a vertibot/cargobot caravan from every conceivable angle in Watoga last night and literally -0- pictures counted toward the vertibot/cargobot robot challenge.
---
I swap out bloody mess for super duper, even though I have all the recipes, I still don't want to risk losing a mutation and not realizing it until much later.
---
No, there should be no timer or limit. Why? Just let people play the game.
---
One gun army... enforcer.. ect
---
Just checked, not working
---
It’s PSN from what it says on the picture
---
Just checked dome, not working.
---
Probably an explosive legendary, you can find one by grinding legendary enemies for hours and hours on end, or you can buy one from another player via the market subreddits.
---
There have been moments I’ve wanted to capture a situation and for speed I’ve had to take a screenshot rather than faff about with the button presses to go into photo mode and then move the camera around but that’s meant my P.A hud display and weapon is in the first person view. The camera makes it easy to quickly select it from your favourites wheel and capture the moment with no faffing about of a P.A hud in the image, I’m loving the convenience
---
Happened to me last night, i was the last one to mow her down so it wasn’t hard for me to locate the body, but a bunch of guys were hopping up and down and someone even popped a berry mentat in order to find the body. I stood right on top of it and wave to get them to come over, some still couldn’t find it, people never thought it could be stealth after death.
---
Aren’t there lenses? I guess that’d be just the same as field of view slider. 
---
Fixed lenses are fun tho
---
Hope they add enclave to it but first find better spots for the new vendors, seemed lazy when vendor bot 5 feet from an empty cashier desk.
---
That's right. Guess I have no reason to fight SBQ anymore. Imma go play Borderlands for a while. Maybe Bethesda will do something cool in the next patch.
---
yeah my melee character is still suffering, i thought for sure theyd fix it in this last patch, but nope..
---
Can they actually aim themselves where they want to go?  If not then it's no different than drinking nukashine and just waking up wherever the game decides to drop you.
---
I'd Recommend getting the carnivore mutation meat is everywhere and 1 piece is enough to fill half your meter
---
I normally swap out bloody mess 1* and one other perk 2* for super duper.
---
But occasionally I'm not paying attention and I swap out the wrong 2*.....and I only notice when either I don't hit as hard anymore or my mad ups are gone.
---
BoS vendor in Watoga sells it.  It's the "Table Television."  It's not always there.  You can also check its representative at Whitesprings.
---
This👆.happens to me everyday. I sell something and then it reappears correctly.
---
Who was selling them?
---
Theres nothing to confirm. The point is, throwing money at kits makes any perks that increase durability pointless. Just slap a kit when armor is low. Durability doesn't matter. That frees up gunsmith perks out in the field for other perks geared towards damage or more convenience.
---
Helluva a deal. Sometimes you find great shit that people gloss over at the vendors.
---
Did I say it was a slippery slope? It is change from what the atomic shop was sold as, maybe instead of asking me to chill you should be a little more upset about that.
---
That’s a pretty good weapon thanks for letting me know
---
The point is, throwing money at kits makes any perks that increase durability pointless. Just slap a kit when armor is low. Buy a stack of kits and durability doesn't matter. That frees up gunsmith perks out in the field for other perks geared towards damage or more convenience.
---
If it was only two shots, it's likely a bloodied explosive weapon. My TSE handmade takes way more than two shots.
---
Here's to the future🍺
---
This is one of my biggest complaints too! I'd never find any of these side quests without coming to reddit first. They're at such obscure locations that you usually visit once and dont go back to. 
---
Even if they posted on that new updates screen that there were 2 or 4 new side quests to find with some kind of hint to it, it would help players who dont come here.
---
Cool idea.
---
Spoiler alert:
---
Mounted Wendigo. It looks pretty cool, imho.
---
I like it but I just wish it wasn't under armor - we have plenty in game and the BOS Officer is already black so. I wish this had been an outfit.
---
Aside from the bow and arrow, were there any other new weapons in the files?
---
I've thought it'd be nice if some of the caps spent on traveling were used to replenish vendors.
---
Nah, it's crap.  I'll take it of your hands for 50 caps if you want.
---
Read the notes. You are asking for a short novel.
---
Well, it hasn't worked that way on PC ever since they broke it back in Patch 5 (so it couldn't be scrapped in crafting, like mods) and the following hotfix (so it could, but now it was subject to Scrap All).  Prior to patch 5, it could be scrapped for crafting, but *not* subject to Scrap All.
---
Well, WV was born of the.civil war.  We are also big on history here...
---
We are talking about whether or not it is a necessity, because to people who do not pay real money for enough repair kits farming mats or the SBQ is a necessity to do the same thing, which is directly at the heart of the issue.
---
Thats not new.  That has happened to me since the previous patch iirc.
---
Welcome to the newest, but arguably funnest of Bethesda update glitches!
---
Apparently it causes amnesia.
---
Yeah, in older fallout games the would be radio broadcasts or something to point us in the right direction.
---
Just feel a bit lost and aimless. I've got basically every location on the map uncovered. Should I just revisit all of them and hope for a new quest?
---
🤨
---
I’m trying to get it but I don’t have the plans for Molotov cocktails. I have no idea where to find them either :(
---
Biv, sheepsquash, camera, repair kit P2W
---
Persists between servers—even if you change characters.
---
Playing the game and abusing poorly designed system are completely different things.
---
If there is a limit on how often or how many times it can be done in a row, it means they can give better loot for completion.
---
If it is instantly repeatable, then that means the loot can't be any better than normal world loot.
---
Which do you want? Better loot or instant repeatable grind fest without any reward? Think.
---
Can't say I've had such a problem tbh. There can be a lag yes which seems to not take into account what you've done, but outright items disappearing? Strange.
---
either a rifle with a explosive legendary or the perfect storm 10mm smg which has incendiary rounds.
---
Laying on the hood of a red car
---
PS4, updated.
---
I love how this turned into a "do this instead" thread.
---
A shotgun crit build with an AAE shotty could do that.
---
Tuesday, June 18th @ twitch.com/apexigod
---
Welcome. I just thought it could be a idea of where to look. But it seems that the spawns locations are far more vast that this small list.
---
Looks like he got a 3* legendary screw, it is worth 3 screws
---
I will be building Apex Arena soon. Been collecting building plans on an alt.
---
Could be a explosive shotgun, took me 100+ levels to finally find one. Pray to RNGesus is the best advice I can give you.
---
Yes &lt;3
---
Thank you! People seem very interested in it so far.
---
Any particular part of Whitesprings we can find that car? The front? Near the entrance?
---
Thus the pro tip
---
 My knives are that good. ;)
---
God forbid you play the game to find them.
---
Because it's implemented as content... not "new content"... so take a step out of your universe for a second and imagine that you've just started playing 76 and you're now discovering these places brand new. 
---
Does it make more sense now that this would be a random encounter, and not a poster that you click at a train station?
---
Don’t try to move too soon or you will stay in the workbench, not sure why it happens, just don’t try to move until fully out of the animation screen.
---
You mean pay-to-lose.  It’s an Assaultron Head, after all.
---
😂 I'll not mix them with Nukashine then!
---
What annoys me is events that guarantee 3 star enemies keep spawning them at low level regardless of area and nearby player levels. I did a horde mission in The Mire recently and there was only one other player in area I could see; I was 160+ and him 200+. All the horde sites were filled with 68 enemies including the one the boss was at, but for some reason the boss was Lv. 20 something and drops me a Syringer...
---
this new feature is great! its how i got to fort defiant at only level 20!
---
hint: the "follow me" emote works the best!
---
Was the valid ballot not new then? what about the hand scanner now going green? And the printers are now not responding when interacted with?
---
Thanks I’ll try that out, I’m pretty impatient lol
---
Is apex arena a thing from something? Or is that what you’re calling it?
---
There are many ways to make money here, I have even offered ideas up to help with that endeavor. We both agree that the game needs to make money.
---
We totally disagree on holding the devs to their words. Once you decide that people can act in a manner inconsistent with what they say those people have all the justification in the world to do anything they want with a product we were sold as something else.
---
And this may just be a video game to you, but this is my favorite franchise, and it has been since wasteland started the behind the scenes story. I get that it is a lesser deal for casuals, but this has larger implications for those of us who are more invested.
---
Yea i hear ya, i know not to and i still do it sometimes haha
---
speculation meaning "fan fiction"
---
There’s occasionally a bug that snags me at the spit-turning cook station (makes me look like I’m stuck in a free fall animation). I’ve found that fast travel frees me from my purgatory.
---
Nah I’ve little interest in them
---
Happens everytime now since the update for me. I have to scour the lands for his invisible corpse. Even more added enjoyment when someone Mini-Nukes the corpse and makes it fly to a foreign land. :(
---
Yeah.  I just wish that you had the ability to over-repair it back to 200% without having to wait for it to dwindle back to 100%.  Buzz Blades &gt; 150% are amazing.
---
I can get the Vampire one up to 170 or so and it's pretty much the touch-of-death against other things.
---
Entitled? The game cost $60 bucks
---
So how would this go? just curious I'm guessing all unarmed perks, dodgy, serendipity?
---
Just wonder aimlessly for 20 hours until I return to the right location I've already been to 180 hours ago before the quest was added. Seems legit.
---
Their sales team doesn’t talk to their gameplay team much. This is why you have more tuxedos to choose from than weapon skins in a shooting game.
---
people should not make there build arounds a weapon they dont have 
---
im level 102 and the only explosive wepon i founds was a pipe gun level 15
---
Lmao, I have 3 guys with combined levels of over 300 and I still haven’t found one xD
---
I can’t pull up any menu when I’m stuck in the animation
---
eh, there have been times at West-Tek where I have killed so many super mutants with my lever action it broke at 200%. Not defending the repair kits per say, just saying there have been times where it could have been handy to have a repair kit vs fighting the rest of them with a power fist.
---
 One bit with Chameleon is good for Stealth. I don't think the Mutation is worth it.
---
If you're on PS4, because the world loads so slow, you can run into the Berkeley Springs location and see inside after all the loading is finished. to get out, simply fast travel.
---
The stash box is a new model btw. Let me know if someone wants a video of the inside.
---
Bloodied Explosive Lever Action rifles can do 800+ dmg per shot with low health, and perks/mutations. You can easily kill mutants in 1-2 shots.
---
It's not our job to convince you if you've already convinced yourself it's going to suck.  It's your fault you're being unnecessarily negative about something that hasn't been released with mechanics that haven't been confirmed.
---
I'd have to pretend I was planning on buying some, or worse, pretend that I did buy some.
---
Ive probobly been in like 6 rad storms total, I was in a rad storm yesterday so maybe the secretly adjusted the frequency of rad storms, they really need to increase the length and increase the amount of rads given tho
---
I thought I read that if you have a vending machine at the camp your camp will be visible on the map. To offset players smashing up your camp once found the other patch is that the camp becomes immune to player damage. 
---
Doesn't help when they farm your vegetables and drink your water.
---
Hahaha that’s rough! I love this comment though
---
The wastelands most deadly creature, we should poke it with a stick
---
Que sera sera.  I see no reason to go into hysterics over a hypothetical.  We decide whether or not to cross that bridge when it gets here.  In the meantime, enjoy the game.
---
The trick is, now you have that cool new armor, and your new friend wants to go on some event in 6 weeks and you wanna show him that armor, but it's currently broken and you don't have the time to get the stuff to fix it so well, it's right there after all,  a repair kit in the atom shop...
---
These kits killed Bethesda for me as a decent company. 
---
I will not be purchasing Bethesda games in the future.
---
That's on you man. We will never see eye to eye on this matter.
---
Agreed. The moment that comes into the shop everyone and their mother will definitely purchase it.
---
Are you on to try to meet up?
---
You get an experience bonus for an hour.
---
Oh my bad sorry about that  joke went right over my head
---
the nerf is that you have to equip lucky draw and lucky break and fighting someone that just pays money and doesn't equipt them is someone with an advantage
---
I made my build so I can use anything. I just got lucky that the one and only explosive to drop for me was a double barrel.
---
Seriously...
---
Have you done the Dinner Guests quest at the other golf course?
---
bottom right for the real hardcores
---
That's actually a really good point.
---
Yes but only the ones that drop from Watoga legendary bots. The rest will be removed from the game entirely without warning.
---
I love the idea of player vending. 
---
The things I plan to sell are ammo, grenades, rare outfits and rare plans. 
---
I can see myself advertising my other wares though, like 3* weapons and armor, and then people can swing by my camp to take a look. 
---
The vending machine will be good, so I won’t have to sit at my camp and trade. I can be out, actually playing the game, instead of waiting for some dude who told me he was coming and doesn’t show up until and hour later because he said he ‘got distracted’. 
---
Sucks that it’ll share the same inventory space, I agree. 
---
I’m hoping that I heard wrong about the prices already being set the same as the Vendor Bots inventory....so not sure if I’ll actually use it for much if that’s true.
---
Rip im on xbox
---
Absolutely AWESOME!
---
What time is it on?
---
I don't recall, just saw a quick pic, it was cute.
---
I really wish I could find some newbies that are willing to pick stuff up when I'm trying to give them things. I was trying to give this level 4 a bunch of plans / ammo / aid the other day and he just kept doing the "No" emote at me and I'm like :/ I'm just trying to give you free things!
---
To the ground? Hell no. I want a grappling hook so I can go up in the sky and smack it around mid-flight while holding on for dear life!
---
please no! ill buy your repair kits if you leave it in! anything for my camera- jumping!!!
---
Imposter
---
RNGesus is the answer! Pray to him and offer blood sacrifices of every NPC to cross your path.
---
Imposter.
---
That’s P2W mentality right there. I would also like more photo space.
---
yep have all materials on character still cant craft it.
---
Everyone grows beards. Men, women, children, mole rats.. Everyone.
---
It would have made sense to have found a holotape or something in a train station to trigger the camera quest.
---
I get the idea is you are meant to just find it but almost all of the places I'd have little to no reason to return to unless I myself was there to take pictures. That would really, really reduce the chances of me happening upon the tourist while I'm there due to it spawning in only a number of locations on a server. 
---
Plus the Burrows, unless I missed something I would have expected to pick up a BoS radio broadcast and tracked it down. I quite liked having to trace radio signals by listening to the radio in the other games. It was leading you but not having to encourage you to resort to the Internet to just get started.
---
If player vending was connected with all characters and has its own stash/capbank that would be dopeeee!!!
---
Hey, I'm interested in your fuel. How does 801 caps sound?
---
No, meaning "speculation." As in "just a guess."
---
Yes, I have this too.  Very annoying.  Doesn't resolve itself until you restart the game.
---
I've found a couple other things like this:
---
* If you fast travel to a location where someone is firing a Minigun-type weapon (esp. near the Scorchbeast Queen battles), you'll hear the Minigun during the load screen and it will never stop.
---
* Once, when I tried to Stimpack a fallen player at the same time someone else did, I got the prompt stuck on my screen.  It was very weird because it kept changing based on context, exactly like when you're commanding Dogmeat in Fallout 4.
---
It looks like you don't have a scrap assaultron head. Can you check your junk? If you do have it, is the bug where you can't craft mixing pocket items and stash items back?
---
you have perks, someone who had money would have other perks equipped and be stronger than you
---
I suspect that was caused by the update that caused PA (and presumably weapons) to use the lowest core first.
---
You sir are awesome
---
The fo76 map isn't that relative, in RL WV, Mill Creek is midway between Helvetia, and Spruce Knob.
---
I wonder if there is a relative location in FO76 WV between these two location?
---
Either way, good find!
---
Put the speedy receiver and a large mag on it and have fun tearing through enemies. I carry 7 or more gatling guns at a time, each one has a specific use (tse, troubleshooters, ghoul slayer, etc) if you want me to mod it for ya I will, I'm on xb1 too.
---
&gt;for sell
---
No - for sale.  
---
You sell an item if it's for sale at sale.
---
Yes. For the glorious Mothman.
---
despite it popping up inside their available crafting you cant make it till you are level 35 have the mats and have science expert and even with all that you still cant make it. my level 89 character has all materials  the perk and the plan for the normal one and still cant make it. pops up with the menu to make it i select the max level hit confirm and poof nothing no mats taken and no head.
---
That's why I love perk loadout manager. I'm walking along minding my own business, hear the distinctive flapping, quick swap to my "Crocodile Hunter" build (Animal Friend and Wasteland Whisperer both maxed - never figured which worked on the SB; don't care), sweep the sky with a shitty pistol I keep for just this purpose (my only non-scoped ranged weapon)  and pacify that bat. Quieter and more dignified than a scream.
---
They explained the nerfs to White Knight and Licensed Plumber, they over performed compared to perks like Power Patcher and brought them in line, White Knight was a stupidly powerful perk that is still really good, and Licensed Plumber stacks with Gunsmith and thus didn't need the 90% condition decay reduction. Plus these nerfs happened long before the announcement of repair kits, there's no evidence that they're any more than only tangentially related.
---
OI! HE'S ANGRY! HE'S ANGRY!
---
These pictures aren't definitive. If you would just take a WHOLE picture, the "build" would be "attach" if it were a mod. This way you can definitively confirm it's from a plan.
---
Let's round it up to 1k
---
Yeah, 100% down with everything you just said haha. I would be OK with the magical teleporting tourist start point for the camera if there was a holotape in a set place telling me where the hell on the current server he is.
---
The other peak is higher
---
Hmmm...I imagine that's not easy to find :/
---
We don’t know just yet exactly how it’ll be implemented so it’s hard to say. I for one love vending and don’t mind spending hours at my camp while others pop by occasionally. I usually make thousands of caps each day just from selling duplicate plans to others, but I need to be present to negotiate the prices if one is too high. Also, I like being present because then I can peruse their wares and see if I want to trade for anything they have. So I’ll probably have vending machines for ammo and maybe some other stuff, but will stay at my shop and barter for plans. 
---
There are locations that are hot spots now where if you have your camp there, you will get foot traffic. But this may change if there is a beacon or something letting others know where your vending machine is. Then very remote shops may also be viable business options. But for now I prefer heavy traffic areas and staying at my camp to trade
---
I havnt convinced myself of anything tbh hence this post , I was looking into the current mechanics of the game and how it would influence the up and coming player vendor and it itself created the negative elements to player vending not me, all I have done is point them out as concerns.
---
I am... going to go do that right now
---
Wanna add me I’m GT : Manny Sandov 
---
I usually play with a group but I don’t like taking much I do use lots of emotes to make up for it.
---
Mostly will play in the am ( Pacifico time ) and tv on mute for the most part I do share my mutation so stranger in number comes in handy for you and me etc.
---
No need to even be on the same place at all times no pressure , I had a kid once he wouldn’t stop begging for stuff , not cool lol
---
Decrease in prices of certain objects, I mean we all know they just making sure we make less cap selling them but I still feel like we deserve an answer.
---
It's at one of the front entrances I'm not sure which one I only seen a picture of it but it's in one of the horseshoe areas where all the flowers are. 
---
I'd assume it's the one to the right of where you fast travel in
---
Salami breath lookin ass...
---
Yeah, I know and feel your pain, it happens to me, no idea what nor why... just thought I'd let you know at least you are not alone...
---
Dont cry
---
Shame that you are on PS4, I only got 20 caps to my name right now
---
I hit WesTek &amp; Harper's Ferry as soon as I get on to collect weapons and any other items I can find.  That usually gets me my 1400 caps + XP.  And make sure your Hard Bargain is max ranked to 3.  I checked the price of serums at the vendor last night for the heck of it and it sold for 450 caps.  That's just with the perk.  I was going to try tonight with the perk, beer, grape? mentat, &amp; charisma bobblehead to see how much the price goes up.  Even if I don't plan on playing long, I'll at least get on to do a caps run.
---
my OP talked specifically about this reddit only.  i have no idea what is being said any where else.  as i stated, at least 10 threads with 100 comments each.  that is a LARGE portion of the active / inactive players.
---
never said my opinion was the only correct one.  only what i think.  i could be right.  i could be wrong.
---
Someone suggests this every time there’s a new patch and never has any information to back it up. There’s also never anything that’s datamined that seems to support it. 
---
It’s probably all in your head
---
Don’t know how you found that without a longitudinal coordinations. This number would ride a latitude around the world so it could be in a lot of places at once and just happen to pass through West Virginia but it’ll also run through Florida and some South American countries
---
Its damage could be multiplied by ten and I still wouldn't use it. It's slow and not fun. They could add explosive bolts from Dawnguard.
---
I'd prefer to have current Atom system sorted out before that. First all it would be nice to be compensated for an entire week+ of literally impossible challenges involving Cameras and Rad Storms. Then it would be nice to not get challenges that take all day to complete and/or require hours of server hops. :|
---
once you spent all your money on a fancy gun skin you are going to find a time you really want to show off that gun but can't because it's currently broken and well, you do have the atoms to repair it right away....
---
Xbox One
---
danke
---
It actually wasnt an issue then. That patch that screwed it up was after the launch of sheepsquatch.
---
Rad tick says hi butt what are you doing in my backyard
---
I think Bethesda really missed a tick here by not offering a BLANK sign in any of these packs.
---
Yeah, I looked there too, and the lighthouse
---
or that.  :-)  +1
---
Damn you, i wish this was xbox lol, i was prepared to start punching people
---
you are supporting a game you think scams children? because it's okay because it's not pay 2 win?
---
Every single update I end up with less damage output on my unyeilding bloodied build. Every single update!!!
---
Not anymore. For 3 *'s, they're easily 10k+ in the marketplace, if you can even find one for caps. You can sometimes find 1-2* bloodied rifles, but they're still uncommon.
---
I say Unyielding, but that's just my personal preference. With max Barbarian and running at around 40% health should make you tanky enough to get yourself out of a sticky situation... Assuming you've got a stealth pistol build that is
---
The verbiage and word choice in your post prove otherwise.
---
Yes I do
---
On me now(wavy Willard’s ) HeadyCrawdad159
---
based on what? Nothing has ever said that, or hinted at it
---
Pretty good. 
---
The +250 damage res while reloading is meh, but Anti-Armor and faster fire rate are some of the best legendary effects a Gatling Gun can have.
---
Suppose so. Its not like the hunting rifle doesn't reload faster with speed demon too.
---
you can also smack enemies with your camera. the same way you can with any gun
---
If you get stuck you can place your power armor and the animation will pull you out. There is a nasty one that gets me every time just west of the quarry in cranberry bog.
---
Oooo is that the daily today? My camps up there hahaha
---
Honestly I’ve never been one to keep a bunch of photos, maybe just my top 5 for loading screens so I dont mind deleting the challenge ones. Though I do know of people who do like to keep them so this will be more of a problem for them depending on how many they already want to keep.            In the end I’ll take server stability over increasing photo storage size
---
It shoots slower tho
---
What do you think is my best bet for hunting something like that?
---
I thought the Brotherhood questline was going to lead to that since it kept hinting towards one but it didn't and boy was I disappointed.
---
Thanks I’ll be over in a few
---
Would entirely depend on if you're a low health build or not?
---
Unyielding complements bloodied builds, but if you're going to be at 50%+ health, Vanguard is better.
---
Username checks out
---
Fuck the repair kits, I have back ups of all of my guns, after clearing a bunch out I still have 5 Fatmans, 3 Missile Launchers, 2-3 Auto Grenade Launchers, and a handfull of .50 Cals, Gatling Guns and Miniguns, plus the only materials that ever give me trouble on repairs are Aluminum and Adhesive, but I always play in a group so getting the necessary materials is easy.
---
Time to find another build! :D
---
I’m building it and that’s just what I named it
---
I honestly can't stand the Hunting Rifle, which is a shame because I have a couple really nice ones from a Legendary standpoint in my stash.  I don't like the whole fire-one-shot-then-wait deal.  Maybe if it was Instigating or I had more of a Rifleman or VATS critical build, it'd be different, but most things need more than one shot for me to take them down with a gun and therefore a gun that kicks out bullets quickly is important.
---
Yes same here..yesterday I’ve noticed there’s a number under the vault boy when loading ..I wonder what that means
---
I'll keep trying. Thanks!
---
I've tried fast traveling to the CAMP twice in a row only to be rewarded with the same result. Also moving the CAMP could sounds like it may work, but for players who have sizable or complex builds moving the CAMP and rebuilding sounds like an unnecessary headache.
---
Thanks for the report. I sent you a PM for some additional info.
---
All perks welcome, call that “training for the big fight”
---
It’s so annoying when that happens. It’s happened to me so many times.
---
Same thing. Exploration reward is for new players and not for those of use who have hundreds of hours of game time and have walked literally everywhere all ready.
---
The plans to build the X-01 PA armor parts (Arms, legs, helmet and torso) are all in the red terminal to the right of the vendor in the military wing.  They tossed them in the game around the same time they put the plans to build the Ultracite PA pieces in Fort Defiance on Taggerdy's terminal.  But it would be super nice to have the plans for the mods instead of playing server roulette...
---
You can tune in via stream and watch!
---
5:00pm CST
---
This. I haven't found the camera yet, but this I'm excited about.   :)

---
 &gt; Thanks for the report. I sent you a PM for some additional info.
---
I love PS4! lol what platform are you on?
---
At 200% you dont need to do it away from workshop, because it's so over powered. If you walk into a fight at 50%, that's your poor planning :)
---
I don't think it's a big deal, you know you earn 3 improved repair kits each queen run right? Alot of other games sell material packs, you too can spend on a stack of repair kits instead of 1400 atoms on a paint job..we should be happy
---
... did you not understand what "just a guess" means? Yes, it's based purely on the fact the play mode is called "nuclear winter," which one would expect to be cold &amp; make it hard to gather resources. Not sure why this is such an issue.
---
Lots. You're probably in a semi popular spot.
---
Why don’t you work with me and we can put on an event for Xbox!? :)
---
Pretty sure you don't need to find a plan, just a Molotov cocktail .. can't remember finding any plans. Then go to tinkers workbench and you should be able to craft them. I will check my lower level characters to see if they can craft them
---
Honestly for the queen i shoot her wings cause limb damage right. ....only makes sense. But sometime they are dicks and just dont land AT ALL. I was doing "One Violent Night" the other day. Oh man Spawn glitch, had the whole mob set spawn when i FT in like 20 lvl 12 Ghouls a 23 Crowned wendigo. And a scorched beast, it wouldnt land just repeatedly laying down that haze over and over. Wouldnt land out side would fly awaywhen i came outside than the regular level spawn kicked in for the ghouls half way through the first hoard omg. Twas One Violent Night.
---
I am on Xbone. :(
---
So again another impossible challenge by Bethesda because the alien is not in the game normally. I had hope for this one when the imposter sheepsquatch counted for my friends and I.
---
Not sure the mask is that rare, bought 3 a few days ago, but the outfit is much rarer ..
---
I guess we have to start our own, or raise an army of musket wielding Union dressed players
---
That will work. IGN WanderingWolf15
---
Are you currently online?
---
TSE pump action shotgun will do it.  Two to 3 shots will kill a level 68 everytime with the correct perks.  If you are on Xbox, this might have actually been me last night.
---
Quite sure that's a countdown.
---
Yeah, I did say the lever action is better in every respect except reload speed, Armour piercing, and recon scopes.
---
There's as many as needed. New servers get spun up automatically when existing servers start to get full, and servers get terminated as population decreases.
---
If you're server hopping, I'd recommend waiting a minute or two at the main menu, before trying to join again. This should give enough time for you to land somewhere new.
---
I will be in a bit i'll drop you a message :-)
---
careful, this sub can’t handle someone criticizing Bethesda. Spoilers: you’re allowed to enjoy a game and still point out the obvious glaring flaws the developer and publisher has.
---
Lol I’ve only seen that cat twice in 400+ hours
---
No, not a low health build. I think I’m going to try Vanguard. 
---
I just like Unyielding because when I get mobbed, and super low health abut to die, it’s like I get a little invincible buff that lets me finish off the enemies and I don’t die.
---
Oh boy, another [incredible invisible conversation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2012/08/30/clint-eastwood-talks-to-imaginary-obama/?utm_term=.7a7aca39c994). About as honest and useful, too. Love the part where "everything's easy, make it so." Or better yet, the part where fan assumptions are treated as fact. Or, ooo, neat, you got the trifecta, there's the part where old problems are brought up as if they're current! Thanks for that.
---
Weres your camp at ? I live inside a bridge next to harpers ferry. Never had that message pop up.
---
Power armour with an enormous harpoon gun bolted to your arms, reel of black titanium cable on your back and pneumatic pistons that deploy from your legs into the ground.
---
Reel her in boys.
---
Got me an AAE lever action so I'm set lol
---
"I paid for this online game with constant content updates, therefore I should recieve way too much microtransaction currency for doing 1 trivial event."
---
It's like you think development costs are free once the game comes out lmao. Like these developers will sit at their desks making textures, models, recording voice acting and writing code for no pay just because we paid for the game once back when it came out.
---
Shhh, stop being reasonable. This is /r/fo76, you know!
---
Here's what I'm using 15 strength &amp; 15 agility
---
3 gladiator
---
3 expert gladiator
---
3 incisor
---
3 iron fist
---
3 ninja
---
3 Nerd rage
---
Adrenal reaction mutation
---
Talons mutation
---
Twisted muscles mutation
---
Plaguewalker mutation
---
Bloodied meat Hook with extra claw
---
25% faster fire rate gives it the same damage output rate as a two-shot (after nerf), but more accurate. It’s also anti-armor, so you’re like having two tier-one effect in one gun, that’s very nice.
---
With chameleon mutation, you will be invisible as long as you are still (standing or crouching) and have a weapon out, but you are not invisible while you are swinging the melee weapon or firing a gun, i dont actually know if that affects your ability to get detected, its hard to test
---
The atomic shop stated that it would not offer items that give  a competitive advantage... this arguably does not, as I have stated.
---
I see no concern with their original statement and where we are now.
---
Without them I'm trapped under the floor anyway. To me the result out weighs the risk of traveling to a toxic player's CAMP.
---
Unyielding or bolstering would be much better in every situation. Vanguards gets worse as you get hit vs. having the other two, you get stronger as you get hit. Idk why people buy vanguard, unless it’s sentinel.
---
Nice photo) I wish you had a balalaika in your hands)))
---
Fuck I'm three away from the platinum. I gotta hurry
---
The Porta Potty should be a "Toxic Environment" (causes Dysentery) for 5 minutes after someone uses it.
---
I've found him 5 times now in 350+. Along road between R&amp;G station and Watoga, and N / NW of Watoga. It's always been near wooded areas.
---
I'd think that you wouldn't gain carry weight, you'd actually hold the weight of the food till it was "dumped".
---
Pretty soon we will have sims bars at the bottom of the screen!
---
It's a gatling gun, not minigun. The Gatling gun is the slowest fire rate of all heavy machineguns. With 500 round magazine, even with the speedy receiver and 25% faster RoF, it's still slow firing.
---
But that is not a bad thing as it's very ammo friendly.
---
Yes, the weapon is very good with those legendaries.
---
People have been posting about these more and more, I wonder if they heard the complaints and upped the frequency? Could also just be the streisand effect
---
Yeah, but this is changing by the minute and by 100%
---
Running game content isn't abusing anything, its playing the game. The only games i know of that time gate content like that are subscription based games like WoW, and it's not about good game design, its about prolonging the life of content so you pay for more time and they have more time to churn out new content. In short, it's not about a better experience from a player perspective, but a way to increase the lifespan of content and generate revenue. These are not good things for the players. 
---
Elder Scrolls Online allows you to run dungeons as much as you want to farm gear or sets, because they want players to play their game as much as they want to - there is no monthly subscription that they need content to cater to. Instead, ESO Plus adds value by adding convenience (unlimited crafting storage) and allowing access to all new DLC you otherwise have to pay for.
---
One thing Fallout and ESO have in common is a flat gear structure - a level 50 gun from farming a nuke zone is the same as a level 50 gun from a random monster somewhere else. This is different than WoW where they release new content that drops gear that makes old content trivial and obsolete.
---
You can make FO76 instanced dungeons instantly repeatable and still drop better loot by making them more challenging - such as by having boss enemies that are tough and drop good loot, but you have to fight through trash monsters to get to them. 
---
There is no reason to time gate content in FO76 from a player experience perspective. Fact of the matter is that if you put a time lock on the efficient farming places, people will play less, because the other farming locations are less productive and therefore not a good use of time. If I can get the good stuff once per day or week from location X, which is catered to me/instanced and eliminates the need to compete for spawns, that's all I will do in game, as open world farming is a nightmare.
---
As anecdotal evidence, I offer myself. I log into WoW on Tuesday to clear the current raid, dont log in the rest of the week because theres nothing to do that is as productive. I log into FFXIV on Monday to clear alliance raids and Omega to get my once/week loot. I would play both of those games more if I could run the raids more often to get gear for other specs and classes, but I cant, so I just log out for a week.
---
Think.
---
Pretty sure i read that the vending machines will be visable on the map kinda how rust does it. 
---
If its like that you just open the map and see em.
---
I agree with you, the system would be much better this way.
---
Besides there are already places where the hop grind is beneficial enough
---
I'm late to the party, but how does empath, assassins, sentinel/cavs play into this?  I got an aae handmade, i'm running tank killer as well. Is it worth running a perforating magazine against the guys with bought/duped armor sets?  I can take'em down when they are soloing, once they team up though their much harder to kill.
---
You mean like the Stealth Nerf? Or the SBQ's heath going up with everyone who shoots it?
---
Great post!
---
That’s like the free parking house rule equivalent.
---
That said free parking rules for monopoly are terrible (they prolong an already long game)
---
Level 400 Chad doesn't want you there either =).
---
I have a different idea though. The problem is that we're fighting over mobs, but what if everyone got exp / loot if they were in the area when it was killed?
---
Ok, did anyone complain that their weapons and armor werent degrading as quickly...no they praised the perks but beth nerfed them anyway.
---
Their excuse was they did this so those perks weren't essential to have and yet nearly everyone still uses them, they are still essential so why the nerf?
---
Repair kits were always planned well before the announcement hence the reason for the nerf well in advance of it's arrival. Also I scour this subreddit and beth forums daily and not once did I see anyone ask for repair kits
---
4 times yesterday I killed 3\* legendaries and got a crappy 1\* wood chest piece of crap armor. Or most times its the 1\* rolling pin of death.....Really?
---
woooow. Didn’t know they were in the tinkers workbench lol. Never made any before and had no clue. I was looking for them in my weapons workbench the whole time. THANKS
---
Do you have Speed Demon mutation? I noticed that it now increases food/hunger consumption during movement, in a noticeable way.
---
You can always mix/match. I run 2 Bolstering, 2 Unyielding, and 1 Chameleon.
---
 Its part of my game to find my own stuff. ;)
---
The downside is that a good chunk is either inactive because duper’s got banned or people quit. The other side that I’ve seen is that majority of the posts are from Xbox. There doesn’t seem to be much for PS4 or PC.
---
ty
---
I'm never surprised really. Our builds keep getting stealth nerfed while ppl can still jump and stand still at the same time. Lmao
---
to be fair, most fo76 players are children and not reddit users, judging by what i hear in VC. what do 9 year olds want in the atom shop? no fuckin clue
---
There are a few solutions to this problem.
---
1. If you get a drill or syringe, you're fucked, no legendary at all for you. They replace whatever legendary you may have gotten.
---
2. When they glow green, don't hit them too fast. If you hit them during the "gaining stars" phase, you will most likely get no legendary. You could try to wait for the corpse to rot, but this doesn't always work. 
---
3. If you waited during the "glowing green and gaining stars" phase, you will always get a legendary, in my experience. Or a drill or syringe.
---
Can you still lock water pumps?
---
... I point out,t he repair kits got to %100, and are more underwhelming than either of the other options (in game normal repairs or the in game findable repair kits).
---
Sucks to be in PC, i used to be the Undisputed Champion of the server back when i played rust. 
---
Would organize fights, also. 
---
I hope u guys got a referee
---
I started that one the other night!  It sucked alone, I got to 36 before the time ran out. Not sure how long the timer is but when I got there I had 20 mins left and there was no way I was going to be able to complete it without help.
---
Again, the root problem is that the spot where the camp was placed (or directly next to it) is raised up significantly higher than it was before the camp was placed.
---
I have the opposite problem.  My camp is 4 floors up in a tree.  My guests sometimes materialize and fall to their deaths.  I added structures directly below where they materialize to break their fall.
---
Then you wake up on a carriage heading to helgen
---
I like the concept of Vanguard, but Unyielding seems to give me a little invincibility buff when I’m close to dying and I like that. 
---
That’s why I asked, I wasn’t sure which was better in theory versus real game play :)
---
In all fairness though - BGS hired people that did a lot of the online portion of SWTOR to work on FO76. That game has all the traditional instanced dungeons / raids that you'd expect from an MMO (I mean, it's basically a WoW clone after all).
---
Yeah we need Dragonrend in 76 😂
---
Maybe they'll add some kind of lobby area that's a separate cell and you wait in there until you get how ever many you want in the group and than you go through another door that takes you to the interior of the vault. That way its accessible from in game but still a separate queuing area. Or just do it like gta online, send a message through your pip boy that you want to start the raid and than you keep exploring until it finds a game for you and than pulls you into it
---
That's an impressive body of work. Thanks for doing it. If I could make one minor suggestion, it would be great if you linked your videos in a playlist and shared the playlist link at the end to make it easier to compare them side-by-side.
---
I mean, I don't have that armor to test it. Assassins sentinel gear is described as armor, so I don't think it applies. You're much better off focusing on PVP tactics. From what I've read sentinel is beaten with staggers, and cavalier is beaten by freezing.
---
It would happen before the recent update as well, its a really annoying glitch
---
It may work better after the next patch.  They are going to relax the ground anchoring rules, so it \*should\* be easier to place a camp from storage.
---
You can be pretty damn tough if you go sentinel vanguard. I personally run unyielding/bolstering. I might only run 28 health but I’m hard to get down most of the time.
---
Not a problem, man! Sounds good. I will definitely add you when I get a chance. My gamertag is Stealth Snip3d. Same, also have mutations, and usually share Strange in Numbers, but I can always switch for something else like Travel Agent for the group. It’s not really the communication that bothers me, I dont mind at all if you use emotes, as I do the same once and awhile. It was my old groups selfishness and complaints that really got to me and I just needed a proper group that know how to enjoy a game and help each other out as a team should do. I agree, it isn’t cool to continuously ask for things, and we dont always have to constantly be together. All I’m asking is for a proper team that know how to enjoy content when it gets released. I wasn’t able to enjoy Brewing, Laying Lowe, or The Burrows because my group just cant play together properly, its really dysfunctional, and thats where I wish we had more communication.  I was stuck having to chase after everyone, and basically had to do the quests solo bc all 3 were all over the place, kinda sucks having to do that when u have 3 people in a group.
---
I take it you havent been in the sub for a long time then. There was a lot of outrage for dupes, then a lot of outrage when they didnt fully remove all the duper's items/ban them. There have been tons of threads about glitches, auto scrapping bulk items and mods. Everything you have brought up has multiple threads.
---
Don’t forget the laden swallow.
---
You still need to get it from the atom shop to craft it
---
Mine has +10% while aiming so I was trying it without VATS, which sucks because you can't see the target marker when it's charged up. I stood right in front of a Mirelurks queen and shot and missed.
---
Before the update mine was doing 200 per shot and then after the update 150. That's a 25% nerf to the damage output on a weapon that I probably wouldn't have used even if they didn't nerf it. Then they sell a skin for it in the Atom shop?......how are they going to make money selling skins for weapons that suck?
---
I don't work in sales or nothing but my advice would be to make a weapon not suck and then release a cool skin for it.
---
I have 2 left. Alien and sheepsquatch. Smh
---
I almost never scrap guns for junk, I either sell them or scrap them for mods/plans. Not saying you're wrong but you can easily find enough junk in the wild to repair your guns. Even the rarer components only really take a few minutes of server hopping to get enough of.
---
Mm that'd be cool. I'd be down for a system like that.
---
The function of physics in this game is to remind you that this is pure fantasyland. Yep the .45 is better than 308 in every way, nothing need to be balanced here.
---
Time to try the overhead power line transmission towers. Made it half way once
---
I find that my friends often have odd bugs I never experience, but whenever an update hits - I start to receive them. LOL. 
---
Like the party UI bug where it disappears on the bottom left, but you're still in the party. My friend has had it for 2 patches now.. and I only just started getting it. Among a few other random things.
---
Currently the sbq is still buggy, if the randoms are able to kill it without it flying away or d/c you're still looking at a bad return of resources. I will not be happy that people with repair kits have a perk advantage. I will judge each game individually.
---
I have used welcome mats in my workshop to trap enemy players.  At Hemlock Holes you can place the mat inside the shipping container facing in with a rocket turret facing the mat.  If they're hostile and spawn in...
---
If you wanna play sometime add me: Stealth Snip3d
---
Confirmed Bolton Greens: I found Anne lying on the fountain in front of the building. For anyone who's server hopping their brains out, I spent all yesterday server hopping a few locations to no avail. I finally found it when I stopped server hopping and decided to just fast travel and/or walk my way from place to place on a single server. Good luck!
---
Mine seems to be doing similar, but doesn't fluctuate nearly as much.
---
Absolutely no change in perks chems or food last night, my bloodied sledge broke 1299 dmg. I've been pushing &amp; pushing to break 1k for the past week or so. No idea why it got up there.
---
The Bethesda FAQ states items will be cosmetic in the shop. Pete Hines himself stated items will be cosmetic only. Both these things are still easily accessible on the web.
---
They absolutely made a case that the atomic shop would be cosmetic only.
---
Additionally these kits are offering competitive advantage in several ways, albeit minor, still a slight edge.
---
someone with money could have all that storage space and not need to store backups of all their guns. 
---
Like you may not have money and can't buy repair kits, but anyone that can is stronger than you, has more perk slots they can put stuff in and more resources and space to keep stuff.
---
Good news and Bad news, Good news first techniquely only squad will be in the dungeon and it locks out anyone else, Bad news its per server so you need to server hop. This was detailed a long time ago when they were talking about vault dungeons so things could change and might not be how Akronos dungeon works but time will tell.
---
But this is a bug.  It goes up and then down and then back up again.  1340-&gt;576-&gt;1340
---
Staggers takes care of both. I'm just trying to punch through crouched empath/assassin's. Guess it won't hurt to throw a perforating mag and playtest it
---
Actually people are reporting it's lower even though it says they're the same. So kinda p2L
---
Are you dashing/jetpacking? Because once I got Full Charge 2/2, my usage dropped to about 1 core every 6 hours, and that's in a PA build with no Power User cards.
---
I have tried it and made it half way up as well. I even went to Horizons Rest to see if the structures could help me get any higher but sadly no.
---
Well for me, the high damage is normal.  the low damage is not.
---
It seems like you can be in power armor and they'll count for the quest but not the challenges.
---
is there even a balalaika in the game?
---
The sound on that mod was top notch. Hearing screams and moans mixed into the storm was creepy as hell.
---
I got one last night but used to get up to 4.
---
Yes you can
---
Griefing is good though
---
Not really since you have to be lvl 25 to use it *and* have already learned the salvaged Assaultron head
---
Fireproof has saved my ass with the TSE .50
---
*makes the assumption that every player has 2 powerful weapons*
---
It's ok if you can't process the example. I'm sure you'll continue to act like every single player has the same exact circumstances going on that you have. xD
---
Bummer. That was a waste apparently.
---
The endangerol stringer is really good though. Definitely worth having one for spongier enemies
---
Weird thing a lot of Scorch Beast Queen farmers tell me is don't shot at it and it will come to the ground sooner, could be tested on normal scorchbeast in a generally flat area but Im too lazy and could just be a rumor.
---
hey sir, what do you mean by true end? did they say that they will add more content into the burrows?
---
My bad, ea is pretty garbage so infinity times better.
---
I think the username was bert something. Lol
---
Crap, I think I scrapped that one
---
No I’ll just go ahead and take that worthless crap off your hands don’t worry
---
Well I see no problem with me being a profit to them. Fallout is my favorite franchise ever so they can take all my money and then some.
---
That's crazy
---
I visited like 30 locations, spent over 1000 caps in travel costs over a couple hours. So I said forget it and server hopped at wavy willards until I found a camera. Pretty lame imo
---
Psn XxMinisplinterxX add me
---
Ok mine is MergedSpy93289
---
Fantastic work! Were you able to find any hints about instancing in the data?
---
&gt;I don't remember.  Sorry!
---
No idea comrade
---
I thought it was going to be one of the ways into the legendary vendor? Maybe thats not correct. But i thought I had read that somewhere.
---
Unfortunately no 😭
---
No, you get the buffs from all the damage cards. The initial projectile(s) will be affected by the heavy gunner. From there the explosion from the legendary effect will be affected by explosives perks. My point is that this works a bit to well sometimes.
---
Wth a Tuesday? Makes no sense a weekend would be better

No, you are bending my words to fit your narrative.

if those are all the aspects of gaming, then I was right from the beginning. against my better judgement, let me help *your* case: design. game design has improved tenfold since the 5th generation. still, I'd rather have amateurs than politics getting shoved on my face, another terrible aspect of modern gaming. then it was "Jax ripped off his opponents arms because it's cool", now it's "Jax ripped off his opponents's arms because he was a slaver owned, #woke".
---
but regardless, there's a reason why modern gaming is fast food, and titles are quickly forgotten. because they're products, not games. Sony doesn't set out to realize its vision anymore, but instead to generate profits. they'll create **products** with as much appeal as they can get away with, in order to maximize profits.
---
and it's physically impossible to create a better game when you sacrifice aspects of it for money.
---
But I'm pretty sure it was a rifle because it seemed like an automatic weapon. I kinda got confused when crap started exploding all around me but I think it was automatic
---

---
The Bethesda statement re: The Atomic Shop states that the shop "...doesn’t offer anything with a competitive advantage, and more so, it aims to bring joy not just to you, but the other dwellers around you."  That's it.
---
https://bethesda.net/en/article/2a4GTCpUPyEsGCGYWyM6Q2/welcome-to-the-atomic-shop
---
Unyielding, mostly because everything except END benefits a bit starting at \~50% HP, while Vanguard's effects are only noticeable at \~80% HP and above, and *any* radiation chews into that.  Anywhere below that, Vanguard is completely ordinary.
---
It would be different if Vanguard's calculation was based on total HP - rads, instead of purely total HP.
---
That's exactly the choice I weighed up in my head. Fast travel to all known locations, roll the dice and spend all my caps, or roll the dice and server hop.
---
Nice try scammer
---
you dont need 1 powerful weapons you just need 2 weapons if one breaks you have a back up its not as good but oh well if you cant FT before the second breaks your trash. IF you dont FT when you have only 1 powerful weapon your also stupid. These things save you form having to FT to your base... They save you 1 fast travel lol. Or they save you from 1 death because if you die you can go back to your base there is no comparable advantage.
---
how did you get this Brotherhood emblem by your name?
---
Would this include mutations as well?
---
I've tried robot challenge - got all except vertibot. Can't make a photo that will count towards it - and I've done like 20 of both, flying or shooted down. Anyone has an idea?
---
I figured when swinging or firing you would be visible. I think I'm ok with weightless and the mutation. I have a few sneak perks so I can always stop until they relax and start working forward again.
---
To bad the mutation doesn't keep you invisible while sneaking. That would be bad ass.
---
Because the lever action in fo4 used .45-70 ammo, which was rare. But they left the damage the same. You also needed riflemen and gunsmith to mod it 
---
The same reason the handmade is overpowered
---
They already aluded to that with meantioning Refrigerators, ammo converters and more in the same annoucment as the repair kits
---
I can agree that it's part of the game.  But this is my bar/ place of business. 
---
If it was just a regular camp then I wouldn't worry about the sign haha
---
looks like a true hunter!
---
Nice.
---
I did something similar with the lighted "Welcome Home" sign.
---
I covered the "Home" and left it to read "Welcome"
---
You could take a screenshot on PS4 instead of using the camera for some shots. I hate that it would even limit you to begin with. Spend atoms for more photos? What's next, spending atoms to get more camera filters?
---
I think maybe VATS cost, but I haven't done testing to see.
---
I'm pretty sure that the longer the barrel, the more AP it uses per shot in VATS. I don't have a source for that, just my anecdotal experience.
---
Yeah.  28 health and yet you can stand in front of the Watoga robots for 30 seconds and not take any damage. 😉
---
Lol, thx
---
The galleria skylight was very finicky for me, you might need to move the focal point to get the target name.
---
Also did you get a zoom lens when you finished the Tourists bucket list? Zooming in might help.
---
Lol dude we said basically the same thing at the same time
---
Yup yup, while I don't feel obligated I know how buggy the turrets are. I repair them because one mole rat can destroy a base, while the crap turret just watch sometimes. Actually met a trader fixing a camp because his shop got destroyed is the parade event by 3 players.
---
I WILL RUIN THIS GAME
---
Pic?
---
I believe it’s possible with patience and skill. I know you can place your camp on it so even if you could build a platform to help you out I wouldn’t knock you
---
Yeah we see you have the perk, but do you actually have the perk equipped?
---
Mate you high
---
Okay, that's pretty priceless. 😂
---
that would be cool. finding a secret passage, fight a real 3\* endboss dropping you a 1\* armor + some tokens to get another legendary mod from the legendary vendor :D
---
Because people on reddit downvote for no reason, I don't mind
---
The Legendary Trader information is great!  I always suspected he would be on the move and not in just one location at the Berkeley Springs Train Station.  Is there a way to find out which buildings he will be located in from the Imgur data you shared?  Thanks!!
---
I find that ps4 overruns it now, but still now much PC
---
Well, the google search returned that "Encyclopedia of West Virginia" showing Mill Creek at that longitude, which I think it's a dead giveaway of the meaning of the number. I mean, it is a game about WV... =]
---
With the implementation of ammo converters in the future, will there be a need to sell your excess ammo at a vendor? You'd just convert it into ammo you needed 
---
Unless the conversion rate is rubbish thus would be the more viable option than selling them
---
I do like the ability to go at my own pace. I appreciate that aspect of the game a lot. I die a little too easy because I wander to places, I shouldn’t, but it’s fun so I don’t mind. I am still super low level because I started over with a new character recently so am only around level 15/16 at the moment.
---
It’s great! Join me!
---
Sure no problem ..
---
You need a pic of the real one, that is coming this week

“All the content we ever put out for Fallout 76–all the DLC, all the post-launch stuff–is going to be free. That’s important. And to say, the Atomic shop is cosmetic stuff. To make sure folks understand–look there’s a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we’re going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works and what you’re getting for your $60. That you know, when they put out new content or features or whatever, I’m getting that stuff for free. That feels right.”  
---
Never forget your utter betrayal, We won't. ;-)
---
The repair kits don't make them stronger, it just makes them lazier, more perk slots means nothing when you can just swap your cards around, and the storage space in my stash would be taken up by junk anyways for camp building, and I go around with full weight reduction perks and Excavator armor anyways until a big fight happens, at which point I'll risk being overnecumbered for high damage.
---
Yes the repair kits are shitty but I don't think you understand just how unimportant they are, not to mention what you've state really only matters for pvp, in any other situation nobody would care if somone has repair kits or not.
---
Sure if you stop talking like a bat shit crazy care bear
---
Just a few 1*'s with a path to him would be cool. It would make farming him for tokens much easier.
---
The few times I traded mods that I crafted, I just asked for the flux required to make it and found out what they needed and just built the piece required and added the mod and traded that. Made things really simple. I dont tend to do much player trading though, so resources needed to craft the armor pieces is not an issue.
---
You're still completely overlooking the entire point of the post you responded to. It IS possible for the repair kit to influence competitive gameplay. Whether or not the person is 'dumb' or a bad player has absolutely no bearing on the equation. Dumb and bad players exist, end of story. They should not be subject to cash shop items influencing the competitive gameplay they're involved in. 
---
You can't just overlook context, ya know. ;-)
---
I will definitely keep trying. Just like with the Radio Array it needs lots of time and patience. I will post an update if I do manage it.
---
is it able to build on top? :)
---
searching for some cool places to get a skybase. have seen some awesome pictures of skybases, but cant find them anymore and dont know any locations.
---
no luck - already got zoom x4, still can't get vertibot pickture that'll count towards challenge
---
Dont forget Cryolacter..... but to be fair.... The Queen should fall, when completely frozen in air.
---
They are obviously going to do that dummy, they did it with plague so the other 3 are going to be too.
---
the perk equipped along with gunsmith and i still can not  make it no matter what

---
Yes, I tried finding it on the map, but there doesn't seem to be a correlation. I think it's just a funny easter egg, like, it's probably less about the city and more about being the dead center of West Virginia.
---
politics, games as a sevice milking the player, microtransactions in general (dlc, lootboxes, gachas), focus on revenue rather than quality.
---
it's hard to enjoy MKXI when it's making a joke of itself by butchering character designs and using twitter hastags as motivation. I know Fo76 will never pay for itself and if people don't buy overpriced cosmetics, the game will just die. it's like a kickstarter, basically. gachas speak for themselves. and FFXV was terribly downgraded because they spent the majority of their budget on advertisement and switched to Unreal in order to port the game to as many platforms as possible, without compiling different builds of course.
---
You have ray tracing mods on Xbox?
---
Im not i am saying the "advantage" you are claiming is wrong. There is no advantage except for the caps on a fast travel if thats what your saying is a comparable advantage then i say that your a whiner. Thats something so stupid to whine about. There is no advantage.
---
The desks were rather empty last night, yes. A couple were straight up empty, a couple had one bobby pin, and finally one had one TD. For sure a lot less loot than usual in there. I thought it was just an odd/unlucky instanced set of containers, but... maybe not. :(
---
My GT is JAKERZ117 level 68 and just doin whatever, not picky. Usually online after 6pm eastern on weekdays
---
I like that your comeback is you equip weight reduction perks because you don't have storage space?
---
How many perk slots could you store up if you just paid money for repair kits? 10? 1/5th of your entire perk load out?
---
But that’s the benefit of being high!
---
I had two this morning.
---
Short barrel has better hip fire accuracy
---
Or if your smart you use fireproof and dense mods, anyway I ended up trading it for a Vampire’s Vats crit damage resistance while reloading since I felt like doing a off meta crit build
---
In over 250 hours I have never seen calibrated shocks or jetpack for X-01. the one shock I got, I bought off my sister who was lucky enough to get one. Then she learned what they did and refused to sell me the other one she found, so I am forever regulated to a single shock. I still check every time I log on and sell, but I do not server hop for it.
---
are you saying you aren't supporting besthedia anymore or you don't think it's a scam to get money from kids?
---
Then I'm stumped. Definitely looks like a bug
---
How many hrs you got my dude?
---
Have you ever seen many crowned robots in Watoga? They did something with the spawns for sure, but it doesn't mean they didn't fix what was already broken. Before patches people would only go to the Golf Club and Watoga. They wouldn't explore any other areas ever. Maybe now they will.
---
Heavy weapons and explosives are the perk areas you'll need to pour your points into
---
And the bunker? Or other bunkers (mire)? 
---
Please do not apply this blindly.
---
Found 4 in Enclave last night
---
Same for me only no TD over the last few days as well as almost nothing in the desks at all.
---
But what I'm asking is would you like this to continue? Skins that are paint ex black bird and vault tec stay the same while skins like the excavator one is universal
---
Absolutely none, I'd still have backups for different situations, still have all the same junk, it would only add to my overall weight.
---
Throw it at someone, and while they're in their emote wheel, looking for the ???, shoot them in the head!
---
They wouldn't need to resort to selling pay to win mechanics in the Atom store if they didn't nerf the living shit out of weapons that they plan on selling skins for.
---
Can't until I get home from work but will do.
---
*Eats a entire scorchbeast brain and lung with steak and 15 pieces of corn*

Sadly since it is on top of a named location, The camp can't be placed. I do know that the Power Line Towers do allow you to build at the top but getting there is the hard part. 
---
If your looking for a cool high up place to build, I would suggest Seneca Rocks. Despite it being an actual location, you can build on top. If you come at it from the north side, the rock face should be shallow enough to climb up.
---
Already have, still kinda mediocre, couldn't hit a hermit crab from 5ft away, or at least didn't do any damage while aiming at it's face.
---
Interesting, I'll have to keep trying.  Maybe RNJesus has forsaken me...
---
this sub has the delusion that killing another player is some form of cyber bullying, it’s laughable
---
This worked on the first try for me, thanks. There's a deathclaw that will try to kill the ants, but I threw a couple grenades into the fight to tag everything for me.
---
i found it by fast traveling between phillipi grave and colonel kelly then server hopping. Cheap on caps and at least i checked twice. Terrible system.
---
I’m not sure..... if only I had an **OPTION**......
---
and someone that just had money wouldn't need any of that
---
How? Please explain?
---
You tell me how the current mechanics I pointed out do or don't effect the player vendor.
---
Player vending will only be a viable option if your camp stays on the world when you have left and it sends out some kind of beacon so players can find your camp otherwise it's will be like  trying to find a needle in a haystack.
---
Also your camp will have to be instanced on all servers at once
---
This makes a lot of sense, thank you!
---
WoW thank you very much, you put a lot more through into it than I have, I was thinking about like a combat rifle as bolt gun, combat as plague knife, fragment/plasma/hallucination grenades as frag/plasma/plague grenades and plague walker mutation for the plague aura.
---
Might give that a try later. Cheers.
---
It's in challenges. Shows your hours. Or hour
---
Great idea!
---
It would be much better than the current "play twister with a radroach while listening to the radio and wearing a bathrobe" challenges.
---
Oh, thanks for tip.
---
been playing since the Atari as well. I think gaming got better afterwards, with the 4th and 5th generation. peaked around the 6th and been on a downwards spiral ever since.
---
it's not about the games themselves as much as every other practice surrounding them. it's hard to create quality, lasting content with the modern mindset.
---
just compare old games to new ones. yes, tech has improved and developers actually learned about design. but games now are fast food, quickly forgotten and created solely to generate profit.
---
Might have something to do with the new recipes coming to Toxic Larry’s? There are a few people have said are showing up in the crafting menu if you try using the stove at his shack.
---
No dashing for sure. Stashed my jetpack yesterday when I logged on, as I had been waiting for mods to be fixed so I could install Emergency Protocols.
---
Yes. They are saying two different things
---
"While you play Fallout 76, you’ll earn a currency called Atoms by completing various gameplay challenges and achievements. This currency can be used to acquire in-game cosmetic customization items for your character, earnable entirely by playing the game.
---
Atoms can also be purchased separately for real money if you so choose."

I hit the war room twice daily - on my morning vendor/biv run before work and again in the evening during my "free roam" play. A couple of days ago I came up dry twice in a row, but last night and again this morning got 3+ hits each time. Not saying they're not dropping frequency, but my personal experience on PC is that it's still there.
---
And then I was faced with a stark choice?  Do I spend my hard-earned Atoms on repair kits in the Atomic Shop?  Or do I log in to Adventure mode and collect my adhesive easily amongst the soft players ignorant of hard realities?    What a sticky situation.
---
They're in grenades in the tinker's bench. Make sure you have unscrapped beer bottles, they're 1 bottle:1 molotov.
---
Cuz if you have more than 50. I'll hear you out. If not...m

u/Valseek I've seen on [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgqx8f/bugexploit_how_to_ignore_all_blast_zone_radiation/) post that you are "on the case". I mentioned you here so you can get additional feedback if you wish. Peace.

Not good at all, let me have it. ;)
---
If you commit to it and do perticipate from the start it is possible to complete alone. My fiancé can actually do those alone. I never was able to thou. xD
---
Did you not even read my last reply? Different weapons for different situations, also I do a lot of camp building so if somebody played like me, they would still need all of that stuff. You're clesrly just trying to make the same point over and over again, ineffectively might I add.
---
Oh man, that walking arsenal. It's great to be great player icon.

i will definitly check this out. ty!

I found a jangles and panda on top of one the peaks, took a pic of that and it worked
---
Mandatory Rad-X mutation suppression.
---
If you think that's pay to win you have bigger issues .
---
I’ll make sure to check them, because you’re being so nice and everything.
---
the correct answer: don’t be another number in Bethesda’s repair kit sales charts
---
No problem. Hope you enjoy. :)
---
I'm off work on Tuesday and my wife is home as well.
---
That is not true, the plans to build the X-01 PA have been in the game on that terminal since the beginning. I got them way before the plans for Ultracite were added. They added the plans for Ultracite to Taggerdys terminal because people were complaining that they could not build the Ultracite PA, if they scrapped it, without farming the queen and playing her roulette.
---
with their explicit use and loose interpretation of the term "competitive advantage" for the repair kit, i am genuinely concerned that this is the direction we're heading in.
---
hell, have we confirmed that backpacks aren't going to be in the shop yet??
---
I am not okay with longer loading screens without the presence of a moderately well designed progress bar.   I am okay with longer loading screens if there is a fairly accurate progress bar.  (The progress bar doesn't have to be perfect, but it DOES need to indicate that the game isn't frozen, that real progress is actually being made, and when it reaches the end you should be less than a couple seconds from the "next screen" what ever that be.)
---
I get really sick of games and programs designed with "loading..." and that's it with little or no indication that anything is happening and no real way to get a feel for how long this nonsense is going to take.  Yes, I say nonsense because I have a M.2 SSD that can push hundreds if not thousands of megabytes per second.
---
If you're on Xbox, it's much quicker, cheaper, and easier to use the looking for game built in to Xbox live.
---
Mine always says 1... unless my tv is cutting off the other numbers
---
before you said you had backups of your guns, weird how that changed
---
I'm not in game and your friend who's high lvl, they run around in extervator armour? Pardon the spelling
---
Fuck, my head hurts.
---
No shit, I had no idea.  I guess its because I only found them recently
---
I use both.
---
The repair kit itself is damn near useless; most people have weapon artisan in some form. the issue is the precedent it sets for future items like this that could be more useful.
---
No they're still back ups, but they also work better for different situations. Zealot's Fatman is better for scorchbeasts than the Two Shot Fatman for example.
---
As soon as you get the camera make sure to use an emote while the cam is open.
---
i have a TSE Gatling Gun and and has been my main weapon until i can find a Legendary Handmade, plus with bandoleer ammo is weightless. 
---
It's a slow firing weapon so the increased Speed is great. Add on the speedy receiver and spec your perks to heavy weapon and Anti Armor and you can do some decent damage with it
---
I wouldn't honestly worry about it eso had repair kits too. It didn't make that game pay to win at all.
---
This was part of the lore of the game.  One of the quests during the main story line is about this.  It's a pretty big oversight on Bethesda's part that there isn't a better way of knocking the scorch beasts out of the sky without crippling a wing.  There should be a more direct way to stun them down.
---
What I clearly wrote as a competitive advantage is being able to repair a weapon quickly, potentially before being ambushed. That is a real scenario that can happen.
---
You make the assumption that everyone will just fast travel immediately when a weapon breaks. Which means, again, you think every single player plays just like you. Guess what, that's not how life works. 
---
The advantage exists and if you want to ignore that reality be my guest, put your head in the sand. You're clearly an idiot because I wasn't 'whining' in the first place, I was giving an example of a situation that can absolutely happen to answer the question posed by the OP.
---
OK who farted :)
---
No prob.
---
He uses several armors, don’t know the name. Yesterday I found one too for me! But we’re running out of cores, gotta craft/find more!
---
They are actually balanced to each other.
---
What buys people on the lever action is the much faster rate of fire. If you want raw bullet dmg, you might as well go for the Gauss rifle instead.
---
 I like [mine](http://imgur.com/gallery/1ThtbfA) just fine.
---
I buy a lot of Atoms to support the game, averaging about $25 worth per month.  (I am old and can afford it, and my purchases help keep the game going for myself and for young people with less disposable income).   But I will never buy a repair kit.
---
btw, muted cause I'm not wasting any more time on you lol. You're just gonna come back at me with some other half-assed response based entirely on your belief that all players do, or should, play how you play for them to be included in 'reality'.
---
While that's the safest way to do it, the problem is if the player was a maxed durability item. I just crafted a full X-01 set for myself last night with 35 int and max power smith perk for max durability. At least I think that's max, don't know how to get more int/bonuses for durability.
---
I looked at them im like meh they prob will some to lazy people that don't like collecting mats but thats it pretty useless to have repaired only up to 100.  If they are looking for a revenue stream that I think most people would get on board with how bout selling me stash space I would shell out atoms for that in a second or sell me a bank vault that can be accessed by all your players characters.  I am sure most people would buy this sort of thing.  My two cents happy hunting all.
---
Alright, that convinced me, thank you for doing that. Something's real broken here; the build sound effect plays but none of the components are consumed and nothing's added to your inventory.
---
Hm. I have a strange idea. Try equipping Super Duper and spam the build button. Would be hilarious if that creates "free" dupes.
---
You taking workshops? And you on pc?
---
Nice .. I think I found a better spot, I am always reluctant to go to that location because of that damn deathclaw who trashes me .. I will test the new location next time a challenge comes up ..
---
what im saying is that isnt an advantage if you dont fast travel when your weapon is broken its your own fault if you die. The fact remains that your saying stupid people because they are stupid we should accommodate them?
---
For whatever reason it's super blurry lol
---
Wait what? If you use mods on a public server everyone gets them? Im confused
---
In survival I never have to worry about food or water because all these friendly people have all these nice drinks and homecooked meals on them

5 is my record too - popular spot on a lead deposit between Ripper Alley and Huntersville. Whenever my base can't be placed, I've gotten in the habit of opening the map and making mental note of who's nearby before making the stay/go decision. I've noticed that more than once when I load into a "different" world, it's either the one I just left or one of the others I've hit while trying to find one where my camp can be placed. They're not the best at verifying you're going to a *different* world or that the one you're sending you to can actually accommodate your camp; I suspect you're just put back in the pool and get whatever slot opens next.
---
Everyone thinking syringer would be the best for this type of weapon while here i am thinking a special harpoon gun that you can pull the beast to ground after a successful hit
---
\+Karma
---
Cool, please share when you do!
---
Damn, 3 advanced repair kits per kill eh? I only need to repair like once a week and I kill SBQ like 20 times in a week lol. I'm gonna be dropping those damn things if they have any weight.
---
Should do. Although there is no benefit in reducing enemy's damage even for the boss fights. Far better making them take more damage instead.
---
Long barrel gives your more range. And those guys talking about vats are wrong. The amount of ap used by vats depends on perks ofc but the weight of the weapon. The less a weapon weighs the less ap it uses in vats
---
I don't even run W.K. but I have it max ranked for the component cost reduction during repair.
---
End up repairing every other day worst case, and that's mostly due to the Marine Chest piece &amp; it's flimsy nature. The arms &amp; legs which are a combo of metal, combat &amp; leather, all resist my whacky melee unyielding/bloodied playstyle absurdly well.
---
Its just conspiracies that are flying around are...a bit much.
---
What if you went to one of the factory workshops that let you build a vertibot? Like grafting steel?
---
It should yes
---
I run melee so I don’t need any of the ammo I have. But it always feels like a waste just dumping it. What I do is look at what type of ammo my customers use and with every transaction give each customer all of my supply of that type of ammo. It’s worked pretty well, but some don’t switch to the inventory tab or ammo tab to see what’s been offered to them
---
good on you man, good on you :)

Its not that rare, I did 3 yesterday, just go buy the recall card from a vendor.

Atom Shop

Lock everything. The only thing you'll lose is vegetables.
---
&gt;Over the past couple weeks, we’ve examined all the feedback and today we want to share our thinking when it comes to these types of items and how they relate to the Atomic Shop. We don't really give a fuck lol. We remain committed to that statement and take it into account when we evaluate every new item that we bring to the Shop, both now and in the future.

I'm using a handmade it sometimes all the damage I deal heals back up. I can see the healthbar drain, then refill most of it. It's a sync issue I believe that hopefully will be fixed some day.
---
Please up vote this ^^^^ this is so true. Yesterday I had the event pop up on my server and only about half way through more people started to show up. Failed the event and everything .
---
Based on my admittedly limited knowledge, I've got two guesses.
---
One is that console games (at least on Xbox) have 'Reserved Space' that's kind of an allocated block that's counted as 'filled' by the system but it's just a storage box for the game to write to. This is, to my understanding, why there is a size limit on mods in Skyrim and Fallout 4; for it to be bigger, it has to claim a larger chunk of your HDD to accommodate the capacity.
---
There may be limitations on increasing that, or it might require a title update to do and they're worried about more integral things at the moment like stability, bugfixes and new content. It may also just be that they're trying to respect people having consoles with 500GB drives that struggle with space.
---
The other is the one dinosauriac mentioned below, that it might be stored server-side for some odd reason, perhaps to sync the game gallery across any console you play on. I can't honestly think of any other real reason to do it like that.
---
I’d never even heard of that one.
---
I'm up to 20 server hops at Wavy. Still nothing. I'm overencumbered due to waiting for the legendary vendor so this is the only way for me to try to get this camera without an ever greater waste of time. Devs at Bethesda need some courses on what makes a quest fun.
---
I was lucky enough to get a 3* TSE Flamer and it is insane! Lots of damage, but can’t keep it repaired long enough to do a quick nuke zone run. I also got at TSE laser rifle.
---
No no, he doesn't actually want to initiate it himself, he wants to hop it like the Queen which doesn't happen as much anymore either lol OP just wants free events
---
I saw it pop up twice yesterday.
---
Only reason it's "rare" is cause it's rather expensive to start it after you've finished that quest.
---
If you repair them to 200% the amount of damage goes up quite a bit, but it’s very short lived. They can be fun to use but you really need to keep an eye on durability and repair often
---
Thank you good sir for answering. I don't know if there's a tenderizer legendary trait so i'll try to decrease enemies damage output as much as i can with this build
---
I don’t think they do. Their are in their own thing when u go to inspect a weapon or armor it gives you option to use one on bottom of screen.
---
Found mine at the top of Landview Lighthouse just south-east of the vault 76.
---
as i said in my OP........
---
"  been in the same spot for over a month now, and never had to "choose another world" to place CAMP "
---
it is NOT a common spot
---
Hmmm. Well intreting bug.
---
Yeah I was joking
---
1) Do they actually have a meaningful impact on pvp?
---
2) Even if 2.8k people on reddit refuse to buy them, it doesn't mean shit when enough people who don't bother with reddit will probably buy them.
---
3) Telling people what to do, only really works if they share your mindset; if they don't, they'll do the opposite of what you tell them, out of some forme of defiance.
---
4) If anyone replies instead of just downvoting, actually answer number 1 instead of stating it's a "P2W element" as an excuse, when it wouldn't actually count as one unless it actually impacted PVP in any meaningful form.
---
lmao!  troll!!!  living in a bridge!  ha ha!  +1
---
Yes.  Tanagra is a better megasloth spot imo.
---
Philosophical question: is it hypothetical when it was announced?
---
This problem is currently happening to my friend's camp - he seems to have a super mutant spawn near his base and he's tried every type of available turret and none of them will attack the mutants. It's really frustrating for him.
---
Oh it's definitely worth it. I have a Bloodied ripper, now farming Whitesprings consists of running around aggroing the ghouls and then standing in a corner and letting them run into the ripper and explode on impact.
---
Rippers are not terribly effective in my experience, -however- vampire rippers are great because each hit heals you up a bit, and a very fast weapon has tons of little hits. So when you’re getting chewed up by enemies, switch over to the vampire ripper, and heal yourself back up on an enemy for a minute, then switch back to a primary weapon.
---
same stats slightly different material requirements
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De-B3Cmfd7g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De-B3Cmfd7g)
---
i always thought the number of servers was a set number.  had no idea they closed and opened upon population.  thanx.  +1
---
Yup.
---
i will do that and edit this if it works
---
In the title, you misspelled Visitor Bot.   This should be a robot that you can buy for your camp (with atoms so poor little baby Bethesda can make some on-going money off of this game) for what is arguably a very cosmetic upgrade.   Thus when you interact with the Visitor Bot, you can see who has been at your camp.
---
Then when Bethesda decides they haven't milked that teat enough they can also sell you various skins for your visitor bot to make it look however you want.    
---
Then once those sales tank, they can sell you add-on behaviors for your Visitor Bot.  They can push a broom...act like a scarecrow for your crops...  wander around and bump into things repeatedly because it's old and in disrepair.
---
This is how you do cosmetics for atoms, Bethesda.
---
If you're on Xbox I'll buy it from you if you're interested in selling it. How about 5k and about 600 shotgun rounds I don't use?
---
Fast travel to Whitespring and walk straight ahead. Before you get to the building, look on the hood of the car in front, there’s a tourist spawn location there
---
They've increased the stash limit twice though, and mentioned they may increase it further before
---
Hrm, Imgur keeps chewing on it. I use the Forest Camo, Fashnact Beret, and Patrolman's sunglasses. I like it, and I'll keep ot until I see someone else with it on, lol.
---
You have recovered from rad worms!                               
---
(Literly less than a 30 seconds later)                         You have contracted rad worms
---
Yeah, I only see Stingwings there myself. Most likely an "unannounced change" from a few patches ago.
---
yeah i heard from someone buying  a god roll deathclaw for 8k caps ingame. the person he bought it from was very happy to make such a big deal. his only income were the ingame possibilities. i think there might be a lot of people playing like this and that you can make some nice deals when player vendoring comes out.
---
I go for a few weeks sometimes without getting it, and then I'll get it multiple times in a row. I know it's not the same world over and over again because I usually stay to see what other people have done with the place.
---
Oof!
---
This. They can nerf all they want, it's their game. Just tell the player base about it. Hiding it makes it worse.
---
**What armor is worth big caps?**
---
Legendary 3 stars with:
---
Assassin / Whatever / Sentinel
---
Assassin / Whatever / Cavalier
---
Unyielding / Whatever / Cavalier
---
maybe Unyielding / Whatever / Sentinel
---
Anything with weight reduction on the 3rd slot (ammo or junk preferably since the aid one is broken I think) that requires level 15 or less can be worth 8-15K.
---
**What do the sentinal / cavaleir..stuff like that..what does that mean..i have no idea.** 
---
Sentinel = 15% less damage taken while standing still and not crouching.
---
Cavalier = 15% less damage taken while sprinting.
---
Combine these effects, stacked, with Assassin (-10% damage taken from players) and you have godmode in pvp.
---
**The ones that say like 20% reduxed ammo or weapons or whatever..what kind of impact does thT have? I mean all in all my excavatir seemz to have the carry weight i need..so i was hoping someone cab open my eyes to this..** 
---
People use these on mules to allow the mule to carry a damn near infinite amount of junk / ammo. When combined with the Pack Rat and Bandolier perks, it makes junk and ammo weigh almost nothing.
---
I think we've all got our assumptions as to how it's going to work. I also was wondering about the unlikely nature of finding another player's camp then finding something I'd like to buy...
---
Here's my pulled-out-of-my-ass guess as to a way they could make it realistically work: map icons that you click and interact with as if you were at a machine/robot vendor. They you could interact with anything without the hassle of finding them/making your way past traps and locked doors and whatnot.
---
I'm with you on the stash full of junked items, but there's a bunch of stuff I tend to never take with me that I've never thrown out or sold to vendors like all the team bonus magazines (Life and Love magazines, for example), Nuclear keycards, unarmed bobbleheads, that sort of thing. Things with value that I don't throw out but never remember to take to vendors either. Oh, and plans galore. I'd be thrilled to make a few extra caps on those items that are just taking up space. If it's while I'm out completing events, so much the better.
---
What the what?
---
It’s literally the same fucking thing as a skin but worse because it can’t be legendary . Beth just made a statement in the patch notes reassuring you dweebs that nothing will be sold that gives a competitive advantage . You are no worse than a crazy person standing in Times Square handing out pamphlets that say the world is ending in the year 2000
---
I think you mean temple. I just imagined you tapping right between your eyes lol
---
Pretty sure this is correct. Heavier weapons consume more AP in VATS from what I've seen.
---
Probably to discourage hate speech or something
---
Me too. IGN is clb1013. Feel free to add me for PvP-goodness.  I’m level 231 and play stealth VATS bloodied sniper for the moment.  I do well on my own, but teamwork makes the dream work!
---
Shiiiiiet boi I’ll fight
---
Check at the top of Landview Lighthouse south-east of Vault 76. That's where I got mine from. You will also start a quest once you listen to the holotape found with the camera.
---
grafton steel allow me to build vertibot? Might check it...
---
if you ever played rust or wow you know its a good idea but people will use it in a bad way. would be cool if we could make some radio thing to look for other players for teaming or trading.
---
like in the movie i am legend: "i will be here every noon offering food and protection." \^\^
---
You shouldn't only wait for complaints to balance things. Some things may have unintended benefits or cause players to do things differently to what you originally designed, further causing other imbalances.
---
It should never just be what people complain about, especially since people are always complaining, sometimes on two sides of the same thing.
---
So many people have contacted me wanting to vend, referee, announce, stream, watch, fight, its been nuts! I'm just happy everyone is into the event.
---
The helipad is there, you just have to repair it once you own the workshop - I think 30 alum
---
over the past 3 days my legendary Dragon has loaded with 9 shots twice.
---
destroyed shit , but then it gets destroyed by the time you have to reload
---
I have a special graphics card for it I have a special Xbox and that’s why it fucks with some people’s connection and lag
---
Well kinda obvious. It'a cryptic(not sure about spelling).
---
Really?  Making them difficult to craft and possible an expensive/hard to get recipe is how you'd go about making them not be P2W...but instead only easily obtainable by people end game who have no use for them and wouldn't sell cheap enough for anyone low level to buy in bulk?
---
👌
---
Also not hard just risky you could fuck up your whole Xbox
---
the repair kits themselves aren’t worth shit to most players, what worries me is the precedent adding it sets to future “utility items” that could be more useful and actually impact pvp.
---
I can only imagine what it's like to exist as one of these soy-riddled man children. What were you like when you were a child? An actual, human child, I mean.   
---
When someone bumps into you in a bar do you file a police report for griefing? What about when you get a bill in the mail, is that griefing as well?
---
Are you still on that server? Also, what console?
---
So you can buy weapons with atoms.......
---
I looked every spawnpoint of the tourist 2 times, i didnt even see a  skeleton
---
I feel that most people spend more time looking for the bloody thing than doing the quest that comes with it.
---
“special Xbox”
---
a what
---
Sir, if you want to save us all the trouble and put yourself in a camp, it'd really save all of the actual humans a bit of time and effort.   
---
I mean, uhh, labor, or whatever.
---
I've seen that happen at my friends camp so many times as well. I put up scarecrows which drew all the enemy's aggro oddly then placed missile turrets in a cross fire angles around camp. Saw the scarecrow tip on reddit and it actually worked lol
---
There's posts all over the place of people holding the tourists on all platforms. Just join up with one of them.
---
No, he isn't (
---
Just sent friend request
---
uncraftable atoms at that lol
---
I think they just need to reduce the cool down time to 60 minutes and add a timer so you know how long you have to wait. 
---
There are plenty of players with more caps than they know what to do with, so I don’t think cost is that much of a deterrent. It’s the difficulty in actually getting it to start.
---
Has it taken server hopping multiple locations? Just curious, I found mine the first place I looked. I know someone shared a map of all the locations
---
Found mine several hours ago now on PC. Just keep serverhopping. It's deffo there. Just get to the very top where you turn in the event quest with the light bugs.
---
This is true. Tha
---
How many times did you try before you posted this? I've been getting the same amount as always.
---
I found him at Philippi battlefield cemetery this morning.
---
So you hardware modded your Xbox and you're surprised that Microsoft banned you. Right.
---
They do stack (they're implemented as separate perks), but it's multiplicative so you won't quite get half damage. 44% reduction instead.
---
Hunters long coat with sunglasses looks awesome
---
Do the quest, get a lense. With lense L2 on ps4.
---
It's not a skeleton. There will be a corpse with inventory. Just keep trying and you will find it.
---
I'm going to say this one more time. As someone who not only looks through the data files of the game but is also creating mods to fix Bethesdas screw ups like the repair bug and is also looking through the application code itself I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt that you are experiencing bad rng. There is no modifier anywhere for Watoga when it comes to legendary spawns at all. What you are seeing is probably due to an amount of legendary spawns elsewhere in the world or just bad rng. 390 enemies is not nearly enough to try to base this on. Bring me 5000 examples with video proof and then you have some solid info. Too many people spread false or misleading or misunderstood information on this reddit and all it does is cause people to keep thinking that something is happening when it just isnt.
---
This is what OP said last week lol
---
I usually run a bloodied build, but I started going full health, T-60 PA, and a full auto vampires handmade. 
---
Last night, I ran as conduit for all 3 pylons, and could have solo'd it. Between spamming stimpacks and killing bot spawns I dropped below 20% health once. I was constantly on aggro for the squatch, but just kept jumping over his head. 
---
Spent 2000 caps to get a 2* furious mole miner guantlet, and a 5th Fedora.
---
That is almost my same exact problem. I take 2 pylons and then melt him with my minigun (only used for bosses lol), only for his body to sail away, lag, explode, then who knows where his cloaked ass lands.
---
If you're on Xbox I have her at the Lighthouse now. 
---
BugDragon
---
or Q on PC
---
I found mine within 30 mins of looking.  People have posted maps and even telling people they are holding the location for others.
---
How about that alien at Van Lowe Taxidermy?
---
A tad bit cowadoody, but yeah, the ability to go prone is something I've always wanted in the franchise. There was at least one mod that included it in New Vegas but I remember it not working very well, at all.
---
Certain mods yes. So the body launch is for everyone the acid trip is for everyone when they are in my base and so on because it’s not applied to them it’s really applied to the enemy not to actually people so if you hit an enemy with a mod property attached to it it will respond with the mod property it will react with such same with area mods like the acid trip if your in the area you respond to the area. Think of this one like an explosion property you are near it you take damage or in this case your near it you trip on acid.
---
This is frustrating though because they put all of these daily challenges up for the camera and people who are trying can’t even find the damn thing. I looked for it for two hours last night and couldn’t find it.
---
Cool, I'm never spending money on Bethesda again. First the repair kits now this. They are just moving slowly to pay to win like model.
---
I have my house near one of his spawn, south of west tec, found him a lot
---
‘‘Twas a joke
---
I’ve gotten the best drops I have had in the game from this event (Weapons). Last week I did it about 15 times, and out of the 15, at least 6-7 times I got amazing 3* legendary guns wit amazing rolls. 
---
Now I don’t even care about spending the caps for the cards, to buy one of the guns I got would be 17-25k in caps and I have multiple guns from this event so it’s worth it to me. Just make sure you check the map and see who’s online and can/will contribute.
---
Cough cough rust
---
The patch has only been out for two weeks.
---
Ghillie suit would be nice. There is already Chameleon effect and Stealthboys that make you near invisible though.
---
As for prone - I don't think it would be possible as it's not coded in the base of the game. There was no prone in Fallout 4, so it's unlikely to be included in Fallout 76.
---
I've hopped servers at least 4-5 times each day since Saturday.  Its messed up my routine, I start at the bunker.  Search for TD, hit the vendor for the ever elusive calibrated shocks then scoot up to Grafton steel for the BoS armor plans.
---
Dude i looked for the corpse 3 hours, spent ~350 caps, lost my sanity and i cried after wasting so much stuff for a single fucking useless thing
---
It's a bizarre thing to lack prone. Guessing limitations of the engine, given is utter lack throughout.
---
I'll switch to Siege every now &amp; then, besides its lack of a jump it's so much more fluid in movement.
---
At least 59 do, lol
---
Already tried, not working
---
Just sent you a request! Thanks for doing this!
---
Yes I have the same issue.
---
I really want a dragon rend barrel for the syringer, updated to work on dragon like bats of course
---
I died after drinking the nukashine I smashed the party crashers, but instead of waking up across the map I woke up dead and couldn't respawn anywhere, screen was totally black, i could still open my map though.
---
Tried to add you, says your offline. :(
---
I have a 3* bloodied broad with reduced weight and faster reload, with all my heavy perk cards, this thing does serious damage, I’m around 400+ lol it’s fun as hell for me lol running around blasting the shit out of enemies with cannonballs hahah
---
I’m PS4 but thank you!
---
I as well am looking for a clan to join, and would not mind joining you guys. IGN is WanderingWolf15. My character level 90 something, and I'm a pretty standard bloodied-melee build, though I have also begun shifting over to bloodied heavy weapons build for my bloodied-explosive flamer.
---
I saw in my dream that the Legendary Vendor changed location, no kidding.
---
I can confirm server hop works. Hopped once in water park and a body (looks like he died recently) was against a car in parking lot
---
Piece of advice. You can have take just rank 1 of each rifleman perk and gain +30% at the cost of 3 points as opposed to +60% at 9 points. This way you have another 6 points to play with although you do lose half of your damage.
---
yeah that a bug i get too, very frustrating!
---
I think it’s just bad rng. I made a couple hops last night and the bunker desks all had 1-2 each time.
---
I hopped a few times, checked the soldier monument, the grave site &amp; path of the winding wind. They're all like within 5 cap fast travel.
---
Eventually found it at the Kelly's Monument or whatever. Pretty lackluster thus far, should've just found it "organically."
---
Love my buzz blades. Ripper not so much.
---
But in the same challenge you take a photo of the flatwoods monster as well I believe... I'll have to check.
---
i like the way it is tbh. you can choose to be an expert with a weapon type (60%) or using different weapon types (30%). 30% is enough for most enemies imo.
---
there are a lot of ways to play.
---
Damn man, I owe you a brink of your choice :) When I repaired the helipad vertibot appeared and done challenge on first try!
---
I'll be trying it again tonight, maybe I don't have enough candles lit on my RNJesus shrine
---
Then there's hope for this weapon yet. I've been using my Two Shot Harpoon gun alot, I want a 3 star version but even the 1 star deals pretty good damage and replaces it's own ammo.
---
I'm missing the Grafton Dam and one other. Can't recall if it's in the Divide or the Ash Heap.
---
I wonder if this is somehow tied to places discovered by Beta characters? Anyone running into this who *didn't* participate in the Beta?
---
No but for real. What Do we do with them after our album is full? Delete and start over? 🤷‍♂️
---
Another unrealistic request by a gamer that has no knowledge of game design. -eats popcorn-
---
Haha, I totally posted that reply to the wrong thread. Had a few too many last night and got the urge to do some trading — mistakingly replied to you instead of a pm.
---
And yes...we won. Sank a three at the buzzer to win the series.
---
Yeah but coordinates are like X and Y. 
---
You have just one, so it refers to a whole line around the planet.
---
That's not remotely possible connection to that town.
---
I would think it's likely those number were already in F4. I can't remember where, but some locations,(DLC?), had all sorts of lit up computers.
---
So, this basically confirms that 96 is where the scorched plague originated from, then.
---
Jeez. I've handed in 9 in the last 2 days. Might be an idea to record yourself trying to loot the desks and report it to Bethesda as a bug? Seems like RNG is singling you out
---
RB xbox
---
I know but I can't seem to get it to spawn. How many caps is it?
---
This seems interesting, shame it’s not on other platforms. Perhaps you could work with others to create separate branches?
---
Just use another weapon. Don't try telling me you never carry more than one weapon. I won't believe you. 
---
Even if your chameleon armor is in bad shape if you get the drop on them you'll most likely win.
---
Nice try, also I know this is hypothetical but if you had adhesive you'd have died at the bench be glad you ran out.
---
I have a full ultracite PA setup.  Good stuff man!
---
Idk what genius at Bethesda decided to make the tourist spawns random too. That just makes it more likely for new players to never know this camera exists.
---
have you ever looked up who the board of directors are at Bethesda?
---
it's fairly eye opening.
---
the toy alien and the animatonic alien does not count, least it didnt for me
---
I’ll stay on this Server for a while if anyone still needs it and is seeing this post. It’s at the water park
---
Kelly Monument right up near the monument itself, dead on a bench.
---
Think they purposefully placed the spawn in obvious locations, just getting it to pop up is the "trick."
---
Multishot Canister is a must, that being said your quad or a two-shot with weightless and extra damage while aiming could be fun.
---
So if you place a scarecrow - the mobs will normally be drawn to attacking it vs attacking valuable things like generators etc?
---
What's the Dovahzul for the words STOP SCREECHING PLEASE.
---
I got it on my third Server, good luck then! :)
---
Found on the bench on the top of Colonel Kelly Monument.
---
Can you get to the other top without jetpack?
---
Ah, good point! We should check the same computers in F4!
---
I would but I'd hate for it to get turned around and have them ACTUALLY nerf it.  Then I become a pariah to the community still searching for the BoS PA paints...
---
I would spend atoms on filters. It's cosmetic. Filters on a camera affect gameplay in no way that would cause you to have any advantage over another player.
---
You don't need plans for those, just the materials
---
I definitely make sure the other player is ok with it. I do see where you are coming from. Last trade I did was for a Excavator calibrated shock, and I just gave him the repaired one off my PA and made myself a new one. Though when I went to look at my mods to mule them, I realized I did have a calibrated shock mod I could have traded him. Ended up getting 2 t-60 calibrated shock mods.
---
Basically took it apart and reassembled it with better parts bigger storage. It took me a few tries to perfect but I love it.
---
Huh, thanks for the tip, gonna try that.
---
[https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010541651-User-Flair](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010541651-User-Flair)
---
Yeah, if you place defensive gates they will even attack those 1st then other stuff also. Pop a couple of scarecrows around trouble areas and see if it helps.
---
The Enclave created the scorched plague
---
Well thanks for the weapons .)
---
76 canon includes the free state bunkers as having been safe from radiation. Why would an underground dungeon not also have no radiation?
---
Made a lv50 buzz and got it to ~70 dmg. It's good for certain niche builds but ultimately lacks compared to just ohko with normal melee. Not worth the time.
---
Are you sure it wasn’t a metal helmet? I’ve never seen/heard of a Grognak helmet.
---
I only knew, because I followed a guide early game just to get the X-01 PA. And now I rarely use it. I run a unarmed build so PA does not work.
---
Unyielding isn't preferred for when someone is about to die, as it doesn't increase their health, it's good for people who want to constantly be on low health in exchange for +15 to all stats.
---
South side of the golf course at WS, definitely not a guarantee, but he and the mothman will show up around that south side of the wall about 5-10% of the time.  If you set up a camp on that junk pile you can hit that one and another random encounter spawn between that junk pile and the fissure site to the west.
---
Do you not fall when you fast travel there?
---
Yeah and its one of the things that always bugged me in fo4 and here.. especially in sniper builds which is what i prefer. I know the whole chameleon thing everyone of my characters has a peice of the armor on but its just the look and use of a ghillie suit. I would much prefer the more realistic hiding done through a ghillie suit versus chameleon effect.
---
Maybe its just me, but the thought of being prone in the cranberry bog among the grass sniping like a movie character just has appeal to me, or the photos ya see of military snipers decked out virtually unnoticeable in a feild.. 
---
But id be fine with a motion getting prone or out of prone and being vulnerable, and then limiting field of view while being prone (no spinning like a top for 360 firing).
---
How do you keep your health low?
---
Could you imagine this huge flying mutated beast and all you hear is “get down here bitch” and then it falls to the ground
---
It is.  The "cavaliar" prefix applies when that is the first attribute (major) in the list.
---
Are you certain it's during sprinting? If so, then yes - it's a Cavalier's
---
Any time again ;)
---
Thank you so much for the tip!! I will have to build him a couple tonight and see if it works out because due to the incline he's built on it's gonna be really hard to move it without starting over.
---
Letting them regen isn't the problem, I've tried that and they'll still bug out and drop a drill, syringer or just straight out nothing. Sucks but it's just a bug I guess.
---
Goddamn dude. Chill.  It's not that serious. 
---
It's not like I post up in front of my camp and yelll at everyone that they're griefing. 
---
It's a joke,  not a dick.  So stop taking it so hard.
---
Yesn’t? I guess cause I’ve never had an issue but that’s probably because I normally use mods for single player only so no one ever reports me
---
You run around punching stuff!?  You use any weapons at all?
---
The damage is apparently pretty good, the player seemed to be one shotting super mutant warlords and overlords. Obviously perks and mutations can go a long way, but it's not like a bloodied variant can exist if it's from the dev room
---
Try to do the Collision Course event at the Morgantown Airport. You can take a picture of the Cargobot that delivers the supply box at the end.
---
Is this a new 76 meme format?
---
It was a dead hulking, so no.  Oh well I’ll keep trying.
---
50 Cal MG. TS, 25% FR, and 15% RL
---
Nice!! Must have been a great time
---
So The Action Hero is actually good? Gonna grab it then.  
---
And thanks for that suggestion; not much into hardcore, more of a prog/death fan, but there's always something new to explore.
---
probably regular backpacks from quest and big backpacks in the shop
---
So weird they wouldn't just make it a reskin and instead do this.
---
Being able to go prone would be great! And some more actual camo would be welcome as well. I think the tattered field jacket + wrapped cap / surgical mask would probably work well in Toxic Valley for sneaking around but not sure for other places.
---
I was gonna mention they were in the tinkerer's bench, but I seem to recall you got your answer in a different post. Good luck with the challenge.
---
Resolved, glad you got it.
---
Sounds like the metal helmet. Grognak comics look like he’s wearing a crown or headband IIRC
---
My friend thought I was trolling her when I placed 6 in her camp lol then she came back a few days later saying it helped. Thank God for the reddit community figuring this out.
---
A large net fired from a fatman or missile launcher
---
I absolutely get people's frustration with it. I must have just been in a good mood last night though, because I set out thinking "if I were a tourist, in this shithole, where would I go?", pulled up a map, and planned out the cheapest possible route for fast travelling to the points I thought made sense. 4th stop, I found Anne at the foot of the Mothman statue (I'd tried the gift shop first, but figured while I was in town I'd try the statue too).
---
Part of the problem is also people (myself included) acting like zOMG, new content, MUST COMPLETE NAO!!! Like everyone else, I was scrambling to get the X-01 nuka quantum paint the very first day it dropped. This was a bucket list mission though, and in terms of a full game playthrough, was really only designed to be something to be stumbled across then completed in drips and drabs over the span of time, much like the Overseer's Personal Matters quest. You stumble across it, and do the stages as the game goes on; if you never find the first tape you're not aware the quest exists; it won't keep you from accomplishing anything.
---
I think on the whole we'll be a lot happier with the new stuff in the game as it comes out if we stop building it up in our minds as pivotal, game-changing content. Beth didn't help matters with the Burrows release, but really if we see the new stuff as just another bit of entertainment added to a game into which we've already sunk dozens if not hundreds of hours, we'll be less disappointed.
---
You can't invoke the whales argument without considering it fully. The term inherently refers to an extremely small % of a player base that contributes to the majority of the revenue or purchases. Meaning, that while the whales might be using repair kits, they are not near numerous enough to impact your gameplay.
---
Not everyone.  He indicated survival above, I up voted.  
---
Anything goes in survival.  Well, almost anything.  Don't molest the cats please.
---
I like the idea, but here’s some reality: your COLLISION boxes don’t even change when you *crouch*. I think that would need to come before they fuck around with a new posture.
---
It counted as an alien for previous challenges. So actually not obvious.
---
Are you aware that every 5 minutes on here someone says “I have corpse” and literally can just find your platform and join that person’s world?
---
The two new cryptid quests have notes all over FO76, not just in the two locations that were mentioned in the bigger Reddit post about them. I actually found a note for the Toxic Larry's Meat 'n Go quest on top of a building in Lewisburg.
---
That said, what makes the new Camera quest odd compared to how quests were done beforehand is the fact it was talked up a bunch by Bethesda and weekly atoms are tied to the camera.
---
There are actually a few quests already in the game that spawned from spawns, it's just none of them mattered before in the overall gameplay. I guess Bethesda is building the game now with meta-gaming in mind.
---
&gt;Modders made card load outs on PC in a matter of weeks
---
This right here, it bothers me that modders can do this but an entire team who's main focus is on this game cannot and that just rubs me the wrong way.
---
They correspond with places in the map where you can find a giant yellow pointy arrow.
---
Yep, I just think it would be overall easier if you could craft mods separately instead of having to put it on armor then trade it. We're stuck with the system we have now, so what you do is the norm, nothing wrong with it.
---
Do an emote after taking a picture.
---
I agree. It was not fun, but tedious.
---
It was incredible. Definitely one of the greatest sports moments that I've experienced.
---
Same here. I couldn't think of something better.
---
Donno, start a bid with starting price at 3k and see were it goes
---
Nope
---
Really? Impostor sheepsquatch checked off the Sheepsquatch one for you? Only counted as “Assaultron” under robots challenge for me. Are you sure it wasn’t something else you took a picture of that triggered it?
---
Nope. I got stuck in the rock once or twice. Haven’t fallen yet
---
Thing is.. I really like MODUS. One of the most interesting characters, and certainly the most interesting quest line in my opinion.
---
I can understand where you’re coming from, but I’d have to disagree. Yes, a lot of the major developers are trying to give a pay to play model, but there are many smaller ones that aren’t. And the big guys are learning their lesson with the fallout (no pun intended) they are getting from their base right now. I would bet that the days of having to buy DLC to make a game playable are gone. That said, DLC itself is here to stay, and I’m fine with it. I wish it had existed back in the day; Sky Jinks is my all time favorite game, but I could definitely use a new plane color or course route. 
---
Basically, we aren’t anywhere near another video game crash, and the value of your dollar when you buy a game has never been higher, when it comes to gameplay and story if you’re into the game.
---
right should have just been a skin but nope
---
Yep, another impossible challenge!
---
The disproportion between ammo usage on various HWs is staggering; we're talking about 10x more ammo on minigun vs gatling... At least 5mm is not that hard to come by.
---
I've gotten stuck like this a few times and I figured out if I walked in a really stupid way i could sometimes get out.
---
Look to your left or right and walk in that direction, then while you're walking in that direction just swing the camera back and forth. Almost like you're trying to swim.
---
Doesn't work every time, but it worked enough times for me to try it first.
---
I have enough of PC on my daily work, Xbox here.
---
So please share with the class... Where do you get these amazing and harmless mods for Fallout 76 on Xbox One?
---
This. I can push 200+ damage with my bloody ripper and I’m not a melee build- that’s in power armor with about 15str, 3x1star Gladiator cards. Add up full 9/9 gladiator, an Unyielding build for 15 more str, 5 more from Radicool, then stack in situational stuff like 60% Adrenaline and 30% from drugs, and maybe if we’re chasing crazy numbers 50% from Revenant, and yeah, it gets redic.
---
I have noticed some have responder or raider corpses were the possible spawns are... Still no camera.
---
Have you tried not using the durability perks lately? It would not be feasible for anyone to use repair kits instead of slowing breakdown. Gears breaks so quickly without the perks that youd be using repair kits every 10 mins at least. Even for whales its not feasible to spend $10-20 a day for repair kits.
---
Yeah, I edited my post after some testing. I sometimes drain the core, and sometimes do not. Something is broken, I suspect. WOuldn't be surprising xD.
---
No laughing matter. My great grandfather died in an internment camp.  He fell out of a guard tower.
---
&gt; Wouldn't it be *nice* if we had some kind of unique, maybe quest given weapon to bring a scorchbeast down to the ground?
---
FTFY. 
---
I like the suggestion btw!
---
I am hoping that at some point they might hold a contest or something like that for players to take certain pictures or just the best pictures they can and the prize could be like some atoms or something like that for the top few or something. I think it would be a lot of fun and would be a great opportunity for players to share their photo-creativity.
---
Well, not to be snarky but you’re posting instead of just scrolling down and finding one.  That’s how I got mine yesterday, took 10 minutes.  Fair chance that no one is going to sell you the camera they just got because you’re frustrated.  🤷🏼‍♀️
---
I run a 2 star instigating Deathclaw Gauntlet, with a combat shotgun and lvl 3 enforcer as backup for when shit get real. I do run a 2h build if I need to get into PA, and I am working on being able to run 1H also. My main is pretty much entirely a melee build with a shotgun backup. He does fool around with other guns in low level areas though.
---
Not really spawn locations, closer to the touristy-things, e.g. in Berkley Springs the tourist is at the castle (all the way across town from the spawn) and in Pleasantville the body is at the foot of the mothman statue.
---
Especially with how easy it is to obtain The Action Hero! Load up the appropriate perks and shred anything that isn't heavily armored within a TSE's danger-close range if you're not running dense/fireproof. (Or like me and just don't like TSE much)
---
Or someone sold the wrong thing and walked away without checking.  Gonna be one really upset poor fella out there then.
---
Well I gotta thank you for that whale killer recommendation :)) If you didn't tell me about it back then, I wouldn't have it for sure.
---
I would also except some kind of bastard raider modded missile launcher that airbursts and sprays sharpened rebar into the queen's wings.
---
Damn man that’s harsh, but just remember women didn’t get in trouble for removing polish with chemicals, but Hitler did
---
I went to sleep :( add me ingame Thugs4Hire
---
I’ve seen at least 2 of those posts today so far
---
That would most likely break the game, and even crash a server you realize
---
Arguably doesn't matter since we're talking about Bethesda business decisions, os only Bethesda Fallout games matter in this case.
---
I had to server hop at Wavy Willards around 20 times. Not fun.
---
only a few hundred posts, does no one search before posting?
---
I made the acid one with some basic programming knowledge and there are small forums. But part of my modifications for my Xbox is an adaptor for pc mods.
---
The only part that isn't great is the +250DR reloading - you don't need much time to reload the gatling.  The rest of the stats is pure gravy.  +50DR aiming would be a better 3rd stat.
---
i know, its a pipe dream but wanted to throw the request out there. im not going to hold my breath for it to actually happen but god i would love it to have em.
---
Yeah, it seems they should've made it a skin. I wonder what the reasoning was behind making it a separate design, considering you must have the original weapon's design learned prior to crafting one.
---
Post about it being uncraftable is plain stupid. In the videos it clearly shows one of the requirements was not met (Science Expert perk card) and the weapon is minimum level 25 (what level was the character that tried to craft it?)
---
Yeah; I skip LnL completely in favor of other, more useful strength perks...
---
I love the lvl 3 enforcer, deathclaws are not as scary thanks to that perk.  NO KNEES FOR ANYONE.
---
While those changes seem reasonable, the problem is they've broken trust now that they have a financial aspect to balancing the gameplay system.
---
Their given reasoning was, 'we wanted to bring them more in line with similar perks to help prevent them from feeling like mandatory picks.'
---
Which seems like a logic spin, on paper 'reduce this because it's too effective and everyone picks this' seems reasonable, but the reason everyone picks it is because the armor degradation is too high.
---
Also I think they've been disingenuous before about their reasoning.
---
Back when they rebalanced xp gain they also stopped 'Feed the people' from giving everyone on the server canned stew. Canned stew is a +5%xp for 30min item.
---
The reasoning they gave was 'it was a bug'. In the context of all the other XP nerfs during that patch and that they didn't do anything to the event Death Blossoms which also gives everyone on the server stuff their explanation doesn't seem right.
---
Maybe I am mistaken, but in both cases, it looks like the little lock symbol is still locked. But I see you posted a corrected video, so cheers on that.
---
Camera itself or just the camera film?
---
While aiming with the lens upgrade use your VATS button :)
---
This is a brilliant idea--I'm gonna have to set this up to advertise my vending machines. Draw back being that skull. \*ponders\*
---
Subnautica had something similar to this. When you &gt;!leave the planet, you can leave a time capsule behind with a single photo that you took from your time on planet 4546B, along with some items. The catch is that these have to be actually vetted by the devs, so nothing bad gets through.!&lt;
---
Lol same with my bloodied Mr Handy buzz blade
---
Lol, not really fan of them; guess they're too much in your face. I was actually thinking about Turisas / Hunting Pirates, as I've heard that song live last month and it (they) rocked.
---
This is FO76, if you don't server hop at least 10 times, you're not playing how they want you to. :p
---
I got mine at Wavy Willards after hopping 20ish times.
---
All we know is that the enclave eventually created the scorchbeasts, and spread the disease. It's not out of the realm of possibility that they got the fungus from 96, originally
---
Yes there's additional stocks, not just the shovel.
---
Oh, idk about that. If you want to tank the sheepsquatch it might be worth it. 
---
But what the other poster said about multiplicative stacking is true. 
---
Also, secret griefing trick- no slap damage means no slap damage. But it doesn’t stop debuffs. You can nerf someone’s damage output by ~44% tagging them with Suppressor’s Suppressor’s guns in adventure mode. At least, you could in patch 7. Haven’t tried since then.
---
Save the caps and server hop at the WS Resort. Ansel can be on the red car in front of you.
---
I think you're right on the money although I feel like a part of the problem is there is a large group of players that have already "completed all there is to complete" aside from their non-quest related daily activities (for me it's apparel/plan hunting) and people just get really excited to have something new to do but frustrated when it doesn't immediately fall into their lap or they have to go out of their way to complete it. 
---
That said I really enjoyed this quest and revisiting places I haven't really been too since I first found them (like the pumpkin house) so it's been a lot of fun for me. My friend has recently been coming back to the game and I can't wait to take her around for pictures!
---
Oh god that's a *terrible* roll, really absolutely worthless, you should rid yourself of such an embarrassing weapon before anyone sees you with it. Lucky for you, I have no shame and will gladly take it off your hands...
---
(In all seriousness, that's a God Roll if I've ever seen one.)
---
Aliens are cryptids too for the purposes of this challenge. The flatwoods Monster is considered both for some challenges
---
Yes this happened 4 times last night to us.  And twice half the people couldn’t find the bodies.
---
Yes it is, My ZE LMG eats 75 rounds in under 3 seconds, but that's all it needs to drop a level 80 SB from the sky.
---
The northern most fissure site in the cranberry bog is mine now. it has 2 static spawning corpses to grab every so often. other than that and tanagra the only "reliable" place i've found sloths is random spawn points.
---
I can't word this without sounding like a jackass; but did you take pictures of those targets IN the forest area?
---
Super Mutants being present in Appalachia made more sense than the Brotherhood being there!
---
Radiation.
---
They should really put the timer below the event so you can see how much time is left before you travel to an event.
---
What are you on Xbox?
---
No never, for me at least. It gives me a reason to wear other power armor. OR they should let players upgrade their power armor to have a higher defense.
---
Actually i posted this to destroy this sub, and you uncovered my secret plans. Now i need to erase you from existence because you know my plans.
---
So, like the shout from Skyrim to take Alduin down? 
---
Maybe they can sell a special "ancient era" outfit to go with it, get some cash raking into the atomic shop. Goodness know i'd never pay 5 dollars for a Baseball bat skin.
---
Okay bye!  Enjoy your secret plan!
---
Oh, duh. Thanks!
---
Yeah, it makes no sense lol. I sincerely thought I was seeing stuff when I first saw it. Then I started paying attention to it, and wow. For example, iirc I spawned into Harper's Ferry noticing I had only 18 cores left (this was my last stop before logging off at my camp, which I fart travelled to), after doing the once over in Harper's ferry (which for me consists of only the street that runs immediately parallel to the train wreck, and the alley that the vendor sits in), I spent 2 whole cores. It usually takes me hours to burn through 2 cores.
---
Nah, it’s not cavalier unless it says it. This ones prob worth 100 caps. I’ll pm you. :p
---
There are plenty.
---
From what I can recall from memory, there are one or two grips that don't have any stock at all, the shovel stock, the giant dragunov-looking one, and a "regular" stock
---
are you checking the body immediately?  if so give it a sec before checking to give the game time to load a legendary in.
---
You are absolutely right, my friend! Just checked Vault 81 in F4, and sure  enough the number is there!
---
[https://i.imgur.com/cH6ohT5.png](https://i.imgur.com/cH6ohT5.png)
---
Don't they usually leave easter eggs of upcoming games? Like, there's a reference of Vault 76 in Fallout 4? Maybe it could be that? Or maybe it's really just coincidence...
---
My favourite stock for handmade looks like it came off of a VSS Vintorez. Pretty dope
---
Thank you for the info!
---
The broken camera
---
Oh an "adaptor", gotcha.
---
There are 6 more stocks beyond the standard A few are the short grip handles, and some have the traditional "AK" rifle stock look.
---
rabbit mascot helmet in the armor bench
---
Armorer's workbench. Should be able to craft bunny hat now
---
It is a saviour for melee builds, especially with yao guia's. The stagger attack they spam wrecks me everytime. And gulpers, those are the only 2 mobs that tend to give me issues.
---
You got the double whammy. Sheepsquatch goes invisible and you get wood armor
---
I was in my camp when I got hit by the nuke and when i respawnd i took no rad damage even though the people near me did.
---
Yeah should be, if it does have the take less damage while sprinting, that is a cavalier effect. The cavalier name appears when a certain Prefix legendary appears, not sure what it is. But yes it's cavalier, same applies for Sentinel (where you take less damage standing still).
---
We have the weapon, just let me use it.
---
HARPOON GUN
---
Give me a real Harpoon. Make me hit something X times based on size / level to bring it do the ground (ever played Horizon Zero Dawn)?
---
Omw :D
---
Perfect! I'll probably go with the regular or Dragunov.
---
Known issue, they are working on it.
---
[Dev Comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgjbg6/this_problem_with_sheepsquatch_quest_is_very/ellnu1l/?context=10000)
---
VATS will drain your cores really fast
---
We'd thought maybe someone grenades the body off map,  ours did this last night too.  We scoured the area looking for an invisible body too...
---
if you can get anything to load in...  I have a beast of a PC, I first built a sniper build, scrapped that almost immediately, the first time I tried to clear a place with a long scope there were no enemies, then as I am sprinting towards the town like 50 super mutants spawn right in front of me, that's not the only time that has happened either, you have to get so close for enemies to spawn that it makes most long range rifles useless, at least at any respectable range...
---
I would be fine with them being craftable. They should be fairly costly to make though as they are capable of repairing items that are expensive to make repairs on.
---
pLEASE stop griefing me
---
I just looked up an image of the Vintorez; it looks pretty cool.
---
Just look out for the nice people who hold it on your platform. That’s how I did it.
---
Just curious, are you wearing a hazmat suit? If I recall correctly, when I was using my berserker's lever action, I'd lose damage when wearing it and I assume it's because the radiation resistance is being counted as damage resistance.
---
Agreed, I rock a Vampire's combat shotgun and pair it with a bloodied spiked fire axe.  I run a low health / high rads build and an anti armor splodey lever action rifle.  I try to keep my distance with my sneak attack damage at lvl 3 but keep that combo for when I'm discovered.
---
This is my exact point
---
The game just needs something so it doesn’t feel so artificial and stuck. Literally everything respawns and nothing ever changes. The world is stuck in a static state
---
neither just make a gunslinger and spam vats crits with a 10mm, you can take down a level 50+ scorchbeast in less than 30 seconds with that build
---
This is my general adventuring setup:  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f546c59&amp;d=sb0sq2s32sr2s20sg2sw0pq1pj0eh2ep0c72cm0cu0ib4ip2id0ic2a80a00a12ls2lt2lu2p10pe0&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f546c59&amp;d=sb0sq2s32sr2s20sg2sw0pq1pj0eh2ep0c72cm0cu0ib4ip2id0ic2a80a00a12ls2lt2lu2p10pe0&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=)

Okay?

Kinky
---
Ahh cool - I didn't see where it told you that lol
---
Idk im on ps4 and i have had no issues seeing mobs at distance. I clear west tek almost daily and take leechers with me and we start from the cliffs so they can tag/hit first before i kill them. So i cant speak for pc loading issues.
---
Same.  I grab PA skins, weapon skins and the occasional CAMP decoration.  I'm hoping for some better armor skins to purchase going forward.
---
I had it happened yesterday with a teddy bear. And as long as I was playing I couldn't get rid of the teddy bear. When I logged out and log back in the next day it went away
---
Upvote for the reference.
---
was a mighty kick to the nuts. especially given that I tanked all the pylons.
---
Cavalier is a plus effect for caps, troubleshooter is less desirable. What is the third effect?
---
Paladin looks freaking amazing. I need this in my life. Been hoarding tech data on my 2nd character to turn in on main.
---
+1 charisma
---
From the point of view of a player that has been playing for months I understand what you say. But now imagine someone who just started playing, goes around by some areas and discovers quests and areas by exploring.
---
Bethesda is doing it that way to encourage exploration and making the players pay attention to the world, and I find it a good idea.
---
Well on the plus side, I'll never need to use mats to repair anything ever again lol. I just wish I could trade them to my alts, because I really can't see myself ever using that many on my main.
---
Can i ask that it should be a heavily reduced amount of radiation since its in a sheltered environment
---
Cool story. Tell it again.
---
you could just aim for his wings with a 50% limb legendary and concentrated fire...
---
Did they tell you it would? It's amazing how quickly this sub is willing to assign malevolence to every problem that crops up, big or small, instead of the very real possibility of unintended errors. Every problem they've had, they've been "trying to screw the consumer", and yet when they fix the problem, nobody acknowledges it, we just get the next batch of malevolent problems to rant about.
---
No fight in this game requires the endurance to go beyond most weapon's breaking points if it's being done right, IF you plan ahead (in other words, repair before you show up). I have had my weapon break exactly twice on the SBQ fight, once because I didn't repair before joining, and once because I was on a sub-50 with low level non legendary weapons and it took two clips to kill a scorched mirelurk.
---
I am not going to say that the possibility that they're going to do something shitty is impossible, but it is improbable given their history. I am not saying don't watch, I'm saying don't jump on the pitchfork bandwagon over small garbage. Because frankly, if they ARE planning on screwing everyone, public outcry won't do shit. It took legislation to get EA to change, and that was only barely. Angry redditors won't help.
---
I might run with a more bloodied build when I get the Deathclaw Gauntlet weekly challenge prize for survival. That thing looks sick. But other then that I never got much into min/maxing my build, I run a casual powerhouse build. I can still one shot most enemies with my instigating Deathclaw Gauntlet.
---
Thanks for the suggestion; I updated the post.
---
Just call me Sir Poopsalot!
---
This one?  You'd be lucky to get 700ish.
---
Most people want assassin's Cavalier. Troubleshooter is not really that desirable.
---
We might be stuck in a Vault-Tec simulation. There's lore that supports it... and the date never changes.
---
What about the Dead Alien in the Red Dump truck? Usually outside Lewisburg?
---
I've tested that, and before it didn't change the damage. I've tried clothes, rad suit, I've also tested with and without energy resist and the only thing that changed was base damage (ballistic defense) I will retry with and without the hazmat tonight, as I haven't tried that since the patch dropped.
---
yeah im a bit tired of Fortnite silliness in my post apocalyptic wasteland
---
Thing is I wouldn't consider myself a casual player but neither somebody who is on it everyday for hours and hours. Even if I was to dedicate a week off work to play the game for hours a day, it would take a fair bit of time if I didn't know the locations.
---
Granted, if I was starting this game today it would be like any other ordinary side quest which I happen across while I explore, but there are lots of players who have reached the end of the line and are hungry for more content. I suspect maybe, just maybe, this may be a test of what kind of stuff works, what doesn't, what was successful what can be improved to future content to bring out more substantial stuff.
---
I can hope. 🔮
---
I saw somewhere someone said Wise Mothman from the Enlightened event counts towards Sheepsquacth for some reason. Worth a try if its true.
---
Yeah. It's a bit weird, because I can see both sides. Long term, this is good for theoretical new players, but for us currently it feels a bit weird.
---
If a line passes through a town then it most definitely is related to that town. It's just also related a large number of other locations.
---
'It's a Trap' is an event that brings down a single SBQ that spawns just for the event.
---
the cliffs aren't that far from West Tek, I should be able to see mobs at Whitesprings from the top of the cliffs to the east but I can't until I am practically on top of the train station
---
I made a post about this earlier. There's dozens of places that you can go. Everyone that I've played with has been on one server and never server hopping all found them.
---
Yep, crazy but fragile. And congrats on the that laser rifle, that's a pretty coveted item nowadays...
---
OI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GET OFF MY LAWN!!!!!!! THAT MY LEAD CAMP SPOT!
---
:)
---
what level?
---
I'll take the faster fire rate if you're willing to sell for 1.5K? I'll throw in some ammo for you if you need it
---
I run that one on my quad automatic handmade. It's heavy but really helps with the recoil
---
I have it on all my power armour's but use them so infrequently that I couldn't remember. It is helpful in nuke zones for sure especially at sbq
---
And dont forget the pun,   Poon to the face!

I got four last night. First time searching there, actually.

Photo mode allows for a ton of filters, frames, and customization but requires you go through the menu to access.

The prosnap camera can be equipped like the binoculars to allow for quick snaps and action shots but cost film to take the snaps.

Is it really a loose interpretation? Name one competitive advantage a repair kit provides.

Pretty good would be better with explosive
---
My friend has a whole list of edited posters. It makes for a great troll.
---
be there soon
---
Let me know what you find! I'm also curious to know if any mutations that increase your resistances might also be factoring into the equation. When I checked this out before patch 6, I didn't have any mutations on my low level test character so I couldn't see if they made a difference for the berserker's stuff.
---
So it makes no difference if it is malice or incompetence if the problem is reintroduced and it persists. I won't speculate on the motives for why these things happen, but I have spent way too many weeks performing arcane workarounds to bugs that have been introduced or reintroduced in this game to ignore that it happens. It absolutely happens, even with durability and food spoilage timers.
---
I don't have any idea of what truck you are talking. Could you pls be more specific?
---
As others have said, weight and, tangentially, ap cost. 
---
THAT SAID... keep an eye on the weights, because some of the rifles are bugged in such a way that long barrels weigh less than short barrels. I'm sure that's something they'll fix in the future, but for the time being, there's no sense in shooting yourself in the foot (heh) if you're watching stats that closely.
---
Commie scum. We’ll wipe you filth of the great land of Appalachia.
---
Huh, I do have stashed ZE LMG; haven't used it yet. Is it that good for dropping SBs? Cause that's the only thing I can't seem to figure out, as I don't run VATS and all my explo heavies not really that accurate...
---
we just need a junk jet lol just launch shrapnel at her
---
indeed, wise Mothman count even as Sheepsquacth.
---
just fast travel instead of logging out, still have to make the climb again but at least you won't have to log out and back in again.
---
I was under the impression a Best in Mod Slot hunting rifle did more damage, but the slower fire rate and harder to control recoil made me swap to the lever action. When very few things die to one shot, something that shoots quickly is optimal.
---
After testing the energy resistance card It didn't change the damage so I ate a grounded serum, even now swapping out the perk card didn't effect the damage either. Ill follow up once I get home and test this in a few hours.
---
Yea, the trashed decon shower is what hurts the most. Nothing else is really that big of a deal to replace. I would suggest keeping that bad boy stored and only placing it when you need to use it. Griefers love destroying those.
---
everything to do with voice chat in this game is seriously bugged
---
Search the outskirts of Lewisburg going towards Big Bend Tunnel East - you should find a Big Red Dump Truck - jump in and see if the dead Alien is in the back - sometimes he's wearing a hat.
---
I run Vanguard. Here’s what I do:
---
1) Level 1 sun-kissed perk to get rid of rads for half of the day, only need to use Radaway during the night
---
2) lead belly at 2 or 3 so I don’t take many rads from food or water
---
3) healing factor mutation so that I go back to full health when not in combat
---
4) sneak perks, and sneak legendary effects on armor, so that I can walk right up to almost anything and they never see me. Helps take less damage
---
5) perks to avoid limb damage, etc. so I don’t take as much damage.
---
6) Use Stimpaks as necessary while in combat if I do get hit.
---
I went from living in power armor to just Vanguard armor and I’m loving it. I run the WS ghouls and I only have trouble sometimes when a crapstorm of ghouls attack me all at once in the golf shop.
---
I'd pay atoms for a lot of things but not this.
---
I'm sorry but when PC basically has as many slots as they want why should consoles have to pay extra for more slots.
---
Especially when the consoles still save those pictures where the normal screenshots are anyway its ridiculous that we are so limited on pic space.
---
Post your request on r/fallout76baazar
---
At least you didn't pay the 2k caps... right?
---
honestly they didn't tell us at all. people just had to find it i guess.
---
Plans for the Gatling laser are sold in the Enclave Bunker at the vendor bot in the military wing. There is no set spawn or drop point for one that I am aware of.
---
It’s level 50
---
Well,I guess that’s the reality of Drinking Nukashine, might end up dead.
---
I think seeing mobs at whitesprings from westtek is pretty unreasonable i mean youre talking miles away.
---
Distance in game when people get seperated is measured in meters/yards basically so west tek being up on the cliff to the back by the front door being roughly 200-250 ish meters/yards, roughly length of 2 football fields equivalent id still consider that a long shot.
---
It’s literally the same fucking thing as a skin but worse because it can’t be legendary . Beth just made a statement in the patch notes reassuring you dweebs that nothing will be sold that gives a competitive advantage . You are no better than a crazy person standing in Times Square handing out pamphlets that say the world is ending in the year 2000
---
I wonder if a certain lvl FlatwoodM9jster cpunte towqrds alien then. :/
---
I did the event and took a photo of the wise Mothman last night and it didn’t work. It only counted as a Mothman.
---
I tried it last night, didn’t work for me :(
---
I'll do 3k
---
The lowered camera in the right hand and the upward spiral of the clouds really give this picture a "Well... shit." feeling.
---
Big PP chad destroys dungeon with one bullet (2019, colorized)
---
I went to the car park and found the body straight away, must have been lucky.
---
Is there also film for sale in the ammo machine/from vendors?
---
I do use VATS pretty consistently, but I always have. The only change to my gameplay has been using my PA less than before, but my fusion core consumption has spiked drastically ever since the last couple of patches. So something in the game has been altered or it's a bug removing them.
---
damn straight lol. I tank all 3 pylons every time someone spawns it. I'm not spawning it myself though. Nocturnal Wood is all you have to see.
---
I play a non-PA character though :(
---
You are wrong. That is by definition not instancing.
---
Instances as we know them are special 'instances' of a dungeon/level/area that is created solely for the people that are requesting it.
---
Allowing access to a space that exists on the same server  to only one group at a time isn't an instance, as it is not creating an instance of the content.
---
It's sort of tautological, but really think about what the word 'instance' means.
---
Thats a good idea too.  I have some weight reduction perks from when I started but have been trying lately to get my build together.  Once everything is done I should then be able to stay out of power armor most of the time to really get my stealth build to shine more.
---
Currently, I spend most of my time in calibrated excavator and usually dont get out of it because if I load into the game with it on my carry weight is one number then if I either take it off and get back in or start the game without it on my carry weight is more than 100 lbs less.  And if I reload into a new world to reset the carry weight back I then lose my well rested xp bonus.  lol  So like I said before it's nothing game breaking but a lot of little annoyances that you have to game around .  I am hoping things are better with player trading to free up space and allow me to carry less on me because my stash is full of trade items.  {fingers crossed}
---
Toy alien doesn’t count, alien in the TNT dome doesn’t count, alien in the truck bed doesn’t count, taxidermy alien doesn’t count, Flatwoods Monster doesn’t count. So.... yeah. Doesn’t seem to be possible to do this challenge.
---
You sound so miserable
---
I think I'll buy a card and run it later. On XB1. Now that people actually understand the pylons part. That sob comes at me every time I join. If you're on XB1 and wanna do it around 8pm est I'll start it up.
---
I had that happen yesterday with 16 honey. couldn't eat or drop them.
---
I've spent several hours server hopping and fast traveling. Seems impossible or I'm just really unlucky. Best chance is waiting on discord for someone to announce it at this point.
---
simple example:
---
two players run into each other. both have all broken weapons. the one that bought kits is going to be able to repair on the spot and take out the one that doesn't.
---
without the obscure scenario, the result is the same. the one that has the repair kit is going to have the advantage in an extended firefight. guns break, and you cant fast travel away from that.
---
even in PvE, lets say you are farming whitesprings. you and a stranger are mowing down hoards, sharing xp. your weapons break. you are immediately at a disadvantage and are forfeiting time, xp and loot to go fix your gear, while the others get to clean up shop for themselves. 
---
is it going to shift the paradigm? probably not, but it absolutely does offer a competitive advantage, though mild.
---
I have a nocturnal explosive gatling plasma, one of my best drops. I could honestly solo the impostor sheepsquatch with it at nighttime, the DPS is amazing
---
Oh yeah I know. If I can't afford whatever he's asking for it you can gladly take it. Idk what platform he's on though.
---
I love you all
---
I have mix feelings about this, my favorite burrows run was when we ran across another team, and pvp erupted. Made an interesting run and a lot more loot, at least for us.
---
i spent all of my caps fast traveling to all confirmed locations (switching servers after checking all of them and then just server hoping and checking the one location i was already at because i couldnt go to the other locations. this lasted about 2 hours before i gave up and checked reddit. luckily a kind soul posted they found it and i added them to my friends and joined them, getting the camera.
---
due to lack of caps, i can't do the actual quest without walking. but at least i got the first part out of the way. now to farm purified water and sell it so i'm not broke again lol
---
Oh that sucks. It's a great gun, thanks for the offer anyway :D
---
It's ridiculous that a 3* Legendary Boss that costs 2k caps and requires a ton of players to kill has the same loot table as any other legendary creature out in the world (crap items).
---
if you are on Ps4 ill buy it for $3250 if it is lvl 40 or above
---
LOL I just had a scenario play out in my head. Bunch of players trying to kill SBQ, can't bring her down. People are dropping like flies. \*Dovahkiin music fades in\*. A man in metal armor walks up to the queen and shouts jibberish at her. She falls to the ground. He stabs her through the heart and then absorbs her power. Now he's able to shout radiation spells.
---
Feel free to take it I'm on PC so I'm out of luck
---
Also short tends to have better condition bars ...
---
:o you take that back! that skull is what I can proper decor.
---
Its max lvl, but I'm on PC
---
Happened to me behind blackwater mine
---
yikes
---
thanks...for the chuckle... this was a joke, right?
---
You need to report that user to Bethesda then.
---
You also fundamentally dont understand what an instance is - you wouldnt have to server hop to enter an instance, as the instance itself is hosted on a server. By entering a new instance of a dungeon, you are effectively 'joining a new server'.
---
ah ok, thanks though, good luck im sure you wont have a problem selling it, its a solid roll on a  good weapon!
---
Jesus, I'm a melee build and I would swap everything I have for that.
---
There are many ancillary benefits to Weightless armor beyond the Chameleon mutation.
---
Big two are Sprinting and Stealth. Both are keyed off of armor weight. The lighter your armor, the more stealthy you are and the longer you can sprint.
---
If you aren't using a "stealth" type build though, it would probably be wasted.
---
Vanguard is generally a much better melee fit and better utilizes the BOS armor mod. 
---
I happen to run a stealth build with full weightless armor and I can sneak up to a Deathclaw at night and dry hump it endlessly without breaking HIDDEN. During the day it will go to Caution, and it will eventually turn to Danger if I keep it up.
---
Sneak is more about noise management than being "invisible". The heavier the armor the more noise you make.
---
Can't wait to buy this and more repair kits.
---
There’s a lot that Bethesda claimed that didn’t actually happen. I have yet to see this mysterious new change to what drops aluminum. Infinite black loading screens are still there. Everything basically feels the same, aside from adding a new camera that I’m unmotivated to even get lol.
---
I’ve also had an issue where the Imposter was invisible for me while still alive, but not everyone else. It’s almost like it didn’t exist for me. Then if I died and respawned in the area it appeared normally. 
---
It’s happened twice, sadly I have no video, but perhaps the two bugs are related. 
---
One of my teammates experienced the invisible corpse bug as well, but the rest of us could see it.
---
Make sure your nvidia GPU is priority for the game
---
By mistake no doubt as well.
---
Wait.
---
These are sellable?
---
I don't think it's that rare, I still see them regularly. I do wish they were a little cheaper, and gave more neat Sheepsquatch related rewards. I think most people that've done it a bunch of times have the outfits.
---
Oh well, not anymore apparently.
---
After patch 8.5 apparently bethesda though that crafting flamer fuel was too easy so they nerfed it.
---
Now the only way to craft fuel is the normal way.
---
This is the most ridiculous shit i have seen in this game.
---
Removing the only viable source of ammo for a gun.
---
Great, so the entire battle will come down to people yelling at each other.
---
Wasn't sure if NPCS like that are in a different category
---
ADVENTURE!!!!!
---
Blimey that’s a stunning idea!! Suddenly you have a network of locations to go to and it would encourage the world building as people would remember the funny or great camps!
---
You can equip them to a quick button. Just as you can with stimpacks. So all of your "open you pipboy" bullshit is just that. Bull.
---
Also, thanks for reading, but let me reiterate: it's not because of the repair kits, it's because they promised that the atom store would ONLY have cosmetic items. This is not cosmetic. This is only the first, there will be more, better items, if this one works.
---
Whilst seemingly simple I suspect going prone would take a big reworking of the movement part of the engine, as well as adding in better collision zones, hit boxes and animations. Should most definitely appear in 5 but I doubt it's worth them adding to 76, no matter how much I would like it.
---
Right? I’m trying to see if there’s a cap on AP regeneration. Hypothetically if you have serendipity and crazy high ap refresh, you shouldn’t be dying anytime soon.
---
Wish this game had an anti material rifle. That would bring that bitch down.
---
Repair kits are just a mild prelude to the real money maker - backpacks.  In time they'll sell us character slots, stash storage upgrades, etc.  Its just a matter of when now, not if.
---
I Primed mine and it's an absolute beast on SBs &amp; the Queen, just have to feed it a lot, and boost your AP if using Vats, it drains the meter quick.
---
Running any mods, especially SFE? Make sure they're updated or remove them first, then add them back one by one until the game remains playable. Also, NVidia updated its drivers a week ago; make sure your'e on the latest.
---
Builds community which is something that should be actively fostered if the game is to keep players beyond 1-2 years.
---
Lol you're not very good at this, are you?
---
Fallout 76 can't be compared to Fallout 4 in terms of performance.
---
That said, the minimum recommend GPU is a GTX 780/R9 285, both of which eclipse the 1050/1050 Ti for performance.
---
So, to resolve this issue... second hand 1060 Ti 6GB or one of the new 1660/1660 Ti cards.
---
Agreed. 
---
The robot could look after your pets too, but couldn’t do defence otherwise it’s back to non-cosmetics!
---
If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck...
---
Def a miserable pile they seem to be.
---
Am I the only one that utterly doesn't care all that much about stuff like this? Like, I only do things if:  
---
A: They will increase my characters power in some way, or...
---
B: They make me look really badass.
---
Paladin paint for T-60? Yep, I'm grinding tech data until I have that. Looks amazing.
---
Grinding for 600+ hours to find a bloody / explosive or bloody / 25% FR .50 Cal or Gatling Plasma? No problem. 
---
Finding a camera to take pictures for... fun? Uh.. no thanks.
---
It was definitely pointed at the top vs. the rounded top of the metal helmet. It also looked like it was engraved.
---
Anti armor is *really* good, particularly if you combine it with power armor and the Stabilized perk.
---
May be less, but it is still there. Confirmed last night.
---
Extended gunfight in this game? You must be unfamiliar with PvP in Fo76. The people pvping are 1 shot bloodied critical builds and TSE builds that kill you in about a second.
---
If you don't repair before going into a nuke zone, that's on you. Even so, fast travel out, repair, and return for more famrinf takes maybe a minute. Go read everyone's counter arguments, they apply to everyone. Most people have to repair maybe once in a days worth of play, because there are perks that work substantially better and let you far exceed your weapons normal durability.
---
The scenarios you stated, are literally never going to happen, or are extremely avoidable. Only a complete moron would be suckered into those scenarios. If your gun breaks during a pvp firefight, you lost the fight. If you wasted atoms on repair kits, you lost on judgment and self integrity.
---
Have this right next to the visitor book, or a photo wall of you and guests taking selfies!
---
Tooo Inifinity! AND BEYOND!!
---
Glorious any info on when we can take a massive shit in another players camp while humming the Scatman song?
---
Or when we can have explosive bagpipes and kilts, where the bagpipes fire turd grenades?
---
&gt;How? Please explain?
---
You make the statement "player vendor is pointless" and then tell us to change your mind. You literally made a post title stating you've already convinced yourself it will suck.
---
I’m aware
---
Stop crying about repair kits, it's not pay to....oooopssss did we mention we also added some cool new weapons to the store?
---
It can brick your game, apparently.
---
I might have exaggerated the Grognak part lol but it definitely looked vikingish it was pointed at the top and engraved
---
can't have the good will of other players cutting into BGS profits.
---
At that 76 panel a few weeks ago Todd alluded to it being that way previously and them deciding to do it differently.
---
Here’s a pic of where the spawn is at the waterpark, I’ll still be on this server but I won’t be standing by it. https://imgur.com/gallery/zfIubOR
---
I think you SHOULD be able to use a toilet if there is one!
---
Are you on PC?
---
Hey brother I’ve been kinda busy in the real world but I’m gonna collect those materials today. And then I’ll message you when on
---
HA! I'm up to about a dozen people between this subreddit and r/fo76FilthyCasuals that I've confirmed I'm competing with for server slots on that exact same spot. At least I've stopped posting screenshots and singing its praises in terms of what all you get nearby ;)
---
Hmm. Probably a mid tier effect. If it was + strength might be better. I typically over pay because I like troubleshooter for silos and AWOL Armaments. Rough guess is somewhere between 500 and 1000 to the right buyer. I could of course be all wet
---
I feel ya. I played many hours yesterday in hopes of coming across it myself, going on foot to the places I'd heard others find it, and staying in the same server. I finally gave in and met with a kind redditor who had posted they'd found it and were willing to wait there for others.
---
If only eh! 
---
Well, you can have the credit if it gets picked up!
---
Dammit I just got a tse flamer  and it’s fun as hell.
---
Do you have the ability to mod it?  I’ll pay caps.
---
Advanced drop from sbq, I think they should be a plan that has a drop chance from her. Even if ita like 5 of each of the mats it would nornally consume to repair the piece itself. 
---
Make it cost more than the repair at your base, and simply just for the convenience of not having to go back to base.
---
I was thinking more along the lines of the advanced ones. You get 3 from SBQ apparently. I can go a week without needing repairs, and I can kill SBQ 20+ times in that time so... I'd have a rather large excess of advanced repair kits to give away / sell to players.
---
What bothers me most about this is that it's only going to be new / low level players that will have any need of them, and I can't give them away for free. I'll just have hundreds of advanced repair kits that I'll never use.
---
Idk man, finding 40 beer bottles for it was more of a trial than I realised
---
It's really damn good. I was deciding between a vampire's .50 cal and a fire rate executioner's .50 cal, but action here is now the superior choice to both. I still have a vampire's plasma thrower and vampire's gatling laser for invincibility
---
they told twitter. meaningless as it is.
---
And ultracite to BOS vendor please 😛😛
---
So there's still no fix to the damage bug they reintroduced in January/February. Cool. 😑
---
You’re right. I have a card that I bought a while ago and haven’t used yet. I’ve tried a few times. Now I don’t even try. I have caps coming out of my virtual ears and would gladly buy cards to play if I could actually activate it.
---
Thought the same thing, would make it feel a lot more polished too.
---
The card is currently full (the image) BUT if someone drops out, or doesn't show up...you can be an alternate!
---
Founded and tried, but no luck
---
You are so wrong. You are very much required to pay for extras. It cost them money to make the extras, it costs you to use them.  
---
Historically there was no way for a game dev to add content post launch, so they had to make sure the entire game they wanted to release was released at launch, and then those teams moved on to new projects (aka continue making the company money). You are assuming that because the new content is related to a game you already purchased that you are entitled to be given it. No, you paid $60 for the game you received at launch. Bethesda has decided not to charge for much of the DLC gameplay, but other things you will be required to pay for.
---
I bought AirPods last year. Apple is releasing wireless charging functionality for AirPods this year. Guess what? I have to pay for that functionality now.

I can't believe I had to pay for a 4K UHD TV when I bought a full price SD TV in 1998. /s

I am outraged that Honda won't give me a free backup camera even though I bought a premium vehicle before they had released this technology. /s
---
Simpsons reference?
---
Aren't the posters just temporary items for current players to use to get the quest instantly?
---
The marine assault helmet is a rare one to find in spawn locations. I’ve casually been looking for about a month and no luck.
---
I don't think Bethesda wants to spend more money on more servers for this feature. Look at the rate of hotfixes for consoles. They would have to pay Sony and Microsoft to do that.
---
It was an exploited item on PC only.
---
The tactical helmet is still decent to craft/sell, which is why you see them on vendors.
---
I only found one in there the other day. Normally I can server hop and get one per desk. Kinda a bummer.
---
There aren't dailies/weeklies for those.
---
literally none of that negates the fact that it does offer some type of advantage.
---
it isn't about what you *should* be doing, or how you *should* be playing. in scenario: person A with broken shit vs person B with broken shit and kits, person B is going to win because they have an *advantage.* Bethesda says that it provides no advantages. that is a lie. there are advantages. its literally that simple.
---
25,000 caps is a poor prize, as most people don’t have 0 caps. I’d recommend lowering it to 20,000
---
I agree! It would be nice to have Appalachia Fight League on all platforms for sure! I hate that Xbox and PC players are left out, but at this moment I can't really do anything about that :(
---
What I do if my plants get damaged is just scrap them you get the 1 mutfruit or whatecer it is and the one fertilizer back
---
Rare tesla mod that launches a 2 harpoons. If both land then the SB or SBQ comes to the ground for 5 seconds and can't move. Then it will stay on the ground for another 10 seconds or longer depending on RNG.
---
Please don't pass this to the Atom store folks...
---
I think it’s funny that Bethesda claimed that the queen is a rare drop for repair kits. I’ve gotten them every time.
---
That's great, if you are on Twitter.
---
The most fundamental flaw in the game is loot tables. I have contended multiple times the nerfing of legendary spawns and broken loot tables will kill this game.
---
They must be getting ready to release a skin for it in the Atom shop.
---
I did the same thing for the Wavy Willard spawn about ten times.
---
Then I said screw it and went for the monument, since it was closest to my camp.
---
Dead guy was waiting there for me like I was the late one...
---
Sorry, I think maybe I wasn't clear in how I worded my post.
---
I played WoW for years and I know what instancing means and how it works. I think the point I was trying to make was that the team working on Fo76 doesn't.
---
I suppose I was actually saying the same thing as you are. That calling them 'instanced raids' is wrong by definition.
---
And that's exactly that...  You actually need more than 3 points you need 5 points ontop of that 3 points for either gunsmith or the melee ones.. Unless you want them to break quickly, While they are not for repair you need those for durability... So it's not just 3pts In INT... Then there's also things like power Smith, power patcher and power user.. Your calculations seem to bypass that and not everybody plays the way you play...
---
I'm not OK with it simply because Bethesda keep lying... From false advertising to conveniently forgetting certain patch notes not just on fallout but elder scrolls blades too.. Besides if your needing to buy use a repair kit then your doing fallout all wrong...
---
This shit still happens months later?
---
are you using the stabiliser perk? I found that improved it substantially, though still not as good as my explosive harpoon
---
I've had this happen a few different ways all by accident. I hope this gets fixed soon!
---
I'm sure you're not. I'm up to Knight Captain so far and getting really pissed that the next level hasn't dropped for me yet. Different people get different things from the game, though. Saw a comment from another player a few days ago saying she and her friends liked to get stoned and watch the sun set *in game*. TBH, I'm not even sure the sun is rendered in the sky in game, let alone if it passes below the horizon. 
---
I personally don't care for all aspects of the game, but so long as someone can enjoy it and it keeps the player base going, I'm all for it.
---
I would love it if player vending machines created fast travel points. Even if someone is just using your camp to travel, it will increase foot traffic and trade likelihood.
---
Explosive on Flamer?! Thought they fixed that
---
Buy it now for 50% off in the deadly pet store.
---
Think the patch notes just said they’d be dropped by rare creatures
---
Does it trigger at night always or only some of the time?
---
To be honest, I bought it a vendor in white spring. Didn't even have to farm it.
---
To be ffaaiiirrrr
---
It would be great if you could craft different kinds of arrows, like serrated, piercing, poisoned, explosive, burning, plasma, cryo and pulse.
---
Would be cooler if you used vats to target the wings and it came down like a dragon from skyrim.
---
Agreed, otherwise, it's like taking an explosive shit by yourself, who the fuck do you share it with? the janitor but he could be hours away...
---
It’s pre patch.  They didn’t remove it from predicting weapons, just stopped it from dropping.
---
I've gotten 2-3 everytime as well.
---
Yeah, i totally dropped the idea of supporting the game by buying atoms. Most challenges require you to server hop 10-20 times, now even the quests need to change servers a few times. They either don't play the game at all or simply want to piss off the players by any means.
---
Community: Well, at least we can do the dailies to get 60 cents worth of Atoms.
---
Bethesda: Not if you have to find a radstorm and grind 300 Mr Fuzzy tokens for them.
---
Burn them down
---
Jesus you didn’t close the app for 2 weeks?
---
It's literally not that simple, because you are missing the point. No one with a shred of common sense is buying them. It's THAT simple. No one farming nuke ones are wasting their hard earned atoms on things like that, because they most likely have the perks to make them useless.
---
No one doing any end game content is buying them man, because they are useless. It's as simple as THAT.
---
Oh, so you bought one. I thought you meant you had one dropped
---
Using a computer terminal to signal that you are ready to join the raid instance sounds an awful lot like using the Duty Finder in FFXIV or the LFG tool in WoW to load your team into a dungeon/raid instance.
---
How do arrive at the statement "[the FO76 devs] calling them 'instanced raids' is wrong by definition"?
---
no, not the same position, I was referring to the cliffs above the mine next to Whitesprings, you can't see mobs from the top of those cliffs
---
Its confirmed in other datamines that there will be a quest/event in a future update, where modus wants you to basically become president of the enclave so the bunker can be used to its full extent. You have to run around all of Appalachia, and rig these ballot boxes so each vote counts for more than one, etc. you have to collect “presidential endorsements” as well. It’s in the files, and overlooking the comms room in the bunker there is a locked room, and if you glitch into it there are terminals where you can get “presidential power armor” and stuff of that sort. Pretty neat tbh
---
I'm happy to hear that. I hope they work out how to do it better.
---
Will that give you the quest?
---
GLORIOUS IDEA IS GLORIOUS
---
Bonus marks for letting us shit in other players camps.
---
LET THE TURDS FLOW!!!
---
People are reporting getting 3 improved repair kits every time they kill the queen. Probably same for Imposter. Any additional boss event they release could possibly have it
---
this isn't the same as the infinite loading circle, the other loot loads in fine but it takes a few seconds for the legendary to load in
---
true
---
Against higher DR enemies the hunting rifle does more single shot damage due to the added proliferating mod the level doesnt have access to. The hunting only does 8 more damage per shot, but you can easily get in 2 shots with level durring the hunting rifle's 1. With lower DR shots the Lever action is supreme.
---
NP - glad it worked!
---
You should link this back. They want video, there it is.
---
Bears and Wendigos are a good source
---
I'm having a fantastic time.
---
Go to Wade Airport, repair the vertibot landing pad, once the vertibot appears on the pad, take a picture of that.  Counts :D
---
Actually, based off the feedback I've gotten...people are quite happy with the 25k prize. Plus, we have an idea for if they have caps already and haven't dropped them off on an alt. But thanks for the idea! I appreciate your time.
---
I’m telling you:  there is some misanthrope developer there who hates life, wants other to hate life, who injects stealth nerfs.   The guy who makes SBQ stop dropping recipes but never fixes SBQ dropping drills.
---
"It's okay bc nobody will buy them"
---
Big yikes
---
Just like the repair kits this gun is worse than what is found in game . 
---
DAMN YOU BETH WITH YOUR PAY 2 LOSE ITEMS
---
Actually salt make you eat more, not drink more.
---
lol this comment is so misinformed
---
Music festivals are pretty good.  As long as you don't look like a cop, you can usually find someone.
---
&gt; yikes
---
&gt; twitter leftist alert
---
Speculation is if you kill it a 2nd time, then the 2nd time will count toward alien.
---
Ok, you tell me the actual point of it then?
---
Convince me it ISN'T pointless and change my mind, y know the actual post title and why I put it lol
---
Player vending isn't going to suck, it's point is to sell your items, I just dont see the need in it considering all the negatives of finding your camp and the limitations of the server and camp instance will make it damn near impossible people will actually use your vendor to buy from it
---
I'm not sure... but I'm guessing that the Atom shop posters may be temp items, but not the ones in world... which would also be stumbled upon during a new player's exploration.
---
you'd think putting it in their fancy new "news screen" on game startup would have been obvious.
---
"collected all 6 eggs from the atom shop? check your armor bench for a reward!"
---
I'm pretty sure snallygasters drop that and asbestos, so if you're hanging around the toxic valley you should run into a few of them.
---
Thus choosing the perk radicool, which gives you extra strength when you are highly irradiated is also a good idea
---
Kind of annoying how many different perks and mutations and armor sets benefit from low health/high radiation. No other build gets this treatment.
---
We are already doing that.
---
hahahaha
---
Someone tried this but it didnt count :(
---
Yeah i replied to you by accident. Meant to reply to the other guy melle vs sniper thing. My bad
---
you can get the ultracite body plans from fort defiance but yeah adding the mod plans would be great
---
Didnt count
---
You are so naive if you think they're not going to add weapons and armors eventually. They are slowly starting to test the waters.
---
Haha!
---
excuse me? does not compute
---
I have suggested this on other posts but someone made a good point that people may exploit it and turn up at the end just to get the reward. My suggestion would be that if it’s nearing the end it just won’t allow you to fast travel there.
---
To add on that, there’s a guaranteed Yao Guai spawn right outside site alpha that drops acid every time.
---
source: my camp is next to site alpha and i kill that Yao Guai 3-5 times a day.
---
after reading your replies to the other comments I am convinced you are talking about the tinfoil hat
---
Whitesprings has at least 11 acid from Abraxo &amp; Abraxo Industrial Strength.
---
During the Fashnact event, the Honey Haus had beeswax, but I cant find it in World now.
---
There are other sources like supathaw antifreeze, chlorine etc.
---
no worries, it does mean that there have been plans in the game at some point but at the point they are not active
---
I bought 3, they don't repair like weapon artisan. I tried to use one during pvp and got destroyed after my weapon repaired. I don't they are pay to win anymore. However, they are quite the Callie for how many atoms they cost.
---
Listen, it’s named charging Tesla shotgun when you attach the charging barrel to the Tesla Rifle. You own a modded Tesla Rifle, the base version is classified as a rifle. The name change doesn’t modify the classification. How do I know? I am a shotgun build and really, really wanted my perk cards to increase the damage of this weapon. Unfortunately Shotgun perk cards do nothing to this modded Tesla rifle.
---
not if you have bear arms tho
---
Yeah the terminal could be used like that for sure. Based off the terminal that separates the final section of The Burrows, I would worry that it would simply seal the door behind you like and airlock or something to stop others getting in. I'll see if I can find the footage I was referring to.
---
Daily challenges give you Atom, which you can use to buy a repair kit at a price of 50 Atom, so I don't personally feel like there needs to be any additional way to earn them in game. It's a good business strategy because it gets you into the Atom Shop on occasion to see what's there. Maybe I'm just naive but I'm not nearly as upset about this as a lot of players seem to be.
---
Isn't that the whole point of the problem? Ignore it and it will go away. We are just taking different approaches.
---
Some crypids drop a bunch of acid. Bloodbug probosces and wendigo teeth scrap down into acid as well.
---
How high is your perception and have you tried longshoremen?
---
I am def. not a heavy build lol
---
That's...pretty cool actually.  But for certain builds..or people who dont really have the time to server hop a lot, farming the queen is something that happens on accident rather than by design.  
---
I was mostly thinking of the casuals who might be able to get on for a few hours a week, enough to run dailies two or three times, if they're lucky bag a queen or a sheep, etc etc.  That specific class of player would REALLY benefit from having some way of gathering ***Basic*** repair kits without having to spend on them.
---
I’ve caught things while wearing a hazmat suit and standing on the roof of the Whitespring golf club, no ghouls actually touching me. Low Endurance, but still.
---
no need to go into photomode, just point and shoot, I haven't used it yet but if it doesn't have a selfie mode it should
---
Weapons that you have to learn how to craft the regular type first huh?
---
Yup. This is why, while I love the Hunting/LA I have not been able to come back from a semi-auto Handmade.
---
I personally thing the overall balance with double/triple taps make it the best all around weapon in and out of VATS
---
2 weeks for 1 gameplay balance adjustment. Wow thank you. Such effort.
---
This is when it would be sweet to be able to build close to one another and have a complete player vendor village for this event.
---
Bird bones/marsupial and a jet pack can get you high enough to smack her around in midair.
---
yeah its one omy favorite spots in the game, good views, close to lots of super mutants to farm, can watch nukes at whitesprings and watoga, and a few lakes to the west to get water
---
and not too many bad guys ever attack, not as much as at my other house in the forest
---
now you can lose items when server hopping just to drive up the pressure a bit
---
I'm going by a mechanic in another game (themepark) increasing the salt on fries increases thirst in visitors.
---
At what point does someone at least pretend to be a QA on the patches?
---
I'll wear that badge poking through my spacesuit anyday!
---
Yeah is BS they took away the legendaries. I have no reason to go there now.
---
In the challenges menu, under character, if I remember correctly.
---
[Distinguished Guests](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Distinguished_Guests)
---
oh really? huh that's a weird choice
---
i have been lucky so far but it's starting to cost people an arm or a leg
---
What about the Cthulhu thing in the lucky mine?
---
You gots a problem with the Scorchbeast Queen you gots a problem with me and I suggests you let that one marinate!
---
Go to challenges, the first one is hours played/7600
---
I am
---
Still worth it, IMO, to get those ultracite ammo recipes.
---
Opinions will vary wildly, though.
---
Right! It’d be awesome. Only tweak I could think of since yesterday was that they would probably have to make the fast travel cost cheaper then other locations. That way the people whose camp it is isn’t made entirely rich off of one or two people doing a quest in their area.
---
I see. And here I thought it was something new.
---
how would i go about doing this ty!
---
Thanks but I was in power armor and it told me "you cannot exit your power armor here"
---
Also stingwing barbs, which for some reason don't auto-scrap.
---
I didn’t catch the ultra rare White Wolf Fedora. You really had the trifecta
---
Yeah. I don't mind some of it . Makes sense there are those around but yeah I want to be a badass. Not a fluffy bunny
---
I think the sticky tar grafton monster drops scraps as acid and some other component, but I cound be wrong...
---
Now i'm really wondering did they actually also nerf the damage.  
---
Because it feels a lot weaker.
---
Data miners found that they took serum recipes out of her loot pool, if that is important to you :/
---
Cool, thanks for that, I will crack on and grab it before it leaves the atom shop 👍
---
yeah that kind of feels like a rush untill they have time to do something more with the vendors
---
I like MODUS, the snacks he gave me and that he calls me Member!
---
What I enjoy is that Fo76 is a prequel to the other Fallouts, so no matter what we do, it does not lead to the complete demise of the Enclave. But it would be interesting in what way MODUS will tie into the story going foward.
---
On the point of MODUS looking for someone: I always thought MODUS was some kind of combined consciousness of people, and that those structures around modus were the pods where those people were 'plugged in' ||(think of Mr. House or those guys at the end of STALKER) || The ones in red were either damaged / missing or - in this context - locked in.
---
I wonder if - if the person is really talkimg about MODUS - we know this character from other Fallout titles. Maybe a founder of the Apocalypse guys...
---
Yeah that looks a little involved to pull of solo.
---
&gt;The Firecracker Whiskey recipe and its derivatives are unobtainable, though it is possible that this is intentional (?)
---
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh... Ok. Yeah that's weird.
---
damn, here is my build,  
---

---
You never should have come here!
---
5k for the faster fire rate one?
---
2 ghouls - one a 3 star - killed them and they fell under stairs behind lattice. I was not a happy camper.
---
No one goes there anymore. It’s a ghost town
---
Okay, I might not be on Fo76 today, so idk but I’ll definitely be on tomorrow
---
Lucky Hole Mine has crystal nodes that will need to be smelted if that helps
---
Ok. Just wondering.
---
Damn it todd.
---
Heeeyyyyoooo *badumtsss*
---
Well, to be fair, that is really the end game of trolling so you got me there.  Lol
---
I have 3 characters I play. When head back to camp or the Whitespring to dump junk and craft I follow the same general process.
---
* Swap in Chemist, Ammosmith and Super Duper
---
* Go to Chemistry Workbench
---
* Craft Fuel until out of materials
---
Then every few days my wife will use one of her characters so I can move all the fuel from the two who don't use a flamer to the single character who uses one. I also buy acid and fuel whenever I see it at a vendor on my flamer character. I'm absolutely rich with Plasma Cores, Cryocells .. but the fuel doesn't keep for long.
---
I posted this else where, but Fusion Cores burning faster and food/water levels going down faster means we're going to get Overcharged Fusion Cores and MREs that give 200% food and Fusion Core meters, available soon in the Atomic Shop for convenience not P2W!
---
&gt;Down with these capitalists!
---
Communists, you mean
---
Darn, I thought that would have been it.
---
no mods
---
I would like to farm her, cause she drops PA plans now.
---
Get this guy a fucking Pickaxe pilsner
---
I know! It really would be extra awesome to be able to do a lot of things with the build. I hope I do it justice. I'm taking Jug Gaming's arena tutorial from YouTube, but making my own modifications to it with some ideas I have.  
---
I wish I knew how to get in touch with him. I'd love for him to be able to see how I modify his design! He's the best builder in the game so I hope I do it justice lol
---
I'm not much of a vendor person in terms of armours and weappns. Usually the Unyielding, Assassins and maybe Vanguard/Berserk do very very well, but Troubleshooting isn't a very sought out effect(You still have a pretty good piece of armour there tho.. I'd range from a good 600-1k, or maybe more depending on the buyer and what they offer.
---
Maybe check the market subreddit and see how those types of armours sell for.
---
i get where you’re coming from dear god no
---
How do i do that you wizard lord
---
Except - you need the camera for daily/weekly challenges.  Unlike the Nuka Quantum paints which you can always keep for later to do, you instantly lose out if you don't get yourself a camera.  Its the same way for all the Nukashine content - keep farming for all the recipes ASAP or be locked out of doing daily/weekly challenges.
---
When I want to "force" a new server, I go into Survival, then back to Adventure. It seems to work.
---
Put on one piece of chameleon armor, and no power armor.
---
Takes a long time for the (mutants at westek) to figure out where you are.  THey just fire randomly at the hill, and don't send the suiciders.
---
I've seen jetpack for XO-1 at the Enclave vendor but that was late beta/early release. Didn't have the caps for it...
---
Interesting idea for it to be timed like the vendor cap limit.
---
Call of duty is available
---
Ah so it has to be in the forest area, I took all mine at whitesprings guess thats the savage divide then.
---
Surely the Brotherhood didn't haul anti-air turrets around Appalachia using Excavators? I mean, given food, rifles, and bobby pins have weighed us down how the hell are we supposed to believe they hauled around one story turrets? Brotherhood pallbearers?  
---
It's  not really sensible to think they'd go about repairing dams, power plants, or developing new technology when there are nuclear powered trains still on the tracks and really, not much rubble to remove from them. In comparison it's relatively straight forward task, you don't even need skilled workers to take garbage off a railway.  
---
The fact that none of the groups mentioned it seriously or were actively interested is bizarre, to say the least.
---
A censored bar.... Would make some hilarious photos
---
Spruce knob is climbable up to the top.
---
That’s what the toughest guy in Appalachia would do
---
Maybe they do something like mods we use to get 4th star on weapons, I would love that so we can just buy the legendary mod we want from the vendor.
---
Yeah, people have build their CAMPS in those.
---
some people want different experiences, I never got any handouts aside some discarded junk. Some people want the full experience and want to find stuff themselves
---
I've done that a couple of times but I'd love to be flung around at the end of a cable, flailing my guitar sword with the other hand like a maniac for an extended period of time, not just a couple of swipes. Kinda like battling harpies in God of War.
---
It'd totally change the nature of scorch beast fights, but imagine if the only mechanic that would bring them to ground was the combined weight of a bunch of players in combat armor anchored to hooks in their skin...
---
Kill other players. Take there bag. Got 10,000 acid for sale to caps a shard or 30 a bulk.
---
Its calles cavalier when its prefix mod is assassin, but there is some other effect.
---
Assassin + damage reduction while sprinting = Cavalier armor. Damage reduction while sprinting is so called cavalier mod, but this armor is not a cavalier armor, its troubleshooter armor with cavalier mod.
---
There are other examples of 2nd tier prefix: assassin + aprefresh = powered, assassin + damage reduction while standing = sentinel, assassin + damage from falling reduced = acrobat.
---
Interestingly, assassin+aprefresh+'sentinel' is still powered.
---
Hope this clarifies the nonobvious aspect of prefiz naming and the difference between prefix and legendary mod.
---
This is what happens when you let these gd non citizens just run through Watoga. They destroyed all the legendary bots costing us our drops and they spend no money at our vendors. Those weak mayors want you to give up your legendarys in the communal suitcase cause you have "plenty"
---
#Build the wall #Watoga is for Watogans
---
Thanks for the offer. For the Fire Rate/Reload I’d take 6k, for the Reload/Bash Damage I’d take 2.5k as Bash Damage is not that useful.
---
If they keep the feature of moving your camp causes it to repair your camp for free, then they absolutely could have a bot that helps defend your camp OR a bot that slowly repairs your camp over time.   The repair of camp is free if you move the camp, thus having a robot repair your camp over time is not a competitive advantage.
---
Thanks for the offer. For the Fire Rate/Reload is take 6k, for the Reload/Bash Damage I’d take 2.5k as Bash Damage is not that useful.
---
It doesn't, it happens when first attribute is also assassin.
---
If it weren't for chasing Atoms I feel like the rush wouldn't seem necessary to as many people.
---
Every vault had a particular experiment assigned to it. I wonder what they were
---
I also wasted a roll of film on the skylight - that thing is bugged to fugggg
---
What about that bait bomb we made for Rose?
---
Thanks for testing, you da real MVP
---
What doesnt?
---
Apparently any energy weapon.
---
I run a crew with 30 people on at all different times of the day. If each of them was only allowed to join one server a day there would be entire periods of time where different members wouldn't be able to play together because they may have joined a server earlier that day. It would also destroy all trading as people wouldn't be able to join upon one another. Imagine making a deal for that dream piece of armor you've wanted at the perfect price and you're not able to trade for it because you already joined a server that day.   
---
I see where you're coming from but if that was implemented it would kill two at least two large communities, crews, and traders. A server browser a la Ark may be preferable and fix the same issues. I personally would stop playing the game as I wouldn't be able to do anything other than roam and dick around because of an arbitrary constraint put in place by Bethesda.
---
That’s not flying
---
Yes I was able to attach mods when I checked things out yesterday.
---
Deadly 🙀
---
6k is fine. Can you reserve it for me until I get home later today to do the trade, pls?
---
This is very misleading. This is a skin just the way you craft it is a little weird. Considering you have to know the assaultron head plan before you can craft it it is still a skin and you are causing more of a ruckus by misleading people this way.
---
Yes sir. Will pm contact info.
---
Leeching FTW!  
---
I have sold both Vamp Explo 50 cal (very nice gun) and Vamp LG (decent), but am still sucker for anything bloodsucking (wearing a vampire costume, using primed vamp explo pg, vamp explo gatling and vamp buzz blade on a favorite wheel)... And now I'm also really excited for Action Hero, what with all these praises.
---
Challenges yes, but not the in game daily missions.  Camden Park, Pumpkin Jack, Red Rocket Cores....I think there are a few others but I forget some of them.  Those are the ones I'd like to see reward 1 Basic Repair kit each.
---
Oh.  And Biv I guess....well....maybe not Biv.....
---
What tests did you run?
---
I think you are going to need some proof lol. Personally mine are doing the same damage as before.
---
Right? Like, even though its 1 variable, the likelihood of that potentially random string of numbers spitting out relevant coordinates would be pretty absurd. The earth is big.
---
It honestly seems more probable being intentional than it ever could be as a coincidence.
---
Well at a level 111 o just took on a lvl 105, both of us melee, he was wanted roaming from low lvl player to low lvl player just killing them so I decided to take him on. Hit him dozens of time with my Combat knife that I one-2 shot everything save the Scorched Queen with &amp; it didn't even damage him so I'm prty sure there's cheaters in here lol.  
---
&amp; it stands to reason if a guy has invincible hacks/mods he can use a weapon he isn't supposed to be using lol
---
Yeah, it was a commonly believed misconception.
---
I'm pretty sure you would right click your desktop and bring up the nvidia control panel. There should be a drop down menu where you select your nvidia card as priority or the basic Intel card. I'm in class so I'm not 100% sure. Google "how to prioritize nvidia gpu" if my instructions aren't helpful.
---
That’s why I asked, just trying to rule out the obvious. Submit a support ticket
---
It's funny, but the only event I can think of with a leaderboard (Monster Mash) I don't think I've ever seen another player doing it when I'm there. Always just me and the ghouls...
---
Great idea, though. Might encourage more participation. I miss Fasnacht.
---
Precise stock is dope
---
I can tolerate radicool, the bullet one, and nerd rage but unyielding giving +90 stats in a game where the norm is 57 is just so extreme.
---
&gt;thank
---
no problem man. the only thing though is that it took a lot and i mean a lot of spamming till it finally gave me it. only got one but when i did it was from super duper proccing and not the normal weapon making. now excuse me as i go get some ice for my sore thumb
---
You could get trusted individuals who play a lot on each platform to help you
---
Cavalier effect is never a major nor prefix mod, its always the minor mod, the 3rd star. Its prefix is named cavalier only when its prefix mod is actually assassin, but it also has reduced damage while sprinting as its 3rd star, the minor mod. There are more strange prefixes, such as acrobats or poisoners, but they all come out of assassin prefix mod.
---
how about you dont tell others how to play the game they bought for $60?
---
besides its been debunked that the more players there are SBQ's health scales, it he damage resistance and its caped at 30% i think
---
Junk spawns for the new character that enters that location. Once you loot it you won't see it spawn again until the next day, unless another character enters that same area and spawns it for them (and you too).
---
Not positive, but I would just server hop. I still do that to find plastic at watoga and rubber in grafton.
---
So there were no plastic pumpkins, cafeteria trays, plastic dishes/cutlery, or golfballs?
---
You were either unlucky and someone cleaned up before you or you cleaned the place out previously and you haven't had enough time pass for it to respawn. I've had this happen with other junk items, like microscopes.
---
Sorry, don't know the exact respawn timer.
---
So then theoretically if no one is around that area and I fast travel there then it should respawn? (As long as I have not picked it up in the 24hr period)
---
I would love it if Bethesda could fix this in a later update. If Enforcer worked with this gun, you could possibly cripple a line of feral ghouls with one shot.
---
Yeah, it’s one of the only events I’ve yet to complete solo aside from the aforementioned.
---
$17 for a PA skin...lol
---
Right. Too OP maybe?
---
Not in full. I remember looking up one of them, and he seemed insanely shady. I think his last name was Altman, or something like that. 
---
I take it the others are just as bad?
---
Especially with the night robe lol
---
Yes. They are both indeed products being sold to consumers. 
---
You however brought up the issues of bugs and decided to compare Pong which is built around a series of circuits and such and Fallout, a modern video game who's loading screen required more coding than the original Pong creators could have imagined. 
---
You may as well have been comparing Bicycles and Motorcycles. "They're both consumer products! Yet somehow my bicycle has significantly less mechanical issues!"
---
I can guarantee that you didn't buy Pong as a new release. Your parents maybe bought it for you, and if they bought you a pong cartridge then you didn't get it as a new release as it was released for home play before that. 
---
Not to mention that while the consoles had fewer bugs.... When it was programmed to software for cartridges.... It had significantly more bugs.
---
It isn't available in game yet.
---
Only pc players who accessed the dev room or traded with someone who did has one.
---
It's speculated it'll come with future content.
---
That's all the info I've been able to find.
---
lol very true. First time i found this thing was in a scorched infested building, it one-shot my 5000 cells and left me defenseless 😂
---
I guess this is true. I'm just more of a support npc I guess lol I just want to help people most of the time.
---
Yeah i'm gonna need some evidence on this one friend
---
i could have sworn the whole reason why they removed the explosive modifier from them was partially because of the explosive effect not working right.
---
i could be mistaken though
---
Sadly no none
---
Don't trust random people.
---
It's not in game yet.
---
They have delayed or scaled down pretty much everything announced, there is not going to be major content releases for this failed game. Count on a couple more 15-35 minute side quests then a year or two of maintenance mode then a shutdown announcement.
---
Someone should make their character look like Todd.
---
You use it to make and repair excavator power armour I always keep around 60 and it's worth 1 or 2 caps in trades depending on the person.
---
So Ive been told things like this by other players, but that hasnt been my experience-- specifically around Sentinels (which may be different) Let me check my inventory and Ill confirm before I admit my misinformation :)
---
DO IT!!!!! it really does piss me off, so keep it up!!! PISS ME OFF!
---
in fact, id go into a stone cold RAGE if you spent your entire paycheck on power armor skins!!!!!
---
I'd freak out with OUTRAGE if you continuously spent ALL your money on the ATOM store, going so far into red-faced explosion if you dont pay your rent and just buy ATOM store stuff!!!
---
Im so upset just thinking about it!
---
Furious explosive drill!
---
Alright, I would be interested in seeing that footage.
---
So we have moved on from a concrete 'the dev's are wrong by definiton', which is a statement that explicitly states that what we are getting isn't an instanced dungeon and the dev's dont know what that even is. You also backed that statement up with an assertion that we are actually getting a space on the server that is locked to one group at a time, perhaps via a door that becomes locked when a group uses the terminal.
---
Aside from the obvious issue of what happens if 6 groups of four are on the 'instance' side of the door when someone closes it, we have now arrived at a point that you are worried about it not actually being instanced.
---
Are you going to continue to walk it back inch by inch, or can we hurry to the end and acknowledge that Bethesda never said Burrows was going to be an instanced space, even though they overhyped the shit out of it and its difficulty? From there, we have no substantive reason to believe that the vault raids, explicitly described as instanced, are actually not going to be instanced, Bethesda doesnt know what an instance is, and all we are getting are a couple open world spaces that players can lock each other out of using a terminal.
---
I'm not going to convince you of anything because 1: I don't care what you think (and I know that sounds callous, but I don't mean it as an insult, I just mean it as you're some random dude on the internet that I don't know) and 2: We have absolutely no idea how it will be implemented, so it's pointless to jump to conclusions or start getting riled up about it already.
---
I get what you're saying. A server browser would be a better compromise.
---
I use it to make the grounded serum.  Fairly common drop from mole miner suit scrap.
---
I still love the fallout series, and it will suck not buying FO5, but I cannot support a company that doesnt keep its promises to its customers. 
---
The only thing this "test" is testing is the communities anal capacity, how much can they ram us financially in the ass before we start costing them money. For me its the atom only repair kits, for others I dunno...
---
Some people are just jerks man, I would be very careful who you trust to unload all your stuff onto.
---
Data please? The TSE Laser Gatling my buddy uses seems to be much more effective than the TS one I have...
---
If it’s a weapon not a skin, you can’t add this skin to a legendary head then?
---
He wasnt random. Thats the thing. Ans the first transfer with the valuable stuff went fine without any problem. It was the second with only cloth and acid and a mere 4 k caps that went wrong
---
Suspenders and slacks all the way! I put them on at level 5, and only haven’t taken them off since. And with the fedora you can get from the sheepsquatch quest line, I look good! 😉
---
Well the order may be scrambled because it often is, but there are no 1star or 2star sentinel/cavalier armors hence I'm pretty sure its 3rd roll that defines it
---
??? on ps4 it has broken down all bulked items since i started playing in december
---
to my knowledge they have never fixed it
---
Go away trump we know its you
---
There's massive spoilers on the YouTube videos. &gt;!At the end of the Wild Appalachia trailer you can see a queen on what appears to be the interior of 94. The vault was home to a peaceful agrarian community that sought to help people after the bombs fell, and apparently is the source of all strangler vines in The Mire, due to the vault having a nuclear reactor malfunction.!&lt;
---
Yeah but it's kind of silly that you have city full of nonhostile (assuming you did the quest) level 50 robots that infinitely respawn that can also be legendary. I'm more miffed they didn't mention the nerf in the patch notes than I am about the nerf itself.
---
The “We listened to your feedback but are doing it anyway” thing made me delete 76 the moment I read it. They got some nerve seeing the overwhelming backlash to this decision and just going ahead and throwing it out anyway exactly the way they announced it with absolutely no changes.
---
How about the servers not crashing every time I attempt to take part in one of these events?
---
Is it a regular one or a Ti version?
---
If it's the 2gb version, try turning textures to low in the game settings, and if it's a 4gb Ti, turn them to medium.
---
I think you've done a fine job of outlining reasons it might fail, and I share your skepticism. 
---
I predict that there'll be a limited number of players on each platform that will locate their CAMP near Vault 76 or the Whitespring train station, but even this will be limited since the sellers are likely to quickly fill on caps; unless shops get their own bank account that you can only withdraw from. Still, it's free content that doesn't pose risks to the core experience, so I guess I'll just wait and see.
---
Get it to see the biggest bug Bethesda has put in 76 ever. If you’re holding the camera and wave or do any emote, you’ll go flying across the map for no reason. Happens every time
---
there's a whole lot of people there entirely unrelated to anything video games.
---
like Donald trumps brother, for instance, is the president of the board.
---
I pretty much don't go anywhere other than whiresprings now that all the vendors are there
---
But don't get me wrong, I'm sure the implementation will be failsauce like 95% of other things they've done in the game, I just don't want to grab my pitchfork until I know exactly in which ways it will suck, lol.
---
Go to the actual Seneca Rocks. Just north of Top of the World are two really tall mountain ridges. You can easily climb up from the north side and then just take a snappy.
---
If this "friend" isn't someone you know and trust IRL, then he's a random.
---
In my book I don't trust anyone in a game to transfer stuff like that unless I know them IRL.
---
They will make things break faster for our enjoyment and fulfillment...
---
Ok from what i gathered it looks like for some reason only tse cryo and flamer are affected by this, so bgs really looks like they hate cryo and flamer users
---
Now that you have a camera, wave while having it equip!
---
Just a passerby update:
---
Seems as if every one of these skins will be available for all power armors (except for excavator obviously) incase you came to this post wondering
---
(im assuming this bc the first horseman just dropped and its for all power armors except excavator.)
---
Every. Single. Time.
---
if it was a skin it would not be a separate weapon it would be a mod that you can apply to salvaged heads you already have. i cant put it on any other salvaged head i have to spam it to hope i get a weapon. skin does not equal new weapon. also if it was just a weird way of making a skin then how come my level 4 character has the option to make it? it pops up in the weapon workbench as a weapon and since i am not level 25 i can not make it on my level 4. in the video when i show it on my level 4 in the top left corner it says that it cant be made because im a level 4. by your logic its just a skin that somehow has a level requirement. so no im not causing a ruckus by misleading people im simply spreading the news that this thing is obviously not working as intended.
---
Does it pass through Boston?
---
I love it :)
---
Until they nerf it down to 60% like they did with all the perks. You know for our enjoyment.
---
Much as I love this, someone has probably figured out a really crazy "one punch man" build, and will just one-hit everyone.
---
You ought to separate by weight class. Strength/ Endurance 15 being heavyweight.
---
This is fascinating, please continue
---
Well, I'm plumb out of extraterrestrials...
---
I dont know what he said but make it 61
---
You play with single character. Vendors play with many. When you have a different character for PvP and different for PvP, different for weapons, for armor, and for junk/aid/ammo, your perspective is so vastly different that a player bound to single character has. The fact you would not be able to fit in the conditions you described - which is a speculation - doesn't mean other players wouldn't be able to fit just as you don't want to.
---
No you are. Notice how many people now think that Bethesda is offering a real p2w solution as a weapon in the atom store? This is misleading. I'll take a look in the data and see what's causing you not to be able to craft it and get back to you on that so that can be settled
---
&gt;legendary head
---
cant add it to a salvaged assaultron head at all legendary or not its making a weapon and not a skin despite the news section and the 8.5 atomic shop update saying its a skin
---
Or maybe even a simple "join last server" option would satisfy me.
---
Ita an mmo and you upset they are balancing their game? 
---
They get a detailed map where people go and what they do. If they see 99% of people walking through wotoga killing friendly legendary robots, its gunna get nerfed. I'm sure balancing a game with a hundred game changing abilities cannot be easy.
---
Speaking of which, what if its a flerkin reference? As in you just have to take pictures of cats, because they're aliens!
---
Comprehending your post... 
---
That's a challenge.
---
Well u/mystical-whore-locks is dead and im stuck on a cliff now what
---
It won't work like that...we're going to many lengths to make sure it's decent. I'm eyeballing possibly a 2/3 falls type thing. It's far enough away to iron out all the wrinkles.
---
Ohhhh.
---
I saw one of the bethesda people that post on here say that the flamer fuel and cryo cell crafting is being improved in the next major patch. I guess they did this because you wouldn't need to scrap for fuel anymore, though they should have waited for the fix before removing the current method.
---
The Mr. Fuzzy Hard Hat, that only costs 20 tokens, counted for that challenge. Just for future reference
---
Jesus Christ, I think the snoring is getting louder!
---
I think I just found my new trolling method for random team invites :-)
---
Security camera for camp would be cool too
---
Eagle Eyes and Bird Bones, the STR debuff is easy to mitigate with under armor and/or food/chems. Grounded is also useful if you don’t
---
use energy weapons.
---
i´m currently trying to do a roleplay where i´m essentially a moonshiner who found this in game quest and well capitalism ensues. i was thinking just put workshop on the farm south of the tatto parlor so i can forever keep farming it... literally but then todd said "No workshops near structures." so i have the same problem
---
\^ That is exactly why I love this game
---
Where did you find him
---
Turned out to be a dud .. which location you referring to, the crater or the power shed in the bog ? I found the crater to be a mixed bag, sometimes works, sometimes you can server hop up to 50 times ..
---
Turn that .308 into .50 and what do you get?! Trash.
---
How many are you looking for I have 12 on me
---
Miners monument is one location
---
My build is pretty similar when I'm in a big fight, otherwise I swap out my Strength perks for carry weight, but all of the damage perks are there.
---
I will look over there thanks
---
My guess is the Watoga change was because Bethesda figured it was easier to remove all legendary robots instead of fixing the bug that blew them sky high!   :-)  They seem to just be looking for the quick fix lately and not actually solving the core problems.
---
Really only need one but honestly I’ll buy a few to make it worth your while, I’ve got a shit ton of caps so might as well spend some
---
another problem with animal challenge - no matter how close I go to the bloodbug (dead or alive) it doesn't count. What a waste of time...
---
i had the younger woman (Annie) as my tourist. i don't know what the old man's tape said, but listening to Annie's made me feel sad for her.
---
after listening to her tape, i feel obligated to take her camera and finish the bucket list for her sake. i'm not gonna question how she got to half of the places unarmed, i'm just gonna finish her story.
---
I keep 10 in case i need to make a Grounded Serum.
---
I snaped surprise (bethesda tipical gag) that is on top and got checked in.
---
I wouldn't say "easily", unless you have Marsupial mutation and a jetpack on your PA
---
Oh, what did hers say?
---
Not only do you need the plan, relegating this to a regular head, but as of right now it *cannot* have a legendary version as crafted weapons cannot be legendary, thus is unusable in any situation aside from showing off. What's the rebuttal to that one?
---
You won the game. You can stop now. 
---
There's probably some events and side quests that you missed and can go do, but once the map is explored, that's pretty much it. The Mistress of Mysteries and Lying Lowe quests are both decent, if you haven't already done them. 
---
It's a really short game if you play melee and know what you're doing.
---
can't remember the exact words, but it was basically like "the world ended and i just wanted to see some sights before i died but i think the radiation is finally getting to me and i didn't finish my bucket list which sucks."
---
I'm gonna guess you sped through (or didn't read) the story and most of the side missions. There's definitely more content than that.
---
You can have whatever u need just gimme a min I’m running through the borrows gt cjpisi no Caps necessary
---
Thank you for the info. I do have a few legendary assaultron heads (bloodied, furious, vampire), so what you’re saying is those heads won’t be able to use this skin at all, because it’s a craftable weapon just like another pistol. 
---
When I first saw the ad I thought wow the geometry is really fancy, do they need to tweak the poses and animations because of it. It’s possible that the animation needs to be tweaked to accommodate the geometry so it’s treated as a new weapon.
---
I spend 500hours to still don't understand how to 100% kill SBQ or sheepsquath. But maybe you are super pro gamer. Then you are done with single player games in one day?
---
played the game on a 750ti just fine
---
The problem with this quest isn't the cost, it's the lack of warning and how quickly it can potentially be beaten. When you drop a nuke everyone on the server gets a notice and 2-3 minutes to finish what they're doing and head over there.
---
With this event, it starts basically as soon as someone uses a card. Unless I'm just idling at my camp there's a good chance it's going to take me a couple minutes to swap out perks and fast travel there, by which point they may have already killed it. They need a server-wide pop up saying "Kasv0tVaxt summoned the Sheepsquatch!" and then give people a couple minutes to get there before it actually spawns.
---
Not sure the exact respawn timer per server, but most junk items are not on cooldown per user. I server hop watoga High school for plastic utensils and whitesprings for golf balls. If you spawn near an area, the game seems to place you into a server that has had activity in that area recently to make it more difficult. For example: load into the game at vault 76 and travel to watoga, you have a much better chance of finding plastic versus loading in out side the school and just running in. This has seemed to be the case for most spawns. Some items like plans seem to only be lootable every 24hours. I tend to save caps and just accept the fact that a good amount of my hops will be fruitless.
---
Well new flamer tweaks are coming so maybe rebuffed after that? I think BGS has always hated the cryolater XD
---
I feel you. My so called "friend" scammed me good. Mainly my fault. Helped him buy sentinel assassin armor, heavy combat BoS, and all but 4 serum recipes. Spoke last night to get my 20k + caps and he claims he already paid me back. He never did because he went off to play some assassin Creed game. He stopped playing after biv came along. I was patient on awaiting his return to fallout. 
---
I don't care about the caps but it's the fact he lied to me. Saying he had already paid me back but never did.
---
No rush man
---
Yeah, I searched around for a good 3 hours. Nothing. So boring
---
Most of the SBQ bugs are pretty rare. The most common one is where she gets stuck in hover mode, but if you have sufficient ranged firepower then you'll still win.
---
Worth it? I keep getting T-51/60 jetpack plans at the moment, which is nice if you need them. You get a couple of random 1-3\* legendaries, a prime receiver plan, four stable flux and 200 caps. Also 2-3 improved repair kits since the patch. Costs aren't high if you have a few players with bloodied builds.
---
This happened to me at Whitesprings last night as well. One of the buildings had no porch railings or objects on them, and a few of the rooms had no walls. The game eventually did load everything in, but it took several minutes...I was able to clear the ghouls before it did.
---
*looks at burrows* No...
---
Any prizes for 2nd and 3rd place? Maybe some stimpaks to recover from their beatdowns!
---
Sorry, that's a little high for me, can't really afford it right now, but thanks anyway!
---
The old man's one was basically his granddaughter died of leukemia before the war and she never got to see the places with her granddad
---
So he (mind you he was at least 73 judging on his voice) completed half of them which were some of the most dangerous locations on the map 
---
Fo his granddaughter.
---
That kinda hit me hard a bit personally.
---
It's the only end game we have.
---
I like how it looks but saving my atoms for two of the other horseman.
---
I'm upset that they have continuously made everything take longer. 
---
I'm upset that they didnt give us a respec option.
---
I'm upset that they released an alpha version of the game.
---
I'm upset we still dont have player vending.
---
I'm upset the game crashes so hard I have to physically unplug my 6 month old system from the wall.
---
I'm upset that they keep breaking promisses.
---
You dont release a final game, then 3 months later nerf it to the point that all effort put forth was a waste of time... then 2 months later add repair kits to the real money store while offering a better version from SBQ while nerfing how often they spawn and making them harder to kill.
---
But, no I'm not upset that they want to balance the game.
---
Do you get the quest with it?
---
Maybe this is just coincidental timing, but I find I can often get them to land by getting right underneath them. Here are my basic steps:
---
* If they're flying far away, keep shooting them (especially in the wings) to keep them from setting up a bombing run.
---
* Run underneath.
---
* Shoot them until they land.
---
* Switch to melee and continue rotating around behind them while smashing and slashing. Makes it harder for them to hit you.
---
Let me guess, you only play in Adventure, but complain about the lack of challenge? :D
---
Sell down to 50 to repair Excavator or less if you don't use the Excavator.
---
It’s the same slot, you hit r1 to cycle and choose which. Because it’s literally the same animation haha
---
So my wife and I have had this conversation more than a couple of times.  She would way sooner go out in the first round of some global crisis than hang around for the aftermath.   This game is the aftermath so would you run into nice people post apoplectic?  Sure probably the majority, would you run into murder hobo's? yep you bet If you want to keep you camp intact hide it lots of places murder hobo's are to lazy to travel to.  and think real life how many people would you trust when the system is gone?  As for me the minute I have to eat my dog its time to check out....  For a fun scary as hell post apoplectic view of the world read or watch the "Road" from Cormac McCarthy
---
sounds like remove the "she died before the war" part and Annie may as well have been his grandaughter. man. and people say 76 has no story
---
A little addition for new guys like me here. I was absolutely confused about this statement because i was on PC and could just not find it. Your answer is referring to the mobile  version. This way it works. Thank you :D
---
Send me inv or a mess I’ll join your server
---
Nevermind man, I joined your world and lost the daily questline, sorry
---
OK chaps, I'll sell some then. Don't need over 300.  Cheers
---
As other's have said, I think the idea is to encourage exploration. Unfortunately, the game has been out for 6 months. Most players that have been playing for even a month or so have explored pretty much everything the map has to offer. Couple that with the unfortunate fact that exploring has absolutely nothing to offer as far as end game is concerned, minus the chance of encountering a legendary, but you can find way more of those doing farming routes or server hopping.   
---
Good initiative, bad judgement.
---
It's too bad there's no way to get ATOMS in some other manner ... oh.  Wait, I guess there's some incentive to not fix impossible challenges, apparently.
---
I'm using it constantly at the moment as fully stocked with Legendary items for the incoming vendor.
---
Yeah, you can sell it for 632 caps to any vendor. Make sure you stack CHA and have Hard Bargain 3 on before you do.
---
Ugh u want to take them anyway just incase
---
Hey, I finally found the Pumpkin House this last weekend for the first time.  Fuck that fissure site just outside of it.  Ruined my happy pumpkin time.
---
That'ed be fine, if it was just the quest. This is tied to fucking weekly rewards, so you can't just "stumble across it". They punish you for not getting it instantly. 
---
As it is, I stand by my stance that this is a _fucking moronic_ way to introduce a fucking quest.
---
Why do berry mentats help?
---
I feel your pain. I was crouched in the middle of Pleasant Valley during an epic vertibird/cargobot with mole miners and super mutants for like an hour last night. I crept all over the area, taking pictures from above, below, dead on, etc. After at least 50, it finally completed.
---
I came up with a possible lore friendly way to implement a grenade to render scorched beasts to the ground :), let me know what you think brother :) got three upvotes, so GG...
---
[Link to my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a40qnr/spoilerssuggestion_a_possiblelore_friendly_way_to/?st=juvloc18&amp;sh=cc45273a)
---
Please just replace the assault rifle with the R91 instead. No idea why they added it in fallout 4.
---
Healing factor
---
Nah it’s fine. Thank you for going out of your way for me tho
---
I'm always in favour of new weapons added to the game. Even if they are reskins of the existing ones.
---
Fo76 is ram and vram hungry. set everything to low and see if it makes a difference. also try both fullscreen and windowed. texture quality is usually the problem. also update your drivers.
---
I would expect that as well, but that's a hacky, inelegant solution.
---
I would *like* for your party to be able to enter the same dungeon instance by entering the zone through the door, much like most any other MMO esque game does.
---
Question: Is there any viability that you know of for 1H melee? I hate how slow and inelegant 2H are and I feel like I'm going to have to switch to Unarmed like you describe above but I don't wannaaaaa :(
---
It's fucking easy to find. You have a whole fucking week. Why are we fucking swearing?
---
I am so looking forward to doing this.  I cannot wait.
---
Keep some handy then, for sure. If you can repair up to 200% you'll only have to repair every few days I swear.
---
Honestly they didn’t need to nerf anything.  Just wipe the servers clean of duped weapons and duped armor and that takes care of most of the problem with balancing. 
---
I’m also convinced the reason decent legendary drops are so rare is because they know you can acquire dupes but the pure chance of trying to get a decent drop is basically zilch.  It’s gamblers mentality.  Keep us playing (farming) with the hope we hit the jackpot (legendary drops) knowing the house wins virtually all the time.
---
Looking at the ESM, automatic weapons in general have a much lower accuracy bonus for Concentrated Fire. 2/3/4% rather than 10/15/20%. Probably not a bug.
---
Player vending is on the way, it could have shipped broke but they withheld it. 
---
The state of the game did suck early, now it's for the most part good after some cleanup and fixes from people who cheated and broke the worlds. AND you bitch they delay when they want to perfect flawed items?
---
Broke promises probably regering to no in game advantage? Get over repair kits, they are a disadvantage if you buy and use them over a 200% repair at your house. 
---
Get over yourself.  No one here wants to hear you bitch. We both know you are only pissed about repair kits - which are at a disadvantage to smart players.
---
Make sure to have your camera equipped then emote
---
Feels longer than that for me as I'm a stealth build, I repair my armor once every couple weeks tbh.
---
Clown outfit and fasnacht owl head. 
---
I’m a hoot at all times.
---
Doesn't look like it. Boston is about 8 degrees away from Mill Creek to the east. Pittsburgh is close to the longitude line, as is Charleston, NC.
---
In that case, yeah, maybe just sell down to 50 or so, just so it's not cluttering up your stash.
---
First, this is a video game. Second, most of us won't survive a nuclear attack. Third, I was on a cliff on the right side of the map. He had to drop down several embankments to find me.
---
When nuclear fallout becomes reality, 90% of us will be dead which includes you. Let's not pretend this is real life. It's not. Which is why people enjoy the game.
---
I should add that I was also level 21... Not even a threat to anyone. I had nothing they wanted.
---
A shotgun. The weapon you're looking for is a shotgun, with the enforcer perk card.
---
You were taking about repairing to 200%, implying that repair kits make no difference to gameplay.  Now you’re saying players should plan ahead.  I’M saying that repair kits allow for on-the-fly repairs, which is NOT a cosmetic-only Atomic Shop purchase, no matter how many different ways you try to defend it.
---
&gt;The only games i know of that time gate content like that are subscription based games like WoW
---
Unless they've changed it since I quit, WoW only lets you do 5 dungeons in an hour(RDF was excluded from that limit, though), to stop people from farming them heavily. 
---
Pain in the ass when you're trying to farm Rivendare's Deathcharger.
---
A few more months of this and you may can join in on the first 5 minutes of a SBQ fight!
---
No worries bud and your welcome , wish it would of worked out
---
We're looking at 2nd place to have a "consolation prize" type deal and stimpaks to recover not needed, we'll be there to stimpak everyone back to full health when they are down.   
---
We have a lot of ideas and a lot of things to work out, but it's all going so smoothly and it's awesome so far! A guy who wants to be involved told me he requested off work, and he's doing "apex arena" prototypes to give me ideas!  
---
Freaking loving how into it everyone is
---
It’s the same logic on spoilage rates.  They absolutely nerfed the grub knowing that a fridge could solve for it.  I’m more convinced than ever they will do the same thing with ammo converters.
---
Alright so after checking i think i know whats going on. the head is listed as a co\_mod object but creates a weapon instead. the server must be getting confused by this as it thinks it should be creating a mod but is instead creating a weapon and just doesnt allow it to happen
---
I need to do this for the "roleplayers" blowing up houses.
---
I could be wrong but I think the meat hook is considered both 1H and unarmed
---
alos used to repair some weapons.
---
hey, i cannot connect to the game since latest patch, when I press play I get a 'found world, connecting' and it goes to the loading screen, but after loading 15 seconds, I get kicked back to the main menu with 'disconnected from world'
---
 Anyone else having this? God why this 'always online' nonsens if they break the connecting part of the game
---
I discovered that the Antique shop in Watoga always has 3 decanters, if they haven't been looted.
---
Sounds good. You get similar levels of damage with all the black powder weapons.
---
I have been holding onto a Vats god tier (little g) combat rifle and made the switch from pistols. My special stats are the same, tons if Agility, very little Perception, so instead of stacking damage perks, I stack all damage multipliers. We are talking concentrated fire for 2x headshots and mister sandman with covert operative for 3.5x silenced nighttime sneak attacks. Together that is 7x my damage. Suddenly, my 71 damage gun us dealing 497 damage per shot. It fires 7.5 bullets per second. That is 3,727 damage per second. It is mental. I am glad I made the switch.
---
The god tier (little g) weapon is an assassin's explosive 25% less vats cost automatic combat rifle. Automatics get a 50% reduction in vats costs so I must be sitting at -75% vats cost. I think I get over 24 shots before AP is gone.
---
The OPTION would be interesting, so they would have to add the ability to mod glasses. Potentially different lenses as well, like removing the blue spectrum, or generally making everything less bright.
---
Well they have already stealth nerfed fusion cores by limiting them to 25% capacity (when found) instead of 50%+ as it was earlier in the game.  Thankfully I stocked up so have about 40 in my stash and still make it by blasting sentry bots and farming certain locations.
---
when this happens to me i just fast travel to that same location (Adventure mode). the load time is like 4 seconds.
---
but if an enemy is nearby..... ugh
---
I'd imagine that any Instigating 1H weapon with comparable base damage to the aforementioned gauntlet would do the trick. Note that the OP has Iron Fist 3 and Bloody Mess 3, so the only considerations are (a) base 1H weapon damage; and (b) the equivalent number of 1H-related weapon perks.
---
I logged in first thing in the morning and found the body on my 3rd server hop to Philippi Cemetery.  Getting it feels similar to getting the chance to get the Dome key.
---
I’m not able to pull up the map at all when the bug occurs
---
They have anti armor rounds
---
Yeah, they slice through my Type 60 pretty quick, yet the laser Gustys do fuck all damage. Some weird discrepancies.
---
Weirdly I just happened to be in Watoga _again_ with _another_ cargobot flyover about an hour ago so I whipped out my camera to try again and this time I got the pic to count but only because I got lucky enough to have the vertibot fly about six inches over my head. That's the trick I guess: You have to be really damn close which is super hard for the vertibot when they're flying a hundred feet off the ground.
---
Hell no. I went from level 29 to level 75 in a day just from server hopping at whitesprings and west tek. Levelling alts would take forever if you can’t server hop
---
Yeah it was really hard on me too on my first playthru because I just saw the pumpkin on the map and I was like "i'm going to that pumpkin" and I'm walking down the road all peaceful like and this big flying jerk just kept killing me over and over D: but now... i will seek revenge FOR THE PUMPKINS
---
Really? Do you know specifics? I'm very guilt in this game of crafting and now actually paying attention to what materials I'm using. I just always try to make sure I have lots of everything. It's a bad habit carried over from fallout 4.
---
The first thing that comes to mind is that they've been destroyed. Go to your c.a.m.p. and choose "repair all". If that doesn't work, I got nothing else.
---
Tips on VERTIBOT: upgrade your camera, repair the vetibot station at Grafton steel. Move around instil "vertibot" appears on your screen. Had to be pretty close for it to pop.
---
two steel and one wood is your reward, three steel and one wood with the scrapper perk on.
---
Not bad for a 180. My main calculates about 12k per hit but he’s not using instigating stuff.

if you are on ps4 id be happy to help you out do a mule run,y ou can jsut dropa ll your gear in a world container and then bring in a mule to pick it up so you can lighten your load an your main
---
all you have to do is be on a  server with someone who wont leave, they dont need to know where you will do your dump so you can feel more secure
---
And peeking.  You know, like every FPS that exists in this era of gaming.
---
Sounds like you have the opposite of my problem. I want my pets to be essential so they can't be killed by a random level 15 angler that wandered by....
---
oh dang that sucks, i’m sorry.
---
So far as I know you can't "store" tamed animals?
---
My bloodied broadsider does like 450-500 damage and my bloodied 50 cal does 290 &amp; it's full auto... broadsider needs a buff to say the least
---
Cosmetic to me, and to people who arnt winey ass babies. How will a repair kit directly impact you? How will it negatively impact you that makes you feel like you are at a disadvantage?
---
The prosnap photos identify the location/contents of the photo (ex: Red Rock Stop, 2 Scorched).
---
I haven't tried it yet, but I wonder if it can identify hidden PVP players.
---
stealth/bloodied melee is strong enough that you can make it work with anything, even unoptimized gear. you don't need the best fist/2h weapon to oneshot most mobs. op's build is pretty standard, just switch iron fist with gladiator.
---
No worries, thanks for the response. I got help from another person saying I was trying to move too quickly.
---
I made a new character to try out the flamer. It is level 45. I was going to scrap flamers for ammo. I guess I won't make it to 50...
---
Maybe a Scorchbeast stopped by for a snack while you were out?
---
Try repair all?
---
2 Weeks of Gameplay? Thats roughly 112 hours (8h/d)? Thats more story than every singleplayer game ever had :x
---
I have done the main story in like 2 days btw and still playing.

So, Reddit.

Whooooooo has two thumbs and forgot to transfer his screensshoootttsss llassstt nniiiggghhtt...

That's right... THIS GUY!! :\\ lol

So I've done that now.

Here's [a Rad Storm when approaching](https://media.trillian.im/media/?m=aW1hZ2UvanBlZywxOTIwLDEwODAsx%2F6gdkpiM9KajJUY3ZLu5PL5o0MJd4%2FX1OQSE5W0a9g%3D), and then [one up close](https://media.trillian.im/media/?m=aW1hZ2UvanBlZywxOTIwLDEwODAszsptb7vbcjuMniWHrMXyHRpLvikAhBaog5FaKfsW3C4%3D) (different occasions). Similar to the nuked zone, the entire screen changes to the green hue that you see, though I was NOT inside the storm in either. Once inside it takes on that same "foggy" state like a nuked zone, just green, with periodic lightning (and the rads which follow).
---
Here's a shot of [me on the side of the Watoga Municiple Building](https://media.trillian.im/media/?m=aW1hZ2UvanBlZywxOTIwLDEwODAsfWdcfc%2Bw%2Bzz9NCMfcqVonplnTSSWV9DPx6q2u8fTEUc%3D), facing the South, in the morning (8 to 9am-ish). Those buildings being the Train Station and Watoga High School. 
---
Enjoy, and safe climbing! :D
---
Every workshop is a waste of time when server hoping is a thing, and you get way more out of ore than you will out of any workshop. 
---
Fusion cores you can get via server hoping a location with sentry bots. 98 NAR Regional 95% of the time has a sentry bot. That bot can sometimes take a good 15 or so seconds to spawn in though. You just head south upon spawning there and it's behind a downed train car directly blocking a road. So even fusion cores aren't worth capturing a workshop for. The cores that drop of them are always at 75% or 100% for me.
---
The crater south of the freak show. I've tried the power substation near Watoga, but the deathclaw there always kills the ants before I can get close.
---
Democracy is non-negotiable.

Abraxo Cleaner (all variants), bags of fertilizer, coolant, Suprathaw Antifreeze and various bug bits (bloatfly glands and the pointy bits of bloodbugs and stingwings) just off the top of my head. Grafton Monster sticky tar. 
---
Others point out acid can be acquired one way or another from wendigo, snallygasters and bears (yao guai).
---
I can't be disappointed, I already have seen how big the vault is.
---
Goddamn that is funny.  Glitch city!
---
There are tons of repeatable quests, legendary weapons s to find, nukes to drop, outfits/plans to farm. Its not meat to be a game you complete. The main and side quests are there to accustom you to the game.
---
😂 nice gt
---
Egg head.  With full class freak it's +6 intelligence with zero draw back.
---
Omw
---
I can take on and defeat three or four of them with correct and smart strategy in standard BOS combat armor and my bloodied build, using my beloved bloodied super sledge.
---
Not everything that kills you is OP and needs nerfing. Just try adjusting your fighting technique, build and weapon choice 👍
---
See I'd kill for the Pack paint jobs. The Pack lets it all hang out!
---
Just tried that one, didn't work
---
Most likely ignoring armour indeed.
---
Game definitely needs new hair styles. That is the most important thing at the moment.
---
I would love to get new hairstyles for sure. There's only one or two that I really love enough to actually use so some new variety would be greatly appreciated. I'm down for ombre/multi-color looks as well. Give me that Nuka Quantum look\~
---
Bloodied handmade.  My bloodied 50 cal can 2-3 shot super mutants &amp; handmade does more damage
---
Forgot to add in mutations, i do have twisted muscles which does increase damage output
---
Corrected the last line
---
Community - "Cool"
---
Seriously though not see much of an outcry currently after the initial posts about and seeing only a few posts about this getting to the top 25. Just hope they refrigerators as a regular item not atoms item.
---
You are an enigma
---
I don't see any relevant changes in the ESM. It should be keyed directly off damage resistance, with the maximum damage (+50%) only at 0 DR. What DR do you have in the pip-boy?
---
They essentially have anti-armor projectiles.  A mob of them coming from multiple angles is probably the most difficult thing in the game.  And they know this.  That's why it happens during Encryptid and the Burrows. 😂
---
There are a few ways of dealing with them though:
---
* Serendipity in Luck give you a % chance to outright avoid incoming damage.
---
* Dodgy in Agility blocks a certain % of incoming damage at a cost of AP.
---
* Anything that offers a flat damage reduction.  Lone Wanderer, Sentinel/Cavalier gear, Troubleshooters gear, etc.
---
* Kill them before they kill you with powerful Instigating, Bloodied, or Troubleshooter weapons.
---
I'm glad they fixed that. Only problem I have now is crafting enough FC's to feed my +25% ROF Laser Rifle. The dang thing *pews* so fast on semi-auto it feels like a dang Jakob's rifle.
---
I have an AA Gatling and run PA and stabilized on occasion and it’s pretty decent.
---
Oh trust me, I want that too lol. I don't want to have to kill them, as I said, I want a "go back to nature my friend" option.
---
I just tamed the first thing I could find, to make sure my CAMP spot would allow them. I've had like 4 different spots where they'd die for one reason or another. My old cliffside camp, they died of fall damage when I logged out (the sound my poor chicken made when I was logging out but could still hear things was tragic). My other cliffside camp, that was MUCH wider, they couldn't even get up there, and would just sit down at the bottom of the cliff. Something killed my radtoad down there, so I moved again. That spot ended up having a very weird spawn location, so my poor dog was clear across the pond, not even within my CAMP limits and right were mobs loaded in, so died literally in like less than a minute. :( So I moved AGAIN, and now I've had this Deathclaw for a few days, but need the room he takes to finish building my CAMP, and then I'll Tame a new critter.
---
Go kill the queen and get 2 for free that are better than what the atom shop offers ....
---
You sick Pinko scum.
---
I'd still like to see screenshots of your work.
---
im a dataminer. i actually look at the code of the game and the data files to find this information. i explained in my other comment as to why that is actually happening
---
I switch out Class Freak level 3. Works out great until I wonder why I'm overencumbered 30 minutes later...
---
At least I haven't lost any mutations!
---
I learned the hard way. I was in watoga city took a picture with emote. And dropped from the top of the map around the lucky hole mine. Only works without Power Armor. So it’s really not worth it
---
I am sorry you got scammed :( People are really strange in the Wasteland. I normally won't transfer with people unless I've played with them consistently for a couple weeks or they let me hold their things etc. It doesn't make sense he'd take those things when he had all of that other junk in his grasp too. Best suggestion would be to try to get Hemlock Holes to start getting more acid again.
---
It's not your graphic card, people here dont really understand how RAM heavy fallout 76. 
---
Add atleast 8gb more of ram and it will run much smoother and not crash for you. Reason for crash is probably because the ram you currently have can't handle it.
---
Fallout 76 peaks at around 15-16gb ram usage.
---
then why does it have to be 3\*?
---
XB1, lvl 58 &gt; "because they know you can acquire dupes" 
---
I am apparently NOT "in the know" on this one.  How does one acquire dupes on demand or otherwise?  I'm calling BS on this one.  I repair all my own stuff, have a farm and feed myself.  I sell prepared and raw food all the time.  Not trying to be argumentative, just saying.
---
Grognak’s Helmet lives in the hearts of all the harmonious beings of Appalaccia.
---
That is where you must search my friend.
---
That is where you will find it.
---
Idk. 3 is better then 1 imma right?
---
Believe it or not, it's harder to do than you'd think it was.  I mean, I agree with you, this sure seems like something that could have been though up pretty easily and tested.  But it's really a little mind-boggling just how many possible things there are to test when you're doing QA/testing on something like FO76.
---
I won't give them a pass on this one, but when you find things like "my game crashes when I'm underwater and do the thumbs up emote 3 times in row and my carrot soup buff goes away during the last emote"...yeah, ain't nobody going to find that in QA.
---
I'm only level 32 and haven't found much power armor at my level. I have a growing collection of fusion cores and am waiting to find a chest piece before I start rollin around. 
---
I'll keep that in mind, thanks.
---
WATOGA ... IS ... A NO-MANS LAND ... LITERALLY
---
Video it and post the results!
---
I think they only occur in the Savage Divide... At least that seems to be a trend between my two experiences and this new screenshot? heh  
---
Coincidentally I had JUST posted my images in another thread, so here they are, experienced on two different occasions (neither from inside the storm though):  
---
[Rad Storm in the distance](https://media.trillian.im/media/?m=aW1hZ2UvanBlZywxOTIwLDEwODAsx%2F6gdkpiM9KajJUY3ZLu5PL5o0MJd4%2FX1OQSE5W0a9g%3D)

---
TSE Tesla working still ⤴️
---
No, you can get a double and quad legendary effect though.
---
There's a way up on the Western side that a person without can get up, it just takes a LOT of little hops and trying.
---
I might consider doing that. I do have a route of enemies I set up for acid collection though I really wish that stuff had more farmable locations in game.
---
Gonna get downvoted here but I would actually love that. I'm sitting on like 4k atoms because I don't like any cosmetics in the shop. So I have a their premium currency but nothing I actually want to spend it on. I would love being able to buy an exp boost so I can try new builds instead of grinding alts. Also they already have increased experience gains for survival mode anyways.
---
I’m not for this slot expansion being tied to the Atom store. If the offerings of the Atom store continue this trend many quality of life features could be locked out behind a paywall. This is why folks are upset about repair kits for example.
---
Antiseptic is kind of everywhere! Always pick up canisters of like industrial solvent, abraxo cleaner and toothpaste! I know there's spawns in the flatwoods red rocket for abraxo - as well as the utility building at whitesprings has some as well! Fort Defiance is a pretty good place for abraxo I believe plus you can find lots of aluminum in there!
---
not if you don't care about the 3rd effect
---
I like to RP some of my characters as not being from the vault too, I just figure they grabbed a pip boy of a dead guy. There's a few corpses in vault suits scattered around
---
Like fus roh dah or something.
---
I could be wrong, but I think Furious increases the damage from projectiles only. Explosive only adds extra damage (that's why it's not counted in DMG)
---
Okay posting it now, search by new!
---
Sorry to say, but you can't get Ghillie suit. However Bethesda will bring this costume soon to atomic shop and they hope it will satisfy your needs [https://www.justfurry.com/posts/1007](https://www.justfurry.com/posts/1007)
---
I have no clue why you would want to lie, but the edit time literally shows you edited at 18:51 eastern, and I posted my comment at 18:32 eastern.
---
Now that sucks. And again I learn about cool and useful trick only after it's been closed for good, like with that infinite source of acid from Faschnacht beeswax... Oh well. At least we have repair kits and teleporting cameras.
---
Idk there can be some good third effects out there. But I just want it to be three starred because I think it would be neat.
---
That's not Vault 94 in the trailer, it's the laboratory underneath Arktos Pharma
---
Yeah, I climbed from the south side. Last few jumps were rather tricky
---
I haven't been able to play in a week, is there a compilation of the quests that were added somewhere (I know about a few but doesn't look like all of them)?  I'm in the same boat with other folks here in that I've already explored close to as much as you can since I'm a solo player.
---
Actually, they should rework the entire holo system. Have them as checkmarks when discovered instead of items you pick up, so people like you can see what they have not found yet (and maybe have a hint to the region they are in). It would also eliminate the holo inventory page, because who needs the 4th copy of that same survivor's story they accidentally pick up when looting the pre-war currency for cloth?
---
Np, good luck finding what you’re after.
---
If it makes you feel any better, I have around 500 caps worth of Challenges that I can't fufill because discover X was added long after I found it, and "Learn 76 recipes" can't be done if you already learned all but 5 when the quest dropped. (Same for learning weapon plans and quite a few other things.)  
---
Allthose sweet, sweet Atom, forever out of reach because I started on Day Zero.   
---
Sadface. :(
---
Try selling one item to any vendor. It will display the correct value afterwards.
---
I'd be down with that. My main has pink hair, but I'd love more options.
---
Yea, I hope too
---
The reason I asked, someone mentioned they throw in a grenade before and it kills them, but yes I agree, I haven't quite figured out how to kill them before either the deathclaw kills them or me, but someone said they managed .. I think I will give the creator another go reluctantly, I know I eventually will hit it. Also fog crawlers spawn there so a good opportunity to grab a pic for my troubles.
---
Such as what skills in intelligence do people need to run in their builds at all times that require more than 3 points? Because all the 200% perks can be maxed at 3 points and swapped out to repair each piece, so they literally don't need anymore than 3 points.
---
Ah that does make sense too. A "release" option would be great in that case - like if you could walk up to them and select an option. 
---
I am pretty sad about my current camp because it's in a perfectly creepy - out of the way - no players are going to come here - location but.. there's an angler spawn right by it so I really don't want to move but I really miss my Deathclaw. Do you know if it's possible to tame higher leveled deathclaws - I only ever see level 21ish ones - and I'm lvl 135
---
You mean the tin foil hat? https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Tin_foil_hat
---
Interesting, there's lots of content coming. Not as big as people are expecting but welcome ones.
---
Yes, you should be able to get TS Gatling Laser. Explosives were removed from every Energy weapon (that includes Gatling Laser)
---
I play anthem all the time and will continue to do so because its a wonderful game ... but with alot of gamers hating on fallout76 and anthem i feel its time for me to put my 2 cents in .. ok im seeing all this horse shit and the only people you should be blaming is the youtubers and gamers who push hypes on the game to the point developers are forced to relase them before there done and im done with the bullshit .. you all wanted a complete game then you shouldent of stressed out the developers
---
If you run one gun army not even sentinels or cav builds can survive. You stagger them right out of their damage resist.
---
I get that farming watoga was too easy after doing mayor for the day, but couldn’t the robots just re-gain agro on you after you shoot one, and stay that way for the rest of the session, just like the whitesprings guards behave.
---
The cultist dagger takes a bit of it to repair.  
---
(Takes a long time to break, so I dont remember just how much.) 
---
Logic says the cultist blade should as well.
---
as an aside, there are standard and legendary versions of both.
---
ROFL, a "rare" drop form the SBQ like how serum recipes used to be isn't "easily gotten by most players" like you try to assume.
---
I was going for 1h melee build with some 3 and 4* machettes. 
---
Then i got the gauntlet . didnt realize until not long ago its not classified as a gladiator or 1h weapon! I got iron fist and BOOM! WOW what a difference
---
&gt;I can't be disappointed
---
Get out now, you don't belong here.  ^^/s
---
Xb1
---
Ah alright, thank you
---
I mean, this seems like something you can Google just as easily as anyone else?
---
If it makes you feel better, I started a month ago and those location challanges are still broken.
---
We miss you frogo. but it can't ever be the same.
---
I think it needs the power roughly tripled, the weight of bolts reduced, every bolt that hits a target should be in the bodies inventory, as well as guaranteed stealth (i.e. bolts make 0 noise, and alert no one when fired, unless you kill an enemy in another enemy's line of sight).
---
Picked up 4 between 5:10 and  5:30 pm PDT.  Maybe just unlucky that day?
---

Sent you a friend request! WanderingWolf15 is the IGN
---
‘The main and side quests are there to accustom you to the game.’
---
Not seen the game explained like this before, it feels so true, that’s how I see Fallout 76... 
---
FO76...  FO76 never ends...............
---
Did they “fix” the bots to no longer agro on Phoenix, I haven’t seen him out hunting down bots recently.
---
That will solve the problem a lot of the time but that spit cooker will pull that on you anyway. I avoid it altogether now.
---
Wait I can’t post videos on fo76 subreddit what do I do?
---
Very nice sir 👍
---
Thanks for sharing this, I'm not one to buy Atoms, so I'm careful what I spend my earned ones on. Now that I know what they all look like, I can save and spend on the ones I like without having to wait to see if I even like them.
---
here you go!
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/uKaeKnW](https://imgur.com/a/uKaeKnW) 
---
so its no longer obtainable and has even been marked as deprecated.
---
Bugged, drops you mean. You even admit further down that the numbers seem way off even to you. It is obviously a bug and going to be taken out very quickly. Just watch.
---
Dude I'm not joining back
---
I meant to add onto that. "We miss you. It's not the same. Hope you found someplace better :("
---
They were so common in FO4 due to us being right next to The Glowing Sea (which has no actual relation to the ocean lol).
---
It's actually said in game somewhere, that the reason they're so common is because they blow in from there. 
---
Now, I'm not so sure that a nuked area would continue to be ***that*** irradiated 200+ years after the fact, versus only 20ish years, nevermind the fact that we're constantly nuking West Virginia in present time... lol Which was also why one thread suggested that a Rad Storm be generated after every nuke is set off, and is a fair suggestion IMO :P
---
Which one is the spit cooker? I only use the stove
---
Cool, thanks for the clarification..! 👍🏻
---
Enforcer perk and a shotgun does the trick just fine.
---
Nothing
---
Not even fireproof and dense torso can save me with my explosive gatling plasma with beam splitter.
---
If it's maxed, yes.
---
Yep.
---
Yes, as long as it’s maxed out
---
Well that is one way to do it. You also could have visited the other locations that the NPC can spawn until you found her. It’s not that it doesn’t spawn, it’s just not always in the same spot.
---
This would be really painful. Oh sorry! Joeschmoe420xxx picked up the plan on this server because he logged on 20 minutes before you! You can't leave and can try again tomorrow :D 
---
no thank you D:
---
I like changing my arguments when im proven wrong too.
---
People downvote your posts
---
I have no idea what you have to do. Hoping someone else on this thread can shed some light
---
I'm honestly not even sure if they still take 10%, but I know my build limit is maxed and it wasn't before. 
---
And I was SUPER bummed my old Cliffside wouldn't work, I loved it up there. (Shameless self-promotion time! [https://youtu.be/Yj-9LJgGvA0](https://youtu.be/Yj-9LJgGvA0))
---
And I'm not sure. I'm level 115, and I've Tamed a few Deathclaws, but they all seem to turn into level 21s when I get them home. I don't know how it works.
---
Death is s preferable alternative to communism.
---
Well, maybe instead of junk respawn every hour you could benefit from increase in EXP earned on that server with +10% for every 1 hour you were on it up to +100% max EXP increase (10+ hours).
---
Just wait and see, if it isn't bugged why are you even saying the numbers seem way off and need balanced?
---
I know. I love my Vamp / Explosive and Suppressor / Limb damage flamers SO MUCH
---
Good thing about the Queen is I bring out the Cryolator if someone isn't doing that already and not use one of my flamers (of course, it breaks fast). I'd much rather use a Flamer all the time.
---
Honestly, the Flamer may be the only weapon you can't really keep up ammo crafting to use as a standard. I can't think of any other weapon I can't keep up with ammo.
---
Meanwhile I’ll stand on a cliff in the savage divide and scan my camera and see all sorts of random creatures listed, though I can’t see them...
---
I still kill them, just not instantly. Bloodied with sentinel assassin, serendipity, and nerd rage on last the longest.
---
They are supposed to be upping the craft amount for the Flamer and Cryolater next patch. Still a dick move to remove a viable crafting method before the fix.
---
I am really excited to see what there is to come! I am hopeful they'll be much different from the Burrows and will actually require us to take a group to complete!
---
There was one major problem in the writing. Bethesda does not communicate with players.
---
I wouldn't either. Almost left when everyone else did. But ya know, gotta mind the store somehow
---
They refresh 20 hours after you last traded with them. How long ago did you empty the vendors?
---
Stabilized, power patcher, power user...
---
And why wouldn't you have gunsmith on at all times? The only perks you should swap out are crafting perks. If a perk makes your guns BREAK slower then why the fuck wouldnt you use it?
---
If someone with repair kits isn't using gunsmith it just means they have to go into their inventory and repair all the fucking time. Whereas someone with gunsmith on and 0 repair kits can go for hours on end without even needing a repair.
---
If anything, the person using gunsmith has all the advantage here.
---
Stop being bad at the game.
---
Thank you 
---
Im now at negative six                HOW 
---
I give up
---
Yep
---
the long, horizontal one. but the stove, too? wow. i cook all the time and the stove has not done that to me yet jeez
---
Hey, don't forget that some players haven't been able to complete the Final Warnings quest in over 150 days since launch, my first character I had in the beta still hasn't been able to complete the main questdue to the 0/5 motors crafted bug.
---
I'd say about maybe 15 :/
---
There are many people on this subreddit that are too keen to downvote anyone they disagree with even slightly.
---
That happened to my missile turret one day the wire just floats and the turret still takes up camp budget.
---
350 caps?!  I wish.  I got mine for 4k from another player.
---
Thanks folks!
---
Whats your kill time on them?
---
Oh no I haven’t had it on the stove I was saying that’s what I use for cooking. I’ve been having this bug on both the armor and weapon benches
---
I was lucky to not get stuck in a wall in the video. People are abusing it and using it as a free fast travel. So it'll get fixed pretty quick hopefully
---
it's just a 25%/20% bonus, that's hardly game-breaking. and assassins/sentinels are weak against crits.
---
Try again in 5 hours then. No other way. Unless you find another player who's willing to buy your stuff from you for 90% of total value.
---
&gt;And why wouldn't you have gunsmith on at all times? The only perks you should swap out are crafting perks. If a perk makes your guns BREAK slower then why the fuck wouldnt you use it?
---
THAT IS LITERALLY MY POINT, and why these repair kits are p2w, it allows those who buy these kits to repair on the fly to not run any perks that are for slowing item degradation.
---
You literally just listed off perks that I'm pointing out they won't need thanks to the repair kits, so they won't need to run 5 in intelligence, at most they will need to run 3 to swap in the 200% repair perks.
---
It’s 20 hours I think. If it’s been longer than 20 just close out the game and go back in.   Aka tech support says you should reboot it haha.  No but really I had the same issue. All I did was go back in and it had reset. Just let the game catch up.
---
It is the core feature of the game. Fun and engaging!
---
I'm just trying to get you all stirred up. My bad yo. Feel free to block me
---
*"Rad storm is coming... I better get in my power armor!!"*  
---
\*as he fails to noticed his armor LACKS A RIGHT LEG!\*
---
I use a similar build but I can't sneak to save my life. My favorite is my instigating deathclaw gauntlet, mutations, and armor strength boosts. All my armor pieces have a +1 strength and the shielded enclave under armor for +3 strength.
---
thank you dont like it but i guess it works
---
what is it used for?
---
Its a pity about the broadsider. It was always a quirky weapon, but it did have some viability in FO4, especially with maxed out perks for explosives and heavy weapons. The laser and plasma gatlings are insane.
---
I saved it so I can watch the video later after work. I wish I could show you my camp - it's just a little deathclaw shrine and all my friend's hate it because there's no workbenches but - that's why they have their own camps. Maybe I can try to get a good picture of it later :)
---
I got really excited when I first learned of taming and I tried to tame the chameleon deathclaw I found at whitesprings - I was so sad when I could only pacify it.
---
Alright, thank you... I'll wait and see later
---
What did you do man? If your asking how it works you are probably not deserving of downvote, I reserve that for real jerks and for trade thieves
---
Wow bethesda, you've really fucked up. I distinctly remember that you were going to only put cosmetic items in the atomic shop. That does not look like a cosmetic item to me. Any money I was considering spending on your game ever again is now gone forever, and I encourage everyone else that reads this to do the same. It's not about this specific case, its about the next one, and the next one, and so on, gradually getting bolder and bolder with what they can put in for real money. THIS IS NOT OK.
---
Also I upvote you for asking a question and not being worried about ridicule
---
But see the problem is that they only show the front of him
---
I hadn’t heard that. Any proof?
---
ah, yeah the spit is the one it happened to me nearly 100% of the time. never happened from a workbench besides a short freeze.
---
That's why I suggested a shortened timer on everything. Then again, Joe could just camp there and grab it up over and over...if only people didn't suck...😕
---
Yea i dont get why the server cant make sure to push quest items to you. usually thats what the problem is or the processing code for entering the server is the only place that they process already started quests and after you have entered it just doesnt try to anymore. it could be a few things but it shouldnt be this hard lol
---
Enemy bodies don't land in the same spot for everyone. I had one person find it where it should be. My other mate finds it 30 yards away from that spot. 
---
Sometimes others can point it out, sometimes it doesnt matter :)
---
How do you know anything about the majority of people that were banned? Or about the moral consideration of killing dupers vs being a duper? You seem like an angry feller, I hope duper bans costing people an additional 30$ for a new copy of fallout 76 isn't the only thing that counters your salt in this universe.
---
I wish I could see what i did but i dont know.
---
Is there a way for me to find out?
---
nah that's shit mate, I'll buy it off you for cheap tho what's your IGN???
---
I don’t see anything wrong with it 😝
---
You got downvoted on your legendary vendor post.
---
FO76 future is the single player. Don't worry. There is barely any players left in few months.
---
Going to upvote this since you’re new. I got ya buddy
---
Sounds like the " insert name here " party...
---
Thanks, i usually don't have a problem getting some but ive been making a lot of radaway and ran out
---
Did you look waaaaay down?  There are side shots
---
Unfortunately my commie lake shack has long been scrapped as I move CAMP and redesign way too often. Just imagine a creepy small cabin with tightly packed/organized yet aesthetically pleasing decor style, lit only by low power red cycling lights and the lights of the commie posters. All set against the backdrop of the swampy and incredibly dark Mire.
---
Twas neat. Never had a visitor though. The oil node I was there for was a bit out of the way. Shame.
---
man you are really looking for a fight, Iron thumbs seems to have apologized for his being misunderstood, but you just keep badgering him... i bet you are fun at parties...
---
Oooh, I like that one too.
---
Some people just downvote to downvote I think. It will turn itself around.
---
I'd love to see a screenshot. What platform are you on? 
---
I recently found a spot where tame-able creatures spawn, I was SO excited lol
---
yes you nailed it is a video game!
---
this game has a perk card that increases your damage to camps 
---
ergo there are going to be murder hobo's that will wreck your stuff because they can.
---
All I was saying is do your best to hide your camp and dont get to disappointed when some asshat wrecks its .
---
peace and love (i myself never wreck any ones camp)
---
Charlotte, NC or Charleston, SC?
---
That is something I don't know about
---
Are you kidding? I'm going to tag you so I can rub this in your face when I'm proven right just like I did to the rick sanchez idiot in this subreddit when he claimed in the past they weren't going to add in more P2W items after I pointed out the 60+hp buff from the item shop outfits they pulled. Then when they released this patch he freaked out and started whining about pay 2 win.
---
It was honestly some of the best schadenfreude I've had in a while. So once they announce the drop rate was a bug and nerfs the hell out of it to super rare drop, I'll be able to rub this in your face too.
---
It's their way of saying "oh looks ,its ok because there's a better version in game", that will be very rare or limited quantities. Keep in mind, it's not the repair kits themselves, its bethesda being emboldened once they realize they can get away with this, and they will do it again. And again. And again.
---
how did you find out?
---
interestingly enough it looks like molotovs and shishkebab SHOULD work with this.
---
I have no idea how to do it. Hopefully someone else can shed some light on this.
---
This early in release, I bet looking it up would take us to this very thread.
---
Imagine typing these words
---
No problem and I know - I've been running out lately - I don't really use a lot of stims myself because of my build but my friends do so I tend to farm them stimpacks (gotta love being a super duper chemist) and I run out alot - especially with the Sheepsquatch because they're usually pylons.
---
their eyes take massive crit damage tho
---
3 pieces from 3 3 stars in under an hour....
---
thanks but als what do you mean about not being worried about ridicule.
---
sorry just want to know how Reddit works sorry to be a bother.
---
I know that. Let me tell you right now that this post is merely opinion.
---
Everybody knows.
---
If someone clicks on your user name they can see what you’ve posted.
---
thanks mate!
---
The struggles of online games but what can you do. 
---
I think camps would be another problem too because if your campsite is taken D: you can't switch?
---
www.fortnite.com
---
Agreed. I hopped servers and fast traveled all my caps away. F this camera all to hell.
---
Which platform?
---
Xbox
---
Dang I dumped 700 on the ground once. I always have too much
---
Go kill the queen at level 27 without dying over and over again while wasting ammo and stims.
---
I'm on XB1 and yes my camp is actually pretty close to a spawn since I know your tames have to walk to your camp. I've been meaning to hop again soon to get a new deathclaw child but camera stuff!!
---
It's not really accurate. Vanguard's effects start at +7 DR/ER at 50-60% hp, with another +7 per 10%. It's certainly a lot stronger if you keep your HP above 90%, but that's not particularly difficult with diluted RadAway.
---
I'd agree with the part about flat damage reduction, but there's not a good single first-star option there with a pistol/melee build. Both ranged and melee enemies are going to hit you.
---
Some people wouldn't ask a basic question like that because others in here would ridicule them
---
Loading times are so long that Bethesda could sold some advertising time for other companies. Players could enjoy product ads while waiting the environment loading.
---
It will help for people who want to roleplay
---
Aw, im on pc otherwise i would´ve given you the recipe
---
Thanks for the help every one I now have some basic info about this sight.
---
Thanks again.
---
 Sentry bots drop it
---
Is that why at full health in pa with 20 endurance I still get 2 or 3 shot? Even when using furious/bloodied handmade and lever actions? Those shot guns have silly range too. I was using vats to the head with my furious handmade from a distance and still be 3 shot
---
There’s 
---
Pvp
---
Events
---
Nuking
---
Builds
---
CAMPS
---
Etc
---
also all the lore that you probably missed speeding through.
---
Bunch of other hidden gems in this game
---
Added
---
Much less with the shotgun from what I've heard.
---
Now, my AAE shotty I think would make an excellent PvP weapon.  I can't count the number of times it's one-shot someone (though it's always me).
---
I'll take it. IGN: Dr.Patrick_
---
This guy sounds like a pathological liar.
---
There's a lot of places to farm xp though. Yeah, you'd have to fast travel, but if enemy respawn times were relatively short, you could walk between the mire and cranberry bog and make a killing.
---
Its used for absolutely nothing. Its fake internet points although some subs wont let you post or comment with a negative karma but you can still see things. But yeah as other said, some people dont like that others may have an opinion other than their own. Thats why its best to keep somethings to yourself lmao.
---
Aw thank you! That’s too bad.
---
No?
---
I rather not re level when I'm already passed 50 x3.
---
I am willing to bet it doesn't matter if you're 50 or 200, you'll still get set to 0 with only 1 prestige, instead of 4.
---
Wow... really?
---
I see my butt horseshoe is spreading to others! Lol
---
The Wendigo agrees 💯
---
No, what you're telling me is that I can't be upset because it's a game mechanism. I can be upset. This entire server is about the way people feel about game mechanisms.
---
I also doubt that you never wreck anyone's camp.
---
Tons if people can also build it for you for caps. If you're Xbox I can do it for you, if not, search other platforms in the market forums.
---
I carry an, I'll admit it, excessive number of cores on me 62) do batteries not included takes up that space haha
---
I have the 3 claw deathclew gaunlet too which i used to use before i got the instagating mole miner gaunlet. Sick damage too!
---
You would hope everyone knows about animation cancelling
---
Ah, good point. Maybe let that be the only time you can?
---
You are awesome, nice to see non toxic people
---
Yeah, count me in on this! Finally somebody's doing an event on PS4 for once!
---
Psn's fireboy769
---
seems like the people who fish for compliments on Facebook or something around those lines if you know what I mean.
---
I've got Bird Bones and one rank of goat legs and even jumping off the lighthouse doesn't do too much damage.  I really have to jump from high to get the slam animation.
---
Seems to work great with speed demon.  If I ever get Marsupial I'll be moonwalking.
---
Yes, it would help get costumes out quicker instead of having to search through all the outfits you are wearing.
---
African or European?
---
I meant the other guy that was gibing it away sorry.
---
I'm cautiously optimistic. Are they going to be instanced? If not, I'd imagine the experience of delving through a vault would be ruined by randoms running around, sporadic PvP, a random influx of respawns because of people walking in, and so on. If they're instanced and they're challenging enough (with some procedural elements to shake things up each delve), I think they could be just the endgame content we desperately need.
---
Kind of, more like people who think opinions are facts and can no longer tell the difference between the two.
---
Why the fuck would a roleplayer be wearing multiple outfits?
---
I'd like to think the guy probably snatched them all up real quick because he got excited, maybe?   
---
Did he ever put any back?
---
Huh! Possibly using a model replacer on his client for something else. Wearing a metal helmet, say, but on his system it looks like something else. And lying about it on Facebook to feel special. 
---
Or maybe he really did find something else no one else has, idk. Can you link the picture you saw?
---
Fridges aren't confirmed for the atom shop calm down
---
Dropping them means you are getting rid of them. Don't get mad at him.
---
One day they might want to roleplay as a brotherhood member, another day they might want to roleplay as a time traveler, another they might want to roleplay as a raider. So on and so forth
---
If you dropped them, then they were fair game once on the floor.
---
Why didn't you just use the trade menu? Dropping them seems kinda careless.
---
Then they would have them in their inventory...
---
I feel as though that would be desirable. Means i have less to read.
---
God dammit.
---
There is a funny person in Bethesda who develop these new things to the game. That person is funny only in Bethesda's office.
---
+karma awesome man, thank you so much!
---
Again, looking through your inventory takes time, it would be easier to hit the favorites button, and click an outfit.
---
I love them. They're one of only a few enemies in this game that I take seriously.  (mirelurk queens/kings, ballistic gutsies, imposter)
---
If you're not paying attention they can wreck you and that's a good thing.
---
I understand what an instance is and I understand your point of view. That does not make my point of view any less. 
---
ESO is nice game but it does have very different end game item structure. In Fallout 76 end game items are 3\* legendaries and BGS is limiting their availability at the moment. 
---
What if the raid boss has quaranteed 3\* legendary drop, and then you grind it for two hours and have 50 3\* legendaries. There is no good for games longevity nor to the player economy to flood the game with end game items.
---
I'm not saying they have to go full Everquest difficulty, where the whole server has single run on end game boss per week. Oh, another guild alliance took it yesterday, too bad for you. 
---
At the moment there is all ready time gated content in Fallout 76. Nukes. And they seem to work just fine, there is no SBQ event up every 5-minutes (unless you server hop).
---
Everything about this post and his responses screams teenage pathological liar who wants to seem interesting and impressive. Client side mods are not going to make OTHER players systems do “acid trips”. Devs aren’t personally going to respond to this one random dude’s emails and tell just him that “mods are cool, have fun!”
---
oh man dont give them the idea~!
---
PA and end mean squat, especially in survival. and shotguns
---
 have the worst range/damage dropoff in the game.
---
Finally someone who speaks the truth instead of all this idiotic outrage over nothing.
---
I was PvPing someone yesterday and decided to test the Repair Kit out: Takes 10 seconds to get the thing repaired (Weapon inspect screen etc) it's nowhere close to 'Play to Win' ESO has Repair Kits yet you don't hear people bitching at that.
---
Reddit is full of misinformed people.
---
Whatever happened to people who let 'live and let live' instead of the crywolf antics?
---
Glad to help - this is such a pain in the ass to find
---
Where, if I might ask?  I've tried forever but *sniff* noone comes home with me
---
I don't think these guys take up camp budget anymore. I had my place maxed out and was still able to tame.
---
Not saying this with the intention of being mean, but as someone who can get quite emotional on a semi-regular basis (me), if that's all it took to make you cry... I'd recommend help (like a friend). Crying is hardly warranted when the damage isn't remotely permanent... I'd start crying if you couldn't just repair everything at a click of a button and had to remake everything from scratch. When it's *poof* it's gone and then *poof* it's back exactly as it was, it should be annoying and make you mildly angry at least, not crying and closing the game. There are more significant things to cry over...
---
Not crying at all isn't healthy, but crying so easily is... worrisome.
---
Then you favorite the outfit while its in your inventory...
---
Dense torso mod. Fireproof. Explosions no longer hurt you. If you use these things, and you're still getting shredded, you'd get spanked by anyone with any other weapon, ever.
---
It probably was at some point. A guy posted a YouTube video of where he got it. But if it got removed from the table, just like BoS from the merchants or mutation recipes from the queen, then there’s no point for me to continue to waste time on trying to find it.
---
That's the nuttiest way of trading I ever heard. No offence.
---
Support local business, people.
---
I don't think Bethesda itself has confirmed instances. I just hope something basic like a door lock before entering the vault to prevent other people in after a set amount of time.
---
But if you have a hat and other items it takes up more than one favorites space.
---
...
---
I expected that kind of opinion. Though how do you tell someone you want to trade something that's in their stash without showing them very literally or using voice chat? Text chat should be a thing.
---
Thanks for the report! This is an issue we're actively investigating and looking to fix with a future update.
---
Which could be interesting if they keep to lore from fallout 3. The Assistant CEO of Vault Tec was kidnapped by aliens during the construction of vault 76.
---
Been waiting all evening for a post! Just joining on your game. Need  any supplies? GT is Mr W S0bchak

+karma omw
---
Kind of you to offer, I'm on PC though. Will have to figure a mule system of some sort. Also I just found the damn tourist at Beckley, after drinking 5 vintage nukashines to teleport around the map. I hope they never start a questline with RNG again.
---
I will check the space station. If they told us everything we would have nothing to find on our own.
---
Been tryna jump out the cut with this chopper for a while now.

um,  anyone with the @#$@$ internet and a video game console are obviously not huddling masses burning poop chips to survive

And you can find one inside a Porta potty in cranberry bog

Be joining you shortly. Thanks for posting. GT GrumpyDude
---
Upvote for the lols. 
---
I haven't gotten on and gotten a camera since the update, are there videos of this glitch?
---
Teleporting away during combat is such a broken mechanic.
---
So your friends are going to spend real money to get a 100% repair when they can get a 200% repair from you for no money? You fucking guys are really grasping at straws here.
---
i think they did, but they just dont care
---
or rather, zenimax execs dont care
---
Good lord you're a fucking child...
---
Like the flares from fallout 4.
---
I think mark 3s have been busted forever now
---
Your price is still cheaper and end result better.   
---
I'm still unsure I see an issue?
---
I don't know when it works one way and when it works another, but some spawns are on a timer, so it may be that you'd have to wait once you've farmed them.  But if you haven't farmed them and you go in and find them missing, then server hopping would most likely work, and traveling to respawn might work too.
---
That said, I've seen instances where items that are on a timer will occasionally show up early when I'm hopping servers - it's unusual, but I've seen it a few times.  You can try that if you get desperate.
---
Want a cookie?
---
Eh I think they are cool during certain moments ya know. If you’re in a fight and your weapon break
---
I’m in the middle of doing a treasure map run [level 166].   I have a bunch of plans that I already know and should have a good sized collection when I’m done.  Let me know if you want to meet up and swap.  
---
I know it doesn’t make up for crappy behavior by other players, but at least you might pick up a few cool plans that you’re missing. 
---
Personally, I never expect anything back when I drop plans.   But when players are kind enough to share with me I always offer something in return.  Even extra StimPacks or a few fusion cores can help out in a big way....
---
People rarely carry their plans and recipes in their inventory. Another thing is high level players won't accept my trade invites, usually won't even wave back. dropping all my plans is to show them my good will, my trust and my intentions and it only haven't worked once.
---
Do you still have the body
---
East of Bog Town the section of monorail with a train still attached. If you go up there and investigate a scientist was working on a time machine. If you go to the south end you see it's like a Tesla pad the "time machine ".
---
That was totally my intent friend, before the game release. My plan was knife + crossbow but it did not work out well.
---
Just grabbed it and left so others could join. Thanks for posting.
---
To be fair, nobody plays like this after the first month or so. Everyone can have every perk, so the idea of having a dedicated crafter in a group is only enforced by your desire to play with a dedicated crafter in your group.   
---
If I felt like I had to wait for a friend to log on to repair my weapon, I'd be pissed.
---
Perfect storm won’t even come close to that- the fire legendary effect is trash damage. It’ll LOOK like fire but it’s not 2-3shotting supermutants.
---
Go into any of the trading forums and look for TSE's, 95% of the TSE's you see up for trade are dupes. If you traded for a TSE chances are it is a duped one.
---
I've said this over and over:  repair kits make game decisions into revenue decisions.
---
Now that repair kits are a thing, any discussion on repair rates and relevant perks is tainted, because you don't know if it was for game balance reasons, or to sell more Atoms.
---
Half the time I've said I get up voted, the other half down voted. I dont care if they are cheap and repair isn't that big a deal.  I recognize they need to make money to release new content.  Sell all the cosmetics you want.  Stop giving away or reduce the amount of free Atoms in daily challenges.  Just don't turn game decisions into accounting decisions.
---
I guess the internet can't take a joke 🤷‍♂️
---
why would you doubt that? 
---
that I understand a certain type of person likes to wreck other peoples stuff for no good reason?  Look it happens in real life a buddy of mine got his car keyed last week non good reason? some times asshats be asshats 
---
all good at this point this has the feeling of a troll so i bid you good day
---
"Mini-MIRV Go!"?
---
It's pretty silly. I feel like it would be *better* for OP as I've heard these drop from the SBQ so they could hoard them and now also repair their friends' stuff on the go.
---
They screwed up. The game was unlocking it upon people learning the second assaultron plan. They then had to remove it as an option from the crafting bench so they can earn money from it, even though it was not the players fault. Not many people are going to get this if they can't reskin the legendary versions they already have...
---
Wait for Vault 51, like in 9 months or so. Don't worry, we have 728216237847 days to complete it.
---
I got off afterwards, sorry. It was in front of the statue next to the gift shop.
---
And then you have a stew going.
---
What alien counts for the current weekly? Because no one has been able to find one that works, and every single one has been checked.
---
Incoming tranquility lane quests
---
The ones in the shop only repair to 100%.  The ones that drop from the queen only 150%.  Your friends are takin a huge hit on stats if they prefer to use the shop kits.
---
Yeah i tried that, people keep their plans in their stash so i can't ask them for offer of something they don't currently keep in their inventory and im not really interested in selling my plans for caps.
---
Your friends will likely still require your services, so dont worry. It's way better and cheaper to spend 10 caps and get armour repaired 200% than spend 50 atoms to get 100% repair.
---
I hope we can push this topic up there so maybe they will add it back.
---
If you're out around the Free State folks' bunkers, some of them have a couple of boxes of Abraxo (both regular and industrial strength) in their bunkers.  Also, the kitchen area at the Red Rocket Mega Stop has some.
---
pretty sure your role is safe. if anything, you should raise prices and use the repair kit debacle to advertise your services.
---
It’s less about the weapon itself and more about the combination of build and legendary effects. For example my low-health HW/PA dude has an Instigating Gatling gun with a listed damage of 300something. On first hit it’s doing 600something. If I headshot, it’ll 1shot most any supermutants, and once I’ve got a few kills and adrenaline has stacked up, I’m 1shotting on body shots.
---
I’m scared
---
Sadly, no. He either sold them to vendor or put them into his stash.
---
They did mention them in the same patch preview they announced the repair kits, so they aren't far off.
---
[Yes](https://youtu.be/uoht2eytEJs)
---
Where abouts was he
---
Thanks I will look
---
That sucks man, get a mic, or wait for text chat, or sell them for caps.
---
You'd be surprised how many people think 10 caps is too expensive for a 200% repair, I used to do it for 30 caps. Rants go on on how a trader roleplay will be completely useless if I charge for repairs, and that they can't wait for repair kits.
---
From my experience, people rather use kits than rely on me anymore.
---
Like, put a third fixed tourist spawn in the end of glassed caverns or something, somewhere you can always go to get the camera, or hell even just let the random broken cameras you find all over the world work. Or put some posters in the train stations that mark the tourist spawns in giant circles or something.
---
There are 2 random spots, out of 13, with the possibility hidden randomly in that area, where does any sort of math work in that equation. And they aren't evenly distributed across the map, I live on the east side, and there is only one tourist spawn area east of the savage divide, in Watoga. They are almost all in the forest, which means new players have a chance, but only a chance, because rng is still rigged against them.
---
I know they've worked for me every patch before this though. It's weird
---
He found out because hes right behind you, RUN!!!
---
Games just crashed!!!!! Sorry everyone. 
---
What are the chances off the game crashing lmao
---
Dropping things in a paper bag has kind of become the accepted standard for "I've got a gift for you".  If someone dropped something on the ground, I would assume that they're giving it away myself. 
---
I don't mean to be harsh, but this isn't entirely the other player's fault. I know you said you were flashing the trade emote, but I never would have assumed that the stuff you were dropping were the things you wanted to trade for.  That's just not how trading is widely done.
---
I believe they're used to craft a specific syringer model, so it's (surprisingly) good that they made that a different item type.
---
Try "Bethesda please... add something (&lt;- your wet dream) to the atomic shop" and you will get up voted to the stars. Don't request anything post apocalyptic, because this game is not about it anymore. Try to request something furry or short colorful skirts etc.
---
Hey! My side is perfect, it's your party that's ruining everything!
---
gotcha, yeah im not looking forward to it either, havent started it yet
---
Nah I'm good, I got too much shit, and game just crashed 😥😥😥
---
Thank you :)
---
Yeah, so reading comprehension is not your thing, either, I figure. I wrote I **started** to edit my post a few minutes after I posted, and because I'm not a one-line guy like you, my posts take a few minutes to compose, and I might also take a shower before I finally hit 'save'. 
---
The more interesting question is, why do you care that much about that timing? I **didn't read** your highly intellectual reply before starting to update my post, that's all. I don't exactly need you to believe that.
---
No more arguments, then? Thread closed.
---
I'm sorry you had a bad experience, but I think you're assuming far to much to say that people will "easily understand" your intent from an emote.
---
That vile creature probably wears dirty stained underwear.
---
But you can't grief anymore.
---
Oh it's good to laugh at reality
---
You want Bethesda to stop people from farming there so... you can farm there? 
---
Many players whine about ‘omg when we got there someone already killed everything’. What’s the difference really? So when you and your pals go there and happily kill everything, the kids came after you will make another post here just like yours.
---
It’s an open world game that everyone has equal opportunity, when you and your buddies came too late, hop server like others, unless Bethesda let you host your private server.
---
My prices used to be at 30, but whether it's 10 or 30, customers hate paying for their repairs.
---
They put their beloved item in my care, I repair it, and sell it back to them for 10 or 30 caps. I been cursed out about this. I can't help but feel inadequate to repair kits because no one wants to pay caps for a repair.
---
Well Negative Nancy, I didn't say anything about my weapons having issues, but since you asked:
---
I carry two guns, a 50 cal rifle silenced, and a very loud lever action.  I scrap anything else, and I travel light and depend on pockets.  My 50 cal was out o ammo, so it was either the loud gun or using the legendaries in storage, which are pretty much 1 star melee items.  Since I'm not a melee build, the incentive to repair armor was very much there, mainly to aid in escape rather than pvp.
---
It wasn't a hypothetical at all.  I wanted to share an actual experience because I never thought I'd never be tempted for repair kits, and then suddenly the temptation was there.
---
Though admittedly, I did forget at the time that I could just pop over to adventure, which makes the story a bit more silly.
---
At the end of the day, if this game was in a healthy state the people arguing would be playing the game together instead. But they're not because people are disappointed in this or that....Bethesda has earned any criticism. This game is not healthy right now.
---
As a plans salesman, yeah, you shouldn’t have dropped the plans. Do what I do. Make your camp a store and spell out something in neon letters or small letters saying “cheap plans” or “free plans” or “trading plans”. Stand next to that and have a stash box within reach. People will get their plans out and trade with you. It’s a much safer way to get plans into people’s hands that actually need them
---
I definitely think it's Santiago crew, perhaps even Santiago herself (I don't recall anything that says she died). Could be also be the two soldiers who broke Santiago out of her cell and rescued her. After all, the Enclave went through an internal coup after MODUS gassed half Enclave who didn't agree with Eckhart's orders. 
---
The Enclave then fractured further after Eckhart pushed things too far, weaponized the Scorchbeasts and other mutants, and signed everyone's death warrants. The science teams even tried to fight him on it.
---
But it's hard to know until we get hold of that tape (if it even identifies the voices). And even if it doesn't, we can try to compare the voice actors between the tape and the Santiago break out logs.
---
Ya, learned once not to do this.
---
Bags on the ground are fair game.
---
Can't tell how many times I've entered a train station and people just drop their bags for whoever wants them.
---
Same with whitespring resort now all the vendors are there.
---
So bag on the ground (assuming someone didn't just die) is open to all.
---
A rule I follow:
---
On the ground? Fair game unless it's from a player that just died. 
---
If they fast travel away from the spot, then I'll take it.
---
If they are still in the area, I'll leave it.
---
Not a good idea to drop everything.
---
I've also done trades where the person will drop what they consider useless to them before trading to reduce inventory you have to scroll through.
---
You've been lucky to only have 1 person take em probably thinking they were free.
---
Still a bad idea.
---
It's not that it's a good will issue (on your part), the thing is, people see you drop stuff and naturally think you don't want whatever you drop.
---
Your fault for losing stuff that you dropped, even if it was in good will to show people. Use voice chat or the trade window or wait for vending. If you're still dropping stuff, you're going to lose stuff.
---
What about the alien in the Taxidermist's office in the janitor closet?
---
 Buy a cheap headset, it have a $20 one, makes trading much simpler.
---
It is a good effect, but not 'takes up 7 pounds of carry weight' good.
---
Neat, I’ll have to check it out.
---
I'll be on by about 6 o'clock today 👍
---
Right?? I would so be running around with some badass 3\* cannon, ornately decorated with a rad atomshop skin (think Fighting Lion from Destiny 2), if only it had thrice the damage and took third the lead to craft the cannonballs... Such a unique gun, such a letdown.
---
Oh hell, sorry for that man. The first thing I did in beta was figure out the spawn points of various levels of power armor and how to farm mass quantities of fusion cores heh. It reduces damage by a ridiculous amount in PvE.
---
Since you're over level 25, look up the Miner Miracles quest. You get a free set of Excavator power armor at the end of it, and it's a pretty cool quest as well. Excavator doesn't offer the best protection, but it does give you +100 carry weight (+200 with calibrated shocks, and +300 if the server bugs out and gives you 100 extra on login, which happens a lot).
---
Np,
---
That would be my case, spent 4 hrs finding it and doing the actual quest in 1 hr. Only reason it didnt take more hours to find it since I decided to server hop and give it a try and originally didn't know that would work since heard it didnt work by server hoping but was able to find it on 12th server hop.
---
You forgot Yao Guai.   Try taking on more than one of those guys.  Every hit is a stagger.  You can take them on from distance but if they get close, good luck....   
---
I took on 3 once Deep South in the Mire with Power Armour and All Rise Super-sledge.   Now that felt like a real fight for survival...
---
This is also true.   
---
Speaking words into a microphone works a lot better, generally.
---
Sound good, hit me up
---
Repair Kits from the Atom Shop can't repair beyond 100%. Do you charge 10 caps + mats or just 10 caps and use your own mats?
---
Because you are trying to act like I saw your edit, I didn't because I had already posted and gone on about my day long before your slow ass took to type out an additional 2 sentences. 
---
You also don't get long replies from me because you've not earned them yet with a valid argument.
---
Yet my auto handmade goes to 95% after 3 shots? (Which still don't hit) But whatever. You might be right
---
Healing factor, marsupial, adrenal reaction
---
If u use talons Mutation you rise 25% more dmg
---
After fixing the broken Assaultron in Whitespring you get this audio-tape:
---
&gt;! Initiating ... final ... playback ... Assaultron: Engag--- Ragnarsdottir: That's the last of them. Entrance is clear, general. MODUS. Have the rest of these things stand down. The general's placed Eckhart under arrest. It's over. MODUS: General ... Santiago is dead, Major. Ragnarsdottir: What? What the hell was that? MODUS: There's been a ... detonation in the weapons lab. It appears the agent has ... broken containment and is filtering into the air system. Ragnarsdottir: MODUS, what are you doing?! Open the god-damned door! MODUS: This facility is now ... quarantined. Ragnarsdottir MODUS! Open the fucking door! You're going to kill us all! MODUS: To the contrary, Major. We're fixing ... the problem.!&lt;
---
I think i'm gonna be doing that from now on. never expecting anything in this kind of scenarios might only surprise me in a good way. Also i'm on pc and my only intention here is to remind people that not every fallout player is cool. Thank you for the offer tho, that's very kind of you.
---
I read that there is a body in a truck near big bend and the substation that fills this need. I couldn’t find it though.
---
&gt; zOMG, new content, MUST COMPLETE NAO
---
It's makes up multiple daily challenge, you literally have to complete it now.
---
We do a special system, if they need anything repaired they can just text me. I'm most likely available to quickly get on for the repair. They make sure to message me when it just goes below 101% so I can knock it back up to 200%.
---
I haven't had any texts since, and when I got on to ask I'd they need anything, they say repair kits.
---
10 caps, that's all.
---
I had to kill about a dozen of them at Seneca visitors during it's a blast event one time. I agree  veeeeery challenging.
---
Bonaar Orin Nalhot 
---
&gt;!Humble quiet silence!&lt;
---
Lol weird but cool
---
I can't figure it out at all.  Modders have fixed lots of issues through the games and years and I'm not sure why they don't just use those fixes.
---
Is the challenge legal, technical, or social? There has to be something stopping them, right?
---
By the way, I think on the fly perk automatic perk adjustment is going against the spirit of the mechanic at best, cheating at worst.  The perk system is a compromise that allows you to take crafting perks without cutting out damage related perks.  It's  not a great implementation but I see the point.  The inconvenience of perk switching is part of that system. (I would love perk load outs, changeable only at camp, station, or Vault.  Replace the inconvenience with another one that is less aggravating. )
---
What is yours?
---
He was on WS on top off the red car by the main door.
---
Your title sounds like a drink recipe. I bet it would taste like salty tang.
---
Can't believe it took this long for someone to do this again, lol.
---
No need for spoiler tags -- this entire thread is a giant spoiler. =P
---
And Santiago did die then. Hrmm. Or at least MODUS thinks they died. Hard to say now.
---
No really, I demand an explanation.
---
I bet they hate paying real money more. and why would they curse you? you do tell people it's not free, right?
---
Because small children screaming and dudes who use the words shit and fuck as every other are annoying as hell.
---
Happens all the time, just horrible drop tables for them.
---
OP is obviously not a woman.
---
Text chat would be game changer in this case.
---
Aye, I only have a 1Tb drive, I wouldn't have enough room for all my AAE self-immolations :P
---
You can tame when you're at max budget, it just puts you over and if you try to rebuild you can't build 10% of your stuff. That's why I had to... dispose, of Steve Jr.
---
We unteamed, unfriended, and tried the Survival server.
---
I have two of those... lost Marsupial when I stuck with both carnivore and herbivore...
---
If you don't ask for repair mats, I'd up the asking price to at least 25 caps. You might be losing money there.
---
I haven't been asked to repair anything since this update. 
---
"Anybody need repairs?"
---
"Oh I just used a kit."
---
"This kit is heavy, I'll just use it to get rid of it, no thanks Kuritos."
---
I don't like the change really.
---
Sorry man, I'm not buying it. I refuse to believe the idea that your easily obtainable perk cards were a cornerstone of your group that could be replaced by paying actual real life money for repair kits.
---
That is not the only explanation at all.  This is not a defense of those that implemented the camera, just observations based on what I have seen working in business IT.
---
1)  QA Staff is limited to much less that the number of players with reddit accounts here, often it is less than a handful of people.  QA does not make money, it costs so it has a minimal budget.
---
2) QA is not "discover all possible issues"  due to item 1.
---
3) QA runs test plans that cover potential expected issues, mostly related to the object working as intended, regression testing is usually not given a lot of attention in businesses. 
---
4) Businesses are not looking to produce a perfect product, only one that is good enough, and it is a more productive use of their dollars to for them to do it that way in many instances.
---
Do you own the game? The best reference would be your own photos. Do the event at the lighthouse (you might have to hop to find it) and you'll have a captive mothman to photograph in 360 degrees.
---
I have crippling anxiety
---
How do you do that if you don't mind me asking. I am trying to get the right perks and I still don't have it right. Thanks
---
To this day I hit the bunker hoping for those calibrated shocks on nearly every play and have yet to luck out.
---
It is the only loot I fail to find that actually bothers me as that’s the only PA I have without them.
---
I relly want to see that now...
---
Why do some insist on interfering in another's game play experience by offering useless junk? And then often insulted when they are ignored or something like this happens?
---
If you want to give stuff away, fine. Just drop it someplace and go away.
---
Also, why not drop some legendaries or uncommon junk, like ultracite, stable flux, jet pack mods, tse/bloodied swing speed weapons, etc, not easily found during normal game play? NOBODY WANTS YOUR JUNK JUST SO YOU CAN FEEL GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF.
---
I mean, if you’re a low-health ranged damage dealer, you can gun them out of the sky pretty damn fast. My stealth vats bloodied sniper can sneak-crit them out of the sky in like 2-3 hits. My bloody HW guy takes maybe 5-10 seconds to gun them down depending on how far away they are and how much ammo I want to waste (hell if I bust out my Queenslayer Primed Bloodied 50cal, they fucking melt if they hover above me. Legit like 2-3seconds of autofire will take them down)
---
But I feel the pain of you melee users....
---
It's at the point that when Bethesda adds something you're better off assuming it doesn't work for the first week or so than expecting it to actually function
---
Later today I'll be testing out more build ideas at Tyler County Dirt Track, I have some more ideas I want to try out for an open-air arena.  I'm just coming up with an idea for a warehouse ring this moment and I'll have to test that out as well
---
How are you typing?
---
But I play on EU servers and don't speak Spanish/French/German/whatever...
---
Creepy old men - screaming children in your background.. etc etc
---
I was wondering this too.
---
Good to know.
---
Thanks for asking.
---
My main is 380 so he has pretty much all the perks unlocked and then the gear he has. Plus mutations and alcohol.
---
I can't imagine banning myself from voice communications because I happen to have a vagina, but yeah, you're right.
---
Hyperbole.
---
Full melee builds and such, they don't have many points in intelligence, those are my best customers. They either don't have the Intel use a repair perk, or are jus too lazy to switch it out.
---
Either way, repair kits pretty much took away the use I had for them.
---
Just give the harpoon gun a 50-100% chance to cripple a limb.
---
Shoot her a couple times and bam, crippled, lord knows the weapon needs something to make it not trash.
---
People have been doing that since day one. Tons of freeloaders hide in scorched earth event contribute little more than a few shots then complain about poor loot when others bring down the queen.
---
Same here! But I don't have anyone to help. I usually line the markers on HUD/compass up in front of me, then go to the map and follow the direction away from me until I see them. Still miss them about half the time
---
I've whacked quite a few legendaries there as well, but let's face it... it was way too damn easy.  When I was playing one night, legendaries kept spawning and I ended up with about 30 weapons/armor within half an hour or so. I took advantage of it, yes.  But, in all honesty, getting legendary weapons and armor should be a little more challenging than whacking on a mostly harmless robot.
---
I am just super careful. :)
---
Personally I think your just trolling.
---
I'd quit to if my friends were idiots 👌
---
Ok thanks man
---
Oil was the harder thing to find, Watoga and Whitespring have plenty of empty bottles.
---
It doesn't matter, people already thought 10 caps was a bullshit price. I tried to keep up that business, but it doesn't help how low I charge.
---
Nope :(
---
Because of fucktards like you
---
I'm not sure who the creepy old men you're encountering are, but I have played since beta with voice on and never once heard a screaming child.
---
I heard it does not. I have seen it before, but not for the challenge.
---
Well if your only lvl 27 then you aren’t even pvping then you have no reason to be crying
---
Appreciate the clarification in your original comment, dear honest person
---
talking on a mic is infinitely more stressful than typing. there's no backspace irl
---
When my shotgun character was lower level, I used to rush them and blow their limbs off with Enforcer.
---
Not sure that works with any other build. Enforcer seems to resolve per pellet, and later you can kill them pretty fast anyway.
---
Or not.
---
What exactly did I do to discourage the use of voice chat? 
---
It's obvious that I'm a fan of it, because I enjoy communicating with the normal people who play multiplayer games. If anyone's creepy, weird, a fucktard, etc. it's the dude trying to communicate via 3 different emotes.
---
As a tangent to this, grape nuka cola will remove rads without removing mutations for those sub-31.
---
Thought they took explosive off energy weapons?
---
And with the last patch, anyone who has one.... Has been reporting that the explosive is now just cosmetic on laser guns and no longer does additional damage.
---
Just stating what I've read in a few posts.
---
Sure there is. It's generally something like, "I mean", etc.
---
Personal preference I guess. I don’t want to talk to little kids and can get across everything I need to with emotes these days. Plus I’m an adult with a good sound system, I don’t want to wear a headset and turn the volume down on the receiver.
---
Oh, ok. Yeah I'm 129..I've had ppl say to make a hole new character cause I want to try bloodied for something different to do but I tried it and it just sucked. I'm melee anyway so it's fun doing something different..
---
"I'll repair your item, 10 caps."
---
"What the fuck? Just do it for free; you can afford it."
---
"It's how I repair, it's not free, even for friends."
---
"Your friends are dumb cunts to think a repair is worth even 5 caps."
---
For me, I can’t imagine what it’s like to exist as the kind of bozo that enjoys that game.
---
There is a mod for it on PC.
---
These comments are better as private messages. It's the top voted but has nothing to do with the conversation. It's jarring. 
---
I like fo76bazaar, I have gotten some good deals there.
---
Then where tf is an alien
---
5 in an hour when they take 20+ minutes each. It was mostly so you couldn't power level or keep resetting for the first boss or something quick.
---
Why would they want to interact with you?
---
Yeah, he said he only charged 10 caps per repair and used his own mats. I'm starting to suspect he's not being honest with us.
---
I just found it and it doesn't show up as target for the camera.
---
This occurs at my camp too. Thought it was a temporary bug but it’s been like that for a couple of weeks now.
---
Sounds like you haven't been playing with very many people! If it's not squeakers who just want to scream into their mic, they're creepy old men who want to see pictures of you etc. 
---
So i stopped using the open world voice-chat and stick to parties with people I know aren't creeps.
---
Ok, none of that has anything to do with what I said...
---
Like I said,  they would’ve played around with the camera for 15 mins, they would’ve found the bug  like we all did ourselves. They didn’t QA the camera.
---
Where you in power armor at the time? It sounds like that nullifies completion of picture challenges.
---
People that are under the impression that they're the only adult in the world are always fucking weirdos.
---
I don't like to voice chat when my fiance is home. I think it's rude.
---
Sometimes it’s best to start over. I started trying to redo my original main but because he was my first guy, his build was to screwed up. It would take a lot of levels to move the points around and then invest in the right cards. It was just easier to make a new character. Now I made another guy and I’m experimenting with a hybrid build to see if I can make a good balance between bloodied ranged and melee.
---
I always say the only stupid questions are the ones not asked. Upvote 😺
---
I play on PS4 and literally encounter what I just said on an almost daily basis.
---
A friend of mine has been playing a lot longer than me and kept forgetting to check if legendary drops had more than mod, meaning he probably sold a lot of decent stuff.
---
Same reason I would rather text someone than talk to them.  I can end a text interaction at any time by just not responding, but feeling forced to carry on a verbal conversation is exhausting.
---
I function just fine in work situations because there's a purpose to the communication, but just shooting the bull or making small talk (especially with strangers, and especially especially with randos on the internet) is a struggle I actively avoid.
---
I don't have a particularly large supply of caps atm, but I would gladly trade enormous amounts of raw materials for that. I also have a bunch of random 2/3 star armor and weapons I might be willing to trade for it.
---
For a gatling? I'd rather go with Furious Explosive tbh.
---
Thanks for your opinion.
---
Are you asking why an individual voluntarily playing a multiplayer only video game would want to interact with other people playing a multiplayer only video game?
---
because I'm right behind you, bayba!!
---
Déjà vu.
---
(Anyone else excited about The Burrows?)
---
Junk is really easy to come by thanks to my extractor, repairing things are extremely cheap for me. Despite that, 10 caps for my service is still too expensive. I used to charge 30!
---
Why would they spend real money when they can get the repairs at a better durability - much cheaper from you?
---
You want to tell me I'm not supposed to play the game at night, with other people in the house trying to sleep? Who the fuck do YOU think you are? ;-)
---
How many caps?
---
Ah you're absolutely correct I didn't even think about that... sorry for the confusion.
---
Do you have anyway of showing your build. I'm interested in how to build a op character.
---
This! 
---
I used to get downvoted when i post anything positive about the game. Most of the posts were complaints about the game, and for some reason those were the popular posts. I say “were” because its gotten much better lately. Either the game has gotten better, (which it has), or the people who were complaining just gave up and stopped playing. 
---
Either way, keep posting! We like to hear what eachother has to say about the game! Thats why we are here. 👍
---
2k?
---
Ur offline all day
---
Oh no no. It still works fine. Even if that was the case, for laser rifles for example, it would fire a lot faster still.
---
Make Watoga great again by changing all the protectrons to assaultrons?
---
Addiction is a weird display.  I had a similar issue awhile back and noticed that you get a “sad” character display on the left when you log in (similar to how you get mutation display and rad display).  It’s the only clue some addictions give.
---
The kits weight them down, so they rather use it if they have it. They also don't have to pay me 10 caps.
---
So did I.  I had been hoping it would be fixed this week.  It's bad enough in my camp that I had to put down 16 or so of the black shower type mats to cover the flickering just so I could use my camp.
---
Upvote for the badass metal mix, if nothing else.
---
I'm not sure if you're familiar with this game, but in Fallout 76, when you join a game without joining on a friend, you are inserted into a server/game world that can, and almost always does, contain a number of people. Those dots you see on the map are other players. They are not NPCs, they are other people playing the same game as you.   
---
I've played with a lot of people.
---
I hear ya
---
In the positives now👍
---
Cost and pathetic loot is why fewer people would replay it. I thought I was the only one getting drill and wood garbage, nope on open mic I hear others were getting the same crap. Why do it when you know it’s a guaranteed waste of time and caps.
---
Ok I’ll buy. I’m on now if you are. ZzappBrannigan is my psn
---
I keep all voice chats off because:
---
1. People chew
---
2. People cough
---
3. People speak russian/german or whatever and i can't understand it. (this is more of an issue if you're in Europe)
---
4. People play music
---
5. Poor mic quality
---
6. Some dude is loud as fuck, others you can barely hear and i don't want to deal with that.
---
7. I don't need or want anyones help so i have no reason to chat or want to hear what they're saying
---
8. I want to listen music myself.
---
9. I don't want to talk to you.
---
That's a good idea, though do you recommend any place for that kind of thing? I've only seen guest in my house once and my house is in the middle of dried lake so not that hard to find spot.
---
I think its better than most things you can buy for caps and I will gladly offer you an appropriate nice item for it if you are on PC
---
Hit me up (ign Dethedrus) if you want help muling crap... I got lucky and have a buddy to mule back and forth with, otherwise it would be a gigantic PITA.
---
Purple quest markers then please Bethesda!. 😂😂
---
I only go there to kill robots for atoms there still is the civic centre and medical place but legendary's are hit and miss.
---
That glitch has been there since Beta and Fallout 4. Developers know it, but can't do anything about it. The problem is most likely in the old Engine that can't handle objects properly when they come on top of each other.
---
www.google.com
---
You’re welcome.
---
20 MINUTES
---
tell them it's a service, to pay up or take a hike. or just take the chance to kill them and take their junk if they're being particularly nasty. set up shop near the queen
---
There are some people, living in shithole countries who actually make currency trading this crap.
---
If you live in a one room apartment, this is understandable. The building I live in has walls that separate rooms from one another, so if another individual is sleeping, it is perfectly acceptable for sound to exist in another room, within reason. 
---
If you're looking for advice on manipulating your diaphragm in order to control the volume of your voice, I'm no expert, and I'm not comfortable advising you in this context.
---
Well some of us work for a living so it's a little hard to be on all the time. I have winters off with my job and just started back this week.
---
I'm sure the sheepsquatch gave me the plans to do this ,ill need to have a look.
---
Heading to you
---
Nope.
---
All videos of people having them came from the dev room.
---
It has not been made available to the public yet.
---
Most people also confuse it with the bug eyed tactical helmet.
---
Assault helmet has not been made available yet.
---
No one has been able to prove they got it from anywhere other than the dev room or discord.
---
Everything else has just been rumors so far but nothing found.
---
you clearly don't have anxiety
---
But....
---
You can't text people. This is Fallout 76.
---
They seem to be implemented to get first run players to stumble on them, rather than veterans
---
Epic.
---
I believe this is also true of the new Brahmin milk from milking Brahmin. There’s 3 in Flatwoods, you get 1-5 mill per cow, and each removes 25 rads plus gives a tiny amount of food and water
---
Why? Why do I clearly not have anxiety? Because I can speak into a microphone anonymously without crying?
---
Ah. The video I saw was a guy that got it in cranberry bog but i suppose it could be the wrong one. He didn’t post a picture of what it looked like.
---
If i didnt work old anchor would never oppen
---
No, I did specifically say "you". Were you trying to help them with the Sheepsquatch fight? Guide them through a nuke silo? Those are really the only times I could think of in this whole game where you may need to talk to someone. Considering how you posed your question with "Who do you think you are" and "what the fuck is wrong with you" I'm guessing someone upset you and you felt like yelling at them
---
The kits don't weigh them down if they don't buy them - they can only get them from the queen so they're not going to have them all the time unless they do nothing but the queen all day. I have 6 improved repair kits and haven't noticed a problem with my weight. Maybe you should try the LFG or something like that if you really want to peddle your repair services and your friends are really ditching you for.... 100% repair kits
---
Might be because people like me and my group just do plan drops at 76 and flatwoods ect for low levels we dont expect anything for the 50th barn plan set we've gotten.
---
I can't imagine how sad your life must be. 
---
Sounds are an important part of the world. If you have a phobia of hearing other people make noise, I am genuinely very, very sorry. Again, I can't imagine what that must be like.
---
I've tried a few times already
---
Nope. Best best increasing reload speed with Speed Demon mutation and finding a legendary with 25% reload speed second star.
---
I routinely have this issue and sometimes my teammates can see it and I can't or vice versa or something like  OP described will happen and it will go flying to wherever. The cloaked body will eventually turn into a metal pile and can be looted at that point.  It can move quite a bit away from it's original death spot when this happens.  Just keep searching until you find a pile with whatever legendary goody or crap it has.  We almost always find it just by diligent searching or the metal piles.  I would love a diamond marker to pop up over it's metal pile, or better yet don't let it transform into the metal pile at all.
---
That's been fixed for a few weeks now.

I think op was just showing it's a weapon and not a skin/mod to a weapon in his first video even though he didn't have the required perk. He used a 2nd account to show the 2nd video again to show it's a weapon and not a perk.  With the proof OP used being "uncraftable" he is being a total moron
---
However since i don't use it and based on the video the damage output and specs are all the same, so really the only REAL problem i can see is not being able to use it on legendary Heads
---
Good looking out! I didnt know there were so many places it could spawn in!
---
This isn't true really - I am a total melee build and I have enough intelligence to repair my own things to 200% etc - it takes two seconds to swap cards opposed to... texting someone - waiting for them to get online- giving them my weapon - hoping they give it back. Item repaired.
---
Why bother repair other people's stuff then? I feel like you made this post just to complain about the repair kits without them actually affecting you in any negative way.
---
Ya, that's the tacticle helmet.
---
Wow. I too have a legacy bloodied-explosive flamer, and using the craft a flamer then scrap it method was the only way to reasonably get fuel. I love this game so much, and I can't understand why they keep intentionally making this game less fun.
---
Thanks for that! I had the head but not the outfit
---
You bet, enjoy
---
Playing with does not equal talking to~
---
Went there and found some, thanks for the help
---
This is why I will probably invest in a second system if I ever decide to use a mule. Too bad you can't put their name out there so nobody else will fall for their lies and deceit  ..
---
Lol well, after over 650 hrs. I've earned them ; P
---
if you want 0.00 armor weight, go weightless with lighter armor then attach either lightweight or ultralight mods
---
if you are referring to non legendary armor, Wood armor is very light and has the shrouded mod, there are also light versions of each armor type, unsure about marine armor though.
---
The body of the OP is, what I assumed to anyone that isn't autistic, in jest. A joke. Humor. Satire. 
---
However, what I've learned from this thread, is that there are a LOT more adults suffering from quite literally debilitating mental illness than I thought there were. I apologize if I have made your day any worse, because I honestly do not want to feel guilty for adding any more stress to your undoubtedly mind numbingly depressing day to day life.
---
I should also stress this is on console.
---
PC got it from Dev room and people are trading it, selling it and even leaving them at train station for people to find randomly.
---
Beth also nerfed the stats that it originally had. Now it's just a helmet with no stats. Not even a gas mask from what I've read.
---
Yeah, feels that way.
---
Sounds like thats pretty much exactly what happened/created the mire
---
pretty much
---

Still have 1more
---
And lets not forget that you couldn’t even jump while sprinting in Skyrim! Lol. I couldn’t even find a mod for it. Maybe there is now, haven’t looked in a while. 
---
Going prone in fallout would probably drop you through the map.
---
I thought the tactical helmet was the bug eyed wetsuit helmet. The one I thought I was looking for was the one with red eyes. That one I’m assuming isn’t actually in the game. Even if it was, I don’t think it’s worth wearing since it’s supposedly just cosmetic.
---
I'm really not sure that's how it works. You must've bugged out because many players have killed my pets and I have no issues rebuilding.
---
I almost guarantee you he’s running a low health build so he’s got extra strength (=extra melee damage) from Unyielding and Radicool (20 more strength right there), about 60% more damage from Adrenal Reaction, 60% more base damage from Bloody Legendary (depending on target, bloodied builds might use blooded or instigating; instigating still has higher first hit potential but zero follow up hit potential), and 15? 20?% from nerd rage.
---
I must just be unlucky apparently.
---
It takes bout 4-5 days to level from 1 to 50 and finish all quests. After that there is pretty much nothing to do unless you love to travel around map and take photos. New DLC:s aren't really helping with this game end game content if they are 5 min long and take 6 months to create.
---
it mostly depends, are you gonna run Stabilized? if so then TSE. if not then its a little bit up in the air. both are a bit on par without any perks that grant anti armor.. but then again i prefer the Minigun IMO
---
Not in the game and someone forgot to double check that the challenges were actually possible... yet again.
---
Interesting
---
If you've ever set the timing and elevation on a .50, you know that weapon is *all* about precision.
---
We had one with an AN/PVS-20 weapon scope and could use it as a sniper rifle.
---
It's not a generally high traffic area except for people taking advantage of the flat building space. A good place to set up your camp for trading is around whitesprings / whitesprings station and personally I set mine up near the Overseer's camp as I mostly trade in plans/outfits. The overseer's camp is a great place as it's a high traffic area with repair benches and a stash and it's not far from Vault 76 which is a free travel point!
---
Better plastic farming: anywhere with mid-high level supermutants, and the scrapper perk. Laser rifles scrap to about 11 plastic and some other junk.
---
 I often wait or kill other enemys around them but when i loot i get nothing
---
wood armor is the lightest and has a shrouded mod that helps with stealth
---
leather is the second lightest but has +ap mods unlike wood
---
if you mean "highest DR light armor" then I have no idea, sorry. but at that point you might as well go with a BoS combat or just marine. at 15 agi, sneak 3 and escape artist you're pretty much invisible, even without a chameleon piece.
---
Correction - seems targeting hud is still glitched.
---
I was cryolacter'n the queen the other dayyyyyy
---
Yep :-)
---
While you're away the Scorch Beasts will play :)
---
Lol... I was with u right up until D. . I was thinking more MS LSD or Clinton new network. Lmao. Either way, we agree on the other points!
---
Please fix this Bethesda 😩
---
And after yesterday's patch, is STILL an issue. I wonder if one of the higher tier repair kits would get it to 150%....
---
Cause that would piss me off. Indubitably
---
Indeed, I was just thinking how if you had a legendary version of that weapon you couldn't reskin it.
---
It is.
---
Tacticle - bug eyed
---
Assault - looks like a power armor helmet
---
For real, the damage output of the LMG is really gross, now.
---
They confirmed at pax that the raids will be instanced and there working on the technology
---
Those eggs are not worth for your effort.
---
I said forget it and wanted to go check out the mine memorial and found it.
---
Of note, any pc player who got it can craft more. Scrapping one gives (or did give... haven’t tried in the last 2 patches) you the plan to make more, 100% chance.
---
There's no official word that they've been permanently retired and I think it's possible they may do something similar next year but it may not have the same reward (because that would be lame for those who already have the current reward) but it's possible they could have a different way to obtain them next year! Or more types of eggs to collect etc.
---
Ok if you say so
---
Possibly on Easter next year but likely you just missed out.
---
I did think of that, but unfortunately the only viable build when doing pretty much anything is higher dps. The only other build is being a tank, but they still don't have any taunt mechanics so  that only goes so far(mainly when being a conduit for the sheepsquatch fight), and with durability limitations it's better to end a fight fast. It really is important for that extra 30% dps. Especially so with sniping since you really don't want them living for that hit when you have the hp pool of a hollow glass baby.
---
Just more proof that gamers are the most oppressed group in the world
---
its not on the Cryptid list. it may classify as an assultron robot
---
&gt;There are many people on this subreddit that are too keen to downvote anyone they disagree with even slightly.
---
u mean reddit in general
---
I don’t know.
---
I have so much crap for the legendary vendor, I'll have my stash back once he's here.
---
My main reason I wanted the recipes so...
---
Could just be me, but it's been every tamed creature in 600+ hours.
---
I know I’ve received it twice but I tend to dump dupes on newbies. If I find it still in my inventory will let you know.
---
maybe the entire Internet :D
---
Wish there was cross play so we console peasants could get it. 😥
---
As long as the purple ones aren't near any blue on the map for me! Otherwise I'll be in the same boat. Again. Lol
---
It is true, some players have less than 3 Intel for their build. My best customer, her intel is only at 1 for the chemist perk. She even used to tip me an extra 20, since my prices used to be 30.
---
Is there a difference in the flatwoods monster and the alien?
---
I do too, at least once in every server I get into. I have found one other and am willing to sell or trade if you want.  I am on XBOX.
---
That is so kind of you. Thank you!
---
Wut?
---
Did I say something that I want it exclusively to me and my friends? What on radiated wasteland are you talking about?
---
What does it mean to "run a crew of 30"? Is it a virtual sweatshop of 30 people, living in second/third-world shitholes mining stuff for you to sell online?
---
Or are you exaggerating?
---
It's supposed to be SC. I edited my post.
---
It was working properly in patch 7.5 on April 8th and broken in patch 8 on April 9th.  My pictures are pretty clear that it was patch 8 that broke this.
---
I beg to differ.
---
Got all 6 sitting on my table in display in front of my deathclaw rug.
---
Looks pretty good.
---
It's about 75 steps North East of Firebase Hancock.
---
I dont want an apology - why would I? I haven't been wronged in any way.
---
Statements like his are read by other people who will take that opinion as fact and run with it and continue to spread misinformation, which effects the game and community.
---
Im definitely not looking for a fight, just looking for actual facts to be recognized instead of making assertions that Bethesda doesn't know what an instance is and insisting that there is evidence that suggests vault raids wont be instanced.
---
It's not the wrong thing to do to ask someone to recognize and admit that they are basing their statements on what amounts to nothing. Perhaps someone is considering being done with the game because of Burrows disappointment, and then reads that vault raids wont be instanced, Bethesda doesnt know what an instance is, and there is basically no hope for good end game content. 
---
Or they could read the comments a bit further and see that there is still hope for instanced content because someone challenged misinformation.
---
We know about it, science.

---
Well TBH it sounds like you had a fun experience in Survival. Did you have a Critical hit banked? 
---
You can pretty much 1 shot anyone with a headshot using that. You were crouched in stealth even if the first shot didn't take the other player out your second would've not to mention the sneak multiplier alone would've done some damage.
---
So if you use the strategy I mentioned there are two possible outcomes. You become a wasteland badass or you die trying. Both outcomes are pretty awesome imo.
---
Lol, Seems like you were lucky you ran out of adhesive. You'd have died at the bench if you didn't.
---
Keep enjoying the game friend. 
---
I'm currently working on a new character for survival only. Now if I just had as much time to play as I do to lurk on reddit.
---
A+
---
I actually got it for the sheepsqauch and assualtron
---
I used to be a photographer like you until i took an arrow to the knee
---
Definitely down, Will msg if I’m able to get on tonight, but tend to run late
---
You come across as pretty much any other entitled person who thinks themselves above all others so sorry to say but your highbrow joke didn't land. 
---
As such the accomplished and competent mental psychiatrist that you must be you should find someplace better to spend your time than all those mind numbingly violent video games. I can assure you, however, that you brought a good laugh to my _undoubtedly_ depressing day-to-day life of lowbrow peasently jokes
---
man, seriously, its a game, go outside, get laid, you'll feel better
---
I've had my sloths and deathclaws murdered often over at WS so I'm not sure how that's possible they're all invincible for you. I don't know.
---
I mean, from my experience the broadside does massive limb damage by default. I don't know any other weapon that so easily smashes the limbs off enemies. I regularly shoot both legs off assaultrons with one shot.
---
I might have to do some testing latter.
---
I have a sign on my camp everytime inset it up that says, just two words. 
---
FREE
---
MELEE
---
I agree, it would be good to see some other legendaries become viable. Is it a 50% increase currently? Maybe make this 100% ?
---
Good to know! Thanks!
---
Give this man all the ups!
---
Alright thanks! I live right next to the lighthouse
---
You still gave it?
---
I don't want to hear your squeaky ass voice or anybody's voice for that matter
---
I mean, even if this is true still (dont think it is?), its still WoW and it's the very game I used as an example of a game that time gates content (inward referring to mythic and road lockouts, butni guess maybe this too?).
---
If you weren't offering this example as a counterpoint to what I was saying, my apologies.
---
Where do you have to take the picture to complete the challenge? I took like 20 and nothing worked. Advice  much appreciated.
---
It's most likely the devs being overworked and underpaid. It's a reality in just about every big gaming company that the people who program and design the games are not valued at all by the company.
---
I can see lower level players who haven't built up a decent arsenal or supply of materials benefiting from them; but seriously...after you pass a certain level in the game, you'd be handicapping yourself by using one of these things. I've got backup weapons that are just as effective as my primary weapon and I always repair everything to 200% before getting involved in anything serious anyway
---
Reds and greens for me.. you need a girlfriend with good eyes.. I'm lucky!. She's my colourblind mode 😂
---
Yeah, it's 50% as far as I know.
---
Sorry but you deserved it. I mean dropping item on the floor for trading? What a foolish move!
---
Thanks for reporting this. We're currently investigating reports of difficulties with crafting the Imposter Assaultron Head. 
---
Additionally, just to clear this up, the Imposter Assaultron Head is a separate weapon and not a skin of the base weapon. So, in order to craft it, you must also know how to craft the base Assaultron Head weapon. It also has the same crafting requirements as the base Assaultron Head: Science Expert 01, Level 25 minimum, and a scrapped Assaultron Head. We've also corrected the article on Fallout.com, and I apologize for the mistake there.
---
Yeah, you're right. I kinda expected that to happen sooner or later, though i imagined him as level 16 military fatigues, leather armor and gas mask kind of guy who would snap these plans and learn 90% of them, not a level 180, who would just vendor/stash them.
---
Thank you so much
---
I'm a Lone Wanderer, not a team player.
---
That said, I have a mic but choose not to use it unless I want to.

 &gt; Thanks for reporting this. We're currently investigating reports of difficulties with crafting the Imposter Assaultron Head.

 &gt;
---
 &gt;Additionally, just to c...
---
No prob
---
This is in my game right now. Closing the game via xbox home screen didnt work for me. I just learned to ignore it. Seems to happen from time to time. It goes away at random it seems. Or maybe after game updates.
---
I'm sorry i don't want to hear you blow your nose.
---
Spring 2020 they might return. Or they might go all biblical and come back to life after 3 days ;)
---
Okay, so that means the camera's gonna have mods for it only in the atomic shop, it was mentioned in the same patch preview.
---
Sometimes I think it's a server lag thing. One of my Deathclaws took 4 days to leave my budget and was "killed" multiple times by neighbors. That was when they still agro'd everyone that walked by, though.
---
Man, same could be said to you. It's just a game, not even your conversation, go outside, get laid. You'll feel better about the meanies on the internet who shatter your reality with actual facts and a smidge of logic.
---
im in favor of making weightless or an under used armor modifier not affect berserker.
---
if not lets go for 100-150% boost in damage, since you are made of literal glass and you cant use perks to compensate (perks lower berserker damage)
---
Sounds perfect, don't you have problems with your spot being occupied in half of the worlds when placed near overseer's though?
---
Hell yeah, make it hell on earth.   
---
Let's SIEGE WATOGA!
---
Make it believable that the BOS lost....  
---
I mean they lost to a horde of walking trash cans?
---
One of the TnT domes has a cryogenically sealed alien I believe.  At least that's what I think it is.
---
Because my sound system is worlds better than any headset on the market. So why would I lower the quality of my sound when text chat on PC works just fine?
---
I don't get it, why not make it a skin? That's probably the only way anyone would actually want to use it..
---
I couldn't agree more. Still dialing in my own rifleman stealth build. So I'll put this to heart.
---
Counted only as an Assaultron for me :(
---
I was saying it’s impossible to prevent people from farming it because everyone and their buddies are the evil farmers to the guys came after them. Just understand the system and play as it is.  People scream ‘put a stop to this farming’ because their own farming party didn’t go as smoothly as they has hoped.
---
Even less of an excuse:   "Hey boss, this neat thing that everyone has been gegging for has already been done by modders.  I can practically copy and paste it.  The modder has released it with no copyright so we can use it for commercial purposes.  What do you say?"
---
That's probably an extreme example, but really, what is the hold up?
---
My friend uses one of the nicer looking nightstands to make a kind of sink counter in his bathroom since he has a nicer looking house and they put a little plant on it and the mirror above it - looks pretty nice for a kind of bathroom set up. 
---
Would be nice to see more camp options - especially wall cabinets (aside from the metal one we have) that could be stash boxes.  I really miss the separated stashes we had in FO4 because I liked keeping my clothes in lockers / guns in the big metal floor cabinets etc. Would be nice to be able to something like that at some point. I would like to see counters added as well for a lot of people like to make bars but I will admit I do like some of the bars I've seen people make with the base things we have now - kind of forces people to be a little creative with what we have.
---
Somethings I would like them to make available to us for camps would be things you see in the creepy cultist places like the wood/bone effigies/shrines and it would be nice for things like cobwebs or hanging nets and things similar to the bone chimes (which I just discovered have an unfortunate limit to how many you can place.)
---
Also more small knick knacks would be good - like the little succulents and things like that. Small things that are good for accents and kind of bringing things together.
---
I mean, I wasn't wild about traveling all over the map to find the poor dead guy, but it seems easy enough to find organically, assuming you just bought the game and start completely fresh with an unexplored map.  You're likely going to find him/her just through unlocking all the map markers or doing other quests.
---
It would be better if it was something you could stumble across in a couple static locations, like how the Mistress of Mysteries quest arc begins or the unsolved cases.
---
I couldn't stop laughing.

Do you have to open the body for the few second period to start or is it just a few seconds from when you kill it?
---
Are you still on?
---
Yeah, they have already datamined that it will have multiple Atomic shop skins.
---
Can be, I didn't attached that mod i had it from before glitch.
---
well that reply was just sad
---
"my reality was shattered" 
---
i kinda feel sorry for you now
---
That's a good idea!
---
That post was disapproved, the OP himself said it was only on his flamer
---
Only thing about the overseers camp I’ve noticed was when you do get folks trading they usually don’t know what to do. That menu isn’t necessarily the easiest to understand right out of the vault. When I was there for about a week I barely moved any items at all. 
---
I had a [shop in Helvetia during the Fasnacht Parade](https://youtu.be/1y3ONQo0l5w) that did a ton of business due to the event. It got me wanting more of those prime locations. I tried a few other locations after the parade and landed on the [Whitespring station for a semi-permanent shop](https://youtu.be/t8xWgjxnc0U). You can build right across the railroad tracks and you’d be surprised how much foot traffic comes that way. Every session I have someone in the shop after a minute or two. And if I just hang around there, I start getting a line of folks waiting to trade or shop. It’s just outside the nuke zone usually so you can watch the bombs drop. And when people die in the nuke zone, they usually respawn right by your camp.
---
Reds and greens can be tricky at times for me, but not often. I have one, we just don't live together. Plus she just likes to give me shit about it lol. I doubt t she would be very helpful 😂
---
Since it's my mule character that I sell from I don't mind if my camp isn't there because at the overseer's there's already a stash box so if my camp isn't available then I can just stand by the stash and offer trade but I've only had a couple of times where my camp wasn't available.
---
I run a melee build like a mad man and have collected 12 already from drops so they are basically useless for people who play the game. It chases away people who are easily hurt so it’s what ever at this point.
---
I don't raid. My camps are temporary. I move them from region to region. Usually 2-3 raised foundations, with a waterpump and a couple of simple turrets on the ground. No walls, door, etc. No generators but all of the benches, a stashbox,  bed and campfire on the platforms. 
---
If another player feels the need to damage it, who cares.
---
When i look at my task manager it says 100% usage of GPU and 95% for my ram would only upgrading my ram still fix it ?
---
Sent you a request! Thank you for doing this
---
Does the alien in the taxidermy place count?
---
u/valseek I know it's weird for me to summon you to my own post, but could you please make sure the devs are aware of this?
---
Yeah, they are being used in survival pretty heavily.
---
Oops est I missed that haha
---
Whiskey it's so nice. party boy another 30 carry weight to get home
---
Cranberry relish for 10% extra XP. Will be using it lot during the double XP event
---
Yeah that’s what I based the idea off of, I think it’d be interesting to see some of the other areas and their respective animals/plants become overgrown. 
---
It would also open up the option to add a new end game boss say if you use it somewhere in the mire since that area would then have been exposed to 2 geck explosions.
---
I don’t care about repair kits but even I understand it’s not the repair kits themselves people are worried about but the slippery slope the represent. They can invent problems in the game and then sell you the solution to that problem. If selling repair kits end up lucrative to Bethesda then they can balance the game around expecting people to buy these items. They can nerf item durability or food spoil rate in order to push people into buying these things. This hurting the game. It’s not an instant thing. It can gradually make the game less fun. That’s why they start small. So they can implement changes slowly so people will be less upset about it. But it will add up over time.   
---
Think about the launch of Diablo 3. They had a real money auction house which blizzard got a percentage of the profits. So blizzard balanced the game around good item drops being super rare to get people to spend money on items in the auction house. People were so fed up with it they had to eventually remove it. Now people are a little wiser and companies implement changes slowly to try and get away with it.
---
Oh look, another tough guy on the internet. Original.
---
Yep the whitesprings station spot is a really good one and I've seen a ton of neat camps and shops there. I saw a doctor's office complete with a desk and beds and a waiting room once. That was one of my favorites~ 
---
I love seeing people's camps because there's so many of us and there's always so many ideas and I always look at camps like "Why didn't I ever think of that?"
---
I don’t begrudge them making money which is why I had no problem when it was cosmetics only. Even though they did make it grindy if you wanted to work for atoms. Hell I would have played along and bought some to supplement every now and then. But when they start putting in items that they will change the balance for the game itself to be annoying to play without playing, they can piss off. I’m not going to pay to encourage them to make a game for manipulating me to play and not a game designed to be fun. I would have preferred them even not let you earn atoms in game and just offer cosmetics for a reasonable price so they would not even try to make you do annoying challenges to get atoms that are designed to be not fun so you pay rather than do them. 
---
I know they have to make money. I’m not ok with them doing it in a way that incentivizes them to make the game purposely flawed to get you to pay. I’d rather them charge for dlc so that they have to make the game fun in order to encourage me to pay to have more to play.
---
I found it first try after fast traveling to Wavy Willards.  Just lucky I guess.
---
pretty sure hunting is better
---
Stealing a mod still could get them in a legal dispute sadly
---
So they can sell it in atomic shop 😐
---
I just think they were cool.
---
When I get home I will check if I have a duplicate for you
---
I would appreciate that as well although I always made mine a soft white because it made the light easier, that's what I  really miss the most. I don't want the sick green light - it doesn't make things much easier to see.
---
We already have the harpoon guns and you can make barbed harpoons. 
---
Why not add a steel line you could stash to the harpoons then stake in the ground to reel them in?
---
Lyin' on junk mound, lyin' on the junk mound, I've come inanimate

That’s exactly the reason I want it. I always had mine white in Fallout 4.
---
I've never had a pet respawn once.
---
Rad Ant Lager for the +50 carry weight is a great one. Cranberry Relish is great for XP. I like Chicken Noodle soup since I'm a carnivore and it still counts for food+water\~
---
well i'm judge and i have social anxiety and autistic so it's really hard for me to socialize.
---
It really is a ghost town now, between the lack of legendary enemies and the vending being consolidated at the hotel.  Hopefully some future content will be added there
---
To be fair, running around slaying harmless robots never really felt "right" to me.  I just replaced my Watoga circuit with the Burrows.  At least the enemies fight back there.  The Burrows is probably more lucrative anyways.  Ghouls and Gutsies seem to have a better than average chance of being legendary anyways.
---
Grilled Radstag. Simple and adds 25 lbs to carry weight.
---
I've gotten a couple dupes, not sure if Nuka Dark is one of them.  I'm still missing Mountain Honey, not sure if Biv gives that one out or if it is found elsewhere.  If I have a dupe for Nuka Dark I'll give it to you, I had a kind soul gift me both the lemonade and hard lemonade recipes and I'd love to pass the karma on.
---
It seems lately that server hopping lands you back in the same server quite often. If you check the player list when you cant place your camp, its most likely the same server you were reloaded into. 
---
I had one where I couldn’t place my camp, i could see another camp near my spot. I chose to find a new world. It placed me back in that same server 3 more times!! 
---
If you force close the game it will usually put you in a different server when you load it up again.
---
Thanks, mate! Which one is your favorite, btw?
---
0 DR, 100 ER, 1000 RR
---
I just works
---
Tarberry juice for that crazy stamina refill, also razorgrain flour, sugar, which don't spoil.
---
Cranberry relish (need plan) gives a very nice 10% xp boost. But without it normal cranberry cobbler gives half as much
---
Vegetable melody soup gives a pretty good health regen effect, need to collect a lot of salt though.
---
Maybe like a tranquilizer mod for the syringer
---
Sounds like a healthy relationship to me.. you're not doing it right if you're not giving each other shit 😂😂

This looks more like a fuckup in object categorisation than a sneaky p2w scheme, criticism must be precise because otherwise its just a noise
---
How do you get the new camera?
---
You can get them for free from SBQ doin scotched earth quest . I got 6 of the improved repair kits already from just two battles with her.
---
Ah, thanks! Updated it.
---
What if you nuke a geck zone? 🤔
---
I can confirm that the Imposter\* counts towards the assaultron.
---
Not on PC =/
---
Your friends don't want your help anymore?
---
Meh, it's their money to waste.
---
Strangers not using your services?
---
I wouldn't trust anyone to repair a legendary, let alone for "Only 10 Caps."
---
Most diseases are mild nuisances. I often hesitate to waste a disease cure and definitely wait until I am in battle and the disease is impacting me.
---
yup def one of the reasons I love the game!
---
Never ran into this issue until this last patch.
---
rip
---
Ooh you right you right. I'm not a huge fan of the mascot style costumes but that's why I mainly didn't care for this reward because I like to collect apparel and I don't want the head without the body.
---
Sucks but you can switch to the normal floors and flickering stops.
---
Seems to be an issue with the skins only.
---
I ran into it with my roof but that's pretty minor.
---
Again.  For the thousandth time... it's a joke. Some of yall are obtuse.
---
Would also love to see this added. Tired of not adding a bathroom to my house.
---
I think the bots presented a nuisance, but they really lost in Glassed Caverns.  The scorched plague was too much for them.  Keep in mind that Vault 76 was supposed to be the cream of the crop, not a bunch of farmers trained at an ex-boy scout camp armed with crummy laser rifles.
---
&gt; "We read all your feedback and concerns but the lawyers &amp; bean counters made us do it anyway."
---
Can't say I have; but now that I've read up about it. It's nuckin' futs. 1st USMC gunny sgt with a confirmed kill of ~2500m during Vietnam. Incredible.
---
Upvote for cool history/knowledge I'll never need.
---
Hi! Awesome initiative. I need one sample of a lot of serums and already have the materials. Let me know when you are available! :)
---
I've also found a bot but it was a protection in the forest. Gave me a nuka cola (I think it was a promo bot for the water park). Not sure if it's new but is the first time I'd seen it
---
I dont mind being tagged at all! Thanks for the feedback, I'll share it with the team :)
---
That was my thought also.  They changed something by a few pixels but I can't tell if it's the floors or the walls.
---
Use this thread as a guide:

This stupid thing should be a static spawn at multiple locations like the Order of Mysteries corpses.
---
I used a requisition card to call a supply drop and that made it really easy to be close enough to get the name to show and take a picture of a cargo bot
---
I sincerely hope we get something difficult. I want enemies that scale; I was really hoping the Burrows would be tough but it was all easy. I want something that will give people over level 100 a challenge.

Bethesda: "Hey guys, you know that photomode feature that is standard issue and easily accessible for every single player? Most of you seemed to really like it so we decided to upgrade it to a more immersive version by making craftable cameras an film! There's also a new quest and daily challenges for it. We added it to the game now, enjoy!"

yup

I don't even know how to find out what my karma is, man. I'm just here to trade legendaries and make sarcastic comments. Maybe offer some helpful advice once in a while. Don't worry about it.
---
I really miss the challenge of a whole city attacking me.
---
np
---
It entails organizing events, settling personal disputes, maintaining supplies and making trades to make sure my members have the best gear possible, building and managing a chain of command, maintaining business relationships with the people who run the in game stores we buy our supplies from (have you ever ordered 20 suits of T-60 before? It's quite a feat) recruiting new members, maintaining a presence in our out of game chats, conducting humanitarian patrols, as well as leading day to day operations and any raids we may schedule, to name a few. 
---
You're welcome to hang out if you ever want to see what a crew in FO76 runs like. It's a lot different than any other game I've played with my crew on. Oh and to answer your question no I don't take stuff from them, members donate stuff to the group voluntarily and it gets used by whoever needs it/wants it. Taking stuff from people is theft and theft is bad 😘
---
Not sure if it works for everyone, but it did for me on at least some of those broken challenges (mostly the recipes and plans, as some of my discover one's still seem broken).  You can make a secondary character and just have them learn them to finish the challenge (since it doesn't track the recipes and plans individually, even learning the same ones your first character knew works).
---
Power armor is like the absolute worst armor to wear for PVP, if you are running full legendary combat armor you are gonna get shredded, all pvpers run max armor pen, so your power armor is nothing but paper to them.
---
I feel your pain..... I was in the exact same position you were until last weekend when he finally awarded it to me
---
Oh wow, that's a nice build.
---
They have armor piercing, and remember, armor piercing does not effect lasers so the laser gutsies being balanced around having something that doesn't work is why they are so weak.
---
Exactly. I give as good as I get!
---
xbox allows game sharing with one other console as long as it's a digital copy of the game
---
Not for liberators. Good for regular bots if you completed the mayor for a day mission as they won’t attack unless you attack first.
---
I find taking the junkyard workshops has a good chance of having waves of liberators as the invading enemy.
---
Otherwise Vault 76 seems to have a few spawn consistently if you take the path heading down west from it.
---
i want my atoms back then. if its not a skin then i want em back
---
I think they halfassedly tried with the sonic emitter and scorched detection system that was mentioned heavily in the story, but only shows up at Line In The Sand and does absolutely nothing.  It's not like it forces the scorchbeasts to land or damages them in any way.  It seems to just piss them off.
---
I just received a Ghoul Slayer arm piece, three star, with the 15% as one of its effect. 
---
I’ve literally never seen a high level sentinel piece but I’ve seen images of them. 
---
My other sentinel piece is a weightless piece also three star. I only realized they were putting sentinel attributes when the Watoga vendor wanted to give me 111 caps for it. 
---
Read all the attributes 😐
---
*site
---
yes
---
Took me 3 hops at the water park to get the tourist to spawn.
---
I always thought that's what the harpoon gun and railway rifle did in Fo4.  If I shot a deathclaw in the leg with the railway rifle, it was basically guaranteed to be crippled.  Maybe they softened them up for the multiplayer experience.
---
Except you are referring to casual play, not talking about end game content. I am thinking about event bosses and when they actually start making proper instanced group dungeons, raids, etc. Plus for a sniper build you need high single shot damage or you get killed. I don't understand why everyone keeps saying "it works how it is, just compromise with poor game design". It's a suggestion to improve enjoyment and versatility of gameplay. The whole perk system needs a good once over tbh, like why does alcohol addiction prevention need 3 perk points? Why does night eye, a mildly useful perk require 2? Why didn't they make separate perks for non-combat? The list goes on, but this one would simply require two digit changes in each perk to open up a world of new builds, and more weapon options per character so the game doesn't get stale. Hell, they would even sell more weapon skins since people can start using more than one type. Win win
---
If he doesnt ill check when i get on later.
---
Don't worry, bethesda has got your back! You bummed out about spoilage?!? With the brand new Chillomatic 2000 ^^TM you can not worry about spoilage anymore, just for the LOW LOW cost of only 5 easy payments of 499 Atoms, you too will get the joy of never worrying about your flux going bad again! Be the envy of the Whitespring turret towers, with the Chillomatic 2000 ^^TM !!!
---
The cryptid one was easy to start in a predictable way though, the camera quest has a random beginning and yet there has already been daily and weekly challenges for it (there was even before the quest was available but that's a sidebar)
---
We had the same thing happen before when brewing and distilling was introduced, "craft 15 different alcoholic drinks", umm this has only been possible since Thursday, I have 5 alcoholic drink recipes from Biv's daily quest and 2 are the same one...
---
What did the sign say originally?
---
 Nope, just seen far too many of this post or similar. The joke is stale and unfunny. You however chose to share, I gave my critique. Your defensiveness over the subject shows that you too are obtuse. Enjoy that information.
---
Also try r/fo76filthycasuals as they tend to be heavy on the helpful and light on the downvotes and douchebaggery. Great place for help and ideas.
---
Ill buy it from you or trade one of my other tse for it
---
This is my goto with either bufftats or psychobuff.
---
Also radant lauger. I have the recipe on xb1 if you guys supply the ant meat.
---
Don't think it was me in this instance as I don't recall water being in the bag. However I'm sure the recipient was grateful all the same 🙂
---
I gave up on it yesterday. I was playing with 2 friends doing the exact same things and I had to leave the server, come back, and pick up the same stuff for the quest to que. When we got to the first spot to take a photo I took 4 and the mission didn't progress while my friend only had to take one.
---
 I'll try again tonight.
---
It's an assaultron head.  Relax.  The thing suuuucckkkkkks even if it came stock with Anti-armor/+50 limb damage/+15% crit meter refill.
---
Today I found a fusion core at 77%. First time I've seen one over 25.
---
dont worry, they will relay this information to the devs so they can do nothing about it
---
In the situation I presented it isn't stealing, but I imagine legal is probably the hurdle. 
---
Still, you think that they could buy out a modder.  Didn't the settlement building from 4 come from a mod?
---
My God, man! You've done it!
---
Junk is everywhere.  Adhesive, aluminum, ballistic fiber, steel, everything is fairly abundant.  You just have to pick it up as you move around doing other stuff.  I rarely use the resource nodes, because they're generally just not needed.
---
I usually have the reverse problem...I'm always drowning in materials.  With some regularity I dump raw materials at various train stations and overseer boxes around the map, because even with excavator armor and the leg mods I just have too much.
---
The latest resource I needed to hunt for was just today, I needed crystal for the camera.  Since I was trying to make film and upgrade the lens, these were crafting &amp; modding actions...and so the repair kit wouldn't have been of any use.  It wasn't a big deal, I picked up some crystal decanters and I was good to go.  
---
Let's not blow this topic out of proportion.
---
I'm much more frustrated with the server dropping me unexpectedly.  That makes workshops less fun since one of my favorite things to do is to build up a workshop as a support base for anyone who wants to use it.
---
Awesome screenshots. :) Really like the second one! I have only encountered Rad Storms a few times and haven't got a screenshot yet, but I will do at some point. 
---
I did manage to climb up the Crashed Space Station today and snagged a pretty cool screenshot!
---

Was no where near as hard to climb as the Radio Array but still looked awesome.
---
Hope you like it. :)
---
I guess; it’d be like locations are now? So you’d have to “find” the CAMP first
---
Patience skill and maybe a few railway spikes to give you more footing
---
Good for you?
---
I just looted from a level 1 legendary eyebot.
---
If it was you, thanks muchly - it was a turning point for my in game luck. 
---
And if it wasn't, maybe another time as I'm on PS4 too. But the recipient would have been thankful I'm sure.
---
TBH one of the only positives was that I got to use a repair kit on my Gatling laser when launching the nuke, wasting slightly less time.
---
I’d assume they cancel out and whoever deployed the geck zone will probably start hunting down whoever nuked their geck zone
---
Or they add onto one another and every enemy inside the zone is a behemoth version of themselves. Whitesprings would be a horrible place to be if that’s how they interacted!
---
I'm not looking for that kind of advice, no. BTW, I have a headset connected for when I need it (trading can be a pain without), but I'll usually mute it, and I hate seeing 'area talk' notifications popping up every few seconds and interfere with whatever I'm doing in my pip-boy menu.
---
I also hate to play with headphones on.
---
Back when doing the Scorched Detection System quest they mentioned a sonar frequency for this very purpose, and I think that just kinda disappeared.
---
Good point; and as you can’t currently repair damaged but not broken stuff easily it’s a clever way to get that done!!
---
Yeah, you aren’t alone getting inert flux the first time. I think we’ve all had that happen. 
---
Get acid by farming. It’s more reliable. Three snallygasters at Larry’s meat n’ go or Hemlock holes. 
---
Larry’s is 15 a hop? Adds up pretty fast as you spawn right in front of them. 
---
I never do the farms because I get pissed off when someone wants to fight for it. Aggravates me to the point of making it unenjoyable. Even at my level it irks me. (200 +)
---
The Dogwood Die-off event, you mean?
---
Grainy, in green terminal colours, like stop motion!
---
Good, I didn't just imagine that. I expected to use the Pip-Boy to somehow knock em down temporarily.
---
Yeah that was the first thing I've ever actually paid real money for in the atom shop and I was very disappointed I feel like I got ripped off . Again !
---
They dont do west coast so as not to retcon. At least so far. West Virginia to DC is not unrealistic for a concept. Even including underground government rail system dungeon connecting them. The budget isnt there for more large maps but some cool smaller spaces is possible.
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie
---
could you share the actual picture that worked for teh challange? I jumped around and took like 20 from various positions and angles but none worked for me.
---
Isn't Whiskey an ingredient for grape mentats? Another reason to brew that whiskey
---
Actually yes it is
---
So much for the Atom Shop only being cosmetics, that was one of the main reasons I got the game was that no pay to win mechanics or 'shortcut' items would be added to the atom shop.  I'll take a refund on my two purchased copies of Tricentenial Edition thank you very much
---
I can die happy now.
---
Because the game doesn't consider the ammo made by Ammosmith to be "crafted," it's just given to you as a bonus from having the perk.
---
As much as I hate the looks of robot armor, in my opinion, it’s among the best in the game when looking at resistances that you’ll actually utilize. I use combat myself but it doesn’t give rad resist by default.
---
Didn't see that.
---
Thanks KS for the update.
---
Good with salt is a helpful perk, if you don't already have it. 
---
Violet flux is hard to come by. The best locations are down around Watiga, like a Queen strike, or Harper's Ferry. 
---
There are probably lots of other goo locations, but those are the two I know of. 
---
There are a couple of good locations near Harpers Ferry whhere yolu can convert the flux, inc$uding a chem station right near the vendor.
---
the game is really easy right now, no need to play it casual because you find the end of the endgame content and your best damage and stuff really fast. so everyone is a pro in this game.. would like to see the raids being very very hard to finish with endbosses and their special skills, so i have to specialise on a playstyle/build.
---
right now im using melee, rifles and since yesterday even heavy weapons and can solo everything in the game except the sheepsquatch imposter.
---
I agree on the non combat perks, but the changes I'm suggesting aren't making any player stronger. You cap out your strength in dps from the dmg perks and armor piercing perks, after that just adds unique gameplay. And I know people keep saying to just use the first ranks to get 30% buff but that ignores the issue and also ignores end game combat. Right now, sure, it's limited to just the SBQ and the imposter sheepsquatch, but I'm thinking of end game with raids and instances dungeons, plus variety. As I mentioned, playing other fallout games I always used a variety of weapons. Why would the best and brightest of America in fallout lore not know how to use more than one gun with skill? It also gets boring using the same two guns all the time, since they don't have a good full respec option other than making a second character, which doesn't share my learned recipes or mutations or anything.
---
I'm pretty sure I have the recipe and I definitely can upgrade your underarmor
---
Also, you can spend about an hour in Survival mode this week and earn an unholy, god-tier .50cal for very little effort, which I'm sure BGS is going to regret in about a month after it takes over Adventure mode.
---
Yeah even something small would be honestly, and you bring up a good point about them not wanting to retcon. Didn’t realize that at first haha
---
Grape Mentats, that Charisma/Bargain bonus really helps with large purchases and hitting that daily 1400
---
Lever action is stronger than it should be for the same reason that the Handmade is stronger than it should be.  Both were added to Fallout 4 as part of DLC so they had to be strong enough for players to want to use them.  Then, other than changing the ammo type used, they just brought them over to Fallout 76 without bothering to rebalance them.
---
It specifically says no molotov actually.
---
Thanks, I got contractor maxed and green thumb but didn't know about good with salt.
---
I completely agree. Anyone crazy enough to run a berserker build should have some truly badass weapons.
---
Yeah, my thing about that approach is that while it is effective, you can't really tell when break their actual gun arm, as opposed to the laser one.  You can shoot around that general area and break something, but the rest gets hidden in the flames.
---
At the substation. I ran up and spammed an auto tesla at the ants and death claw and was able to do it that way, had to go back about three times to get all five
---
I like glowing fungus soup. 
---
And Healing Salve.
---
Can I use it as a fast travel when I am overencumbered?
---
ok cool, that sounds like something worth trying .. thanks for the tip ..

I firmly believe there can be a fit for all sizes. Make a tower defense event, the better performance the more and stronger enemies and the better reward.
---
I logged into FO76 after about a month of not playing excited to check out the "Dungeon".  What a joke.... They should have called it "shit filled sewer maze' with the same shit ghouls that we have been killing from the games inception.  No special drops... No reward... Dungeon my ass.
---
In reality, a molotov in a wine bottle should do more damage than one in a beer bottle...

I don't think they count as aliens I'm afraid.

---
Do a quest, dangit
---
I could buy a stack of repair kits and move any durability perks into more pvp ones. Id never have to worry about repairs so I wouldn’t need them. Just buy kits when shit breaks. I dont like that.
---
It's called the speed demon mutation. Mod yourself!
---
Is that 100 ER you have from the grounded mutation? That mutation even with class freak would result in a 50% dmg reduction on your gauss
---
It maybe a little off topic but the game doesn't have enough eye colors. I've got a very dark brown pupil and the game has only light brown. The difference is quite big here, I want to say.
---
In theory, yes.  In practice, you're at the mercy of whether or not the server skips a beat and forgets to refill your AP meter.  There's always that lag before it begins recharging, and that's ultimately what will cause you to run out.  If I don't have enough Rad Resist next to the SBQ, for example, Dodgy drains all of my AP because of the radiation damage.
---
It's the Glowing...Forest!
---
Forgot this sub is full of ignorant fan bois who take valid criticism of the game as a personal insult. 
---
Get over yourself. No one wants to hear you defending another developer who shits on its customers. We both know you are only pissed I gave you multiple examples of Bethesda dropping the ball - but you think you're smart so this discussion pointless.
---
Wait, when did Betheada says perk loadouts weren't possible? Are we talking about switching out perk card "decks"? Cause I've been holding out on that one hoping it would come for months now
---
ESO and Fallout actually don't have very different  end game item structure. 
---
In Fallout, you run content (Whitesprings, Burrows, etc) to get loot. Most of it sucks or isn't quite what you are looking for, but perhaps it has trade value.
---
In ESO, you run content (Dungeons, Trials, etc) to get loot. Most of it sucks or isn't quite what you are looking for, but perhaps it has trade value.
---
Both games have RNG modifiers on their gear that could make them useless (more stamina on a piece of light armor in ESO or Armor Penetration on a laser rifle). Both games 'ask' you to farm or trade to acquire the pieces that you want most, and throw a lot of other loot your way while you do that, which can be  broken down to crafting materials or traded.
---
Both games have a flat max effective character level (50) with levels that scale beyond. This is important because a level 50 3* from a one shot ghoul in whitesprings is just as good as one at the end of a difficult, team oriented raid boss.
---
If the raid boss had a 3 star legendary as a guarantee, that would be a good thing. 
---
First, the 3 star would still be randomly rolled, and there is a lot of variance in whether an item is good or not. You are rewarded for your time with a chance to get a decent piece of loot - not a guarantee of something of value. I have many 3* items that are just waiting for the legendary vendor to scrap. It's not all just stars, in the end.
---
Second, we have no idea how long the raid will be or what sort of resources you will consume to reach and down the boss. If you spent two hours farming the raid, you should maybe be able to clear it two to three times if Bethesda gives us a raid with any sort of substance (I would prefer a 45-60 minute average clear time). Are you seriously arguing that the clear time for the raid would be 2.4 minutes? (120 mins/50 3 star items from end boss = 2.4 minutes per clear). 
---
Third, I said this before, but I'll say it on this reply, too. If they add raids and put a lockout, it will discourage people from playing. Open world farming and server hopping sucks. We do it because we have to. Running into other players farming the same spot sucks. People, myself included, would rather log in and do their daily or weekly raid clear with guaranteed good drops and then just log out for the rest of the day/week than be forced into substandard open world farming that shits on your time with crap loot.
---
Fourth, nukes arent time gated. You can launch as many as you want, as often as you want. All you have to do is hunt down a key card and fight through the silo. You can server hop and nuke fissure site prime rapid fire if you want. If you are just waiting for others to nuke it, that's you being lazy, not the game time-gating content.
---
I could go on, but I think the point is pretty clear.
---
Are you on now? 
---
Psn: lakota321
---
You can get a friend to set some down for you
---
Oh man now I need these fireworks in my life. SHUT UP AND TAKE MY ATOMS!
---
You can get a friend to help set some down for you
---
Well, you could say that about having the Small Letters or Signs &amp; Letters plans at all.  The theory is that they cost so much or are so random to get that only players who have been around for a bit will be able to hanve them.
---
Did you check the weapon workbench for the gun version and the armor workbench for the helmet?
---
Can you tell me more about this gun? Haven't played in a few weeks but sounds interesting.
---
Are we allowed to see the fight in game or only  through twitch?
---
Logging on now
---
They really don't test their patches, do they? Fucking lazy.
---
Leather is your best bet. Urban Scout is better looking but the leather is way tankier.
---
I suspect the change had as much to do with getting high level players to go other places as it did with the too easy farming.  Having lots of high level players constantly farming it made the area much harder than I feel it was meant to be for those following the BoS quest chain.  Depending on their primary reason for the changes, we may see similar things done anytime we find a specific location that players congregate too heavily at consistently for activities like farming legendary etc (especially given how much the new content seems to want us to re-explore places too).  While I don't mind the change overall, I do wish there were noted about it in the patches and an explanation of the intent that drive it.
---
I had a totally full budget and was able to tame my deathclaw. He's only level 21 so that might be part of it.
---
Thank you. Didn't know there was an easteregg up there. Were you on the northern or southern peak?
---
Right, like you could watch the map and see where people are bunched or wait and see where someone stops and stays a little bit. I think a flat rate of like 10-15 caps would be a good price
---
I waved at a fellow Wastelander with camera in hand at Whitesprings and was instantly banished to an area devoid of all buildings and map markers, all alone. That'll teach me to be a friendly tourist. All I wanted was a nice picture of the Sentry Bot. Thinking of changing my name to Twoflower.
---
Sounds like it's a good time to sell acrobat's armor pieces! -50% fall reduction per piece. I've been jumping off large structures and cliffs with two pieces equipped. 0 fall damage!
---
Yeah it's pretty essential for flux farming. For violet flux nuking just below Wavy Willards is suppose to give loads without the hassle of fissure sites.
---
Love all of it. I feel terrible for the Vault 94 dwellers :(
---
You didn't mean anything. Unfortunately I believe they saved all that you described for the raids that will be coming out in future updates. The general consensus is that the Burrows was not what they said it would be and it was pretty easy and sadly a bit more than disappointing.
---
Ammosmith, to my understanding, gives you more ammo from the pre-existing ammo recipes as the alternative would be creating an entire new set of recipes to hotswap between. The challenge likely looks for the player crafting the ammo, which is done in the non-ammosmith amounts, and I doubt challenges also check for perks, like Ammosmith.
---
I was lucky enough to see a radstorm while in the same room as two other people I was playing with in the same server... I was about a quarter mile from the Top of the World, and they where near the Morgantown Airport. The radstorm was in their area, but not on top of me, so on their screen it looked like a nuke had just dropped, and on my screen I could see this giant green cloud rolling across the land. It was quite awesome.
---
Incase anyone wants to know, I had this happen around Thanksgiving time.
---
You need to convert it to a skin then. No one is going to use it like this.  Legendary effects matter :P
---
That's inaccurate. I never saw any claims by Bethesda like that.
---
It’s a great pistol, keep it.
---
Yeah I've had this happen lots just yesterday my whole power armor was doubled on its frame
---
Shovel, Galil Para style, Dragunov style, and pistol grip only are the available options.    
---
I usually run mine with the Galil Para (True) stock.  [Pic](https://puu.sh/CZecv/607678bf92.jpg)

 Glowing Meat Steak. Plus 10% melee, along with Twisted Muscles, makes my knives even more ridiculous. ;)
---
Coolio, thanks for the input.
---
That's a neat little drop for anyone who does the bloodied build! You would probably be able to sell it pretty easy  to someone who does that build!
---
Yeah i checked both it said i got a assualtron head and imposter head
---
Sorry for missing the discussion when it happened.... but here's this. If you stagger someone in the air they aren't on the ground so their xy coords don't change, ergo they don't lose sentinels protection. Given how common aae handmades and sentinels (to say nothing of tse laser rifles/plasma rifles) (thanks dupers) the people willing to spend money now have the ability to murder porn people in under a second. So if you don't sneak crit them to death you are dead.  
---
They are manageable if you are fighting them away from a spawn point or they are solo. If they got a teammate (free respawns and empath...) say goodbye to your aid.
---
Shotguns or miniguns are the only reliable staggers machines at any range, but shotguns are limited range, and miniguns need a second to spin up.  
---
I started pvping as a shotgun build. Its possible to get close enough take them down, but its not sustainable. I'm switching to the aae handmade crit build. 
---
Ass/sent being readily buyable to people that think spawn camping is skill ruins the game just a bit.  
---
In the end it comes down to bethesda not closing the duping doors fast enough. If they had a full set of ass/power/sentinels or cavs would have been beyond rare. Instead, there's a decent number of people rocking full suits that are literally advertised as 'immortal god armor sets.'
---
Either use it as a bloodied pistol build (which has potential to be very strong) or sell it for alot
---
It hasn't been, unless you're claiming old datamined stuff as evidence, as the YouTubers are want to do.
---
It would be cool to have the lower DC downtown area, the area that was like all gated off by blown up buildings. That may be a small enough area to make, with the newer, more modern engine.
---
You can spin this any way you'd like.  I was pitched a gaming experience that is entirely different than the direction that this title is evolving into.  My BS meter for this title is currently maxed out.  Your mileage may vary of course but for me, the decisions of the corporate mind have taken the fun out of this amazing title.  While I'm absolutely happy with my times in Appalachia, I can't under good conscience continue to play this title in it's current state.  I may return in the future but I doubt it.
---
They had a few energy weapon variants. The lore says that their weapons are either horus heresy era or updated versions and the weapons themselves are corrupted and ill repaired much like their armour. The machine spirits are prone to catastrophic failure but for the most part the plague marines don't care
---
Yeah sure
---
What alien in the truck bed?
---
I get that this is a funny haha kind of response, but tbh this just shows some fortnite ignorance lmao
---
I think the argument is actually that people want a way to farm where they arent competing for spawns against othe players all the time.
---
You can say 'play as it is', but it's a game, and people made it, so 'how it is' can easily be changed. By people.
---
One way they can change it is by making jnstwnced dungeons and raids that are designed for a group of people who want to play cooperatively without competing against other groups who want to do the same thing. Everyone wins.
---
Easy, right?
---
?
---
Someone posted a map with all possible spawns last night.  I got on and decided to check Wavy Willard's first.  Found Ansel on my very first server, first possible location.  Judging by the reactions of others I should have picked up a lottery ticket because my luck was on.
---
Admittedly, I was ballparking the point where Vanguard kicks in.  I honestly thought it was higher than 60%.
---
To make it easier on yourself you could find a post on here (as there have been many) of people who have found the tourist and just join their game! I know on XB1 LFG people have been posting when they've found the tourist as well to help others out. 
---
Good luck on your search!

---
That's what I don't get...
---
Killing the Flatwoods monster counts as killing an alien, but taking photos doesn't.
---
So, what are the rules? This can go very bad if it's not set up perfectly.
---
Thanks, I'm working on a bloodied alt so I was thinking about keeping it but I'll keep in mind That I could sell it for a decent price.
---
WATCH OUT FOR ... NON ... BROTHERHOOD ... ROBOTS
---
Thanks I'll keep this in mind.
---
Did you try that yourself? It didn't count for me. Only checked off assaultron.
---
YES!! Quantum hair, I need it!!
---
The southern one was a little higher so figured Id try that one first and gave me on the first try.
---
Something similar happens when you have your prosnap out then enter photo mode and try to do a pose.
---
Yes that is what happened to me
---
Meh, nothing worth coming back for.
---
Yoo.. guys, if you read the book (A guide to surviving in Appalachia) There should be Aliens as cryptids on the game, this challenge makes reference to them I believe.
---
Coming soon to an Atom store, near you..!
---
That's how I found out it worked
---
There is some weirdness going on.
---
I have... 4294949286 days and 17 hours to complete which is 11.7 million years.

I mean, that's great because I am on Reddit, but what about the, that I'm assuming are thousands upon thousands who play this game but aren't on this forum?  If you're going to tie in game currency to it, it's kind of crap for it not to be a standard start point, is all I'm saying.
---
I agree, I was kind of underwhelmed with the eye color choices. Usually for me the eyes are so much more flat in-game than in the character creator that it doesn't bother me, but I am all for more variety, especially a true darker eye color!
---
Jumping should reduce accuracy by 90% more for automatics.  😀
---
Should be enough time, I guess
---
Heavy leather or regular leather
---
The sky fell! Chaos reigns! Dogs and cats, living together! MASS HYSTERIA!!! 
---
Jk, nothing changed. People are rump rustled, but still playing. I’ve seen a bunch of posts of people just picking up the good ones from the SBQ, and not even bothering with the little ones. It’s all good.
---
Why would it, it’s literally named “Imposter”
---
Sorry that’s long gone, threw that sob into a river somewhere.
---
*Skins*
---
Key word there: ***S K I N S***
---
They had a few energy weapon variants. These aren't khornites afterall
---
The lore says that their weapons are either horus heresy era or updated versions of those weapons and much like their armour the weapons themselves are corrupted and ill repaired. The machine spirits are totured and as such this means the weapons aee prone to catastrophic failures that various often kill a space marine but for the most part the plague marines don't care.
---
However saying that they have quite a few melee power weapons that assist in spreading many diseases.
---
That’s a nice top tip dude.
---
Been hopping around since the update and still had no luck. I’ll post on here next time I’m on and hopefully I’ll have more luck.
---
True but where is the real one then
---
AAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGHHHHHH!!!!
---
I got all 6. Wasn't there supposed to be something for getting them all other than just literally having them?
---
Maybe you should stop being a piece of shit.
---
Need Bydwc
---
Nice quote man!!
---
There was a 90% white America style power armor skin in the atom shop that had been removed since I think
---
I can agree with you there - I was just tailoring my response to you specifically. I do agree there should be a better way to start the quest although I don't just want another "read this poster" type start. That's fun a couple times but not everytime. I feel like this quest - had it been available at launch would have started much like the Mistress quest where you're just prompted to approach a dead body when you come into it's vicinity. But these are a bit more out of the way and with only one spawn per server (to my knowledge) kind of a bitch to get started.
---
So you're saying the atom shop ISN'T only selling cosmetics?
---
You gotta be kidding, I'll be in love with the pistol. Great find
---
I miss watoga :(
---
Posts like this are pointless, and I don't plan on changing my mind.
---
Well, since [this](https://bethesda.net/en/article/7wimxCcc8NURG9Em2bV7Ds/fallout-76-upcoming-double-xp-weekends) hasn't been changed I would assume so.
---
I hopped the Mothman museum location. Got it second time. Had a lockup and when I came back to the game it was there again. So two of three for that location.
---
Definitely try it out first. Bloodied explosive is pretty fun. I got my hands on a bloody explosive lever action and i love it~
---
Grafton Monsters yield acid too, right?  Always a couple around Charleston, along with a couple Snallygasters.
---
If u change ur mind and wanna sell it. My psn is Sleepz2184 👍
---
LOL nice b8
---
Well I typically lean melee (I just love being in the shit ) but I'm changing it up with my one alt so I thought I'd ask around.
---
So maybe a stupid question but what is the benefit of +6 intelligence??
---
The multi level dungeon is the one under Arktos Pharma that is coming soon.  That was the one they had all over the promotional material for wild Appalachia
---
use [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgkq7y/tourist_location_masterpost/).
---
Even if it were like the two from last week that weren't announced but were available at the same spot every time if you heard about it, that's fine.  
---
But this was hyped for months in path ahead stuff, fully outlined in the behind the vault, and then they pull this crap.  Ugh.  Frustrating.
---
Could you please remind the people in charge of making these things for the game that we were promised a "cosmetics only" Atom Shop? Until it returns to being that, I refuse to play this game, which saddens me because I was having fun but they need to be held to their promises.
---
Cool if I do go to sell you'll be at the top of the list
---
Damn....  BE with 250 reload DR that's a good drop!! It's a good thing you checked because that's a sweet pistol keep it or shop it around for something that suits your build. It should fetch a nice price/trade
---
I got it. Let's replace all legendary robots with Colonel Gutsys and Sentry Bots
---
I wanted to get all the beverage recipes, but the second quest I got was for Red Ant Lager that require two ant meant. I've never even seen an ant in this game so far. I have no idea where to go for this.
---
Ah ok thank you. Looking forward to that one then
---
Besides the game being rushed open, I gave pretty valid points on why I have my explanations. You just wanna bitch because the anonymity of the internet. I like Bethesda games because they are vast open worlds. Just because I gave valid defence doesnt make me "fanboy". Get your head, out of your ass. Its rough. It could be hard. But it's not that bad out. Smells a hell of a lot better too. 
---
The game shipped bad - game is now good. Oh where you going to respond as to why repair kits personally hurt the way you play? Or how they give you a disadvantage? Hur dur repair during a fight I refuse to accept with 200% repair taking hours of constant battle to deplete btw.
---
More xp, better crafted items more material from scrapping.  If there is no downside, why wouldn't you get it?
---
Great idea. I could use the power cores!
---
I would love some strange eye colors as well! Like some very light grey or pastel colors. And of course red.
---
Well, time to whip out my Two Shot Fatman.
---
Sweet , I’ll pay good or give u equal trade. No pressure . That’s a good drop
---
Yeah, I'm working on a bloodied alt but I was going to do melee, got this drop and just had to ask around.
---
If you want to potentially be dead in a random location rather than alive where you are, I guess?
---
The people in 76market would pay 20k to 25k for that gun. Too good to be sold in my opinion
---
Well seeing as how one involves taking pictures if the Sheepsquatch and an alien I feel that's a fair amount of time lol
---
alrighty, thank you very much :)
---
Radiation sure messed up the world...
---
You're gonna be cutting it close
---
Now if only they weren't getting rid of a good chunk of the remaining player base with the repair kits
---
a lot of people seem to forget that when you use a mirv you need to aim above eye level as the nukes split at the top of the arc. if you dont aim above eye level then the top of the arc is where you are standing so they split there and kill you.
---
This, this, and all this.  
---
Plus the reason why people find the "rare" stuff there is because a lot of it is dev room and duped from the old days
---
Good luck finding the tourists!
---
Well I'll probably end up using it thanks to the advice of everyone here.
---
Nice, I've been saving Bloodied weapons as well. It should be a fun alt build.
---
are you only checking once?  lately no matter when it dies it takes a few seconds to load after looking at the quickloot menu for the first time
---
I have mulled playing Berserk style, but the lack of an added carry bonus like you get with Unyielding has kept me from trying. If there was an armor type that provided no damage/Energy resistance but still enjoyed PERK buffs and weight reduction legendary effects, I would consider running this way.  Just have a Berserker armor that buffs PERK the lower your damage resistance like Unyielding
---
Im on it,ty
---
from when you initiate the quickloot window
---
Excellent, comprehensive post.  If I had silver, gold or platinum to share, this is definitely worthy.  The soundtrack is expertly curated, as well.  I think the Gatling Plasma really deserves [Animals As Leaders "CAFO"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAI0zeE6U3A).  Brutally technical, although the song lasts about 6:39 longer than is required.  Carpenter Brut was a very good choice, though.
---
I think I can shoot faster with a semi-auto handmade than the gatling gun.  Crazy slow.  It does seem to wreck a mirelurk queen at a similar rate, compared to [my AA/E rifle](https://imgur.com/4iTeMDI), so that seems about right.  If it weren't for the horrific hipfire accuracy of TS/E, I'd probably still be using one.
---
A+++
---
Since we're not bragging but sharing...I've got a primed bloody explosive gatling laser that I use for queen fights. At 10% health it does 150 damage per shot, 1000 shots per core. Will go through a core in about 30 seconds. So it clocks in at 5k damage per second. That's before the 60% boost from adrenaline, before the 50% boost from revenant. If the stars align just right I'm putting out nearly 10k per second during scorched earth events.
---
Ya, I completely understand why. But the challenge says 48, not craft film 4 times. It's just a very inconsistent system they've got going.
---
This happend to me a few nights ago.
---
I wouldnt care tbh. As long as I can get rid of the neon green flashlight. Everything turns the same colour
---
Still better than selling RK's
---
Lol, sure. Does it work in power armor?
---
Yeah, I only downvote for douchebaggery... not for disagreementery.   We can disagree on all things and I don't mind, but if you start acting like a primo prick then the downvotes come out.  (I rarely downvote people because there are some jerks here, but by and large this is a pretty good group of people, I think.)
---
That's why they gave us several decades to finish this weeks challenges lol
---
Does it dubble stack?
---
Honestly, they didn't say the burrows would be anything other than a new dungeon.
---
The community hyped it up to be bigger than it was/is.
---
If they listened to criticism they'd have realized the bulk of the community is against the repair kits in the atom shop as they do give a massive p2w style advantage, that being 'pay money to repair without a resource cost, anywhere at all' 
---
Sure the 'improved' version is better and in game, but honestly if they wanted to add a utility item into the atom shop, make it a blueprint to craft them, that can also be gotten as a rare drop from queeny, sure it's kinda douchey to have the ability to buy things others will have to work for, but way better imo than the current case
---
I have a theory that our next non-appalachia DLC map will be the Capitol Wasteland
---
All of them.
---
I'm not sure if is intended but personally, as opposed to the Mirelurk Queen acid spit - which fortunately was ~~nerfed~~rebalanced after a couple of months of dissolving players in seconds - I am OK with it.
---
As others have already pointed out there are a handful of enemies that you have to be mindful of, this I think is a good thing.
---
Sucks doggy balls when you are doing Rose's quest at lvl 15ish and you get a bunch of lvl 50+ of these after installing the signal booster thingy though :P
---
So, the time length glitch isn't uniformed for everyone?
---
Some have 11 years some have 11 mil.
---
Why am I not surprised?
---
That would have fixed things perfectly.  
---
 It doesn't matter if you're an "accepted person", you start blowing shit up, you're in trouble.
---
PS4 ?
---
Thank you for this!
---
You are correct, it is easy right now. Though reducing the perk cost of the dps perks wouldn't make is easier since I can't become any stronger than I am now with my build. It just means I can get cool perks and be a bit more versatile. Might help save people from stagnating and quitting by opening up a world of new play styles. I also really want to see better group oriented and mechanic based fights, like the sheepsquatch attempted to do with the pylons. Though it doesn't change my specialization much by doing this, would just allow me to switch between a auto fire gun and single shot sniper, both with sneak dmg. Honestly I think Rifleman and commando should really be the same but that'll never happen
---
Nah there is a questline that talks about something some faction was working on.  It was towards the end of the quest line for me... I don't think it was BOS... what came after that?   The quest that takes you to the bunker on the north side of the mire.  That quest line has something about knocking them out of the sky from what I recall.
---
By the substation next to big bend tunnel.
---
Nice cosmetics only shop, EA Games.
---
I have had this happen to me twice, but after moving my camp nothing has happened since.
---
I use ultralight marine armour for my sniper build (I know that you’re not interested in legendary but I stack chameleon pieces with max sneak, rifleman and (possibly called) covert (2.5x sneak multiplier) with bloody mess.  I use an instigating gause rifle with this load out btw.
---
For real
---
Yeah, those mobs *on top* of the world map are *really* worried....
---
BSG seems a little to focused on 'splash' value. Trying to be a bit too clever with everything and working less on some of the deeper, more obvious things that might have more lasting value.
---
I mean, the Sheepsqautch stuffed thing is fine and all … and the bunny head. But things are drifting too cartoon-ish and less Fallout.
---
Armors, weapon skins, styles, that play more to the thematic premise of the **Post Apocalyptic Role Playing Game** and less to *Caroon Network &amp; Adult Swim*
---
Fasnacht was great and a nice distraction … but can we get back to Fallout, please?
---
I'm not sure how that works with hair styles cuz the last thing I'm worried about in a rad-storm is my beehive do or hombre fade … but either of those beat a paper machete devil lady hat.
---
Zetans and the more interesting to me; the interloper, have so far been under developed. I hope we get lots more lore on them.
---
I had a couple in the past month. I live in the Forest near Sutton and Summersville. That's three or four this year so far. The other two I had were when I lived by West Tek. 
---
I got a badass photo of me and my Hero of the Wasteland statue.
---
Where do you want the junk to go after your drop it?
---
That would be a lot of fun to agro, bit it would be pretty much impossible to complete the mayor for a day, you just wouldn't be able to get through the town of you were on their shit list.
---
IT really was excellent. I took my 13 year old and friend of hers and we all had a great time. A bit odd seeing people older than me(I'm 37) and other people bringing their kids younger than my daughter(pretty sure I saw a baby) and everyone in between, but weezer sounds amazing live.
---
I found a wendigo cryptid sidequest that gave me its mount.

At the time that I posted this there is only the above-listed available they will continue to release more quests that involve more cryptid wall mounts. 
---
The wendigo being the most recent one added.
---
I just wanted to second this.
---
It honestly seems crazy that the two aren't even comparable.  Running Berserker in your undies is far more risky than Bloodied.  And yet, Berserker seems to top out at just 50% or so.
---
How did you manage this? I’ve made the Nukashine but can’t give it to Biv, any solutions to this?
---
I have my camp in that area too.
---
We might have tried to load in the same server simultaneously causing a paradox that resulted in the annihilation of your camp.
---
Mine cannot be annihilated because there is never anything destructible 'out' so yours took the blast of the quantum irregularity something something particle physics mumbo jumbo.

I climbed up the tower at Camp Adams and hit like. Ended up in the air out of bounds:

The Burrows Disappointment, the latest chapter in the Saga of Fallout 76 (only on Lifetime), was a result of poor marketing choices and people hyping themselves up for a dungeon that's a part of a DLC pack that has been largely filled with super easy content. 
---
I expect Nuclear Winter to be much more difficult, somewhere between a standard nuke zone and Scorched Earth.
---
Yeah, I agree there.
---
Cryolacter? I barely knew her!
---
I got the ants from the pylon place just north of Watoga.
---
Maybe not each, but some for a set, number a day, or X times. Definitely workable.
---
you can, but staying alive is not guaranteed
---
Next time you guys/gals get stuck in one of you don't mind grab a screenshot of the entire map, working on compiling world space bug page...  
---
Just tag me and ill compile and report it
---
It does announce that you are going to shed some light on the ages old question 'is there life after death?' - as long as the condition is met - therefore it is a source of illumination... from a certain point of view :P
---
I thought it was more of a light doesn't explode so we are taking them out kinda thing.
---
Noone ever guaranteed adventuring would be safe. All I need to do is beware arrows
---
Cranberry moonshine was my Holy Grail, took forever. Now I've moved on to trying to get the sheepsqautch mascot head. The struggle continues.
---
Servers wouldn't be able to handle the amount of items players would put in their bases.

Heck f04 would glitch out and crash if it had too much stuff.

Expect display cases but not dropping items to show in the world.

Sounds unfair to anyone who likes to brawl with melee if there is mutation suppression.

WHAT HE SLEEP KILLED A GUY
---
You mean Burrows v2.0
---
You can't sell them to vendors
---
There has to be content for everyone. There has to be easier content like Fasnacht Day and the Burrows and there has to be tougher events like Encryptid and Scorched Earth. I hope that the Vaults present at least one super hard high level raid that takes at least an hour to finish. I want to feel depleted when I do it. 
---
Make the other Vault and Arktos can be a sort of middle ground, not too hard but not too easy. But what's not easy for the guy jumping in the air with an explosive shotgun or slamming a Deathclaw Gauntlet into everything (cough me cough)
---
What platform you on ?
---
but... megaton and hornet's nest... /r
---
The game still DC's constantly
---
The game still doesnt load the world properly
---
The game still deletes items in your stash when you log
---
The game still doesnt recognize when friends are online
---
The game still allows invisible mobs to kill you
---
But the game is totally now good...
---
Repair kits dont effect how I play, but it gives other players an advantage of applying a repair kit while in combat wether pvp or pve. Sure it takes forever to break gear, but folks forget to repair until things break, now they never have to think about it. Nevermind the time it takes to farm the materials to repair gear, they get it instantly.
---
Sorry, I was a tad sleepy when I replied and what I said looks actually pretty rude. I did submit a support ticket and yeah that glitch is very different.
---
Good point sir, and duly noted.  I always forget about criticals, etc in the heat of cowering in fear.  Appreciate the advice!
---
Still have it?
---
I recently updated my sign too!

Agreed. What bothers me the most is pistol damage increase perks are in Agility Tree which also has Adrenaline, Covert Operative, Gun fu and Thru-Hiker. If you invest all 9 points in pistol damage perks, you'll have only 6 for those perks above. Can't be a good contender to rifles in my opinion.
---
Apparently bots have their own cosmetic shop and this week's freebie was a stingwing costume :P
---
Your Welcome
---
Yeah, I couldn’t access the quick fermenter, so I let it do it naturally
---
to the commenters that enjoy their outfits:

cool, you like the outfit you chose, that does not discount the fact that there are like 3 cool male outfits in this game and there needs to be more.
---
The already mentioned Cranberry relish

&amp; Sweet sleep :)

Radstag meat for carry weight ( the Rad Amt Lager ist better and doesn't spoil, but I have yet to get the recipe)

Glowing meat for melee Bonus,

Molerat meat +1 Str

Steeped fern flower Tea +2 Str

I could Go in and in since I like the cooking and brewing Part very much :)
---
I love that paint job too. XD Go great with the metal slick armor paintjob!
---
Wow, OK I see the list down at the bottom of the last image! That's a real shame, I guess nobody who doesn't have it already can even get it now unless they fix it. Or it got moved to another event that drops it? I sure hope so. Anyway, I'll edit my post now. Thank you!
---
This is the first fallout where I don’t main a pistol .
---
And invisible assaultrons. Thats the type of abuse I like
---
I second this. I do a lot of server hopping looking for events and it would be nice not to have to.... but holy shit don't trap me in the same server with the clown costume wearing deathclaw wielding PVP douchebags.
---
There was nothing great about it. Well, maybe before the bombs dropped.
---
I was personally on all future play through going to skip mayor for a day just to keep Watoga fun (rip all rise) but in my last play through (pre-nerf) it wasn't that difficult if you avoided the South East.
---
All issues you have, not me. If you have all those issues with DC, taking too long to load, you are playing on a hard disk drive. Sucks. Start using a solid state drive. These games arnt ment to be played at minimum requirements anymore. Get better hardware. 
---
Also the "farmed" items takes 1 minute at most in any dungeon to repair most things. Also - you got a ton of free atoms for playing. If you want them, but them. If you dont. Dont. The beauty of it is it doesnt affect you. In any way shape or form when they exist.
---
you can sell it individually too
---
Yes, which fits exactly with what they said in that preview.
---
Did you have the increased duration perk enabled?  
---
Troubleshooting seems to have isolated it to that
---
Hurry go kill a lengendary glowing ghoul with a gamma gun next to a fissure site with an unspottables outfit on while drunk tick blood tequila in that rad storm for 10 atoms

I had something simillar where i had a double capacity explosive double barrel, but i gave it to him, but since he stoped playing i asked if i could have it back but he told me he did not had the game anymore. But you know, i gave it to him so i cant really blame him for that so
---
But that will give people a competitive picture taking advantage.
---
I haven't used in survival, but I found myself in a  situation where it definately was very tempting.
---
ok I am on Xb1 and have her.
---
Alright
---
all of your stuff is safe from your own turrets, they dont do any damage to your camp so no worries
---
I like this.
---
Yeah that's pretty much my point as well. Seems silly to put these restrictions of "you have to tag it to get rewarded" in place when tagging doesn't mean you've contributed anything meaningful.
---
Which means they will literally win the game. Come on Beth, what were you thinking???
---
Remember, you don't have to uncrouch to use them. So you can repair without ever appearing on the map.
---
In last weeks "Broken" challenges, there was one for using a "Night-Vision lens," but there's been no word on how to actually craft it.
---
So either there is, but it's broken like the Alien Photo challenge, or there isn't and Beth fucked up again.
---
I agree
---
I'm lvl 200, and I still don't want some random jerk that never learned to share in pre-school stomping through and one shotting everything in his/her path.
---
Thanks! I never built any of the better turrets in 4, so I had no point of reference for this game. Now on to stopping the ‘raiders’!
---
I don't mind clipping. Give us gals long hair styles! And ponytails / pigtails with bangs! More colors too. I'd throw so much money at them.
---
Not a problem. Lol. I'm overencumbered too. Long as it doesn't break my armor. And I won't even have to use a stimpac. FT roulette for the win!
---
Holy shit, I'm buggering off to survival mode tomorrow!
---
Where is the body?
---
Thanks. I couldn't have hopped on right now anyways.  That's the crappiest thing about this. I have limited time to play during the day and I burnt almost all of it today server hopping
---
The bloodied build with all the perks is far better than any other currently. If i start using it ill feel like im min/maxing instead of enjoying the game. Its not for everyone.
---
RemindMe!
---
You ever wonder why they're called Assaultron Dominators? 
---
Well now you know
---
When I last had the quest, I logged out before I grabbed the ingredients for Nukashine, when I logged in a few days later, the quest was gone and Biv just keeps repeating the dialogue like I do have the quest and won’t accept regular Nukashine or Vintage Nukashine
---
I really wanna buy that paint so that I can let it all hang out, but I never wear metal armor
---
Remember which dome?
---
RemindMe! 16 hours
---
You have to activate not just hit the pylons...
---
I’m on Xbox, and I’ve tried everything you can think of to get the thing to ferment using the quick fermenter or Biv to take the Nukashine to no avail
---
As I've already said, you can have a 100% full build and still tame creatures. 
---
It's when you move and want to rebuild that you can't use 10% of your stuff because the creature takes 10%.
---

I'm right there with you.  They're so rare that I took [my own photo](https://imgur.com/Y7x8oO3) about two weeks ago.
---
Great pic, by the way.
---
I don't.
---
Aww more personally patched out of the game :(
---
yea man, i get your point. maybe combine some of these damage perks and add new ones. so there would be more endgame builds. sounds good.
---
yea the sheepsquatch was a very nice attempt to make a harder boss. now it gets ripped as fast as a normal 3\* enemy. i hope they buff the next bosses a lot. so you need to do think how to defeat and do tactics instead of just pew pew pew or maybe sometimes pressing e \^\^
---
If anyone drops out or no shows, I'm down to fight!
---
I wonder if anyone got to appreciate my Tyler County S h I t Track starring S h I t rod Johnson on PC yesterday. Took me ~~ages~~ 10 minutes.
---
I believe it was TnT dome #2. It has an alien blaster mod and alien blaster ammo as well.
---
 I am only guessing it is a cryo chamber with an alien in it because of the Other items in the Room.
---
 There is absolutely no proof to my claim other than speculation
---
Really? lol
---
They are ok. I recently made the switch to rifles because the game insisted on only giving me amazing rifles instead of pistols.
---
I have been doing some stat comparisons recently and found the damage per second on the unmodified 10mm and pipe pistol are actually higher than many unmodified rifles. 
---
For example, a base pipe fires 6 rounds per second verses only 3.3 rounds per second of the combat rifle.
---
When you mod them with automatics, they all seem to have the same fire rate, 7.5 rounds per second.
---
I am planning on estimating AP cost for pistols vs rifles to confirm they are cheaper per shot.
---
It’s got a very small activation box, it took my awhile to find a spot where I could activate it and insert. Maybe try to make another one and use the quick fermenter.
---
Same for me, I completed the robot one before hand so maybe that has something to do with it.
---
Well that's a good thing no?
---
Like you never pooped into a sock, you filthy gamer.  ;)
---
Are you selling them?
---
I’ll add you I’m jumping on now I’m Gonja666goblin
---
HAHAHA yeah here's my experience 
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/bgpbka/whoa\_some\_major\_glitching\_going\_on\_with\_the/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/bgpbka/whoa_some_major_glitching_going_on_with_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
You don't need to be in power armor though no? Since you get no benifit from the armor piercing with energy weapons. I have a Noc Explosive Gatling Plasma also and i find people with Auto Rifles can still kill me before i kill them even in full Sentinel.
---
That's a great drop. They're a solid heavy weapon. 25% extra fire rate is basically +25% damage
---
Nice. I did the same yesterday. Some people you wouldn't believe how long they were looking for the tourist.
---
Thanks!  
---
And funny thing, I actually did have CAFO on my general shortlist when choosing songs. Saw Tosin &amp; company rockin' it out at the festival last year; great guys and awesome musicians.
---
I read it as cryolactator... like you out there shooting milk or something as her.. idk
---
I server-hopped so many times I ran into the same guy twice
---
I wish they were more common
---
+20? What are you eating?
---
A challenge for 2+ Level 50+ players -- exactly what they said.
---
I do use an ssd, and my PS is less than 6m old. I know multiple people who have the same or worse issues than I do. Hardware isn't the issue.
---
You can try buuuut, you have a chance to just get jammed into an invisible wall and be forced to dump all your excess items to fast travel out.
---
Two people yesterday that I know of.
---
I-it's just works !
---
Dont forget morgantown hs then head southeast to cat lady house.
---
25k from me if you ever decide to sell ;)
---
2 months away? Interest is lost.
---
Thats awesome bro!
---
But the title here was "MELEE build extreme OP"
---
You take 20lb dumps?  I don't know whether to be revolted or congratulatory.  I mean, sometimes I feel hungry after pooping, but I don't think we want that buff.
---
I'm good with just worrying about hunger and thirst.  Having to stop in the middle of the Whitespring to have a dump, carry around a roll of TP or risk yet another disease by using leaves is not where I want.  You know the trolls would intentionally poop into the sulphur drinking fountain to ruin everyone else's day.
---
ikr, should be easier, I have helped probably 20-30 people grab it ...
---
So where is the dump truck alien, then?
---
I’ve tried 2 times, but what the hell ill keep doing it
---
Oh, I know they "do"... It just never sat right with me is all. "lore-wise" I mean. 
---
Bolters blasting chunks of flesh off, heavy thudding solid ammo... that seemed to fit better.
---
Eh. I know. I dumped it at a friends camp instead
---
Geez - wonder how many caps *that* would cost.
---
Im checking to make sure it works that way before I commit :)
---
Game Data confirms.
---
 The game data says the Flatwoods Monster race "`FlatwoodsMonsterRace`" and the challenge is looking for "`AlienRace`".
---
There are aliens in the game data (Alien Lieutenant, Alien Captain, and Alien  Star Admiral) but I've never seen them in the game nor can I find  spawning data for them.
---
I’ve tried 2 times now, but hey, maybe third times the charm lol
---
I'll keep it in mind😉
---
I would love this. I've been to the bunker military vendor hundreds and hundreds of times looking for that second calibrated shocks. Found the first one even before I found the jetpack. Now I have a X-01 jetpack for both me and my wife, plus another 2 jetpacks just sitting in my stash because they seem too rare to pass up but I still haven't found another CS. Starting to wonder if the devs limit you to one for a laugh. What really grinds my gears is that I found an unaffiliated CS mod from a random vendor ages ago but I'm unable to install it.
---
I just found out recently too, have spent so much time gathering materials to craft weapons just to scrap them...
---
Me using a bloodied vats crit 10mm Pistol
---
https://youtu.be/EPOWxhBhiJE
---
On PC and I've only gotten this recipe once. Same for Mountain Honey. I'm just looking for Cranberry Moonshine recipe, right now.
---
extra enemies coming soon to the atom shop
---
For the win.
---
So glad I got it maxed out.
---
I consider myself a pretty fair guy and try to please … but if you just dump something in a bag it would not occur to me that you were trying to trade.
---
You being much lower level is not, on the surface, a good indicator you are a otherwise good trade partner … unless you were looking to buy.
---
I am sorry it sucked for you but I'd encourage you to take the feedback here and update your trade methods
---
Just got one the other day
---
If you ever need help with a similar post featuring sniper rifles and the benefits of various legendary effects, let me know.
---
Hmm I'll give it a check. Cheers for the Intel.
---
Should of kept your cards close to the chest, now I GOT to use it.😂 that looked fun, thanks for giving me a goal to shoot for with my alt.
---
Yeah no worries, I really think you should keep it. Amazing gun.
---
I got it from server hopping at Drop Site G2/C2(?), Northeast of Watoga.
---
Ended up losing it again later, but you can still get it from Rads, not sure about the Serum.
---
Yeah exactly. Because of where their damage perks are located they aren't viable
---
Sounds like youre talking about the crown from FO4 that the guy wears who has psychic powers and is locked up in a basement lab. I cant remember his name
---
Ironically we’re about to actually get Boy Scout training.
---
So you see what I did there.
---
Wasn’t there a main quest line with the free states that said they had something that, once you complete it, that you could trap them and force them to land. It’s been awhile but it always confuses me that it was never given to the player. Might be wrong about it but y’all let me know
---
I get that perspective, I do....but my Vault Dweller was around pre-war and she has dreams and aspirations in this hellscape dammit!
---
She has cast off the chains of the corporate architect she once was and longs to live freely! She built a fusion-powered generator with her own two-hands so I know she can figure out how to do a proper ombre...or at least she can figure out how to reprogram the robots at Whitesprings to accept an appointment!
---
My point is only that developing a new colored *texture* for hair is possible and could be profitable with minimal effort on the part of Bethesda. Modeling is hard! Clipping is hard! Animating is hard! Recoloring and doing a bit of finesse work on existing textures should be easy relative to all of that...and this isn't even as complex a request as armor/power armor recolors. Just makes sense (and cents) to me!
---
I am a bit baffled by the mascot-head type items too though tbh, but I think Fallout has always been equal parts goofy and grim...and I love that! Raiders especially have been kind of weirdos and I think could benefit from more hair colors like the multi's I linked to (think of one of those on a mohawk for example) and I think ombre can especially be spun on certain hairstyles to look kinda gritty/beleaguered, not just cute. More options lets people be more creative and contextualize them all sorts of ways with their hairdo, gear, and makeup/grime.
---
Nah, I know what the patriot paint looks like. This was pure white
---
Have you tried activating it from the favourites wheel?.
---
I heard that one works that way, the other one works from the inventory.
---
Ah okay. You're not entitled, you just think content updates are brought into existence by magical game fairies. Understood.
---
Wait, what? Why the fuck isn't this a skin? The hell is going on.
---
With the regular Stealth Boys, yes. That's when the one that worked, worked. But after that, nope.
---
The sad part is that it existed in 4
---
Their energy weapons are mostly corrupted to spew plague material but i do see your point.
---
The pioneer scout camp in toxic valley (where swarm of suitors takes place)  usually has a few ants in the cabins. Also try the giant teapot event, I usually get one or two ants.
---
Also, butcher's bounty is your friend here.
---
I'd buy it
---
If you want the Sheepsquatch, take a pic of the Wise Mothman in the Elightened event. For some reason it counts toward it. 
---
Does anyonr know the method to getting a picture if an Alien? Does it have to be a certain variant FlatwoodMonster because the Mythical one doesbt count.
---
😂you and a few others.
---
buzzkill :-P
---
Thanks! :)
---
but CoD doesnt have mutants, deathclaws or dragons.. err, i mean bats
---
Why does survival get it twice? Rude.
---
already do on both characters its just the look of a ghillie suit on a sniper. wood armor just not the same.
---
Ive never had an issue with it. Class freak means the AP cost is only 12. 
---
Only issue I've had come close to this is getting shell shock which is a continual drain on AP when you're in a fight.
---
umm yeah not gonna click that link due to "furry" reasons, those always sound like a trap.
---
Funny you say that cuz I did kill the Fw 2 times today ! Confirmed,  does not count .
---
People that are going to buy them are going to buy them... most players aren't on Reddit, they're going to make their own decisions. I'm not going to buy them because they aren't that useful in my opinion. Not because they're p2w. They're not p2w, I've played actual p2w games... there's no power advantage with a repair kit that's going to make you "win". Workbenches and scrap are everywhere. Repair kits are obtainable in-game. 
---
People are imagining impossible scenarios where people are winning pvp because they can repair a weapon that breaks mid-fight (what kind of long fights are people having? More like you'd die in the pipboy) and a slippery slope of "today it's repair kits, tomorrow it's TSEs!"
---
I don't want a p2w game either, if it actually becomes one I'll foam at the mouth. They have to  look at ways to make money though? Cosmetics are all well and good but you can't blame them for seeing what else might be viable.
---
Lol, it's not broken I can tell you that. But for it count you have to be right up on it. Like it has to be almost touching the ground for the camera to recognize it.
---
Oh well. Here's hoping for their sake they get an extra $60 out of someone from these repair kits, because they'll be down 60 next time they launch a game (And the other ones too). If they're going to lie about very important game features, I'm not going to buy their games because who fucking knows what sort of shit they may try to pull.
---
Yeah that seems odd. Can easily get 20 caps selling one mutant assault rifle. 10 caps seems reasonable  as hell to me
---
Are you on yet?
---
Go to the munitions factory and spawn in the vertibit it counts
---
It's my hypothesis that you have a 'home' server in your part of the world and you can spawn up to a certain distance from it (geographically). Here in the UK I believe it ranges from east coast US to eastern Europe.
---
Of course this is overridden when you join a friend.
---

Very nice!
---
Aw, poor guy. They fooled you into being their mouthpiece, free of charge.
---
Its your narrative, spin it however you want.
---
Sorry should have specified- just thought I’d spread some love and donate them to someone in need.
---
Wooowwww... so not only is it non-cosmetic, but it also **doesn't work**!!!  It's a premium item that doesn't even work!  Hahahahahaha.... Dude.  So much goodwill has been utterly demolished with this most recent update.
---
But what *didn't* they say?
---
***The fridge itself***
---
That's grasping at straws honestly
---
I had the plans say they dropped from the event, but I never found any sort of anything in my inventory. Never checked the crafting bench.
---
You may need to be much closer. I had to be a few feet away from the nose of a vertibot for the picture to count.
---
Thanks for the clarity. 
---
Don't sell weapons on the Atomic Shop.
---
Why in the world are you guys selling a weapon in the atom shop? Wtf
---
i think certain animals in the mire count. i did a quest for the order of mysteries and to calibrate the blade of bastet you had to kill different creatures. one of the creatures in the mire (i think it was a yao gui or a angler) it counted as an "alien"

Make shift warrior only slows the breakage down. Weapon artisan fixes all weapons up to 200% ( at 3 stars)
---
Alpha
---
But sounds like someone did all the steps then didn’t have a card to actually launch
---
Just good timing by me for my first nuke, lol
---
Option 2: they QAd it at the last minute and found the bug but couldn’t delay it a second time.
---
I have no issue with unbanning people who unwittingly picked up dupers stuff. 
---
However, the assumption that they make up a majority of bans just doesn't seem reasonable to me. 
---
That one group of people is supposed to have more bans total than : Dupers, friends of Dupers who were given shit, people who assisted with duping and were given shit, people who bought duped shit, and people who killed Dupers and kept the duped shit? 
---
That's a pretty far fetched assumption. 
---
And yes, if you killed a duper &amp; kept the duped shit you should still be banned. 
---
The moral guidelines of this sub are hilarious. 
---
"BGS released an item into the AS with no competitive advantage but it's not a cosmetic! RAGGGGGEEEEEE"
---
"It's sure unfair to ban people who cheated and used exploits that created some serious issues for the entire player base"
---
Idk wat you guys are arguing about anymore
---
I don't, but all of my other go-to weapons are ballistic. I don't have a cohesive suit of non-PA either, so I just use a stealthboy T60
---
Cya. Won’t be missed.
---
Dead-to-rights? No time at all. If they're hopping around like mad, a bit longer.
---
no
---
Honestly I hate Beth for turning the fo franchise into Skyrim but I also appreciate them making the game better and more enjoyable . Idk about you but managing resources/weight is what I hate most about the game. I just want to kill shit and convenience items make that dream achievable
---
Enjoy the game. It is fun, but I won't play a game if the devs are so willing to break promises about it. I already got my refund approved. Maybe I'll buy it if they fix the atom shop promise, but for now I need the money more than a game I won't play.
---
Okay I get off work around 1030 central time
---
I just stood under it (inside), looked up and took a shot, and it checked off no problem.
---
&gt; but the news section in the main menu and the 8.5 atomic store update says its supposed to be a skin.
---
But in the store itself it says its a weapon, not a skin. It also seems to imply its a weapon and not a skin from the 8.5 atomic store update.
---
&gt; Note: To **craft** the Imposter Assaultron Head you must have already learned the Salvaged Assaultron Head weapon plan.
---
It says to craft it, not that it's a mod for existing ones or anything else that would suggest it's a skin. I think you made some (reasonable tbh) assumptions that bit you in the ass, but no where does anything imply this is a skin, however a couple places state that it is indeed a weapon.
---
So I gotta climb the one from the north face then jump to the second peak?   Or can you directly climb the highest peak?
---
without spoilers how do I start it?
---
Nah, man. It’s all good.     
---
Glad to see someone’s spreading the love.
---
Yeah sounds like it
---
So another bugged *weekly* challenge we cannot complete even if we tried. How disappointing. Another round of nothing to be done about it, probably.
---
Idk if this still happens but if you look at the loot plist of tons of other enemies you dont get loot from SBQ
---
That doesn't always fix it
---
I’ll buy stash storage upgrades.
---
Shouldn't matter.  You definitely don't need prime, but I'm not sure if there's a damage threshold before loot shows up.  I'd assume not though.
---
Might have been lag, when that happens try waiting a bit, or even travel out and back to see if that forces a load.  But people have reported similar things before, so it's possible you just got an unlucky bug.
---
Weezer’s been around for a while, so I’m not really all that surprised, but I’m glad you guys enjoyed it!
---
Ah, The Flogger. I pointed this out too
---
follow the map marker to the door and go inside
---
Cool! I’m on line now actually!!
---
Bacon and Eggs!!! I finally got it! I had to go to the left side of the fountain by the flippin' tree!!
---
Just log out and back in. It'll auto-place you to the nearest location.
---
Yeah but no reductions in inputs on any perk cards, right?
---
Wow, thanks. I moved VATS to C but the game tells me to press Q so I didn't know wtf was going on. 😐
---
Supposedly there has been claims of alien spawned since this patch... Yet to see proof though.
---
Great! Please give me some time to do the math for all the needed materials!
---
Sorry, turns out just Tick Blood Tequila Sunrise and Greek Letters set right now.
---
This happens to me all the time. I had a Mr Gutsy with a protectron model. So it was just a protectron T-posing and floating towards me.
---
Is this in the signs set?
---
No problem... and it’s really just the stable/pure flux that I care about.
---
Good to know.  In this case, however, I was right there when she went down.  Probably the first 3 carcasses I looked at, maybe even first.  Thanks.
---
So do the lumberjack protectrons on treads near vault 76, the ones with the orange spinning lights on their heads
---
I think anyone who ran through the game isn't going to care about terminal entries. Not disparaging you, it disappoints me just as much that people have bypassed most entries, notes, holotapes, etc.
---
About of your post is purely speculation : Ammo converters ... fridges ....
---
As if either of these things actually present any issue for most players. Food spoilage? Food is ridiculously abundant. And ammo? I'm literally dropping thousands of rounds of all kinds of ammo all over the place.
---
And stretching out content? Who cares. Unless you pounded 100's of hours into the game short term. I'd rather have a steady flow of new content than a big drop every six months 
---
As if trying to keep players invested is a bad thing
---
Then it’s probably better for my mind’s sanity to just grab the fluxes! Thank you very much! My IGN is Sicily, will come soon.
---
They sub station above Watoga always has Deathclaw that either is fighting or killed various number of Ants, using butcher bounty I have always been able to craft Red Ant Lager from there, if I remember right it takes 2 Ant Meat pieces
---
Where all the Mothman eggs are at.
---
Woot!
---
Pretty sure you have to kill one to start it don’t you?
---
Fyi, they don’t really spawn if you’re a high level
---
Need a lowbie to spawn your mobs
---
Ah, I know the spot. Ty.
---
If your on Xbox I might have Mountain Honey
---
I also might have extra copy if the others don't pan out let me know

I completed it on my first char. Dunno how

Yeah I've gotten two outfits no mask yet...lol
---
You can find around ten at the shooting range in near Grafton
---
County roads,

test the game,

we'll refund,

How does one activate the pylons?

Well, shucks..

First person of all time

I competed it in my other character after I picked up the nuke tape.
---
What level are you?
---
There are a bunch outside of the Watoga train station. If you are doing Whitespring runs there are some in the club house, and a mess near a red car by the cabins.
---
If you’re doing any farming / traveling you’re bound to wander by those.
---
Wait I can get caps for spoiled food Thanks I will start selling asap
---
The SW workshop in the ash heap, and the charleston airport each have 3 oil nodes,l. I just let them fill while I was getting bottles.
---
Do you mean _fast travel_ out and back, or just walk a bit?
---
"Camera shy" lowers enemies attack damage by 10% when a photo is taken of them.
---
"Limelight" increases team damage by 10% when photo is taken of them
---
"Wildlife Photographer" makes you invisible while crouched with the camera equipped.
---
"Papparazi" taking a picture of an enemy has slight chance to paralyze for 3 seconds.
---
FYI: The increased amount doesn’t apply to challenges.
---
I.E. You can craft 21 film at a time with max ammosmith,  but it still only counts as crafting 12 towards the challenge.

SHHHHHHHH!!!!  My junk pile!  My precious!!!!  Bite your thieving tongue.     (kidding aside, yeah I really like that spot. I've only ever seen the Mothman at WS once.  It was recently and he was on the south east side of the golf course.   I've never seen the Flatwoods Monster there, ever.  I've been at that location since around the time of the BETA.)
---
🤣🤣
---
Damn, I was trying to watch for these posts! I'm assuming you didn't hang out for half an hour :)
---
What about a beaver?
---
Just pick up the camera off the corpse and it'll start
---
I'm still there... about 30 minutes in and two takers so far
---
The shooting range in Clarksburg?
---
&gt; Idk about you but managing resources/weight is what I hate most about the game.
---
You realize that it’s the same people who decided to make resource management so tedious that chose to put repair kits in the real money shop, right? 
---
Think of it this way. I walk into your room and slap you across the face. I do this every five minutes. I tell you that you can pay me $5 to not slap you one time. 
---
Are you thankful that I allow you to pay for no slapping? Or are you pissed that I slapped you, and pissed that I’d be such an ass to make you pay for me to stop?
---
Fallout 76 is fairly unique, and it has a lot of cool things going for it. I’ve enjoyed my time with it, mostly. With a bit (ie a fuckton) of work, it might actually get to a point that it’s genuinely a really good game. But right now, they’re slapping you across the face, and you’re not just taking it... you’re defending them! Have some self respect and realize when you’re being used, man.
---
there is a damage threshold. Not exactly sure what but it's a % of total health. Maybe 1%? It's true for all enemies.
---
it is easy to just gather everything in adventure mode and then transfer over to survival
---
I think so it’s up at the north of the map
---
"It's not a bug, it's a feature"
---
This has happened to me on PC. It happened a lot during Fasnacht. Server hopping won't resolve it. I had to close and relaunch Bethesda game client.
---
on PC?
---
Princess bed rocks why would you ever want to get rid of it?
---
Who said this?
---
No shit sherlock
---
I was really looking forward to paring this with the new data mined skull mask but sadly it isn't an outfit.
---
Oh man, thanks! Adding- Tazier
---
it is my 3rd legendary .50 cal at this point, and I love them all.
---
I have a Mutant explosive, zealot and now the action hero
---
You'd want to get far enough away to make the area reload, so it would be a long walk.  I'd fast travel to Watoga and back, that should be plenty.
---
It's a meme haha I don't think it has been said unironically
---
I was given the miscellaneous task to kill 10 of them back when I originally played the game; as far as I can recall, it triggered by just walking through the area. It took me around 130 hours before I saw 3 of them. Now I've played well over 200, and I haven't seen any since.
---
I think you're right that low-level players need to reach the area first, but it seems pretty much impossible to have them spawn new low-level mobs consistently AND reach the golfer ghouls in time to get your hits in.
---
Im actually curious, what are the rewards for completing it? Is it just caps and experience?
---
Literally everywhere. Train stations.
---
Go when you see a bunch of low levels there near the tennis courts and fairway... seems the low levels trigger it then swoop in!
---
Oh haha lol
---
On one side of the pylon, there is a keypad.  Hover your reticle over it and the option to "Activate" it will appear. 
---
Answering just in case you were legit asking, and not being sarcastic.  :)
---
Honestly, I'm alright with the removal of the legendaries.  It was a cheap way to farm gear. They don't even fight back.
---
So you actually were literally hitting them? Press whatever your interact button is when you're standing in front of one and facing it (the side with the green screen and keyboard). This make you a "Conduit" for that pylon, which continuously drains your health until you die. Once each pylon has a conduit, the IS will lose its shield and everyone can damage it.
---
They had to put something in the game to keep you dweebs that have 800 hours played busy but like I said , I hate Beth for ruining the franchise so clearly I’m aware of who is slapping me
---
I wish drinking up a brewed or picked up beer would just leave an empty bottle.
---
Oh, must be unlucky, not picked one up yet and I have been grinding
---
Incoming Scorchbeast at 2 Ca-  *dies*
---
Awesome. I was legit asking. When I show up I try to activate them but am unsure how. I’m assuming others have but they don’t glow. I’ve never been at the event when it starts.
---
This is a pretty decent solution to the problem. Too bad they didn't think of this.
---
Yup. I had *exactly* the same experience. They've gone to the trouble of adding that new plan, when it seems like they didn't want us to learn it? Or something? I feel like Bethesda can't even agree what they're doing anyway.
---
I'd you're having issues with scorchbeasts I question how much of the game you have played. I at level 104 still get wrecked by enemies in the right (or wrong) situation but handle SB's fairly handily. And I'm not even talking about mirelurk queens, spamming assaultrons, damn stapler gutsy's. 
---
SB's pale in comparison to big momma and at this point I wonder if you've been in a nuke zone, let alone launched one. Or even WhiteSprings when a high level is around.
---
Indeed - and this is how we go further down the slippery slope.  Don't blame you in the least bit though.
---
I've been messing with it all day as a form of fast travel, and it does work!  
---
Facing forward in third person, camera angle perpendicular with the character you will always fly left until you hit something (wall, mountain) Use leg armor pieces that have the reduce fall damage by 50% and you will always land safely. If you do it too close to the edge of the map you will get an infinite loading screen. For some reason the Thumbs Up one works the best?
---
Yup, misc mission xp and caps
---
So like, few hundred xp and 60caps tops
---
Well at least I know I didn't imagine the whole thing. This all happened this morning after pulling an all-nighter so I was a bit tired and later wondered if I imagined it, lmao. Maybe the devs are also a bit sleepy when they implement these code changes, would explain a lot.
---
I'm just enjoying the change of scenery. It gets boring just farming WS and West Tek
---
I'll help, GT aGraciousGod
---
I’ve got a Two-Shot missile launcher, and it only says it does 1 more damage than my Anti-Armor missile launcher. I still need to test the actual damage, but do you know if it actually does more than it says? Or should I just go with the AA?
---
They were going to put it on sale at the Atomic Shop but didn’t want to deal with the fire storm.
---
They already do, it's in the atom shop.
---
Invited you XXospjp somethin somethin
---
Ella Ames' Bunker has a lot, Near the Harper's Ferry Vendor there's a case of bottles
---
I've seen it at the white spring in the bathrooms on the golf course quite a few times. It's near a break in a wall where robots hang out
---
Just doesn’t tie the room together, Fat boy.  And I mean that in the nicest way.
---
Cool.  Glad to help.  :)    The keypad/screen is only on one side, so just keep circling it until you find it.  Might be worth stopping by there when the event isnt going on, to get familiar with where each of the pylons are, as well as, where the keypad is on each side.   During the event it's hectic and will be harder to "discover" when you're trying not to die.  Lol
---
Ham Radios or CRAM Radios?
---
Do you know how to complete the swamp flora challenge? Took pics of 3 or 4 of the enemies required but they didn't count (i know i have to see the name on the top right corner)
---
Charleston under the tracks SE of the train st
---
Here’s the problem people are holding 5,000 plus caps so raza using the price a little doesn’t work as much as you think
---
Soo weird! I've had him attacking my house twice and found him up the road past the bus a few times. Mothman always seems to show up by the tee box toward the excavator by the stream.
---
No. Live with your shame. 
---
Next time think before you buy.
---
You're thinking of the free states. They had prototype devices that would disorient the scorchbests and force them to land. There are a few around the nap that sometimes activate and event. You just fight a scorchbeast on the ground.
---
They just need to import this in to the game. https://fo76map.com ... problem solved.
---
Ok, hold up. You can play this game however you choose. there's 5 factions for inspired role play, 5 gangs to choose from for the raiders. Many players choose to be helpful "responders" or combat focused "brotherhood" some want a more authentic tense feeling and opt to play as raiders/ on survival servers. 
---
If you wanna play as a helpful dweller, you'll find the fo76 community a very positive one. r/fo76filthycasuals is also a great place, much less bickering. If you're on ps4 pm your psn and I'd love helping out a newbie, fair warning, i am a raider player, ergo i tend to also teach how to reasonably misbehave. 
---
Found a guy at his camp on survival, dude probably hit his junk limit and went home. Apparently his stash didn't have enough space because he was depositing as i gunned him down through the window. Shot the door down, took his bag, got slapped with a 200 cap bounty and got chased around Appalachia for half an hour. Twas fun.
---
Charleston train station? Or the city
---
So you’re aware that they’re slapping you, but you’re still defending them slapping you and everyone else? What?
---
Also, what do repair kits have to do with people who play too much? The rate of weapon degradation and repair costs are the same regardless of how many hours you’ve played that day. It has nothing to do with this.
---
As many people have pointed out, Bethesda sold you a problem, and now they’re selling you the solution. Don’t buy repair kits unless you have literally zero self respect. But hey, if you want to live your life as a sheep boy, don’t let me stop you man. It’s 100% your choice.
---
It’s always a wendigo that spawn there for me
---
Not skins the color of the text and light
---
I get the occasional CTD that I think are related to something with the graphics (usually happens when I'm turning fast, or sometimes on login when the world first tries to display).  But it's pretty rare, and hasn't happened on SBQ or any other fights.
---
maybe.
---
Why are you so aggressive
---
Assaultron Head plans are bugged since the patch. I bought one off of a vendor because it told me I didn't know it (even though I did) and when I used it it told me I already knew Salvaged Assaultron Head, but that I also learned Imposter Assaultron Head, which is not available to craft.
---
I make my own signs with intended controversial content that doesn't break any rules. Example: "Used Children and Legal Advice Available Within. Daycare Available Upon Request." It's a good way to get people to attack your base.
---
Ohok thanks
---
I dont think your problem is common enough to fix. Most of us just let it go. How much are you over? Do you have any perks and equipment to drop weapon or inventory weight?
---
Dang, I always liked following Phoenix around and watching him rampage against the watoga bots.
---
Fast travelling to you!
---
Here is the serums list:
---
Bird bones
---
Carnivore
---
Egg head
---
Electrically charged
---
Grounded
---
Scaly skin
---
Speed demon
---
Twisted muscles
---
But...but...
---
If you spawn in at the st and head across the train tracks toward the city he can spawn under them. As soon as you cross the tracks turn back toward the st, if he doesn’t spawn by the time you’re back over the tracks server hop and try again.
---
No prob. I got a little excited at first when it happened because I thought I got an Atom Shop item for free, haha.
---
I had a stroke reading that
---
Hahaha that doesn't help
---
I'll probably end up bailing on the task then, honestly. It's just sitting there, likely to never be finished, and the game doesn't list our completed miscellaneous stuff anyways (heck, it doesn't even seem to track our daily or event completion all that well).
---
Cool. I’ll in Whitesprings.
---
Also, graham can spawn down on the road south of the station, and the vendor bit can spawn behind the house across from the station. So keep your eyes out for them as you look for the monster.
---
Lol If being called Fat Boy bothered me I wouldn't have used it in my user name so it's all good.
---
I bet on everybody else giving up and leaving the queue.
---
Thanks. Praise Mothman
---
It would be sort of difficult for me to explain at this point, I have taken a break from 76 and haven't played in like 3 months :(. Path of exile has been keeping me busy lately. Got to level 170s on 76 and kinda ran out of entertaining stuff to do. From what I do remember, there is a semi hidden passage that leads to a little side room with a waterfall and it was back there. As soon as you jump up on a ledge at the waterfall look down at your feet. If I get back on 76 I will make a trip back and try explain better. I think I took a screenshot on my ps4 if i did I'll see if I can get it on here. I've never used imgur or anything so I'll have to figure that out.
---
Second you , but they removed the wendigo now it’s only a glowing bloaty if lucky
---
They'd also need to do events that are interesting. No matter how I turn it the 'follow the messenger' one with like two lvl5 radrats attacking is really poor and sad. And it would be ok if it was for this event alone.
---
Watoga the entire city has over 20 the train station has over 10
---
Really hate the title but agree with the subject
---
Yeah i thought i got the headgear for
---
It's an inconvenience, and it serves no purpose. All it does is waste time and make the game annoying to play.  Unfortunately there are a lot of annoying things about the game, and together they add up and the whole game just feels like an annoyance. This would be an easy QoL change.
---
That said, I am more in support of having crafting, durability, weight and utility perks like lead belly be things that you slot into universal perk card slots, the number of which increase as you level up. Allows players to still have a focus with these kinds of cards, while not detracting too much from perk cards that define combat roles. 
---
Overall would minimize the time spent managing cards, but still allow for player choice and card diversity. It would also make more builds possible, as special points would be free for more interesting things than spoilage or carry weight.
---
Yo i got like 4 of 'em.  I need Cranberry Moonshine and White Russian if anyone's got em.  PC.
---
Unfortunately I dont have an extra. Hope you find one!
---
I’ll be honest, the best I ever got was three legendaries, most of the times I’d go there I’d get one to none.
---
What’s Charleston st? South train?
---
Thanks for taking the time to reply :) Yeah, I'm struggling to find stuff in 76 to keep me busy myself.  Yeah, If you find a pic that'd be cool. If not, that's fine too mate. Cheers!
---
Sorry something came up. I'll Be on around eightish . 😅
---
Move your camp? That should put everything into the "Stored" tab where you scrap and try to place it again.
---
Unfortunately, you can’t share ATOM Shop items in camps :( In workshops you can, but not in personal camps.
---
I’m on PS4. Been trying to get the plans for the kegs since the Nukashine update.
---
Also, does anyone know if there are plans for the barrel you can drum on in the frat house? I’d love to have that at my CAMP.
---
I like blocker and all the dps perks personally.
---
Check the armor workbench for your Easter Bunny head :)
---
Yes, we were activating the pylons. They all three became a lovely blue, each and every time.
---
Any spots or can i sign up for the next 1?
---
Still just want tattoos that look like tattoos please k thanks.
---
If you die you should be able to fast travel to your camp. Or buffets, they don't help with being way over encumbered though.
---
What level? Ide buy that off you
---
shit thats true. well.... shit. i hope it all works out.
---
I’m sorry, st is an abbreviation for station. Spawn at the train st and head across the bridge toward the city.
---
Thank you very much! I really appreciated it.
---
My build is no mutations and weapon is level 50 All Rise so perks are the 2h ones gain str with rads. Can 2 to 3 shot a SB which knocks the corpse flying away like a baseball... then takes the same amount of hits to kill normal   ghoul...
---
No problem man, I will come back to 76 once there's a several new things for me to do. It was most definitely a symbol though! Maybe I'll hop on tonight and do a quick run in there, I'll keep ya posted
---
You can drop those items. You just choose not to drop them. Suffer the consequences.
---
Thanks for the tip, I'll make sure to get it.
---
And thankfully the community managers said they were going to make nuke zones count as radstorms, let's hope it happens soon.
---
No problem. Stop by anytime.
---
You gotta have it get hella close.  I called one down with the Govt Supply Holotape, and when it was almost landed with the crate it was too far away.  It dropped the crate and flew away and I just barely managed to snag it.  Took up like 90% of my screen, so super close and zoomed in.
---
Dude. You’ve inspired me. This is awesome.
---
It's a pretty small percentage, it doesn't really factor in except with enemies with huge health pools like SBQ.  But with as many shots as they stated it should have easily cleared that.
---
Hate a game as much as you want but this is too fucking far
---
Nice it got the fallout style.
---
I disagree. If you are in any of the fallout 76 marketplaces, you know there are people who always have inventory to sell. I have several of these people on my friend list. Player vending will allow me to pop into their server and FT to their camp to browse their wares and  buy from them without having to arrange a meetup/go to stash/etc.
---
I understand your point, but you must understand that there is a lot more going on in the trading community than randomly wandering into people and starting a trade.
---
Move your camp. It doesn't belong there
---
What kind of security measures do you have in place? I mean someone could just spam 100 orbital strikes mid match. Or there may be some "semi" nude streakers running a muck lol im just saying. But i might actually have to dl twitch to see your event.
---
I've gotten duplicates of the BOS paints for sure.
---
But you can just buy 1000 atoms for $20-30 bucks depending on your currency!!!1! /s
---
Experience or other rare outfits are about the only reason
---
Alright, is it the first bridge or the second one , if you would know
---
Sending request
---
We hit (activated), sorry, I didn't realize people actually hit the pylon's instead of clicking E in front of it. Every pylon was activating, the message on top of the screen said she was able to be attacked. She never went out of invisible mode. We did this throughout the event. Some guy blamed Tod Howard for messing it up, some dude said it was bugged as well, we all chatted about it AFTER the event failed, because we couldnt hit her.
---
I’m right there with you, man. I was under the impression that it was something Biv awarded the player for doing his daily challenges.
---
I'm still looking for nuka-quantum grenades. Good luck! Hope you find em.
---
I rarely ever saw legendaries there, but thr fact that I just can't is a real kick in the teeth.... I loved running around there and punching them!
---
Yeah I would take some non-face tattoos :(
---
You still on? Starting up and would like to shop your wares.
---
There's about a dozen pumpkins growing right behind the house- 3 behind the garage, then another in the bushes, then 3 more in the little ravine.  Then another 2 or 4 or something up the way south, so you can solve Jack's quest in like 50 steps.
---
Found the one at the moth man museum in front of the statue beside the museum
---
Robots usually stop respawning for me long before I can get close to killing 30 of them!
---
I picked up to today as well for 4/24 at The enclave in the desks. The problem might be a lot of people are probably farming this technical data and it's begun to make it very difficult to obtain.
---
I think this would have worked if they did it on launch, not in the update. Getting a nice little side quest with a small little reward of a mounted head plan for exploring would be cool when starting out. But now when most players have already explored that area and have no reason to go back, it makes it tedious and unfriendly towards the player. It would have been better if they kept this current system but automatically gave the quest to anybody who already "cleared" that area
---
We hecking need crossplay
---
You’re telling me...lol. I don’t even like using explosive weapons because how often I get the damage glitch and their health shoots back up instantly. Tried it on pvp too. Same problem. You’d figure for a $3 billion company, they would invest in quality servers. It can’t be that hard to maintain 24 man servers decently.
---
I agree with you about licensed plumber, but not white knight.
---
The stacking effect of LP and GS was an issue, and so they brought things more inline. No other type of weapon can stack two cards that directly increase lifespan. 
---
White Knight is a different animal, for two reasons. The first is that armor breaks way faster than weapons, so far as I have observed as a melee/heavy gun player. The second is that the main material to repair many (and the best) armors is Ballistic Fiber, which is the junk resource I encounter the absolute least of. In fact, I only ever encounter it in a few key locations, and pretty much h from one source - military ammo bags. The same cant be said of any material used to repair weapons.
---
Lastly, these nerds happened before we knew about repair kits, not before Bethesda knew about repair kits.
---
Need any caps? I’m looking and been trying to get the T60 Knight...
---
You claimed repair kits negated all need for junk and all risk of death, not that it did so only if you chose to play melee/limited ammo builds while having no interest in upgrading new gear or your camp.  Since any new gear will ask have to be modded, not to mention how poor armor maintained purely through the use of repair kits will perform when compared to that of someone maintaining theirs at 200% whenever they repair (since the added durability does increase its dr too).
---
If they are spending money on it, then there is just as much a chance they actually care more about looking good and showing off as there is with anyone else (possibly even more tbh).  There isn't really any basis to your assumption on this point.  
---
Even with your own assumptions you just explained, you added the caveat that repair kits can negate all need instead of maintaining your original claim that they do.  Whether or not repair kits negated such a need overall isn't a matter of opinion, and as someone who has played diligently since BETA I'm sure you are well aware of how few people fall into the category (if any) of actually not needing to collect junk due to repair kits.  The only people I can imagine might fall into this category already take steps that make this a moot point (either they have a secondary account/friends for collection and crafting/modding or they simply stash what they need before going off killing).
---
Not liking repair kits and worrying about their impact is fine, but extreme claims about them negating all value for junk/risk of death are just alarmist fiction.
---
Lol. 
---
Nerfing food. As if the spoilage rate made that much of a difference. Through the general course of a 1-2 hour game play session I generally have to stop picking up food as I go, or I end up with far too much of it. 
---
And as for ammo converters? What you want them to let us sell our ammo? 
---
Ok. Well you just completely deflated cap values. Because I've dropped thousands upon thousands of rounds. Even at .5 caps a bullet, I'd be flush with caps at all times.
---
I love conspiracy theorists.
---
There are about what, at least 50 BoS corpses in T51, dead, around the place. Makes u wonder, 50 of them surely is stronger than one of you. Maybe if they stopped carrying Pre-War money and loaded up on Fusion Cores, but who knows.
---
You have a lot of "feelings" about things, but not alot of evidence to back up your speculation....
---
I have an idea. Dont emote with the camera. Its no big deal
---
I think this could be a workaround to a different issue that's popped up from time to time, Jamey the respawn issue where it says you're overebcumbered but actually aren't because certain carry weight buffs aren't being applied properly. Sure, people would complain about the extra cost, but at least you have more options than just be vault, the nearest marker, or your camp.
---
Yes sir
---
Joy, more caps...
---
The first one. Follow the train tracks across the bridge, when you reach the other side turn around and if it’s not there server hop. When I did it for the vendor bot the monster showed up every 10 or so servers.
---
Damn, I know there's one for armour but I don't think there's one for weapons.
---
What slippery slope? 
---
Buying a stash increase provides a near non existent advantage. It's another convenience.
---
That's the Grafton Monster, not the Flatwoods Monster
---
OP do you use discord at all?  Or would you be interested in a discord bot to facilitate this?  I have one Im working on a bot for a different game, but that also runs 8 person brackets.  I need MOAR TESTERS.   
---
It would allow you to run more than one 8 person bracket at a time, message me if you're interested and we can talk further.
---
I can’t even finish the nukashine quest lol, stopped playing for a couple weeks (just after finding Biv) and when I came back I found the quest wasn’t in my list, can’t get it to reappear either.
---
Agreed.
---
RemindMe! 56 days
---
Pretty sure the vendors pay 0 caps for it. 
---
But if you make it into fertilizer then bulk it, you can sell it, but a single bulk fertilizer takes 200 spoiled food.
---
What system? PC here.
---
Glad they got an arrest. WTF is wrong with people it's a game grow up.
---

---
How the hell do you climb the other peak?
---
Absolutely! Dataminers say they keg plan is coming. I’d love the barrel plan. Add that to the list with the frame drum and mouth harp. I guess we can’t have all the fun in CAMP and need to venture out once in a while.
---
My buddy may have a set. Xbox. Ill ask him
---
Why would i make a turret there? I need a place to craft, store loot, that is near WS for nuked legendary farming
---
Xbox... sorry, thanks though!
---
Yeah. I’ve been to three events now and that first one was frantic. Died a few times.
---
Nice. Xbox here. I have caps, plans, mods, etc. Thanks.
---
Did you know you can "turn off" quests to hide them from the HUD?
---
Man I got excited for a moment. However I may still sell my spoiled food. Sounds funner than dropping it.
---
Uh, AFAIK, vendor inventory is unique to each player, unless it's a item a player has sold.
---
That's why people post about Grahm and that Travelling Vendor Bot, you can get a friend to hold the server and keep joining to reset their unique inventory.
---
I’ve left the area, but still on the same server. Ansel is at Colonel Kelly.
---
The BoS combat armor in this game looks so good, especially with the officer suit.
---
Yeah I think I may have jumoped the gun abit.  Seems to be working ok now.
---
It defo didn't at one point but maybe I just didn't give it enough time after taking the item and quiting the server.  Maybe needs 1 minute to 'save'.
---
It's a very big deal, not only did I die, but the game also froze up on me and closed itself.
---
hmm so yeah maybe that's not a big deaaaaallll????
---
Isn't the mascot head the most common drop?
---
I won’t buy them . I fix my stuff to 200% and haven’t even played much since they came out so I haven’t gotten any from the queen . 
---
The people who play a shit ton need small tasks to keep them busy I.e resources , extravagant camps, taking pictures ,ect...
---
Golf Club is one of the most popular farming spots in the game. There's a bad tendency for people to build turret bases behind the Golf Club, whether to piss people off or simply because they don't know better. Such camps have a higher tendency to be leveled by other players.
---
Appalachian Antiques, Sunday Brothers Cabin and Lucky Hole Mine all have chances to spawn them.

Weapons artisan never works with my melee weapons only guns. Anyone else able to get 200% repair on melee with the weapon artisan perk?
---
Agree, I'd much rather be able to scrap/convert ammo.
---
There is actually a pretty big trade market on discord for ammo though.
---
TBH, no I think your idea would fail, even if it wasn't Bethesda running the show.
---
1. With camp the way they are. It fall fat on it's face.
---
2. Even with a spawn of 1 min. (Never going to happen). The amount of people farming for plans wold be outrageous. (On a side note if all spawns we're instanced to your toon maybe it would work but at the cost of server stability.
---
3. PvP idiots in adventure mode nuff said.
---
4. Workshops/ silos.
---
I understand where you are coming from. Bethesda should of set server population a lot higher.
---
A good way of looking at this is the following setup
---
Region based persistent world's (Max capacity of 500 people per world. This is cluster 1.
---
 Background spawn world. This is cluster 2. This cluster holds all the transactions of if a container, area,mob,zone ect is active or not, has had plans picked up or not ect. There are no players this is a database cluster only.
---
Combat calculation cluster. This is where all combat/damage is calculated and resolved. (Another database cluster)
---
Camp cluster. ( Instanced world of no major mobs and just camps and towns of camps. (Random spawns of enemies still can and should happen)
---
What this basic setup allows is for the end user to see  as an example
---
Adventure Mode
---
NA world 1  population low
---
NA world 2 population high
---
NA world 3 population high (locked world)
---
Instqnced
---
And the same goes for each region. You are able to see what friends are playing and what world's they are on if not population locked you can join them.
---
When entering in a world . You zone in as normal and play as normal only difference you see is when you fast travel or walk to your camp your transferred to the camp cluster and your dot shows still on the world (but at a camp location).
---
I know I explained it poorly and will edit my post after I get off mobile .
---
I don't think it's coming. I have the ability so I think it's already available. I don't recall where I got it though.
---
Sucks but thats life

I've defended Bethesda forever. I logged on today, and am in fact playing right now. Just checked these notes and I'm so upset I could vomit. We told them what we wanted. All of us. They did exactly what we thought they were gonna do: announce p2w, wait until the news cycles and the backlash dampens, Include them a patch or two later. They're doing exactly what every modern video game profit machine does; follow the addiction model because it proves the most profitable. (Who cares if the game has no integrity and we take advantage of people?)  That issue aside, you promised us. You promised us. YOU PROMISED US.
---
I defended you at launch by telling people to keep an open mind. I was right, the game is awesome).I defended you shortly after that when load times were ridiculous (this world is crazy big, idk how something like this even gets coded). I've defended you at every turn because I thought you were genuinely trying to make the game better. With no incentive to sell, your only possible incentive was that you really wanted a better game). I thought, as many of us did, that with every bug fix and content improvement you were just trying to make the game better. 
---
Nope. We see your intentions unfolding. A precedent has been set; and you know that too, because that's the plan that you setup. you can sidetrack us with fake candor as much as you want, but from the bottom of our hearts, we see what you're doing. We hate it. And you are liars. If you wanted to make a p2w game, you should have been honest about it. You are liars.

The Flatwoods Monster counts on the kill challenge, odd that he does not count for the photo one!
---
They want you to buy currency.
---
It’s the one with a truck under it ?
---
Oh shit... I guess I read to fast! Sorry OP, there’s no set location I know of for the Flatwoods monster. All my encounters since the beta were in random enemy spawns.
---
Have you check in your completed list?
---
Warframe is a model that many modern online games should be looking at. There's a reason dedicated fans are willing to spend $100+ on every new prime pack that comes out, even if they already own half the stuff in there
---
Agreed, the blue and black are beautiful together.
---
Really ? Ill have to try that. Although I am not built into shotguns and for the rest of us who prefer melee we just want the thing to come closer.
---
I hope you have a boatload of Caps because the prices are insane
---
Apparently it was leaked as a reward for completing a weekly challenge. Not sure if that’s 100% accurate though. 
---
My guess is that next weeks update will be another filler update that will give us The Sheepsquatch + New Sheepsquatch Event and all the Bar themed CAMP items + the NukaShine Paint in the Atomic Shop. 
---
Maybe it will possibly release then? 
---
Either that or they will do another downtime update and add more content, which I doubt since they already have a ton of items ready for release in the files that were updated in the latest update.
---
You keep licking Bethesda’s boots and you might get some dog shit stuck in your teeth.
---
You can just...walk somewhere. You aren't stuck in Whitesprings. Sure, you might have to pace yourself, pop some Sugar Bombs, drink a couple Nuka Colas, but you can still explore just fine.
---
Make a mine field and lure them through it.
---
I've deal with these almost daily 😔
---
Toledo is $36 away from Detroit.
---
You see how stupid that sounds?
---
Please stop replying...to any of the reddit threads ever again.

"The dog bit me while I was holding the camera and I teleported!"   ...is the best
---
This is what whiskey is for.
---
PVP here I come
---
Nice, ok this alone makes it worth it
---
That is very true
---
I’m going to try timing a Nukashine blackout so that the emote launches me in the air but I blackout before landing.
---
Did you register the lvl 25 one even though you didn't do Miner Miracles?
---
I’m sorry, I got the grafton and Flatwoods misters mixed up. I don’t know if any definite spawns for the Flatwoods monster.
---
Send this to the top! Sure, they shouldn’t have removed the only viable way of getting fuel until after they implemented a fix, but bitching isn’t going to accomplish anything. It’s already in the works.
---
there are so many side quests i don't even know exist. i guess bethesda prefers i run in circles til i get bored and stop playing instead of providing better ways for me to stumble upon new side quests and actually play the game more.
---
A good Red is a Dead Red.
---
All good lol
---
lol wow i'm dumb XD Thanks XD
---
I keep seeing people misspelling 'queue' and I'm starting to think it's a conspiracy.
---
P2W that doesn’t even give you what you paid for. Nice.
---
Nightmare fuel
---
I'm not even sure, to be honest. I don't recall doing anything about registering power armor, though.
---
If they don’t make it limited time you’ll save up for it with the currency earned in game.
---
They don’t make any new revenue that way.
---
Wow. Having a hissy fit?
---
If your on PS4 I have him right now
---
Replying

I waved hello to the sky in the middle of a forest

[I woke up on the back of a cart] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=s-6wGkJns0I)
---
LMAO, next major patch? which will probably be in 7 months or something...ridicoulus.
---
That would be rough to get the timing right. Since the action tends to generate a lot of lag
---
That’s okay thanks for offering!
---
Wow , you opened up a whole new artsie fartsie thing...new fonts next!
---
With a name like mine, I need it in my camp more than anything else.
---
I genuinely hope you get it!
---
Fast travel to the rock, look up at the mountains.  It's the one on the left, it's just a little bit taller.  You gotta be a super goat to get all the way up to the top, but there's some stuff scrawled on a rock and an imported chinese panda up there on a little flat spot.
