Let’s see the screenshot

Happens to me as well. Everyday I am disconnected multiple times since the latest hotfixes and patch. I get blue screened even more tho. Every day I get blue screened at least twice when I first log into a world, and it's usually within 5 minutes or so of logging in. I noticed it happens most often when accessing a stash box, or a crafting station. I am on PS4 btw.
---
No, all the produce &amp; fruit plants at my CAMP farm when it was in the blast zone of nuke became irradiated and turned into flux fruits and veggies like cobalt, yellow cake, and fluorescent that needed for crafting buffs and under armor 
---
I’ve have pacifist enabled, and rather then deal w/clowns it’s just easier to logging off 
---
Because while I find it fun to poke at assholes (because I am one) I also dont feel like its necessary to better every person I interact with because I have my own issues to deal with. Flawed logic runs deep and I'm not here to be a therapist. 
---
[removed]
---
YES!
---
Should ve said something before hand.
---
Try moving the PA bench, it may be too close to a wall. Or remove the walls around it?
---
That means that now they'll need to drop _100_ bobby pins to use it without being encumbered!
---

---
Oh, the humanity.
---
Twas a joke 
---
I’m not by a bench.
---
No problem, good info to know for when you actually get to the part where you can use them because collecting them is kind of a pain in the butt. I remember the first time I got one, I thought I had found something special, now I don’t even pick them up any more. 
---
I prefer the pump shotgun but I'm sure the combat shotgun is better becUse of its fire rate.
---
I'm not sure. It's live on PC as a limited time item. Did consoles get the update or are we PC scrubs the little labrats?
---
Quad double barrel explosives 
---
Ya sorry not just lvl 50. There are random lvls. 
---
This is awesome! Does that location have any annoying enemy spawns? I may try this myself.
---
Sounds like a lag issue? Like the server isn't catching up to the fact that you've repaired anything and when you fast travel, it forces a refresh of the/your cached data which, apparently, isn't saving your weapons repaired CND status.
---
The servers are supposed to save your progress or state: every 10 minutes and when you complete a quest step, fast travel or when you log off. Something isn't registering correctly for you.
---
Try repairing your gear then logging off. See if it stays repaired.
---
We have had people waiting for an hour. It's just faster, always will be till private servers are running.
---
I do like to farm, but as u suggest, a root cellar or working cooler/icebox sure would be nice. 
---
Wow. So it's like, never buy from Atodd Shop?
---
I never had a problem until today, seemed like my shots were all missing at 95% for some odd reason 
---
I have problems with Ballistic and screws. Because everything needs screws and Ballistic only comes from like 3 pretty rare things. 
---
You're not here to do anything except jerk yourself off. You wont engage with an actual argument because you know you will get beat down. So your best bet is to "poke" and beat around the Bush saying as little as possible, but just enough to get a douchebagboner.
---
This has been patched....no longer works.
---
Really good to know, glad there's people out there doing that too, makes a change from everyone hating on the game.
---
I would very much like to donate some caps to you. If you're on PC add me - Dyonas. Seems better than asking for your name so you don't get tons of friend requests.
---
Quiting to menu and entering a new server fixes it as well. I've had it happen twice sense the new patch.... but that's the least of the issues I've had sense the patch to say the least. DTC no errors and no warning.... interior cells are now laggy and jerks the screen around and makes it hard af to travel in an interior little alone run and gun... losing things I picked up and quests being set back 2-3 stages when it CTD... 
---
Remove the pieces from the frame.  When you log out the frame should show up in your inventory.
---
I think everyone admits the game has more than its share of bugs.  But those who play it, and stick with it, do so because they realize there's also something very special buried in there, greater than the sum of its parts.
---
Bethesda never really knew how to market it.  We live in an age where the adage "If you're explaining, you're losing" is more true than we'd like to admit, but 76 needed explanation.  And I think when it was Todd Howard, that's what we got.  The developers were honest - this is going to be an experiment and a learning experience for all of us.  That contrasts harshly with the slick and overproduced launch trailer, the console bundles, the merchandising, the bizarre Atomic Store pricing, etc.
---
But the proof is in the pudding, right?  The game itself *is* a rather understated affair.  If you want to get the most out of it, you want to take your time.  You need to read.  You want to stand there and admire the view for a bit.  It's not some bombastic in-your-face massive co-op game that the later marketing suggested, and that threw a lot of people.
---
I was going to upvote this anyway, but when I saw I'd roll it over from +399 to +400, I was utterly compelled.
---
&gt; wounded characters can also be executed with gunshots to the head, resulting in decapitation  
---
  
---
Hmm.... I havent seen this happen but now I feel I'd like to make it happen
---
Yup. That was Bethesda showing clear interest in what the AAA industry was doing ($$$)
---
This comment is doomed to go right over people's heads.
---
I’ll try that.
---
I need you as a friend in real life. 
---
Yup same
---
Well I mean you could have cancelled after the beta. Every bethesda game is buggy on release and slow to be patched.
---
Then tell me how it does work because that is how I'm used to it working since base building became a thing in Fallout 4. I'm not saying you're wrong I'm asking you to show me otherwise.
---
That comment is a joke, and also a reference to anchorman :-)
---
Point 1: yes. point 2: no. point 3: yes. Point four: yes, I am most definitely a douchebagboner.
---
Whoopsie, misread it then while also going off memory alone. Either way, I wouldn't even touch any Energy weapon except the Gauss/Tesla Rifles, or the Gatling Laser/Plasma's.
---
 Normie Laser/Plasma Rifles even fully upgraded are trash right now. A Tesla Rifle does more damage with Fusion Cells, able to hit about 150 thru perks alone, while Plasma/Laser can hardly(if they even can) break 100. 
---
Yeah, it seems like this game is trying to break the huge hoarding habits that Bethesda has conditioned us into. Every other Elder Scrolls and Fallout game I've played is a hoarder's paradise! It's been a big learning curve for me. If it makes you feel any better, I dropped 95 levels worth of hoarded ammo on purpose...I realized it just isn't worth the weight.
---
Only thing i have bought on shop are the snipers outfit and the blackbird paint, like and use em both.
---
So as a game developer you guarantee that all the devs that work fro that company want to continue working on this piece of shit game? You think fo76 was their goal in life? What a joke.
---
You were right about the domestic kitchen tables being the three of varying sizes! I’m down to park bench now haha. Great job!!!!
---
Maybe the server crashed due to the large number of items you were transferring?
---
If they are next to him, and letting him freely chat with other strange adults on the internet - they should have their head examined.
---
I'm guessing it's more likely they have no idea what their kid is doing.
---
This is absolutely true, like bringing a child into a pub and complaining because people are drinking around the child  
---
Err no, that child is in the wrong domain
---
That was an overtly hostile answer to a completely innocuous question. 
---
The graft that was placed in your jaw was processed with acid to remove calcium and expose the growth proteins.  Those proteins triggered a biological response by the living tissue in your jaw, starting a process that remodeled that graft into new solid bone.
---
That wouldn’t happen if you put non-demineralized bone powder into a hole in a weapon made of dead bone.
---
Ok, got it! Seems like tuesday will mark the end of darkness after all. 
---
Yesterday was also my first day of being trolled/ griefed on PC. If you run into Godboss or whatever his name was, he is a super troll that seemed like he was cheating.
---
He completely destroyed my house and then didnt take any damage when me and my friends (90 and 100+ levels) retaliated. He was naked with a eyebot helm on, and thats it.
---
Ahh, the one point you can lie about and no one can prove, except you. But you wont. Convenient.
---
This is amazing!  Thank you!
---
Ha
---
That worked thank you.
---
I'm bored so willing to reply. I'm high so unwilling to argue, why would I argue with you too? 
---
That's what I did. I put down on piece of raw asbestos. It showed up. So then I put the screws in that bag. Then *poof*. Lesson learned, that doesn't always work. 
---
When I have that problem, I can usually exit the PA right after I fast travel.
---
False. At this point I am still not defending any individual party or person.
---
Sure I’m flawed like literally everyone else, but that doesn’t stop how easily one can point out the flaws in the “connect-the-dots”logic game people love playing here. 
---

61 downvotes off a 5 upvoted stupid comment?  Man, you guys love telling me how right I am all the time here.
---
I suspect BGS have no idea which items resulted from duping and which did not. They may have systems in place now, but they didn't when the damage was done.
---
At this point, I'd say just delete all TSE weapons from player inventories. Yes, some people will suffer genuine grief over losing a genuine trophy weapon, but even if half of my weapons were TSE I had earned legitimately, I'd personally be fine with Bethesda destroying them if it meant they also destroyed the vast majority of duped items alongside.
---
Could of been, but it should of only been me and not the server i would think.
---
I too have killed myself many times trying to perk into explosives
---
Actually just found a plan for it, i think,  last night! I havent gotten a chance to use it yet
---
#Constant disconnects on PC. **constant**

This happened to me all last night. I honestly kept checking my mouse to see if i pressed the DPI button... felt like i was rubberbanding all over hell. Didnt have that problem today though.
---
Welcome to Fallout 76 :)
---
You wouldn't, because you cant. I made my stance clear. Can you read?
---
&gt;Quiting to menu and entering a new server fixes it as well.
---
It may have worked for you but it hasn't for me.
---
Best for OP to try all possible solutions.
---
Regardless of what you think, "giving too much credit where credit isn't due." Is... an... opinion ! :)
---
Apologies, I sincerely didn't mean to be hostile... upon review, I think poor word choice caused misunderstanding... I shouldn't have said "seriously", it's often used in a derogatory way. Was just trying to gauge whether you were a serious response or forgot /s. Cheers. =)
---
I have 2 TSE weapons one is a vastly superior to the other.  If you think I wouldnt be willing to sell the second one the moment I need caps you are entirely wrong.  Ranged Two shot weapons are almost completelt useless because the bullets no longer travel straight.  Explosives in close range can be hazardous.  Not everyone sees these things god sends.
---
25k cap limit doesnt help
---
Because its a laughably easy game and duping is pathetic, but for actual reasons - it destabilizes servers and can ruin the gameplay of others because many of these dupers are doing so just to grief other players with infinite anything.
---
Special bobble heads don’t stack.  Explosive bobble heads do.  Information from post made earlier today about how people are one shotting pacifist players.  Link is below.
---
https://amp.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/af6kei/people_one_shotting_you_in_pacifist_is_because_of/
---
So how many shots per shotgun shell? Or is that just the shell as a whole I have 596 on my explosive quad 
---
Double barrel. 
---
It was exactly the same in Fallout 4. Can't believe so many people don't remember that. 
---
You are cheating. 
---
FTFY. No "kinda" about it. 
---
It's when you're technically in combat.
---
I'm thinking beyond myself man. Just because I don't have duped equipment doesn't mean I can't empathize with the thousands that do. 
---
My enjoyment isn't at stake. Yeah. But this is a multiplayer game. I've had fun with others in it. I have fun with others talking about it. Other people, just like me, would have their time investment in our shared hobby taken away.
---
Is that healthy for a community that's trying to grow? For a game with years of planned support and updates. Potential years of enjoying time with other people having fun with the same thing as me. We have enough issues in the modern social media gaming world of feeling remotely welcome or happy about anything. You buy a game and you feel alone. You log on to the community boards and resources, but you're just looking stuff up, logging off, and getting back to it. Multiplayer games should make you feel social, but they don't. You're logging on to compete and overcome others. Competition. 
---
Multiplayer in this game is focused on camaraderie. I don't want people I run into during gameplay evaluating whether I'm a cheater just because I kill shit. I don't want people to think I'm trying to steal their weapon with a completely fabricated trade bug when I want to give them something. I don't want people that are having a positive time with the game feel judged and punished by a developer for simply getting a gun from some duper playing Santa. There's enough sour feelings in the community over stuff that doesn't feel good or came from misinformation. 
---
We don't need a reason or trigger to make thousands of devoted fans get bummed out with the game and quit. Put yourself in their shoes. Would that not put a bad feeling in the pit of your stomach? I'd quit. Good game and all, but it'd feel personal and kinda ruin the whole vibe.
---
I don't want that for anyone. In fact I wish the duping had never happened and you felt like the game was fair. 
---
You gotta work out how to play the hand you're given though. And the hand Bethesda had when duping was first starting is completely different than the one today.
---
When you talk about it bringing you in is there some kind of teleport trigger?
---
Awesome thanks!
---
Yeah any BoS groups.
---
Right on, I guess tone is difficult to convey through text. Have a good one!
---
60% of the time every time?
---
Saying they "shouldn't be playing" insinuates that ERSB ratings are a law governed by an authority. They're self-regulated within the industry and are so parents have the information to decide what games their kids play. 
---
They're not a good excuse to act that a dickfart because, again, they are not a measurement of how people who lack self-control are going to manage themselves online. 
---
You can use the argument that you don't believe people under 17 (or under 18 if you're in Europe/Japan or 15 in Australia cause people think differently about media and kids) should play the game, it's your choice how to personally view age categories in a medium. At the end of the day that argument will still fall flat as age restrictions don't actually entitle people to be scrutiny free when they're a dick or troll towards anyone of any age.
---
Hhahahah great story Hansel. 
---
Fuck this dude and all the assclowns like him. I 100% do not care in the slightest if people are duping and cheating on their own private servers but I don't want to interact with this trash on my game. 
---
What the hell are you even playing for at that point if you're lugging 20k of one mat around? 
---
You are the hero this game needs! Thank you!!

Tesla Beaton is unique version of Tesla Cannon from Fallout 3

Failure to adhere to your whims and demands doesnt necessarily mean a shortcoming of my own. I wasn't arguing with you to begin with and I refuse to argue with you about an argument you weren't involved in now. 
---
Face it, you're unimportant and I'm bored so you get to throw some insults at the backboard and hope they stick. Right?
---
This for sure, I love mine.  Reload action is for 2 shells and then you are at 8 in the gun.   I got mine as an honest drop, and love it for clearing out Whitesprings
---
Well it will say like t-51 calibrated shocks and whatnot
---
Mhmm
---
That is what happened I exited and came back then it was in my inventory.
---
It’s just kind of odd to interacting with people who don’t have mics or who just get in the way.
---
He gave you a pretty light ribbing at best. It's nothing to worry about. It's more smart ass than toxic. Don't let your reaction be toxic itself.
---
I got it honest as well. Can’t imagine it as a two shot! 
---
Also glitches the queen out most of the time and it makes her not land as often..... dont use the damn thing on her till it's fixed 😆
---
&gt; I can't believe you got upvoted with your misinformation.
---
Because it's correct information and that page you're quoting is written badly.
---
All damage players do to you is, at all times, reduced by 80% until you fire back or otherwise initiate PVP.
---
This is true whether you have pacifist mode on or not.
---
Turning on pacifist mode does not change this 80% damage reduction in any way, shape, or form.
---
Additionally, you can be 1-shot through this 80% reduction just fine - and it, again, has nothing to do with pacifist mode.
---
I can't believe you haven't figured this out yet if you've spent more than an hour in game or reading this subreddit.
---
Do some quests they usually reward some. Or some events. 
---
You can repair everything at once if you have the materials, just click on the C.A.M.P. device that you placed when you chose the site. You can also go into build mode and repair broken things one at a time.

Naw, we both know your failures. Your "missed point \#2" comment was idiotic because you never made a point. How do you not understand that? Are you lost?

LOL, thank you

Find a stimpak recipe and farm tick blood south of Vault 76. Equip chemist and super duper before crafting. 
---
Its frustrating trying to be friendly by playing 20 questions
---
Amazing! Thank you so much for doing this!!!!
---
They can show up just about everywhere. You could go to medical places if you have the appropriate luck perk. That can get you quite a few stimpacks fast.
---
When the bag was advertised as canvas. Yes. You mark. 
---
I prefer pump due to the range
---
I never said they would want to continue working on this game. I can guarantee that some of them would and some of them wouldnt. I can guarantee you though that they dont have a choice and they are passionate to make it the best they can under their shitty management. I'm sorry, you're talking from what experience in the industry? What friends and acquaintances who work in AAA studios?
---
I agree. I joined because of his post. He only had 2 people. They quit when they realized it wasn’t enough. Now I’m the only one left and the quest has failed. Hope he learned from this.
---
Also takes me 10 seconds of holding the trigger down to kill a level 30 Yao Guai :(
---
Yeah...she should...sometimes she only has the Hat plan on her...sometimes she has both...some other players have reported that she sometimes spawns with neither.

Why is the Simple Modern Bed covered in Vault Tech logos,  while the Vault Tech beds have nothing.  Was super annoyed buying the plans for these at Whitesprings. 😡

The bloodbug. No, the stingwing. Yeah, stingwing's are a pain.

---
Console patch is Monday.
---
If you go to your C.A.M.P. there's a prompt to "Repair Everything". Alternatively you can go into build mode and it highlights in yellow everything destroyed and you can repair it individually.
---
For crops, if you don't have more to repair them, just scrap them. You get the crop item and some fertilizer back and can replant them.
---
It's relatively cheap to repair an maxed out base. I've had mine nuked and was able to repair it all right away.
---
Events work best for me.
---
😂😂😂😂
---
Super duper level 3 and the chemist perk, every bloodpack can make  between 2 and 4

"Your logic is flawed" is not making a point. You know this. That's the conclusion after making a point, which you did not.

Good on ya mate......wait....there's a way to dupe materials???...........I mean....is it a crime to dupe springs.....is it really guys? I believe in a post apocalyptic America where springs and gears and alluminum are plentyfull!!!

Can anyone tell me how its done......so I'll know how to know if someone is doing it.....and stop them.......asking for a friend......scouts honor.
---
I got this today too,  it wont let me craft the Lvl 45 set even though I have plenty of mats 
---
If only there were some kind of final solution to this problem. Hmm...
---
What level are you?  I couldn’t craft it at first, then suddenly could but I can’t remember what level I was.  
---
If you are low level, loot and weapons that you have ammo for, 10mm seemed very plentiful iirc 
---
Dang, you helped us out with this!! My friend dropped his extra and it worked!! thanks! 
---
I have very mixed emotions on this post and the subsequent comments. Let me start by saying that, unless you are a parent, saying things like “oh poor whittle kid getting his feelings hurt” or commenting about what “Santa” should and should not bring is just ridiculous. In fact I’d be willing to bet half the folks saying such things are under 17 or, at the very least, we’re playing M rated games when they were. A parent knows their child best and that includes what they can “handle” in the way of fictional violence and situations in video games. If the parents of this child felt it was ok, then that was for them to decide and them only. 
---
Now, that being said, I will say that it is incredibly important for parents to monitor their children online and, from just the tiny bit of information provided here, it feels likely that isn’t happening with this child. The problem is, many parents don’t investigate any further than “my child wants this for Christmas” so it is entirely possibly they had no idea the game was online and he’d be freely interacting with others. Possibly they are naive to the dangers of letting a child this young engage in online chat but, you’d also have to be living under a rock for that to be the case with how it seems the media loves to show those sorts of horror stories that villainize gaming in general. 
---
Either way it still comes down to one simple fact... unless this is your child, you’ve no place in judging, or assuming, what the situation is. The bottom line is, regardless of the ESRB rating, and regardless of being online, we as adults should always be mindful that at any given moment, the person our digital self is standing beside could be a child. Being a mature adult is accepting that sometimes, you have to look past what should be, and act with kindness either way. 
---
You don't agree with the price dont buy the atom shop content....
---
&gt; They aren't THAT rare
---
I played pretty intensively from the start of beta until this past week, when I stopped at level 119, I think.
---
I got _two_ (2) legendary two-shot weapons in that entire time, and that time included quite a lot of running around a nuked Whitespring resort.
---
Note: That was _not_ two-shot explosive. Just two-shot.
---
I have _never_ looted an explosive weapon, at all. Not even once.
---
To me, a legendary two-shot + explosive weapons is not only _rare_, it's non-existent, except in other players' hands.
---
Wait? Are you here to tell me how to play the game? I reported a false advertising, and thankfully a lot of people are coming out to say what they have to say about the Atom shop items.
---
Optional? Yes, as optional as it is for you to come here and post like a negative bitch. But you did it anyway, didn't you? How would you ever feel good about yourself without telling people they are playing the game in a wrong way?! How could you ever continue with your life without accusing someone of whining and calling him entitled?!
---
Not only you came here to post nothing but toxic comments, you flipped the whole situation to sound like you hate everyone who spends time building their camps. Where do you store all that hate?
---
How many frames did you have out at once?
---
They would lose a large amount of players if they did that. I've been playing since beta and I'm just now lvl 90, I'm proud of my gear/load out, if they took all of my "accomplishments" away, I'd be very upset. 
---
It’s not that long of a process. I’m sure his other account has plenty more mats. You’re pissing into the wind, just enjoy the game. Until they fix the exploits no one is going to stop duping. 
---
You on xbox?
---
Wow, TIL. Ive been grabbing things one by one like a chump.
---
I'm sorry, which people do you know on the industry? Which acquaintances of yours worked on fo76?
---
For some reason the game let me place them all down I was confused but went with it
---
Because duping and glitching etc halts further development time that could be spent fixing bugs and programming dlc instead of running round trying to catch the little gits! Lol
---
Yeah why
---
add infexion23 on xbox. level 127 so if you ever need help, hit me up.
---
I didn't take any, no. It's not like they would show much, just about a dozen different TSEs, thousands of ammo and several more legendaries. They also had normal armor there, I don't know why.
---
Level 8. I'm new to the game
---
That's nothing to do with not being social. A lot of people just don't want to talk over a mic with others for various reasons. Or their surroundings are not fit for voice communication. Or they are just not capable.

Don't assume people are not social.

Though, I'd wager a lot of the muted mics are people that have remained muted even after PTT was introduced out of hotmiccing fear.

Essentially it revolved around crafting 300 boards, which would cause you to disconnect from the server. In the window of time between crafting your 300th board and you disconnecting, you drop the items you want to dupe into a container in the world. When you disconnect the game rolls back your inventory to the state it was when the disconnect was triggered (crafting the boards), but when you log into the same server and go to the container you dropped stuff in, it's still there.

Never duped myself btw, just saw a video about it

Xbox here.  We run in Party Chat mode because the chat volume is so much better.  The Team/area chat in game is very quiet.
---
When I come upon someone new, I will switch to game chat for a moment and say hello.  Explain we're in party chat and what we're doing...if they want to do what we're doing then we will add them to Party Chat and team if we have  a spot...often we are a full team but do run 2 teams some.  If no vocal response I assume its 50/50 they're in Xbox chat or dont have mic.

When the game came out I met everyone I play with regularly in game!  Really nice mix of people we've put together and play with.

Except even if it was an item from the test room, you have no idea how it was obtained. People were trading each other and duping items before the test rooms were even widespread knowledge. Hard to just say "punish them all" without considering not everyone is equally guilty.
---
I'd suggest changing your stock, I know for certain "Forceful" is my favorite.
---
If you got durability troubles, certain stocks will increase the amount of punishment your guns can take by a HUGE margin.
---
Welcome to the wastelands!
---
I think it opened up at tinker’s workbenches at 10
---
If you need it, i can give you screws, springs, and black titanium
---
PC, its not so much being part of a crew but finding people out in the wastes
---
Actually this door seems a little cleaner and shinier than the original.
---
Thank you! 
---
Is this a common occurrence? I got the full uniform when I completed the fire breathers quest line. Didn't realize it was % drop rate and it was standard quest reward. I'm on ps4
---
LOVE your colors and shapes!! Gorgeous portfolio too!
---
Haven't had time to do any art of my dweller, but it is definitely going to happen haha
---
Anything is appreciated at this point

Oh wow, I got them pretty late, well after 100. Was confused when I looked at the plans and had a vibe that I didn't have it. Was so happy but kinda confused when i clicked it and it actually learned.
---
Jeez.
---
Get shot at ;-)
---
I feel ya. 
---
I’m making fun of you for crying on reddit about a garage door that you failed to examine. Entitled cry babies love their text walls though. 
---
The sack at the Whitesprings station next to the tinkers bench is where I drop my extras.
---
Be careful around this thing because if you don't have the Starched Genes lvl 2 perk on, it WILL remove all mutations you have.
---
I have two sets of Ultracite PA. You’re welcome to have the set I don’t use. GT- Xwolfpackleader 
---
I have a bug with sound for my game and it is related to the game chat. When I have a head set plugged in everything is fine but without I lose all sound to the game unless i switch game chat to either off or team chat, but when I have my headset on it doesn't seem to recognise when I talk in game chat anyways :p so if you ever were trying to talk to my I apologize because in really love to roleplay when I get on these online games it makes everyone have a good time IMO.
---
Also, I am assuming it’s not visible. If it’s grayed out, then you are missing components.  Gunpowder and lead required.   
---
Lucky Hole Mine with Excavator armor brother.  There is a lot of lead but quite a few crystal nodes as well.  Hope that helps :-)
---
No, he's not.
---
But his rant really had no place in this thread.
---
I also don't think it's really fair to blame the community for the lack of information/amount if misinformation surrounding this game. 
---
I ALSO don't think a PvP mode where you either run dense+fireproof and take no damage or don't and get one-shot is hot garbage. But maybe that's just me.
---
I ALSO ALSO think that having the only way to not get one-shot require not wearing power armor was an equally terrible design choice, and fireproof is at least an attempt at bandaging that.
---
You don’t even know how much you just made my night 
---
I don't know, man. I've tested slap damage with crazy-good weapons and perks set for maximum damage, and even with chems on board, there was no way to one-shot a full health person. It would take a lot of bobbleheads to get that ability, even with an instigating 2-shot weapon with explosive bullets.  
---
I'm also kind of done with the game because of it. A group of someones destroyed my camp, then when we hunted them down, one of them managed to one-shot my friend. He chose the wrong person to one-shot first, because it gave me the opportunity to mow him down. And with a crazy good weapon myself, it still took several bullets to kill the guy even though he was taking full damage.  
---
i'm out of the loop, what is a duper?
---
Effing solid. You're a treasure. 
---
anywhere with microscopes but good luck with that they are usually gone. probably just hold workshops that have crystal nodes for gauranteed crystal.
---
As far as I'm aware, scrapping scout arnor does not yield mods. The only way to get mods for them is to buy them from MODUS im the Enclave amory.
---
Yes, it is invisible 
---
Prime Lever Action uses 44 Ultracite?
---
Im fine with people not wanting the free stuff but thats where a simple "no thanks" would be helpful instead of just flat out ignoring me.  
---
Like I said too though I tried speaking with about 20 people and I got 0 people actually speak back, just a few that emoji'd to say they can hear me
---
They will get banned. Mass item creation is being monitored at this point.
---
Lucky hole mine, a crapload of lead and about 80 crystal per run last time I went.
---
Huh, I just do the Enclave event in the Savage Divide "A Real Blast" and more often than not, its Honey Beast I'm charged with exterminating, and boy howdy that's a lot of Adhesive &lt;3
---
The area Northeast of the Monongah Power Plant... where you pick up one of the schematics for Rose's initial quest.
---
Pf no worries bud. After bed time I'm back out living like I did before kids anyways.. ruining Xbox controllers with dorito fingers and Pepsi..
---
Welch and Camden can spawn the plans. 
---
Yeah, take Excavator power armor up the tree in Tanagra Town out in the Mire and find the path leading inside. The walls of the cavern up there are entirely lined with gold and crystal deposits, you'll extract dozens of ore chunks with the armor equipped.
---
There is actually a difference if you actually see the compare the pictures #hashtagtolookcool
---
&gt; But his rant really had no place in this thread.
---
maybe yes, maybe no, but you calling him a cunt makes you no better than anyone.  just sayin.
---
I can confirm this. Radshield is a pain to make though. 
---
I hope not, but I can tell something isn't right with crafting due to the you dont have enough material messages and super duper seems to proc less often.
---
I saw a post on here a little bit back where someone figured a way to semi reliably get him over a bit of time. He likes to spawn by players workshops, so someone went to one of those farms out West, claimed it, then fast traveled a bunch back around back to it. It's right on the road so Grahm won't be missed if he comes.
---
There's probably more to it, that's from memory, but yeah. Workshops are a decent way. Also saw him A LOT while doing the Vendor Bot Responder outfit farming.
---
Haha I duped like 10 x01 suits and have 2000 of every junk there is
---
I guess I can't really speak to that experience. I don't think I'm alone in having found numerous of these weapons myself, but I suppose it's possible given that I've only ever found two in all 160+ levels of playing that there could be people who have found less than me (As little as none), and players who have found more than me. It's also possible I'm one of the exceptionally lucky.  
---
The only reason I tend to doubt this is as I said the people I was playing with were also coming up with them occasionally. Now granted, we've been playing since it came out as well, and so only finding 1 or two is still less than one popping up every month and a half or so, so it's not like I'm saying they're COMMON, but I guess I'm just saying it seems to me if you're primarily leveling through killing legendaries then it seems to me that they pop up frequently enough that it shouldn't be a question as to whether or not a high-level player could plausibly have found one themselves.  
---
Of course, your experience contradicts mine, so I suppose I have to conclude that indeed for some players they really are that rare, and maybe my experience is exceptional and the best course is just to assume they are all duped (Since I account for such a small fraction of the community as to be negligible). I 'suspect' that Bethesda has the numbers for the actual drop rate and can gauge this for themselves. That said I suppose since the Legendary Glowing Bloated Ones weren't supposed to offer the drop rates or experience that they were offering, one could also say me and the players like me were still exploiting the game. It does sort of seem like a no-win situation to me. 
---
Oh yeah, but like I said, I do it mainly to farm 3-stars. The adh and BS fibers are just an added benefit.
---
"it just works"
---
It should open up at 10 iirc.  Good luck!
---
Aye, better off diluting rad-x since it's found constantly. 
---
Bless you, angel
---
I’ve started to drop fusion cores and the like in the trash cans or other cabinets inside the train stations. I agree this should be how we all dump those things we have too many of!!
---
I find the airports are the best source of them, specifically the one with a bunch of army tents which usually has those white medical boxes in them.
---
Can’t remember the name at the moment.

I'm getting on rn
---
I'm thinking it's about delays between calculating the hit percentage, displaying it, registering the player input, and calculating the hit. If you're melee, and you click VATS and immediately attack, the screen will display 95% by the time you miss, but it initially reads 0% for a part of a second. You see 95% and a miss, and figure the game is wrong, which is not entirely incorrect. I also suspect if a target becomes momentarily inaccessible or covered, it might be 0% (or less than 95% anyway), but not have time to display it. I take a deliberate pace on the first VATS attack, and the calculation generally seems about right.
---
This is just it though, a sample size of 20 people, not even 1 person actually spoke back, PTT seems to have actually made communication worse because when the mic was always on people would actually talk back to you even if they accidentally left it on.  
---
Dont get me wrong I prefer using PTT but since it was introduced the game has gone silent
---
In a world where I only wear Power Armor.
---
Hahaha no, but I might do that next time I get in game! Hahaha
---
"ITS SO OBVIOUS BETHESDA DOESN'T DO ANY QA" /s
---
It's in the loot table for the Mire events/dailies, along with the Tattered Field Jacket and regular Leather Coat. Probably the three rarest outfits in the game currently.
---
I have a 3 star revo sword with +40% power attack, 90% reduced weight and one other I can't remember you can have if you want.
---
Thank you for the offer anyway
---
Whatever they did to introduce this new loading behavior was done to fix the infinite loading bug. 
---
I was just looking for this post (the original at least)!!! Thank you again for reposting it, and for all the work put in
---
You are a goddess among mortals.
---
Thank you soooo much for this! 
---
I might be misremebering, but I think anyone with an inventory weight of over 5k got their inventories cleared as per the patch
---
I would love to see the return of the caravan shotgun and lever action shotgun. And the return of the cowboy perk from fonv.
---
And a garand, a 1911 and the 9mm pistol. The service rifle. And the hunting shotgun. And 20gauge shotgun ammo.
---
I better stop here...l
---
"Hundreds of connected shots to kill even a low level pacifist..."
---
Excuse me if I'm wrong, but isn't a low level pacifist in Fo76 actually quite difficult to kill. From having not shot back obviously, being a pacifist and all.
---
Hey there! Nuka Girl here. I live just over the southern bridge from the Nuka Cola plant.  I returned to my family home after the bombs, and have been there ever since.  I loved building my C.A.M.P. using the existing structure there. I hardly ever have to deal with baddies or critters, enjoy fresh running water at the river, and love visitors! My roomie, Winchester Dean, lives in the bathroom. He's a dapper young radroach, and will probably propose to you with a wedding ring if you interact with him. I talk to him a lot, so I set up a little chair in there. I love your home! If you play on PS4, add me: VillainesSarah, and I'd love to visit sometime!
---
Take the Thunder Mt. Power Station workshop. Right near the Power Core Processor is a raw Crystal extractor node.
---
Safe phone sex is important.
---
Super Mutants tend to drop a lot too
---
its a random effect I have a Mr.handy blade that weighs .98 pounds if I over fix it it does like 90 damage  
---
some people are in their own discords talking to their group and have in game chat turned off. 
---
If your going to sell your game because the graphics dont live up to your expectations. You might as well go ahead because it doesnt get better. I miss when games were played because they were unique and fulfilling of your time. Its annoying how much people nit pick at graphics and every bug, not just with f76 but with all games, between that and the microtransactions gaming is dying so fast its not even funny...its sad
---
Problem is positively identifying.  I think wiping anyone with 1000 weight is a start.
---
Yeah, heavy in my stash.
---
.308 is one of the most common ammo types in the Forest. If you can't find any lying around, just fight Scorched or Super Mutants and you will likely get back more than you use up. You will find one or the other as the main enemy for most locations in the area.
---
What's your build? I'm unarmed and I do fairly well in pvp. Try to flank, pre use stimpacks, and use grenades. 
---
Yes, I get that now and then.
---
I am dum :)
---
Because people are stacking thousands of bobble heads.  It’s not the weapons.
---
Yeah, I have that on one of my characters.  No regrets!
---
I skipped survival building and I still regret it.
---
It's super annoying to not be able to place my camp amytime I need when I'm overencumbered
---
the moment they fight back, they have already loaded 20 bullets into me and I am in space. I dont think a build change can really help me
---
You think having to move stats around to pick locks and hack terminals would be better than just swapping cards around?
---
This same thing happened to me but my buddy gave me his excavator set to hold while he was making a new character because of a bug related to main quest that won't let him progress  and i was looking for my set and put his and mine out and I disconnected and lost both so now I owe my friend a set of Excavator PA and I'm out a set for myself but mine was only t-45 So no big loss on my end but my friend is not happy with me lol. 
---
&gt; I don't think I've eaten anything that's not Nuka, Whiskey, or Dogfood in like a week...
---
You should take a break from playing!
---
I know people who work at EA Vancouver. I know people who work at Epic Games Montreal.
---
Believe it or not, management having control over the games isnt unique to one AAA studio. In about 99% of cases, developers have no say and they want to put their all into it to make it the best they can with what their given.
---
I don't need to know someone who has worked on Fallout 76 to understand the process and the thought process behind a developer working for an AAA studio. EA has some pretty similar practices to Bethesda and this family-friend's distain for many of the company decisions is obvious. 
---
Now, I'm a hobby developer, I just do it in my spare time but I have done theatre professionally and it's a similar thing. You can have a really shitty director for a really shitty show, but all you want to do is please the audience. You put as much as you can into your character and the show itself that's within your control because you just want people to enjoy the experience they spent their money to come see.
---
The primary driving force of duping is making real world trading a thing.
---
Thats the main economy breaking problem.
---
Aa for what happens when they die, the simply drop nothing.
---
It really makes me regret making a VATS Crit build sometimes.  I can be 10 feet away with both me and the target standing still and still miss a completely wide open shot.  I can just exit VATS and hit them easily but I miss all of the damage that half my perk cards are used for.
---
Sounds good! Thanks!
---
RadShield is hard to get, because the flowers don't always bloom. And diluted Rad-X, which also doesn't suppress mutations, is too weak. 
---
One of my friends buys dupes for 300-500caps each. I don't condone it, but all the same. They're cheap as can be ingame. But many players who don't know these things(surprisingly a lot), or have a lot of money to toss around, are actually buying them online. I've seen one bundle of TSE weapons going for $10 online sell to around 50 people, another one for $9 sold to 23, another for $13.99 to around 40 people, etc etc. When a lot of people have the game for $30, these other scummy people are (illegaly?) making up to $500... Yes, I know Beth has made more off the game. I was exaggerating the amount for humor. They're still making a lot of money from the game themselves.
---
I'd also like to know why Beth isn't going after them when Beth has gone after people for far less. Not bashing Beth, just confused as to why they'd allow it to persist.
---
Best wishes
---
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Cheers!
---
Ok.
---
I am a camp builder, buying every single item possible. I cannot thank you enough for these names! The tables and chairs are so hard to distinguish, I've spent so many caps buying repeat plans just to find out that I cannot learn them. Also, shame that the bed with the vault tec sheets was not named the vault tec bed. Thank you a thousand times over!
---
I believe it's a level cap. I didn't get to finish this until level 110 or so. Now that there is an influx of lower level players just starting the game and making their way to the Golf Club, they're spawning more often. They (golf ghouls) all spawn at level 9, I believe. At least those are the ones that I've seen. It's pretty anticlimactic to finally get it. It would have been fun to get some sort of cool golf club as a reward. If you spy a lower level there on the map, try to get over there and share the kill with them.
---
Accompanied with "Overencumbered..."
---
Yeah but surely if you see another player come up to you then stand there around you for a while you'd flick gamechat back on for a few seconds to see if theyre talking to you.  
---
With the PTT you dont even need to have it off unless your actually around randoms having a full conversation through the game, but when I chat to my friends on discord we'd still switch game chat on if we encounter another player
---
The penitentiary has a few in the medical wing, need hacking 3 to get in there from the front entrance. There’s usually around 5 in there
---
Thanks everyone! 
---
I would rather have more points to put towards stats and lockpicking and hacker be skills that you learn based of your level of perception and intelligence
---
This is just lame. I gave a thumbs up for you posting this, but people doing this shit are losers. There's no thrill or excitement when reaching a pinnacle of achievement. Weapons that instakill, because of TSE, and glitched out bobblehead usage are cheap. Not even fun to play like this in my opinion. One thing I used to love doing in Fallout 4 was to start a new game on hardcore survival mode. I did this at least a dozen times. I feel like there is a certain appeal to starting with nothing, and finding good equipment and weapons; making a unique character that uses what they find in the wasteland. I remember when people were modding weapons in the Dead Island games to make them unbreakable and 1 hit kill. At one point most everyone had katana's and weapons with stupid OP mods on them. Or people would join others games and just drop them on the ground cause it was so easy to duplicate. Eventually the creators banned all modded saves, and made it more difficult to duplicate items, so as to prevent people exploiting the games dynamics.   
---
This kind of behaviour ruins the entire format and experience for people who are wanting to legitimately play a game as it was created, not as they can exploit it to their advantage. Some exploits in 76 I was fine with. The one where you could place camp items that were stored even if you didn't have the plan for them, for example.
---
Food?
---
I've launched 10 or 15 nukes and never had a problem. I'd say it was a one time thing. (Ps4)
---
sometimes when people are too overtly social towards me I am wary because I think its a scam or something.
---
Other people who are low key about it are fine.  I ran a long nuke session last night at the golf course and ran into a guy who was all chat chat trade trade yada yada and I ignore him mostly, was polite but nothing else.  As the session went he organically learned how to work effectively with me to clear/tag and we killed megatons of shit.  By the end of it we talked voice and traded stuff and added as friends and it's all good.
---
sometimes it works out, sometimes it doesn't.
---
Alternatives to stimpaks;
---
Get cola nut perk and gain AP when healing their are there different kinds ok Nuka cola with increasing amounts of AP gain. Plus it also hydrates you and gives you one cap!
---
Get the dog food perk and gain hp and food buff along with rejuvenated if you have well fed buff 
---
Last option all though kind of weight intensive is to drink boiled or purified water also. 
---
I actually tend to use those over stimpaks
---
Also, the First Aid perk maxed out lets diluted stimpacks basically heal like unperked regular ones. Then, with chemist equipped you can get like 8x the stims!
---
You could have them screenshot it and send it to you...might be a few extra steps but worth it. 
---
Thanks!  I generally am.  Because of wonderful people like you!
---
Yeah...I just accidentally discovered this myself last night. I had finally upgraded my camp to all metal walls and security doors a couple nights ago. I logged in yesterday and it couldn't spawn my camp, and that was okay, I had been wanting to move it for awhile and this was a free opportunity...when I finally decided on a location, I discovered my camp budget was almost 200% stored ..it was a pain in the ass to fix this because I couldn't build anything new, I could only use what was stored until I got it under control...and then my stash was 100lbs over....fml
---
How did you message him?
---
Please do. Don't make my mistake
---
I think they didn’t want it to affect people’s decisions to wear outfits, but at the same time, you could just have a hat go over a helmet that gives armor you know?
---
Can confirm. Not sure how reliable this is tho. Better keep a backup. 
---
Lol nice bro 
---
Its a nice change from the salt that often gets soread through
---
Reached level 25. Opened the perk pack..the funniest card says an I quote.."your kid so ugly, the cat tries to cover him up in the sand box. #65." 
---
F off Bethesda. Ok? 
---
You got any gear for sale 
---
This.  I have a 2se handmade.  A buddy and I did some 'testing' PvP at a workshop. (Im a PvE and run in pacifist otherwise).  
---
Anyhow - I shot him multiple times and got wanted, and a high bounty, and eventually exploded myself but didnt kill him.   
---
I was in pacifist and was killed with 1 hit of a sledge hammer by someone in Watoga I was not engaged with.  Running in lvl 50 X01 armor and lvl 70 myself.  Explain that?  not the weapon for sure
---
Thanks! I've just joined!
---
If that's the case, you need to learn how to type a joke online. There was no indication that your response was indeed a joke. It's easier to to say, "I'm joking", rather than admitting you're wrong and moving on.
---
I guess they wanted people to have freedom with character cosmetics. With new perks and mutations, dmg resistance already has a big buff and so no need for extra dmg from headgear. This allows headgear to be only cosmetic, and for players to choose to not wear any without pressure of necessarity.
---
Didnt you know? The human brain emits waves of energy that turn nonbiological materials into paper.
---
They exist, I have heavy robot chest and leg plans. Sorry I dont remember how I got them, most likely an event.
---
The mods shouldnt matter whether its light heavy or sturdy
---
I upgraded to tricentennial on Friday, there's an option in the atom store (PS4).
---
I use it to repair my deathclaw gauntlet. It's actually annoying as shit because bone is literally everywhere but you can only get the material from super mutants. 
---
You are confusing the Fire Breathers and the Fireman Uniforms. Did you even read the post?
---
I haven't been unaffected by them, but as I said, I've only encountered maybe two incidents (one "Server Disconnected" and one client freeze while entering power armour) since the update. Whereas it was multiple times an evening before the patch. 
---
I was just wondering if perhaps there were client issues people were having that my wife and I weren't.
---
I can already imagine the Wooby fanfics now. Wooby a poor man  dressed in rags trapped in a developer cell. Used as a test dummy, shot at and beaten... he suddenly becomes self aware and realizes he's a NPC. He uses the powers of the command console to teleport him to Appalachia where he now seeks revenge on the developer who abused him all his life. Todd Howard... Only to find that Todd Howard never plays his own games... What will he do now? Wooby decides to refocus his anger upon the players. Seeking them out to kill and ban them all.
---
Anyone with content from dev rooms will be eventually found and given a possible notice of ban. Also all people who even enter the rooms now get automatically banned.
---
All of course with a chance to apologize and continue playing. At least that's the gist of what I glanced at. 
---
Thank you for this! I'm going to use it as a guide to determine what I spend my caps on for C.A.M.P. items
---
Well there must be a common way as I have had one - two - three shot insta kills from shotguns and combat rifles with pacifist always set no where near a public workshop PVP areas.
---
The guns always shoot fiery tracer, so explosive something is involved.
---
That makes sense
---
Basically what I did.  However, I didn't know you HAD to be killed by a player to clear the bounty.  Got naked, stored all my junk and let a scorched wail on me.  Re-spawn, STILL wanted.  Waited around another area and like clockwork, someone in PA came along and nailed me in one hit within literally one minute.  Also what I didn't know is that the bounty gets taken out of YOUR stash!  More lameness.  Turned on pacifist now.
---
I like the bloodstains next to your dressers
---
It doesn't take months. Every time one pops up, they just make a new one. So technically they're fixing dupes in less than a month
---
Well its kinda weird for a army helmet to give no protection
---
I forgot
---
Ok I’ll message you if I ever do need help!
---
Heh, interesting you should pass by, then.
---
I actually did know much of that, at least at a macro level, mainly because my oral surgeon took the time to tell me about it when I showed interest. I just figured it would be amusing to mention it. But yes, I do realize it requires a bit more than crushing some bones and stuffing them in the hole. :)
---
Thanks for your work, by the way. Your industry has made it so that my rear molar, which had to be extracted after being badly broken by popcorn (now sworn off for life), could be replaced relatively quickly by filler and then an implant. I didn't like having an abbreviated bite.
---
(Also, my plan to become a cyborg is one step closer to completion.)
---
I just argued with my girlfriend for thirty minutes about that fucking ship. Thanks, guys. 
---
I just want to grow the plants for the disease cure and I would be ecstatic
---
Sorry for my ignorance but what is "duping"?
---
Yeah i know what you mean but i literally just go up to people and say "hello, do you have a microphone by any chance" I added that last bit since no body was respong to just hello or people would emote a wave at you just for being there even if they cant hear you.  I take a long silence without an emote as a no
---
It's wanted up in here
---
Ok, cool story. Bubye now. 
---
Sounds good! Good luck with the business my friend 
---
People have been complaining about getting one-shotted in pacifist mode. I'll readily admit that i'm not an expert on the game mechanics, but there are some heated exchanges going on about how terrible the system is that this would be possible. 
---
This is great, now I can tell which plans I already have and which I still need. You’re awesome, thanks for doing this!
---
I've been playing games a long time.  I've seen some real disasters.  And while Fallout 76 has some real problems, I wasn't expecting a new Fallout game for, I dunno, 5 more years or so?  So I'm tickled to be playing it at all.
---
Plus things seem to slowly be getting better.  For me anyway.
---
I'll give it to you for free I'm on Xbox
---
I’ll see you tonight! 
---
Too bad people cant just leave shit in there. RIP-aroni to the greedy people.
---
The sunshine tidings food producing workshop, he apparently pops up a lot after you take the workshop, I will say it did work for me so it’s a good one to try. 
---
I prefer the D.E.N.N.I.S system
---
I get frequent crashes to desktop now too
---
Yeah, no doubt. There is a combat armor helmet which I'm not sure if it doesn't give armor. Because I know people have gotten the marine helmet and it has dmg resistance
---
There you go. Its a complex system with piss poor instructions, but kind of fun to learn as you hop along the bunny trail.
---
&gt; you are too messed up to pick a lock.
---

Upvoted for the clever and topical reference.

If it doesn’t work for you after turning it in and you don’t see the 4/5 relighting might work for you. Just worked for my friend 
---
I know, I've seen those. But can you explain how the second image doesn't have any metal around it? It bloody doesn't. If you can achieve that exact same look in game like the second picture, the one that shows the rolling door inside of a building with wooden sides, I'll buy the door for you.
---
Thats literally illegal. Its flase advertisement. I hooe Bethesda does get sued one theae days. Mayne that'll teach them a lesson or two about spitting on their community.
---
All of you are overlooking The Machine. One of the sexist guns in Fallout history
---
You also can't explain a scorchbeast either though.
---
I keep my OS and critical applications on an SSD, but I don't like things that can corrupt your PC on the same drive, so I have 4TB HDD for my games and gaming clients.  I thought everybody did that.  I can't afford 4TB of game storage and a 1080!
---
Half the time I think "Nah, there's nothing good in there anyway"
---
The other half of the time I prove myself right.
---
Yea lol
---
This 
---
D.E.N.N.I.S. System?
---
a 308 fmj 
---
Yes
---
I wish they just made it open season on dupers
---
They are going to have the rifle perks affect the gauss rifle so that’ll be a big help.
---
I dunno if they're testing weapons on him, maybe he's there to display outfits?
---
Mmm, but then they'd need a female too.
---
You can get the Heavy Robot schematics from Harpers Ferry in the same location that the Marine Armor schematics spawn, I have gotten chest and legs there in the past.  Check out this video but instead of jumping for Marine only pickup Robot schems.  When you go there if the plans aren't there or the ones you want don't spawn DON'T pick up whats there and just server hop to try again.

Hope this helps and good luck hunting!
---
Berry Mentats? They do exactly that.
---
These
---
No worries mate
---
On now for a few hours by the way :)
---
Well, I don't think it's such a big problem for a single item. But people here are saying a lot of things in the atom shop don't look or even work like in the preview pictures.
---
Duplicating
---
Dis my main weapon now.  I got a nice little radium rifle for Scorchy and All Rise as a backup.
---
Didn't you know that a .308 does more damage than a .50 cal?  /s
---
Thanks for taking the time to do this, this is really useful.
---
Duplicating items.
---
Sometimes the gene pool needs a little cleaning.
---
Don't fucking be that guy.
---
We have enough of those guys.
---
We're down voting you because you're an insufferable cunt. 
---
And only of the two last seasons
---
This is the most useful thing I've yet seen to help us play this game. I'm going to go get you some gold.
---
That looks dope! Is that the new red rocket door??? I might have to pick that up if so
---
Ahhhhhh ball's. Thanks for letting me know.
---
It still freaks me the hell out that people find this stuff.  I mean...seriously, how do you find this crap?
---
Half the time I can't even find plans that are sitting out right in front of me!  I literally had one of those perception perks going off today and it still took me 10 minutes to realize that I was looking right at a bobblehead. 
---
Yeah. Like the other two said, if there’s some kind of heavy lag in the server, it will cause that kind of thing to happen. I personally had my .50 Cal break during scorchbeast fight and it still let me shoot it.
---
My level 43 melee build beat the crap outta a level 202 guy today, felt good man but I only took 600 caps, wish he woulda dropped that kind of loots for me to destroy
---
Look at my name, I'm not trying to be better than anyone lol
---
Omg I was there too man, same thing happened to me at first I was gonna avoid it but then I was like fuck it I see some 120+ players going this should be fun lol, then it crashed...fml
---
I had to relog for it to show up.
---
Oh wait.. your spot is the barn!!!😂🤣😂
---
guessing you dont have professional coding experience
---
I'd take a save wipe if it meant getting rid of them for good, honestly.
---
Yeah.  You're absolutely right. 
---
I don't have a sense of how many there are. I have run into a lot who, based on their chatter with one another, sounded like they were in their early teens. 
---
I specifically asked billy because he has appeared in Watoga, at Freddy's house of Fear and in the Ash Heap decked out in a combat helmet I have him, a power armor frame, and carrying the brotherhood rifle I was giving out to new players on Christmas day.  
---
He's not the only new player I have seen running around in locations that are way above their levels, but I have assumed that some of these are alts or mules. 
---
 
---
Yeah same, i always saw this one as a bonus fallout because i wasnt expecting another installment until after TES6 had come out, and im not an elder scrolls fan so it would have been a very long wait for me.  Also, i had always wanted a multiplayer fallout so that fact this one was multiplayer and theyre going to keep updating it is the best possible outcome for me
---
Thanks for letting me know.
---
I am currently playing on PS4. Whenever I try to attack someone with a bounty, it does practically no damage, and it says that I am initiating combat. Then, if they kill me, they get my levels worth in caps. If I manage to kill a bounty target after this happens, I only get the bounty. I hunted at least 10 people with bounties before Jan. 1 and every time I was able to snipe them without them even seeing me at all, or before it was too late. It never said I was initiating combat during these times. It never said I was attacking at the bottom of the screen.   
---
Then after Jan. 1, I tried to kill a 15 cap wanted player and it did no damage. I point blank shot him with a sniper in the head while hidden, and it did nothing. practically no damage. I am classed to use rifles, so this should have done massive damage. They then turned around and shot me with an explosive shotgun in 1 shot, while I was wearing a full suit of top level power armor. I assumed it was a fluke or something, until a couple days ago, it happened twice more by someone whos name is ringabell954 on PS4.   
---
Then again later that day by someone on my friends list who asked me to kill them. Again, it did no damage to them when I shot, and they turned on me and killed me, after I shot them. He thought it was funny, of course. I simply blocked and will never speak to again. I no longer attack wanted players, even if they ask me to. People are getting low level bounties to attract attackers, and then going around killing other players because they shot first( assuming they were attacking a wanted player, not starting pvp). I have several friends who can attest to this as well.
---
Or people like me haven’t payed close attention to the patch notes and realized that PTT was added. 
---
Thank you for this
---
Wouldn't be surprised if they add mods to certain hats/helmets down the line, if not all, much like we already have for the clothes you wear underneath your armor.
---
Been a while since I have played FO4 so i'll take your word for it. 
---
Angles don't work that way.
---
whats really crazy is why it took them so long to fix it
---
brilliant, and finally! and thanks OP for asking
---
Maybe if you hadn't abandoned me in the vault to suffocate I'd want to talk to you.
---
Did you still need nuke material I have a lot.
---
You shouldnt get a bounty for destroying workshop items anyway. I go to take a workshop and then get wanted for destroying the turrets that are shooting me? That's dumb as hell.
---
That kinda makes me feel sad for people being duped into buying off eBay. I know they’re doing it on their own accord but come on, you’re getting scammed. 
---
Mods that gave protection for helmets would be cool
---
Remember when you created a Reddit account just to troll this sub? Pepperidge Farms remembers.
---
Text chat? Has Bethesda patched that in? Or are you using a Nexus mod?
---
A lot of us just do the challenges for free atoms bruh bruh
---
You looked pretty drunk and i didnt wanna wake you
---
Two words - “Junk Shield” perk ;)
---
He specifically said "unoptimized".
---
I just bought a mic.  Haven't set it up yet.  Also:  many people new to the game haven't figured out how to emote.  Tell them how ;)
---
There it is! I was feeling lazy and couldn't commit more than a minute to the comment.
---
Thinking of trying it myself soon, need those damn powered doooooors
---
I didn't insinuate anything about laws. Don't put words in my mouth. Not that it matters, since laws aren't some magical thing; they're just the self-regulation of a larger group of humans.
---
I see the ESRB rating as establishing the ground rules. If some parent chooses to ignore the ground rules and throw their kid into the game with me, it's not my obligation to do their job by proxy. I don't personally engage in PvP, but if I did, I would resent the notion that I should go easy on someone who shouldn't have been let into the arena.
---
Parents need to stop pushing their own obligations onto the community and then complaining that the community failed them. I'm sick of that crap, sick of everyone being lazy and then accusing others of being the problem and that everyone else has to do the work, "for the children!"
---
No. If you want to preach at anyone, go preach at the parents. Not us.
---
This sometimes happens when you use the alternate power armor station.
---
###Absolutely glorious 
---
There isn't a logical fallacy in any of the statements made. I pointed out how the logic makes complete sense, used real world examples of a similar premise for reference, the only persons character who was put into question was that of an unnamed, possibly fictional character that you decided to defend. You can't make the argument that you didn't try to defend him when you decided to object to the claim he was guilty of duping or endorsing that behavior when you asked under what grounds the claim was being made. 
---
It's not a leap in logic by any means, I still don't understand what you initial argument is if your not trying to defend the individual in question. If you would like everyone to entertain the possibility that yes, he could have server hopped 500 times for all he mats, yes it's possible, but that is unlikely
---
If your trying to say as you Initially claimed; he killed or found that dupers bag and was going to dispose of it himself, that is also possible. But again there is no reason to think or believe that. The same would have happened to OP if someone had killed him and found that bag, they would have assumed he was the duper and that would have been a completely sane assumption. 
---
If a cop finds you with a bag of weed, and you respond that you simply found it and were going dispose of it, how well do you think that scenario would go? Its again a similar situation, what would be the right assumption for the cop to make there? 
---
A one shot I don't believe is possible without a lot of bobbleheads. Hell, a friend of mine shot me for slap damage with a 2 shot, explosive harpoon gun and while it took a chunk of my health, it was no where near killing me. If you were getting instakills in slap damage, I can't imagine that the person was anywhere near full health.
---
Hell, in pacifist mode, I unloaded nearly a full clip into someone with a 2-shot level action with exploding bullets, and I only got him to half-health, and yes, I do have level 5 demolition expert.
---
It usually takes me more than one shot with full damage pvp to kill someone with a two-shot weapon with exploding bullets.
---
So that’s what Bethesda’s next big update content is gonna be?
---
A bunch of PA paints and masks? :(
---
Actually they probably won't get you banned, I've received these items from a guy I know and after the latest update the Faschnacht Masks got removed from both mine and other players inventories and stashes. 
---
Bethesda knows that some players have traded for those or received from other players. If they don't want them available to the players they will simply remove them as they did with the Faschnacht masks I've mentioned previously.
---
This reply Demonstrates Value.
---
My only problem is the part where we Separate Entirely.  :(
---
I've done my gather, repair and cook for the day.  Westek here I come!  Thanks :D
---
I'd assume the door should have its own separate power counter separate from the traps since you can't have multiple inputs on a single counter.
---
So button splits off into 2 different counters. One for the door, the other for traps.
---
Another problem is that it's probably really hard to kill passive players with traps.
---
Getting armor mods from scrapping has always been uncommon in my experience. Melee weapons too, come to think of it.
---
I cant tell them how because i play on PC but i use a controller so im not familiar with the actual keybindings, and to top it off, im left handed and often mess about with the key bindings so i dont even knows whats default
---
You earlier today
---
&gt;  So if you are alone you can solo her easily. I took her down with like 10-20 shots with an un-optimized build and a handmade 
---
You just now
---
&gt; Team of 4 in under 5 mins. 
---
How do you go from claiming you can kill her with a handmade in 10-20 shots to linking a video of 4 people killing her in 5 minutes and think you've won anything?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I actually play on my phones hot-spot on my xbox and I never disconnect either 
---
I'm confused by your response because not only you proved my point that you don't need to spend money to buy things in the atom shop, but you mentioned "it has already happened"? 
---
My previous response, towards the end, was about them not adding/selling an item, as a marketing scheme, that would benefit PA users. Not only will that defeat the purpose of the shop being cosmetics only, but doing so would dig themselves deeper.
---
Apparently gold sells good
---
Wait... what?
---
You mean the Tactical Marine Helmet? I do have that and even got a spare one. But it doesn't give you anything. It isn't even showing up on the armor workbench to mod.
---
I've been looking for this, no luck so far.
---
I listen to music with headphones on.
---
How about the ability to raise brahmin? Y'know, for us carnivores 
---
If you've done all the challenges already, and theres only daily/weekly left....you gotta relax!!!! 
---
I would wager a large number of players come from offline Skyrim/Fallout RPGs with little experience of, or desire for, human interaction in the real/online world. 
---
They probably don't post on reddit, infact some who are active on beth.net refuse to speak in 76.
---
I sometimes have to ignore chitchat and gimmies when I'm running a new low level char on a solo time limited challenge.
---
Or just claim the munitions factory if you don't have the perk points, I went afk for like an hour and got thousands. Well i sat there listening to music and reading reddit 😂
---
You’re very welcome.  A huge reason I work in med device is because the work has a chance to improve people’s lives.  I used to work in the development of stroke and aneurysm treatment but opportunity brought me to biologics.
---
Working with bone is equally awesome as it is morbid.  After all, our raw material are the remains of what once was a living person.  And as is the case in all manufacturing, sometime a mistake is made and you have to scrap product.  The sad part is that when a mistake is made with bone, the remains of that person who provided the ultimate gift of donation literally gets put in hazardous waste dump.  That motivates me to ensure the manufacturing processes i design and the instructions I write for the technicians are as fool proof as possible.
---
G for Gmote!
---
I suggest you try something like what I do. First I ask politely on area mic if they would stop using the explosive weapon during the event. Then if they don't want to stop I start hitting them constantly with my melee weapon. I do no damage since everyone has pacifist on but they can't see to shoot and have a chance to blow themselves up. I don't stop hitting them until either they stop using it or they leave. 
---
You are the best!
---
Knowing some bikers, some of which were really hard core in their day, my guess is that they actually *would* behave differently (nicely) if some guy showed up with his kid, provided it were in the day and they weren't already totally plastered. 
---
That said, you make a valid point. 
---
All i'm saying is keep it in mind. It really doesn( matter if it's an 8 year old, a 14 year old, or a 40 year old, there's really no reason for anyone to be following another player around bullying him. 
---
No worries my dude, just trying to share the love like it's been shared to me.  Happy hunting!
---
Get that Pharma Pharma card 
---
I would love if they added a sniper rifle based on the real-life Barrett M82 or even an M40A5 to give the sniper build a little more oomf.
---
Oh haha sorry it's a reference from a TV show, don't mind me. 
---
honestly not sure what you're talking about. all 3 pics look the same
---
The animation purely ingame normally only is fast if you are in combat. Then your character gets inside and outside of PA faster.
---
But there is a mod on the Nexus which switches the animations. 
---
Be advised though. It breaks the entrance a bit so you float outside the PA at first but it is working as intended after the animation is done.
---
I love love love this!
---
I find that outside of Gauss rifles, most energy weapons don't do enough damage to oneshot even with Instigating and sniper barrels. A charging Tesla with Instigating might also work but I've never seen one with that effect so I don't know. If you can't get bloodied or two shot, Instigating is definitely a decent option to look out for tho.
---
Sorry. I am not doing commissions right now.
---
Paid Bethesda's shills, this sub is chock full of them, pretty obvious by now.
---
You sound like someone who flys around in their jet just killing other players in GTA.
---
Damn! I should trade mine for some sentinel armor 
---
I love how they call it a small town named China.
---
What is the Chinese threat? Some buildings hiding a computer, that's it.
---
If we get to "invade" China towards the end of DLC run, and its just a city... God damn it.
---
Oh really? Sorry, I must have been mistaken then. When other people I know we're talking about it, I thought they said it had dmg resistance, I must've been wrong.
---
I get the same issue all the time as well.  Same situation - two consoles on the same network trying to connect to the game.
---
fast travel?
---
I dig your work!
---
Duping is bad for the market value of items but everytime I see one of these posts I think "What a Hero!"... Not really though. Seems kind of sad that people have so little to do and such little to care about in the real world that they go out of their way to get people who aren't directly affecting them in trouble.
---
&gt;adrenal reaction 3
---
I wish that was a thing
---
I don’t see why they care unless the plan is to sell this stuff. It’s all cosmetic except for the MA helmet. 
---
Dave: Say you have an ax - just a cheap one from Home Depot. 
---
[slow zoom in on man chopping]
---
Dave: On one bitter winter day, you use said ax to behead a man. Don't worry, the man's already dead. Maybe you should worry, 'cause you're the one who shot him. He'd been a big twitchy guy with veined skin stretched over swollen biceps, tattoo of a swastika on his tongue. And you're chopping off his head because even with eight bullets in him, you're pretty sure he's about to spring back to his feet and eat the look of terror right off your face.
---
Fanboys will still play it anyway 
---
I get disconnected at least 3x a session now on PC 
---
Thought I've complained about them, I have found a couple of TSE items myself, legitimately through killing enemies and I agree 100 percent.  I would gladly give them up if it would stop the shit show that is happening now because of duping.
---
Do you see the metal panels on each side of the frame in the first two pictures? I'd like too, but in the atom shop the first two pictures show just the rolling door with a red frame, no rusty metal panels. In game it has two metal side panels attached to it.
---
its due to high int and was likely crafted
---
You can get the codes from [nukacrypt.com](https://nukacrypt.com) or if you want to solve them yourselves it's a bit of work. You need 8 code pieces for a silo. You also need the keyword decrypted by Modus. Then you take the keyword and rearrange the alphabet. From that new alphabet you have have a new eight letters. You unscramble a word from those eight letters and then you have the order of the code.

Become a drug dealer

Voice chat is turned off so he can’t hear anyone...feel free to talk about skull fucking ghouls if that’s your thing
---
Contractor rank 2 makes it pretty affordable. If you killed the queen you should have a few.
---
how do you know the person you killed was a duper? it could have been a scrap harvester and seller and you messed with their income. Lol!
---
Wait 76's loading screens cycles through screenshots?
---
How have I never noticed this before wth.
---
Thank you nights give it a go, thanks for the lengthy reply! 🙂
---
I hear you brother!
---
Also get this. I also spawned (world loaded) then it hit me with another 10 second loading screen 😤
---
Sounds like you just assume anyone working above minimum wage cares about they work to some degree you made up. There plenty there just for a paycheck, and fo76 sucks. I guarantee there are plenty of the devs that just want to get to the next project.
---
R twice.
---
I don't even know what platinum does but I am giving you it. This will save me so much time and caps. 
---
Thanks
---
Which game community do you find non toxic?  Just to stereotype gamers as a group lack social skills and then you can compound that by games and online communities being anonymous so people can be as nasty as they want with no accountability.  
---
I find the fallout community to be better than most towards each other as it's not a competitive game.  What I find bizarre is how a decent chunk of the Fallout community seems to actually hate Fallout.  I started playing with FO4 and then went back and played the earlier games.  I can't fathom why people think NV is a gift from God and every other game is a dumpster fire.  It seems like eventually you'd move on with your life and find something you DO enjoy to spend your time on.  But I digress...
---
Also it goes without saying using exploits on an online game is bannable on pretty much every online game.
---
Even if it is just one item. Thats like saying "well they only assaulted someone once..." Breaking the law is Breaking the law. I hope they end up losing a few million in a class action lawsuit at slme point. It wont be enough to damage them but maybe they will stop screwing their fans.
---
Press the open inv button twice
---
I play on PC and get one every 30 min. This just started as I used to go hours without. 
---
Thanks 😊
---
Yeah, that's a bug with the Marine Armor Helmet though, it only gives you bonus DR if it's over repaired.
---
They may add cities in expansions.
---
I didn't hear that anywhere or anything, I just wouldn't be surprised.
---
Let me clarify, I do not think this should be in the game or used..
---
It's absolutely stupid that this is even possible, how do Bobbleheads stacking end up in the full end version of the game?
---
But I am a curious person, if I hear this is possible I will try it to see if it's genuine and if someone asks I will tell them what I know.
---
If you want to be annoyed, be mad with Bethesda for putting the game into millions of peoples hands when it is still full of bugs and glitches. 
---
I would also like to make the point that many things they claim are fixed in their 'patch notes' are still broken.
---
I have my camp in almost the exact same place. But it's just an open house for people to use when they kill the queen or do a run through watoga 
---
I have a lot of crashes to the home screen with an error code on my PS4.
---
Great point!  Honestly never thought of it, that would be incredibly helpful thank you.
---
The things you learn everyday about this game.
---
what do you have or when do you want to meet?
---
At the same time they'd need to put it the ability to switch off the appearance or overlay cosmetic hats because alot people care about their cosmetic appearance, especially when that's what they buy for real world money in the atoms shop
---
Sell outfits and headgear. Ranger, Golf outfits and Straightjackets sell for 30+ caps each, as do Marine Tactical Helmets which are craftable from cheap junk.
---
Do you use wifi? I've heard using ethernet messes it up I use wifi and never have problems. (I know nothing about PC excuse my peasantry)
---
This is especially funny since they've said repeatedly that they can't remove duped items from player inventories. 
---
I do re-cycle a lot of low level chars so run around with low health at around 200 - 300. 
---
It could be the slap calculation is an absolute value and doesn't cap the damage to a max percent of the victims health, so a 250 damage tickle on a L100 player will inst-a-kill a L10 player.
---
Do you use wifi?
---
I replied to your other post. 
---
And if the bikers feel like the fact that it's their bar gives them the freedom to assault the person or otherwise harass them, then they're in the wrong, regardless of whether he should be there are not.  
---
(Not saying it's a good idea for anyone to test that theory in real life. I knew a guy ... can't remember the full story ... his name was Bear. Some other biker knocked out all of his teeth, and because of his ... condition ... he wasn't phased by it and threw the other guy through a window and beat the crap out of him.) 
---
Bikers can be nice folks, if approached the right was, but if not, they aren't concerned if they're in the wrong. :-)
---
Selling junk is your best bet. If you are a lower level find any building or area where you can handle the enemies and just loot everything. Literally pick up everything. After you scrap your junk, build/repair what you need to then bulk the rest at a tinker's workbench. If you are far enough along and high enough level to handle Fort Definance, it's my favorite place to loot. Pick up all the straight jackets they sell for a good bit of caps by themselves and also all the m junk stuff you see. Scrap, bulk, sell. Server hop if you have to and repeat the process. There are a total of 7 vendor factions, meaning you can make up to 1400 caps a day and it's easy to get that from selling junk.
---
well maybe im just bad or I messed up with my perk cards or both
---
im in the same boat as you, absolutely terrible internet, other games its either constant disconnects or rubber banding all over the place. But this game, yeah its a rare event for me to actually be disconnected from the server.
---
Very Rarely. I have a regular ps4 also.
---
Nope, had it happen today. Logged off and logged in again and my quest was back. 
---
Same here, even without using power armor
---
That poster is my entire play style.
---
If you're not going around randomly attacking people, then it probably doesn't. 
---
&gt;If you're attacking someone and they don't respond, sometimes it's an old  guy with crippled hands who doesn't feel obliged to help you virtually  bolster your sense of manhood. Other times it's a little kid who just  got the game from Santa who has no sense of how to interact with people  online and it just wandering around enjoying the game. Either way, if  they're clearly not interested in PvP, why not go find someone whose  style of play is more to your liking?
---
How dare you suggest that players stop hounding players?!?! This is PVP and that means I can grief, I mean role play, all I want and tough luck to anyone who can't take it, despite the fact that the game is played by people of all  level of capabilities, even actual children.  /s
---
Actually I agree with your suggestion that players stop pestering people who don't respond to repeated attacks. Just came here to read the [inevitable lack of empathy and was not disappointed](https://memesbams.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Rolling-my-eyes-gif1.gif). 
---
Honestly selling glowing meat steaks nets a decent amount of Caps.
---
I live just northeast of fissure site prime just out of the blast zone along the border of the map, and there are always 5-6 ticks there whenever I fast travel.
---
Finish dailies and take over workshops. You get 20 caps just for clearing out the enemies, spend 25-30 caps taking the workshop, then get more caps a few minutes later for defending it. Net profit + at least 2 plans + a bunch of water, stimpaks, and resources you can sell. Other than that, loot valuable items and sell them every time you pass by a vendor. Sell off all the legendaries you find instead of leaving them behind. 
---
I have the original xbox 1 and I use wifi and never have disconnects. Some other people on here said he switched to wifi and it stopped crashing
---
I do use unyielding when not in a nuke zone. Survivability a rad resistance seems to be better with it in a nuke zone.
---
Did they patch the staircases so you could stack them? I might start playing again.....
---
I imagine removing all the masks from ALL the stashes and inventories would be easier than checking on how many items players own.
---
Melee and vats atm are a big mess up =S
---
You charge too close, sometimes you end up facing to the side of your target, instantly missing.
---
You also end up charging too far away and targets crawling backward just dont get hit at all even with you swinging a damm 2hander the size of a skyscrapper.
---
No one is stupid enough to actually be buying these items...right? 
---
I guarantee that as well. But like I said, its beyond their control.
---
It can still be equated to theatre. When I have a shitty director and/or a shitty show, I still want to do the best I can for the sake of the people coming to see. They are paying to see, the least I can do is try to put on the best performance I can through a poorly written show. I cant wait to just move on and get to the next show but I still feel obliged to put my all into it because it's my art.
---
Game development is their art. I completely agree that there are some devs who could care less and just want to get it out of the way without any effort, but there are undoubtedly more developers that care about their fanbase that they build up and want to do their best with what their given. Heres the thing- both of us get paid above minimum wage for what we do, and both of us do it because we are passionate for it.
---
You should try and do at least one on your own. It adds a bit of drama if you're unsure if you've got the code right or not.
---
Ummmmm. I have 130 hours and am level 157 and have 2 TSE guns. If you know how to grind when it's time to grind. I understand that most TSE's you see are duped but mine are from a lot of grinding and 1000's of dropped legendaries and 1000's of scrapped weapons. Guaranteed you do not farm correctly. 3 star legendary enemies need to be killed slowly with multiple weapons to get the kill (tip. Open with a ranged then move to a melee then use a name to drop em). Letting the health regen is the key to get the best drop. 
---
No, wired. The error code is CE-34878-0 which is almost always caused by the game or application. 
---
Im polishing the design now, but all my plans are geared towards open PvP servers Bethesda announed.
---
I think ill build super simple schematic to test this power counter out.
---
Haha sounds good I will man!
---
Glad to know I'm not the only one it really sucks when your trying to clear a room and you have to go into the menu to equip another weapon hopefully bethesda does something about this next time it happens I'll post a vid
---
Are you sure they can hear you?  I bought a headset the other day, have tested it with friends over other software, but I get no response from players in FO 76 when talking and also can't hear them if they're talking.
---
There is a point in the the game where you will be out of pretty much everything; either stimpack, water, disease cure, ammo, springs, screws, lead ... 
---
Just hang in there and it will get better .
---
They should have put a bunch of these inside the golf club
---
Best response I have read so far. 
---
You said what I was hoping to convey, but much more effectively. 
---
The Deathclaw Gauntlet requires bone to repair.
---
I'm not sure, the .50 Cal wasn't able (obviously) to be silenced in FNV and my Anti-Armor Gauss is already close to 300 dmg. With sneak attack multipliers, all ranks of Tank Killer and a piercing mag, you're talking about ignoring almost all armor and a 750ish non critical shot. 
---
Something stronger than that will be dangerous. The Gauss already shreds players even in power armor. 
---
I play on Xbox but since the patch, which I have only played day of it was terrible, disconnected 4 times in 10 minutes lost two of my best items then decided to play destiny now
---
Said it once, I'll say it again. 
---
**Tesla Cannon**
---
You can repair it for super cheap by going to the actual CAMP machine
---
Easy isn't really the point though... they claimed complete impotence. 🤔
---
I find water and glowing steaks sell well.
---
Yeah. 
---
Some good replies too though. 
---
You still can separate  your camp into pieces and place only the desired one. I.e. you dont have to place whole house when what you need is 1x1 with stash, bench and anti-mosquito turret
---
Mh.. well could be that they were talking about the zeros it has like the other helmets i saw. So 0 Physical 0 Energy and 0 Rad.
---
Other then that though it has nothing. Doesn't even help with airborn diseases and that.
---
Id take a save wipe if i didnt have to unlock all those plans again. Spent 6 hours server hopping for lever action plans
---
Any enemy that drops an explosive weapon should automatically drop a plan for this and lighted variants of it.
---
No, it's not that because weapon damage scales with pvp, and in fact, a low level player has a bit of an advantage over a high level player. There is functionally no real difference between a level 50 and a level 100 player, fwiw aside from perk card possibilities.
---
But even if that were the case, what drew me to this topic to begin with was a friend of mine, level 205 or thereabouts, was one-shotted in slap damage today. I was wondering how on earth that was possible. Stacked bobbleheads makes a lot of sense -- it took me quite a few shots to kill the group with a stupid-good weapon and they were taking full damage. 
---
They are used in game to wish to be grown up. I used one and next day my character woke up as Tom Hanks. True Story.
---
.....80-90s reference for all you young people :P
---
"No" -Bathesda
---
Maybe it never lasted long enough... hopefully the op just had slow internet for a bit and this won't be consistent
---
I wish man. There's an entire sub economy out there for virtual items in pretty much every online game. Given how people complain about how there's nothing to do in 76 I figured it wouldn't be as robust as it is but a quick online search will show you how much business is being done. 
---
Summersville. Shoot supermutants and collect more 308 and hunting rifle mods than you will know what to do with. Then do it again.
---
Only a few days until this cancer is over, stay strong brother
---
They are, played with a guy the other night who told me he  bought his.  Personally, I would get really bored of the game if I had that sort of firepower.
---
Dodgy is a great perk when out of power armor. However, it is better to focus on AP with that perk. AP becomes health with dodgy.
---
That wouldve been nice yeah. Those rusty steel walls are ugly as hell
---
Amazing! Thank you!
---
You need to keep in mind, that you technically take off every other armor if you hop into PA. Means if you have like carryweight and strength on your chestpiece you basically take it off if you get inside PA.
---
So you loose like 20 carry weight already through that. Or if a armor piece reduces weight for chems or food.
---
It does show if you don't have Class Freak equipped, after you equip it no longer seem to lower your VATS %, even when its there syphoning 13ish %, but even so you seem to miss an awful lot.
---
You’re getting downvoted but I agree. I play solo and if I never went to this sub I probably wouldn’t give a second thought about putting turrets up there pissing people off. 
---
Me too 
---
&gt; To me, a legendary two-shot + explosive weapon is not only *rare*, it's non-existent.  
---
You are exactly right, which means I shouldn't see one every single time I go to white springs or the Uranium Fever event... but I do.   Which means duping is out of control.
---
Also, if you see anyone giving paint jobs away, give them a high five 
---
Yup maybe next week if my orders increase!
---
Really? I heard it's gonna drop on 15th.
---
What kinda 3 stars you got? And serums?
---
"I have the hardest working liver in the universe, and now there's a hole in it."
---
I think you mean makes her never take off from the ground again
---
Woohoo!! hell yeah im stopping by! 
---
Ive been crafting healing salve when I get low on stimpacks. The ingredients are very easy to find.
---
Also to add, power armor puts you at 11 str which is where the carry weight comes from for some people. If you're already at or past 11 str, you won't get any carry weight. 
---
Pity you couldn't have set it on fire and threw it on his corpse
---
Dude he fell out of thin air!
---
I realize this is a generalization but if you bought a TSE weapon with real money you, sir, are a moron. Just the dumbest, most gullible, dipshit with far too much money for your own good. 
---
For what?  I've played the game a lot and had zero issues.   
---
I cannot begin to describe how useful this is. Thank you!
---
&gt;The "Display Cases" plan (sold by Pendleton at The Whitespring) unlocks nothing.
---
I must've bought that plan like 4 times because I never saw what it unlocked (and I really wanted some display cases). This explains a lot.
---
Remember also that Sony Build for better true life colours and less vibrant colours like samesung:) for example. If you want more vivid colours you could true changing colour settings on the Bravia.
---
Might be hard to see in the pic but this is the lighted version, it has a little lamp mounted on it right above the edge of the screen. I don't think there's just a paper poster version of it
---
If I could upvote this a billion times I would!
---
I agree with these words of advice.
---
You know I'd be happy if I could just have my goddamn Deep Pockets mods in power armor, to hell with everything else. 
---
I'm losing like fifty pounds of carry weight in that shit. 
---
Not if you want inside the building
---
Speed demon, herd, healing, grounded, chameleon, marsupial, bird bones, plaque walker ass for three stars could you be more specific my inventory is large
---
Yeah. Alt blows. Find myself never using grenades like I did in FO4. 
---
Weird how you're downvoted for that, but the person above is upvoted
---
Where did you find the plan, and if youre on os4 will you sell me one please
---
OMG! You are awesome! Thank you so much! 
---
Saw one near the Charleston train station. Ran right past it and might not have noticed if I hadn’t heard the turrets.
---
Why did I get downvoted?
---
I would've kept a bit because screws springs and gears are harder to come by
---
Get a hazmat suit.  Raw flux from nukes zones = $$$
---
TSE's.
---
Also, I will take Speed Demon and Healing for serums.
---
People are making 1000s of $. Unfortunately it's true. It's horrible. Worst part is. All those guns are worth nothing. Takes 2 days of trading to vendors to get enough money to buy a 2 shot explosive weapon, you only need what you'll use. The rest I guess is to have as a collection, which will seem useless or like nothing when weapon lvls increase, which will most definitely happen. People wasting their money
---
Anyone else wondering water a duper is?
---
Did I say 5k to 10k? Although, that *is* what they're worth now because of supply and demand. What's your point?
---
I agree the DCs are annoying as f**k. I clear an area then I'm about to go salvage for junk then I get DC. 
---
Oh I'm sure there's still some way to dupe on PC.
---
I have the lvl 3 bargain perk.  Marine Tactical Helmets sell for 31 caps each.  I just became about to make these 2 days ago.  
---
Outfits are easy to sell and carry compared to other items like weapons.  I hate carrying high levels of Bulk items because you can lose them if someone kills you.  I prefer to take clothes to Harpers Ferry Vendor and Watoga BOS Super Duper Mart where they dont have stash boxes.  
---
PS4 message
---
I hate duping, but why throwaway the gains that you got from killing the prick?
---
Yea and mine oddly enough was controller related. Have a titan fall themes controller that gets all hanky in this game i went back to regular Xbox controller and all was fine.
---
Wouldn't it be actually funny if this guy farmed all of this stuff legit and he just had some guy shoot him and dump all of his stuff in a river.
---
(I realize that this is not the caee but it's funny in my mind nonetheless)
---
I heard there is, but it's not publicly known.
---
Selling junk in bulk is a good income source. Also check the wiki see which vendors have the same faction/ cap stash so you don't waste money on fast travel only to see they have no caps left. They regenerate every day per player, not server based.
---
I just build a 1x1 tile with generator, power switch, power counter, and a speaker. The speaker made sound each time I flipped the switch on. I also connected the terminal in another iteration of the test, and modified the counter value, and it made sound each time I switched it on, and the counter did not reset after reaching the "max" value.  
---
It seems that its simply broken.
---
Pretty sure it’s what you think, not sure though
---
Yeah I'm practicing my fast twitch in BlackOps4 free for all to survive in Appalacia ... Mmmm GKS.
---
Gatling gun 25% less vats/ Gatling laser 90% reduced weight/ , lvl 40 combat shotgun +50 damage resist while aiming
---
oh of course they intended to sell it.
---
http://dulfy.net/2018/11/22/fallout-76-vendors-locations-and-factions-guide/
---
They’re not supposed to.
---
Try going to the different factions at least as they are separate pools. Good luck. 
---
r/fo76baazar
---
This is a poetic and beautifully written comment. Especially the part:
---
&gt; Grow up.
---
Fuck dupers.
---
You can place them all down but once you place down more than 1 you lose the recall ability and anyone can walk up and take one of your PA's
---
It does less damage than a Hardened .308
---
a week ago I came across a camp with all the doors locked, I found a window with a workbench in view, and used that to 'teleport' into their house.
---
I spent about 5 minutes looking around, and they came home.  Hit me with a ?? emoticon, so I had them unlock the door to let me out, and showed em how to warp into their locked house.
---
they closed the shutters, and I went on my merry way.
---
But duping in this game does affect everyone on the server. Duping causes server lag, instability, and crashes. It makes it hard to play when people are exploiting the game and causing the entire server to have to load all the extra data.
---
Since I'm basically a pharmacy, I had some fun and put bone chimes at my door that ring when you walk in. 
---
I feel like server stability and vats realtime updating is a bit of a problem together lol
---
Bulk and sell junk I just found I had 700 absbestos and 800 nuclear material in my inventory they sell for 1-2 caps each also I bulk glass and bulk ceramic leather etc. I'm a bit of a hoarder so it's easy to stay up on caps. 
---
Make a loop there's plenty of guides on it I start at either whitesprings RR or Harpers ferry then hit all the factions
---
oh equip hard barginer before selling
---
My fast travel loop 
---
From Harpers ferry
---
Watoga station
---
Walk to BOS vender
---
R &amp;G station
---
Lewisberg Station
---
Whitespring bunker
---
Whitespring Station (or shops same cap pool)
---
Boom 1400 caps with the cheapest fast travel expenses
---
Yes. It's seems to be worse for me.
---
one of the dupe exploits... I work in computer security, I know at least two other ways.  Not sure if it's "common knowledge" with the cheaters yet, but I've been reporting to Bethseda 
---
Ther is two bots the one that spawns with the eyes bots and the one that spawns alone, the one with the eyes bots is the one u can trade with and the other one its just a regular bot 🙂
---
&gt; just spent my first day
---
I feel like you should play it for longer than a day before telling people whether its worth the price.
---
Where's your base?
---
tesla rifle count as heavy weapon...
---
As of now, cosmetics
---
Selling drugs got me almost all of my caps in fallout 4 and 76
---
Anti-Material Rifle, 12.7 mm handgun, Ranger Sequoia, That Gun, Fido, Plasma Defender, Nightkin Bumper Sword, to name a few.
---
That sucks. Though I will say that the two shot legendary on weapons that are designed more for sniping is less valuable, since your shot spread gets ridiculous.
---
you're right to point out the contradiction, but you're making an assumption based on a false premise: that the same people opposing micro transactions are the exact same people who are paying IRL cash for duped items.
---
yes, I'm sure there's a crossover but I think the people paying cash for items are in the definite minority of the game's player base. having said that, I think it would be a grave mistake for BGS to offer "loot crates".
---
I'm on Xbox, the One X, with killer internet, and disconnect constantly. Seems to be a total crap shoot 
---
Ah sweet, I did not no that. I thought there was only the one bot and and I have seen the same robot 3 times so thought there might of been an issue.
---
Thank you 👍
---
Bravo to you for dumping the dupes. There’s a lot of issues with this game, but the “fans” that dupe or play along with it have only hurt the game and fan base they claim to love. Fallout fans are quite intelligent and find a way to push damage/builds/bases to their max but this is when it falters. 
---
Being bored is not an excuse to screw everyone else’s game up. If Bethesda has any chance at polishing this game up to be what we all wanted, then the dupers are on the opposing side. They break a game that’s already already been tearing at the seams. Those of us that had to work for our gear, caps, and experience are the true fans. I’m fine if fallout fan base drops off all the casual gamers that hop new game to new game forever chasing the flavor of the week. Same goes for the view hungry youdupers that are finally getting some pushback. 
---
Someone came up with a good solution. Leave all duped items in their inventory as items that can’t be used, sold, or dropped. Break their over-encumbered backs and hopefully the games economy can bounce back. Let’s face it if true fans were stuck in a vault with these scummy people and then let free, we all knew they wouldn’t last long out there. Maybe without them we can enjoy the upcoming vault update and raise hopes on the future of this game/franchise. At least enough to give it another chance. 
---
Twin lakes just south of when you spawn in
---
What people do with their money is their own business, let's not mix up agendas.  I agree duping is an issue (I don't experience that many disconnects, and if bethesda would implement even the most basic feature of letting us rejoin a previous server, it would be even less of an issue), but it is tiring to see so many little duping anecdotes upvoted to the front page constantly.
---
Or just jump through the window (the bars on windows dont have collision, know this works for brick and metal) or teleport through it if a workbench is near a window. No bounty
---
It takes a strong will to dump 7k screws.
---
Also... Make display cases display things!
---
Love the straight jackets in Defiance, it's even better that they only weigh 0.1 each
---
Im glad to know they at least exist!
---
Telsa rifles definitly do. They one shot the ghouls at the golf club and its is great. I have a two shot one and a instigating one. They function pretty much alike. The one was surprising was the two shot exploding telsa, which is a bit of a downgrade. Gets rids of the bolts and replaces it with two rifle bullets that act like shotgun pellets. Only way i could make it useful was putting it on automatic.
---
20 caps !
---
This would be nice to know.  I too am curious.
---
I had no idea! Thank you so much! If I find them Ill hit you up for a reward!
---
and there is vegetarians too...
---
No
---
For most things, yeah - i have a two-shot lever action that is still somehow pretty accurate. /shrug
---
hate to hijack the post, but do you know where raider plans are? 
---
If youre on xbox ill give you some, I dont use the hunting rifle currently
---
I think it’s 650 caps I’m not sure though
---
Let’s change the context. Say you go to a board game cafe or similar and try to play Monopoly, Settlers of Catan, Cards against Humanity, poker, or some other board game with strangers with the same attitude you’ve expressed in your post. 
---
Running with Monopoly: You bring in money from 10 other Monopoly sets to pad your bank account, stick the best chance cards from those sets up your sleeve, etc. You insist on playing by house rules that ruin the gameplay instead of the rules Parker Brothers printed on the box. 
---
Nobody will want to play with you. 
---
The same applies to an online game, except other players don’t get the option to not play with you. Exploiting allows you to bypass the enforcements of the agreed upon rules, or more accurately the game rules Bethesda set out. 
---
Don’t be the person nobody wants to play with. 
---
When you role a 10-sided dice you have a 90% chance of it not coming up a 5.
---
It’s still possible to role it 100 times and every role comes up a 5. Unlikely, but possible. You’re not guaranteed a 90% average because each role is a separate event, each roll is a 90% chance of “not 5”, but the average depends on aggregate data where each event is independent and thus you’re not likely to get 90% “not 5”.
---
I believe that’s what the person you’re replying to is trying to say.
---
You can get 50 lbs per leg in PA, with the right mods.
---
Bone is crafted into cutting fluid I think. So that helps with gunpowder also
---
So some cheater got it from the dev room, and doesnt exist in the game yet. Hopefully they add it soon
---
Of course it isn't player level.  Generation youtube isn't playing with a full deck.
---
Are you looking for rp or just grouping?
---
Check out r/TalesfromAppalchia they also have discord server.
---
Jeez man you guys really love to complain about F76.
---
That's not exaclty how that works. Server performance is no worse now than it was before Duping. Betheada is kind of lucky to have dupers in a way because everyone thinks its dupers fault that the servers suck but in reality they have been this way since day one. Its nice for Bethesda that they dont have to take any responsibility for their incompetence. Agian, I agree that duping is bad for the ingame market amongst players and so I don't support it however everything else wrong with this game, including server performance, falls entirely on Bethesda. 
---
God dammit, you're the BEST!
---
That's an end game quest, maybe wait until you are closer to the appropriate level. 
---
I noticed. I meant like thw one that the entire things are a light.
---
Mothman eggs made into mothman omelets gets about 158 caps. I also sell chess. Keeps me in fast travel caps.  
---
Mine were 650 before hard bargain perk
---
Certainly an oversight on Bethesda's part, no reason for the Marine Armor Helmet and Wood Helmet to not be obtainable.
---
Elmer's glue or duct tape your choice
---
Yeah specially after the patch I'm missing %95 of the time.
---
dont forget cranberry cobblers!
---
Thanks for the info. I think I'll get 1000 and some chems to be safe tho
---
Between those levels or those levels and beyond?
---
Thanks for the info!
---
I believe that's how it is, my lvl50 weapons are cheaper to repair than before and I'm lvl235.
---
Nah, save your caps and help someone else in the future when they need it and you can.  Just glad I could help and hope you get them quick to get you back to taking out the wastelands baddies!
---
Apparently its 650
---
Pretty sure one burns and the other has bonus crit damage.
---
I wouldn't know for certain... Cause why would that be explainee?
---
Yeah yesterday I went to my base and two level 6’s were beating on my generators. I shot at their feet and they ran away and of course their two higher level friends came out. (I’m 115 they wrrr around 170) I figured based on this sub, “My TSE lever action should take this guy out in one shot” no, it took like four or 5, and I only got one before the other killed me.  
---
But earlier I was one shot with a pistol. 
---
Yeah I get that. Probability determines the likelihood of an outcome, average (mean) determines the actual outcome. However in a statistically coherent system the two should tend together. In fo76 however they appear to be particularly divergent. That is admittedly based on anecdotal data, but there's many people for whom that appears to be true.
---
Yeah, in a nuke zone, pick the flowers
---
RIP. I got it in ps4
---
because you said "heff"
---
Sounds like a mule character.
---
I wouldn't count on this being high on their to-do list
---
Did that before with someone's workshop, they used a bench as a wall.
---
I don’t play enough to benefit for eBay money, just for myself.  It the simple solution would be- release a game with no exploits and there would never be an issue. Lmao this game is a joke just like the people in this sub
---
That would be nice
---
painted on the sky
---
&gt;but I think it relates to weapon level
---
Yeah thats what Id say, but Isnt that how its always been tho? Whyd they even bother saying that
---
Screws, springs and plastics are my crutch in this game can't do shit weapon wise cause i never have any of these XD 
---
So here's an easy faction fast travel path
---
Harpers Ferry
---
BOS Vendor bot
---
Whitesprings bunker
---
Whitesprings Station (or shops same cap pool)
---
1400 caps possible seems cap pools refresh about every 18-24hrs IRL time
---
Do this daily and you'll be rolling in caps 
---
I guess. I don't miss with 95% on any of my none two shot guns
---
As of writing:
---
[Prewar Locker](https://i.imgur.com/Sq83MeA.jpg) is only sold via Free States.
---
[Vault Locker](https://i.imgur.com/ylqRfPx.jpg) is only sold by the BoS Vendor *BUT* is in another levelled list too. (I do not know what that list pertains to.)
---
Hope that helps and thank you for a very nice visual compilation.
---
It’s called the drum mag hand made and anti armour shotgun so much fun, the shot gun Kills most things in one shot
---
Are you checking the correct tab? They are under aid
---
People cheat because the game is boring 
---
Have fun trying to bethesda support that while you did have bannable items in your inventory, it was totally just to destroy them, honest! Ill use my brain and pass on that fun-fest.
---
[deleted]
---
I don't agree with purchasing duped items or any items at all with real money but I gotta say its 1000 times better than buying a 20 DOLLAR emote pack that wait for it...... DOESNT EVEN CHNAGE THE EMOTE ANIMATION, and just gives you like 6 new icons on your emotes. The atom shop is partially to blame. People would rather buy somethimg useful than be ripped of by Bethesda any further.
---
Are you lvl50?
---
I'm putting one in me camp now.
---
Oh geez, those locker plans are going to kill me.
---
Okay so i might be reading this wrong, maybe u/wully616 can confirm, but there is no such plan or mod for dense metal limbs (there is dense metal torso, but not limbs). And it appears that the padded combat torso is only available through scrapping combat armors (doesnt drop anywhere in the world).
---
https://youtu.be/PTkHT6UHqkI
---
I've always figured you mix the powdered bone with wonderglue, shape, and then let dry.
---
You stop receiving points at lvl 50
---
OMG how useful!
---
OMG how much work you did!
---
OMG how stupid these names are...
---
There are different loot tables per person. There has to be. My brother has pulled 5 longcoats in a week, tried 10000000000 times fir that. He ports to grafton, bos plans everytime, ive never seen them. Calibrated shocks, i get them all day long. He has never seen 1. 
---
Its to force trade. Its got to be.
---
afaik luck only determines the quality of dropped items
---
no, as has been answered numerous times now
---
You don't see any problem with cheating in unavailable items via a developer test room?
---
What annoys me is I can't place floors on top of foundation, necessitating stairs.
---
Here a is some thing you can do
---
1 turn of the screen for up to 3 days
---
2 reinstall graphic driver in pc setting
---
I guess if you have dmg resistance from junk perk... You'd be an unstoppable slow moving tool
---
You forget this sub is probably not even 5% of all players. Just because everyone here thinks spending real money is dumb doesn't mean all players do. 
---
The mobile gaming industry is worth billions due to micro transactions. It would be no surprise at all that bethesda would make a shitcload of money too. 
---
I would love if they went with different ammo types, hollow points, flechette rounds, shotgun slugs or 000 buckshot, I’d really like to see a 6.5 Creedmoor option
---
But a Barret with depleted uranium or tungsten rounds would be awesome 
---
I wanted to stop by and give you my upvote for your hard work and dedication to the community; as with your contribution. A+ my man!
---
Vendor Groups - If there are 3 vendors in a group they all share the same money group.
---
I'd agree. They are clearly not giving us any stats or dmg reductions, as they are indeed meant to be for cosmetic purposes. That being said however, while hats may or may not happen, I'm fairly certain we'll see something done with helmets at the very least, at some point in the future. Whether that'll be mutually exclusive of cosmetics or not would be the question. While I assume they will implement something like that to give people more to grind out eventually, I also imagine it'll be very much like our "under-armor", few points of damage resistance in x or y and maybe +1 or 2 stats to something.
---
Whats ur gamertag, ill be on later
---
I paid like 689 caps for mine
---
Sure it is
---
I actually don't complain much, I mostly post about good experiences. This time I'm posting about a false advertising I came across in the atom shop. 
---
So jeez please stop complaining about what others post about. What's wrong with you people who feel so entitled to come and post when others have something to report, like you've never talked about the bad things you encountered in the game, you goody-two-shoes, you role models.
---
Sooo things that they should have fixed before the game was released. Lol. 
---
Oh.. that sux. what kind of minigun was that?
---
Aniway, i must be the Unluckiest player in all fallout; i've encountered Countless legendary enemies, most of them 3 stars that had no legendary loot  at all... but the top was yesterday. 
---
Fissure site prime: a horde of players (most of them with shitty guns like me), 40 or  maybe 50 minutes of fight, time and ammo were over for everyone,  and shortly after even weapons went broken;
---
 i was so desperate that i had to use a Furious spear stolen from a  legendary \*\*\*dog that popped up during the fight (wich nobody except me cared about), and after all this bloody and furious battle. . . no legendary item drop for me; not even an ugly melee one.    :(
---
It is a gating mechanic designed to keep you logging in everyday and to prevent you from hording caps.
---
I just put 666 above my door
---
Not off the top of my head, but let me finish rendering some videos and I will hop on the areas I believe I see them fairly often and see if I can get you a spot to server hop farm.
---
Thanks for this! I need that metal set. I have too much steel!
---
ITT: Bethesda can't be at fault for creating opportunities to cheat. 
---
I have an explosive combat shotgun so I don't know what you're talking about. /s
---
Yep.  I mean the TSE handmade is great for distance shooting.  I cant use it inside at all or I kill myself.  Ghouls are difficult because if you shoot them far away but they speed sprint you around the same time you'll blow yourself up.  Excellent on Grafton monster or death claws.  I dont find it effective on Scorchbeasts but others wear by it (although they have TSE Shotguns not the handmade).
---
There is something not right about PvP.  I dont know why system would be set up so anyone could 1 hit anyone in pacifist and kill them.  Id like some PvE servers as soon as possible.  
---
Ill be really sad if they nerf the TSE Handmade because of what some people are doing in a broken PvP system.   Its a great weapon but it isnt the weapon the internet is making it out to be as far as killing other players.  It does 200ish damage and I have 3 rifleman cards 1 level.  
---
I dont even care if people stack their magazines/bobbleheads.  Just STOP allowing PvP for people and their camps that have zero interest!
---
Dude, you're a hero
---
PC as well. Other people typically talk back, or if they don’t they at least communicate with The emotes. 
---
Great see ya soon
---
I didn't know that! Thanks
---
That's the only big thing, yeah. Scrapping all that crap and finding plans again. (But I don't have all that many, anyways. I could never seem to find them.)
---
&gt;Banning the dupers is a good start, but it doesn't go far enough.
---
true. but at first give them temp ban for few days as warning. how most civilised company do... btw i hate cheaters, but the bethesda is the las company what have a rigth to judge cheaters or expoliters. because they do the same in real life for real money.
---
I don't suppose you'd be willing to share this wonderous creation when you have finished it?
---
Wow that's crazy
---
Did you just admit to duping?
---
Supermutants have a pretty good chance  of dropping them as well.
---
Wish he was kidding. [Here's a photo](https://i.imgur.com/7X4BdwZ.jpg). You can see the health and AP bars, as well as the power armor outline on the left and the outline for the compass in the bottom center. It only shows up against yellow and green backgrounds, but still, not cool. Fallout 4 has HUD options, why not include them in 76?
---
This seems reasonable.
---
Instead of an open world bethesda should have sold a small box
---
Nah I think that in fact I’m the one that poked a nerve, since you’re the one that started with the personal attacks and are also continuing to reply, with increasingly ‘edgy’ replies at that. Funny thing is that I wasn’t even trying. 
---
Kids these days, such tender little things.
---
How about people floating in the air also one shotting and generally behaving like a bunch of douches...?
---
That makes no sense :O
---
Why just the explosive one? 
---
Left leg armor keeps disappearing since the latest patch.  Has happened twice in the past 24 hours.
---

2794GB Seagate ST3000DM008-2DM166 (SATA ). I can not build an excavator power armor right leg, it says I don't have what I need for the build , when I do. I lose the benefits of wearing deep pocketed combat armor while in the excavator power armor. Need some help here.
---
Gods work right here! Thank you so much for this!
---
Ahhh cursed on PC. We cant message. You gotta creep into their server and literally whisper at them.
---
Better hope that the Scorchbeast doesn't see us first.
---
I checked my inventory/stash and I haven't seen this happen.
---
The fact that you feel proud of this "accomplishment" really shows how sad of a person you are lmao
---
No bitch dont land when it's done if she is in the air...
---
I have something similar happen randomly on xbox, I can equip a melee weapon, then a gun, both from the weapon wheel, but if I try to swap back to previous it will say "you cant equip that in power armor" even tho I just had it equipped.
---
I think what causes this is if I have a fist waepon equipped, then get into PA. Even if I manually equip a weapon in PA, For some reason it refuses to remember my previous weapon.
---
i farming whitesprings and watoga a month ago every day for 8-10 times. and never seen a tse drop even i have 15luck +chems. those guns r extremly rare. got only few two shot guns with a single star. 
---
if u have and sell it ur stupid or duper.
---
Weird flex but okay
---
In addition to an open world I'd say
---
Let's go COWBOYS!!?
---
And the whole server clapped. Obama was there. That dupers name? Albert Einstein. 
---
I enjoy this sort of thing solely from a can it be done mentallity. Ok, yes, my theory worked and I can one-shot the SBQ using exploits and broken game mechanics to the detriment of the gameplay for everyone else. Now I'll go back to playing the game without using ridiculous exploits and enjoy actually playing the game as intended.
---
Nope, he's right. The only people who play the game are also required to post on Reddit. So it must be that the people here who are upset that people are duping items and selling them are also the people buying duped items. There can't possibly be a separated player base and many people with different opinions, that would be madness.
---
I have mixed feelings on the matter.  On one hand, it'd be a nice thing to not have to grind each character for cosmetics and camp stuff.  On the other hand, it's a minor roadblock if planting with a regular team of like-minded builders.  Your friends can just help build for your alts.  Not sure really if it's a matter of balance, since Atom Camp purchases are account wide.  
---
How tf do you get enough stuff to sell every time
---
Thanks, I was going for a horror movie poster style.
---
Thanks!
---
Unfortunately that's a risk of oleds and playing a lot none stop. I am always cautious as a huge portion of games have static objects. 
---
Console?
---
&gt; We don't need a reason or trigger to make thousands of devoted fans get bummed out with the game and quit. 
---
What do you think will happen to level 5 players who get their camp blown to hell by a level 90 player with two shot explosive weapon that he acquired through duping?  
---
That's exactly what I saw today. 
---
TSE are clearly the most duped weapons out there, and they are clearly the weapon of choice for griefers. 
---
This is beyond dispute. 
---
You talk about people quitting the game in frustration huh? Are you telling me people won't do that if griefers are running rampant with the most powerful weapons in the game because of duping? 
---
I acquired the cooking stove by reading a kitchen stove plan. PS4
---
No link?
---
With Fallout 4 though I can change the color of the HUD once in a while and it's not a problem. 76, I'm stuck with the default.
---
Wow such hate I think you loose the most buddy
---
Sure.  I am still working on it.  I made separate tabs for myself at the bottom.  What I want to do is eventually make a Master Tab that shows all Owned or Wanted.  
---
I have it set to view only but I believe you could copy it and work with it as you like now.  The last tab sheet "Copy" is some stuff I haven't decided how I will categorize yet.  They have some Post and ZZZ and Cut plan names in there...I believe Post ends up in the Atomic Shop as I see the Flame Power armor paint in there.  
---
Anyhow here it is - still in rough draft form but it will give you an idea where Im headed 
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j_InJD8HVYE-YIW9S2kc_0B_VqgQPCMtQQJssP9NOF0/edit?usp=sharing
---
Yeah
---
I don't mind pvp. But not when there's a group of 4 where one appears to be able to hover in the air perpetually and they are all using explosive gattling weapons and can 1 shot you at will and then if you do kill one somehow the others just sit on their bag like they're taking a dump until the dead one comes back so you can't loot it and then they start all over again. Reported and logged off after a few spins of that. Fun fun fun.
---
That wasn't what you said. It's not even close.
---
Do you have any kind of screen refresher? Back in my plasma days you could set this scrolling grey scale to get rid of stuff like that. Didn't know LCDs were so susceptible to image burn
---
I've just stopped trying to play. Maybe in a few months..
---
Take my upvote!
---
I always do a run through of Morgantown airport through the tents and buildings. Seems to be quite a few meds up there. 
---
Whoah now, that is WAY too logical of a choice for Bethesda to implement.
---
Good to know thank you
---
Are you being sarcastic? They can delete an item from the game with a simple patch, same as adding an item, which is way easier than going into millions of individual inventories and looking for specific items
---
I finally figured out what tattoo im going to get to pay homage to my favourite game series
---
"Over encumbered"
---
This is where I had my very first camp! Awesome place, got a few to many visitors for me.
---
There is an way. But there you get no that exp as Whitespring-Resort. Go the the Ultrazit Cave near by the prime fissure. The Scorched will respawn every 2/3 min. Just go in farm at the place before the scorchbeast comes. :) 
---
It's OLED, not LCD. The TV does have a 'clear panel noise' thing it does when you shut it off, but it can only do so much. Eventually, the burn will be permanent.
---
You deserve this Platinum, it makes me want to play the game again after losing some steam on it. Appreciate the time and effort on this!
---
Yea like in f4 touch can't wear a hat (ex baseball cap) and a gas mask wth goggles like wtf
---
""You miss 95% of the shots you don't take"
---
-Fusion2005"
---
-Michael Scott
---
Guessing its because its essentially the assault gasmask (shit raiders wear) just without the mask
---
i think the same thing happened in Fallout 4
---
Ive done all the exploits- XP, caps, you name it. Who cares? I basically play alone or with my brother. You act like anything I do in this game matters lol the economy was ruined from the start. Literally nothing I do will change anything in this game
---
and? kill the robots too. this is how is farm fusion cores...
---
Yeah, it is a lot on Bethesda's part. I'm just saying it does have an affect on others playing the game.
---
Go into a silo. It will continously spawn more robots until you clear it or leave. 
---
Well then, I think I should probably close my shutters too...
---
Try it solo for yourself instead of being a dipshit and come back to me kiddo.
---
A power armor is more like a tank than a siut of armor. Thats why you don't get the benefit of the underarmor.
---
Don't be sad you still have your walking tank, not bad right? :)
---
There's a huge difference between removing items that are tagged to not even be in the game yet, as opposed to differentiating between a legitimate and a duped items with the same tag.  Maybe stop talking out of your ass and actually learn a little something about the behind the scene game code.
---
It worked fine during the BETA, no issue. However now adding anyone will make them disappear off the recent list. Unfriend them and they appear back, neither will add them to friends list.   
---
All other games are fine.   
---
I don't have the PC version, only xBox  
---
Today xBox live was having issues but this has been going on for awhile  
---
Additionally the only way I can accept a team invite is finding them on the map.   
---
Joining them in game has to be done through xBox, invite to game or join game option.   
---
Just weird, there is something checked somewhere, who knows, maybe my fault, just want to try and figure out what it is...lol
---
It's not really farming since they don't give you exp (after some point) or loot (ever).
---
A pretty miniscule one I think, other than the market being flooded which I'm sure will be fixed since they just started bamning dupers.
---
You can easily go into settings and change HUD opacity. Do people even bother to fucking check this shit before posting and winning? 
---
is it cosmetic or does it increase a def or special stat ?
---
Might want to list your platform 
---
you nuked yet?
---
This absolutely is a solo player game tho with multiplayer on the side.
---
Yes, but people defending bethesda are even worse. 
---
Where was my invite scrub
---
the issue is they should a separate tab of your build that grows as you find them, activated on limited charges and recharge timers, they should never have been another type of chem to consume
---
It's easy hoard everything, scrap everything, bulk what you can lather rinse repeat then sell bulked items you'd be suprised how quick you get bulk ceramic and glass this way
---
the only junk you shouldn't sell is
---
Black titanium
---
Screws
---
Gears
---
Springs (god I wish I had some springs)
---
And maybe keep 100 or so of everything else and sell the rest
---
I also sell all the garbage legendaries I get trying to farm the good stuff
---
You could also sell extra non legendary guns/armor instead of breaking them down
---
Incorrect; I RUN plasma gats and energy weapons despite their problems and I can assure you that goddamn thing NEVER holds a charge, if you switch a weapon, its gone, you put it away and do something, its gone. 
---
it can be done.
---
Judging from their comments they're a duper and have no sense of the actual game.
---
Could start with building some Vaults and make up stories about how a Chinese Communism should be destroyed.
---
Some of the other ones probably stack.  Those are just the ones I have heard information about.
---
How about fixing this shit before release like a competent developer?
---
I bought it at Harpers Ferry. Seen them there a few times. 
---
You're right. I missed that the person was wanted. My bad
---
The community is full of shill accounts of Bethesda PR, and people with low standards for AAA $60 games. There is no community
---
I sure hope that's the case.
---
My water farm would go into absurdity territory.
---
24 ;)
---
But seriously I'm a MMO &amp; Fallout 4 vet, so when I was trying to level I did so very fast and efficiently 
---
They "fixed" duping yet server crashing factually got worse post patch.
---
So there goes that scapegoat you people had for defending such a sorry state of the game. 
---
Correct, it looks like the Dense mod is only available on torsos.
---
I can't find anything called "padded", perhaps you mean Cushioned? Cushioned is only available for legs and that it will spawn as part of the LPI_Recipe_mod_armor spawns
---
Bro. A level 90 is going to destroy a level 5's camp of next to nothing if he wants to, whether theres a TSE involved or not. The demolition perk makes even basic weapons vaporize camps and workshops. TSEs aren't pulling the ass hole trigger, a person is.
---
I'm trying to bridge a connection here man. Do you not see my point? 
---
Ps4...need many. Its nuts
---
so many other perks that are better if it isn't reduction
---
You are 100% correct on this. TSEs, and I don't care WHICH TSE it is, will not kill someone with slap damage. I know this, because my friends and I have various max-level TSEs and all of us have level 5 demolition expert and are spec'ed into the guns we use most.  
---
A TSE Harpoon gun will give out a small chunk in slap damage. A TSE .50 Cal will give out less damage, though the high rate of fire will allow you to kill someone with slap damage fairly quickly. It's certainly not a one-shot or even 10 shot though. With a handmade -- forget it. You're not killing someone with slap damage.
---
Remove the ability to stack bobbleheads and magazines, and you will remove the ability to one-shot with slap damage.
---
Yeah leather armor too. Usually I just make new armor from scratch because of this.
---
Can someone explain why people are willing to spend up to 18 dollars for a mere texture?
---
There are 7 vendor factions with linked cap pools, so you can sell 1400/day. Google FO76 vendor map and you'll find a color code map showing who's linked. 
---
I addressed this in my feedback letter, and my idea thinks of it as the BASE, a multi character build with leveling as a group (your own characters or you and a community that has chosen to be a faction together)
---
I'll come 
---
I want to be able to see it against the background, not have a ghost of a HUD. Changing the color lessens the issue, making the HUD blend into the background is a shitty bandaid.
---
How do you know they didn't earn it legitimately? Just assuming anyone you dont like if being a duper back you look like a pathetic asshole imho.
---
How do I attach a screen shot, it tells me pictures aren't allowed.
---
Yes that's right. With my power armor in FO4 I always wore full charisma gear for trading.
---
That's a little different but most likely a glitch 
---
I rarely leave my PA I'm terrified of the wasteland and my guys a germaphobe poor fella 
---
Oh by chance is your secondary a death tambo, moleman gauntlet, or power fist because those can't be used in PA
---
Yea I check under AID, they are under the same tab as bobbleheads
---
Me too
---
Spoiled meat 
---
Spoiled fluids
---
Spoiled vegetables 
---
Syringer ammo 
---
Crossbow bolts 
---
Stuff I usually drop because it’s garbage !!!
---
That's *exactly* what everyone on this sub was saying.
---
You mean downvoted?
---
For scorchbeats, I’ve found using a TSE rifle on their butthole works best. 
---
Just loot different locations and come back to the same location later. They patched farming for resources because people were server hopping like crazy, now you just have to circle back. It's not too bad, just explore and you will find stuff naturally ..
---
I hope its true
---
But I can give you exposure!
---
LOL!  You are a better shot than I ;)
---
We've never had an economy dude. Theres no auction house. Anyone is worth whatever the seller says it is and no amount of duping would change that fact.
---
Change the recon scope to this
---
Hip firing's generally the way to go it seems,  VATS or otherwise.
---
Scopes hilariously seem to have some insane bloom effect when actually aimed, but make hip firing like a laser.
---
Lmao my friends do it literally everyday then sell it to people. But just because 85% of the other players do it and we sell the stuff we dupe cheaper than regular. Yea I see it’s sorta cheating but it’s still in the game and most of the community (on my platform) does it because it’s an easy way to get cash. If they didn’t want it theyd remove it, not punish people who do it
---
If you keep winning why would you change your behavior?
---
So you're saying they removed these items from the game completely amd unilaterally. For what purpose? To put them back in later? Are these items just gone from EVERYWHERE? Including the developer room? And if they can do this thing, then why (and this is my point from the beginning) claim that they *do not* have the ability to add or remove things from player inventories? This has been their mantra since the community first started asking for solutions to the Duping issue. Essentially they just keep on with the, "shrug, nothing we can do about it" routine. It seems they intend to track and ban dupers now, which is great. Bottom line is that they either can or cannot add or remove items from player inventories. 
---
Hope that was more clearly stated... and in regards to tone, not trying to be aggro or condescending, just clarifying. Cheers!
---
Ugh, that's officially unluckier than me!
---
TSE, why he's so mad
---
I love how they named him wooby
---
Whoosh...
---
...that’s not the right word...
---
This is pretty dumb. Any end game player could make 10k+ of 5 different ammos in a day and 1,000 carry weight is super low. A lot of people hoard and play with 1,000+ weight just walking around 
---
They must have a way
---
Well I have to wait until they land so not that impressive lol. 
---
Blame the lack of text chat.
---
I generally prefer operating alone, or with my friend, but I can't really convey much at the moment  if somebody is talking on mic and since I don't use one, I can't exactly mime a conversation using emotes.
---
They said they couldn't do it at all... I'd say that falls clearly in the scope of the definition of impotence. 🤔
---
Im xbox
---
Gobi Scout Rifle!!!!
---
No Oblivion is obviously a digital location....
---
A download would be required to reach it. 
---
It's how Bob was able to enter the Game in the show Reboot.
---
When I'm over encumbered but AP doesn't drain and I can fast travel. 
---
I already bought it for my warehouse and I like it. 
---
I'm agree that the pictures are misleading, just pointing out that there are several photos since some people don't realise you can scroll across to view extra preview photos. For example, one of the preview photos for the Scarlett Sniper outfit has no gloves which is how it looked in game. 
---
After 378 hours I have 4 alts, all between 3-6k junk, ammo..etc.
---
&gt;However in a statistically coherent system the two should tend together.
---
That’s the thing: because each event is independent it’s entirely possible for them not to tend together.
---
Yes. I’m convinced that graham can spawn anywhere a random encounter/enemy can. I have a camp just to the west of NAR trainyard in the ridge and there is a random enemy spawn just under the cliff outside of a bandit overlook. Usually it’s a wolf/scorched/supermutant but twice it’s been graham and moo moo and he heads east to the highway and then towards Whitesprings. 
---
I haven't noticed an issue with xp, but if that's the case it's shitty. As for loot, the legendary bots still dropped stuff for me, and they seem to span fairly regularly when you get near the silo portion.
---
I guess the other option is just server hopping and jumping to places with high spawn rates like west tek and dyer chem
---
Are you referring to the +100 carry weight for the excavator armor or no? 
---
Padded combat armor torso (Explosion1, and Explosion2 is Dense): [https://imgur.com/1IorY3Z](https://imgur.com/1IorY3Z)
---
I've got a 22 pound handmade that would beg to differ, and no weight management perks for it.
---
IDK, you should ask those who spend it on. Believe it or not the Atoms used to buy these items are also earned in game, not just by paying real money. So every time you see atom shop items being mentioned, don't imidiately assume the people mentioning them payed real money for them.
---
Are you on pc? If so I'm pretty sure I saw your place a couple of nights ago. A friend of mine and I were hanging out around watoga and some people launched two nuke at fissure site prime. We both thought your build was awesome. 
---
Whatever you say. None of that changes the inaccuracy of your prior comment re: "only the first shot is slap damage."
---
You're a ridiculous person.
---
Yeah since a whole power armor set weighs 10 pounds
---
I've only seen one mothman in 200 hours of playing. It was attacking me before I came out of my llad screen. I was going Ti get a pic with it after I killed it  but I didn't realize it disintegrated upon death. :(
---
Upload to imgur then paste the link into the text part of your post.
---
Lies
---
I play a few days a week for like 2 to 3 hours and usually have at least one disconnect. I’m on Xbox One X. 
---
With the spammed SB Scream I wondered how you even saw it.  LOL ;)
---
probaly planed atomic shop items... btw really lame thing to place them into live servers...
---
You would probably enjoy circuit farming brother.  Here are the ones I do level 50+ and I get a great deal of enjoyment from doing them.
---
Circuit A - Whitesprings Club -&gt; Huntersville -&gt; West-Tek (inside and out) -&gt; National Isolated Radio Array -&gt; National Radio Astronomy -&gt;Sugar Grove -&gt;Hawkes Refuge -&gt; Wendigo Cave -&gt; 
---
Circuit B - Thunder Mountain Power Plant (outside) -&gt; Crevasse Damn -&gt; Dolly Sods -&gt; Dyer Chemical -&gt; Abandoned Waste Dump -&gt; Harper's Ferry -&gt; Valley Galleria -&gt; The General's Steakhouse -&gt; Robco Research -&gt; Ranger District Office
---
Circuit C - All the scorch beast fissure zones ending with fissure prime -&gt; Streets of Watoga -&gt; Watoga EMS
---
Circuit D - Just Glassed Caverns, tons of scorched spawn whenever you harvest a certain number of ultracite nodes so you can go be a super murder hobo to your hearts content in there.
---
Hope this helps and happy hunting!
---
This is amazing, thank you! 
---
If a person is dumb enough to pay real money for duped items, they are probably dumb enough to buy Loot Crates. 
---
I doubt there are many (if any) people saying no to loot crates that are buying duped items.
---
Umm, without weight perks my inventory is around 1500, with perks I'm able to fast travel.
---
Did you try water boarding them before graciously giving them, posibaly the best items that they will  ever acquire in there life? Sometime the good old fashioned hockey punch works too.
---
the technology just isn't there yet
---
Thx!!
---
Yes! After almost 100 hours suddenly tonight the lag is so bad I cant play. What the hell?
---
Glass Cavern could be a decent option. Plenty of scorched and then 1-2 beasts at the end that are easy as fuck to kill since they can't fly. 
---
Thanks! This is incredibly helpful, unlike the plan names ingame:
---
"Wind instruments" - contains a single brass instrument.
---
 But did you get to make music with an older star on a giant toy piano?
---
Curious. I got my own issues too. I never can share a perk. Every time I press 'Share' the share Symbole appears and a few seconds later it's gone. That sucks because I play most of the time with my team. 
---
If I'm at a vendor or crafting station and there's another player there, I usually get all my unusable plans (and any ammo i don't use) and drop them into any nearby box. Then let them know.
---
Those of us playing it love it IN SPITE OF it's many flaws.  If you enjoyed Fallout 4 you will probably find enjoyment playing this.  I am 340+ hours in and still playing new builds and finding new things to experience.
---
He only sometimes spawns once I got 2 lvl 60 charred ghouls both bosses
---
Duping for crafting mats for exp maybe ? 
---
Play on PS4 and I get one every couple of hours 
---
I never claimed to know anything about coding. But presumably those who are designing and administering the game content SHOULD know what they can and cannot do. If they've repeatedly told the community they cannot, and then suddenly they can, I think that speaks directly to the way they have interacted with the community in general, and especially where the question of duping and bug fixes are concerned. Perhaps it is more difficult to manage certain things, but if they've done this, it can hardly be impossible.
---
So you’re a shitbird for doing things that the game allows you to do? Doesn’t make sense. Don’t be bitter about what other people do to make the game enjoyable

Only a small number of players in any game will actually spend money on loot boxes and/or buying duped gear on eBay. So the same people complaining about buying duped gear will be the same people complaining if they added loot boxes. And he same small % buying duped gear will be the same small % who actually want loot boxes. 
---
Everyone is entitled to an opinion, just as you are entitled to be a cuck.
---
Duping is duplicating items through sn exploit. A duplicated item has been duped, and the one duplicating that item is a duper. It's just easier than saying duplicating duplicate duplicators.
---
I found a bag in the river with 1 mil weight
---
You sound like a pathetic duper with no game sense. Tey it out for yourself then come back to us kiddo.
---
This is utter bullshit.  You can DEPLOY as many power armors as you want.  You can recall them at any time regardless of how many are out.  The people spreading this nonsense around are also the same idjits that told people to DROP their power armors instead using the E/activate key to deploy, thus making the armor susceptible to theft and loss.  Stop spreading FUD around.
---
Yeah I know fist weapons cant be used in PA, but when they automatically get unequipped is when it breaks the quick swap left d pad. It is a pair of knuckles. 
---
I am pretty sure it's true. However the intial game load is the only one long enough to see the cycle start. 
---
I also could be wrong, and this could be one of those Sinbad's Shazaam movie false shared memory things.
---
Oh for fuck sake. You complain about not being able to change the opacity. I point out that you can change it. You downvote me and move the goal post.
---
Fucking whiny bitch. 
---
Radaway, not rad away 
---
Possible, but not likely.
---
However, while I respect what you're saying and think you know what you're talking about, given that we're dealing with about 30 unverifiable anecdotal data points it's probably not worth a deep dive into stats theory :-)
---
Enjoy the eventual ban.

My buddy that drops scorch beasts in under 20 seconds disagrees. He's using stealth crit rifle build.
---
It’s not unbelievably bad. But it depends on what you liked about New Vegas. If it was the story, characters and impactful choices that made you enjoy the game, then don’t buy this. If you enjoyed exploring, doing quests and building a character then you will probably enjoy this game. 
---
It’s a fun game, just know what you’re getting yourself into. 
---
This is fantastic, thank you, your holiness!  
---
I picked up the 'Tool Chest' just a couple days ago and it did indeed unlock its namesake in the C.A.M.P. 
---
Oh good, it's not just me. Mine gets stuck in a loop of 'controls disabled' and then 'waiting for a response from the server' and it just sits there looping forever.
---
It's really killed my desire to go and claim workshops, especially when I'm spending 30 caps and a bunch of ammo to do it and then get disconnected after obtaining 3 lead scrap and two purified water. Talk about bad ROI.
---
I love the game. Never trust reviews. I never do
---
I've gotten them very rarely. I play primarily on the PC and PS4 on the side. 
---
I personally feel it is an amazing game and am thoroughly enjoying it.
---
That being said, there are numerous bugs, lag spikes, disconnects, balance issues, ect...
---
One man's trash is another man's treasure.
---
If you bought digital editions BGS was allowing digital upgrades to Tricentennial edition around Xmas.  Message them nicely and see if they will still allow you
---
a duper came to my camp once and d ropped an explosive shot teslsa shot, explosive shot gstling gun,  and explosive shot pump action shotgun and i only use them for when a high level enemy is just getting annoying. Or if another player wont stop SHOOTING MY GOD DAMN GARAGE DOOR ON MY CAMP
---
I go to nuke zones and just walk around picking flowers to get fluxes. Those sell for high caps and you can get a butt ton if you have the perk that doubles all the flowers you pick, it also gives you double the flux.
---
This is Amazing! Thank you very much!
---
Id lol withe the lockers (I was looking for the clean white one) "Two Plans. Same name. Same price. Good luck."
---
It should be stable by now but isnt. Its a huge company, not a indie company. No excuses
---
I thought we had all agreed to leave them on the body to the left of the Vault 76 entrance. That's what I've been doing anyway.
---
Yes, and yes also screen shot stacked legendaries there are so many variation I highly doubt you managed to get 10- 3* legendary TSE Shotguns I call BS on even 2
---
With 1* legendaries is possible to get duplicates without cheating but 2-3* no way 
---
There's a guy who did a duping vid selling Legendary's for $12-$45 each on his website store that's pretty f*d up and will directly effect our ability to play this game fairly. 
---
Stuff like this may force Bethesda to sell the same stuff (though I hope they never do)
---
If they could auto delete any stacked legendaries that'd be great. I also wish theu could keep track of who's frequently disconnecting that'd be an easy way to stop duping.
---
Monitor them check thier inventory then ban away
---
God's work! Someone likely already said, but "Stone Benches" is sold by Graham and they look like those fancy stone benches you'd see in a garden.
---
I've checked if the masks were still in the containers found in the dev room via Fo76edit and yeah, the masks are still there. Maybe the masks are now automatically removed from inventory upon pick up.
---
oh yes. Server disconnects and just random CTDs are now far more common. I love this game, but I really wish Bethesda would make it playable.  
---
Dupers crashing the servers was annoying, but in many ways this is worse. You could always tell when the server was going to crash via duper -- now there's no warning at all.
---
If the snappy has the same damage as a refined .50 then we are literally talking about a 2 point damage difference when compared to a hardened .308
---
Good, at least you see I'm not crazy. But as you can read in the comments here, there are some people that really spent atoms because they thought this door would fit with the other types of walls just because the first pictures are confusing.
---
Personally I spent a good 5 minutes looking at the pictures before deciding to go in game to check the ingame preview. And it's the reason I found it so confusing why I posted here.
---
Others bought it instantly, only to later find out it still has those metal panels on each side.
---
My dream is that the coming content paints the future picture of an evolving and changing WV wasteland. 
---
And it leaves alot of people who thought that the launch content was the permanent state of the game world, and they feel stupid.
---
As you get higher in level and play/explore more, you’ll just learn what locations carry what. I’ve made over 10,000 caps in like two weeks of casual playing just from collecting things I’ve come across.
---
Anyone know where I can buy/get the Barn items?
---
A love hate for sure.. Cant get enough right now and looking forward to future updates  
---
Choosingbeggars 
---
Really? You think it's normal to carry thousands of pounds of items, including thousands of wood, steel, rubber, silver, and other easy to get, items? I'm sure you think it's perfectly normal to carry 17k wood without duping...
---
I'm on an OG Xbox One and can launch nukes just fine. It's Bethesda's shit servers.
---
They spawn near that hole in the golf course, the one with the skeleton at the bottom. They also spawn in the houses next to it. They spawn with high-level ghouls so you can see a level 9 golfer right next to a level 60 fetid cancerous glowing diseased legendary ghoul that rapes level 20 players.
---
They  spawn in that parking lot behind the fire engine House
---
They do not spawn in that Circle you see on the map.
---
There are never very many of them, you're lucky to get 1 to 3 per visit
---
I have done this twice with two characters after they got at least two points into stealth. I believe that's level 25 and above, but I'm  going by memory so don't hold me to that
---
 the reward is not worth what you have to go through to get it. It's just some caps.
---
I’ve heard of this, but I still have such a hard time believing people would actually buy them. I guess it only makes sense since a lot of people support micro transactions. 
---
Still, seems like such a waste of money, to pay more for a weapon than the game is worth. Also wouldn’t it be so much more rewarding to play with it you earned it yourself? I guess people have different mindsets. 
---
The Press asserting the unbelievable badneS is both uninformed and exaggerated. This game so far has been a few hundred hours of the most enjoyable gaming in many years for me. Check out my post on it from my profile page. It’s a game hand built for rpg / adventure gamers and particularly classic feeling if you ever loved a classic pc game like myst or fallout or some newer stuff like portal or last of uS. It’s a hybrid that feels descended from a large cross section of worthy games offering complex customization and character building in a dark setting where almost no one survived. 
---
For what? Arguing with a child who thinks the queen doesn't scale?
---
I don't think knuckles work in PA
---
You are completely missing the point I have stated.  Items in game all have unique ID tags per the type of item.  There is NO distinction between items of the same type.  Duped items have the same ID tags as the originals.  
---
The apples and oranges of this is that the stolen items from the QA room do not technically exist in game yet, even though they have their ID tags assigned to them in the engine.  So it's simple for a Dev to run a script and have the game engine remove any existing copies of the QA items, because they were NEVER supposed to be ingame.  There are NO legitimate items of those types ingame anywhere.

With friends, its one of my favorite online gaming experiences, cause its fallout with friends. Without friends is a GOOD fallout game, with enough great players who will help ya out if ya go ask for it. It has glitches, but no more than Fallout 4. They story is delivered in a neat way. Exploration is more rewarding than I've seen in a Fallout game. And since you are just yourself, the role playing is neat and deep, dont sleep on those cards and how specific your character build can be!
---
Officer, if these people didn't want me to break into their house they shouldn't have had any windows. I mean its glass, its just asking to be broken.
---
These are the same guys that have you shooting right handed with ALL LEFT HANDED GUNS
---
Maybe not hard, but this game is never really "hard" per say. He kills it in 2/3 shots lol. I know they are wayyy more tanky than that. The point is, he isn't doing himself any favors by exploiting, which he obviously is with his TSE. 
---
Constant and now I have a terrible lag. It was unplayable tonight. 
---
I just want to be clear here, so I'm not feeling stupid.....
---
The problem is the two pieces of corrugated metal on either side of the door?
---
Same experience here.

Probably got addicted to cocaine and has a gambling  debt. cocaine is one hell of a drug...

Tell me the difference

Yes.
---
There's a [fountain near the mothman museum](/spoiler) with like 50 mothman eggs to loot in one spot.
---
I've only seen the mothman once and it flew away without attacking.
---
If you play with friends, yes.
---
End game bad, cuz of balance and scaling
---
This happened to me the first time I went to search for the vendor of the mire. Endless level 68 super mutants. I had 600 pounds of sell loot. I should’ve moved a camp and saved the junk to stash but I ended up losing it in glitch death bags. 
---
if you have a marine combat helm, yes it came from the dev room.
---
Seen phoenix do this too. 
---
Yea I’ve started farming there when I need caps.  The assault rifles that drop sell for a lot.
---
Fuck that
---
Oh nice. I'll have to check that out. Must have missed it on my first visit. Thanks! 
---
you could’ve made tons of caps selling it 
---
I was thinking of excluding ammo.  This is more of a thought exercise. Plus letting everyone get a healthy understanding of what normal is.
---
Was the spawn rate crazy for you?
---
All these people talking about having thousands of pounds in carry weight what the hell are you hoarding all this shit for? I have three toons, played like 400 hours and never have been consistently over encumbered. Literally the only items I don’t end up bulking/gifting/selling are springs, screws, lead and steel and top tier multi effect legendaries. Everything else is disposable.
---
You unequip all other armor while wearing power armor, therefore you wouldn't have the benefit of deep pockets while in power armor. 
---
Get hit by a nuke thats all xD u actually have to be right in the center

What building plans do you have?

Fallout 76 in a nutshell.

Yes.   I went in there just to explore and there must have been at least 30-40 that I had to kill before it was over.

He had 231 lbs of screws on him.... And that was just the screws. If you look at just screws and wood scraps you're talking about 740 lbs. You're rodiculous if you don't think this guy was duping.
---
I need to him down again at some point. I know he's gotta have plans I want,  like the mirrored disco ball. 
---
And the outfit that has it naturally put on counts as armor pieces too, so no armor 4 u. Weird.
---
The game isn't forcing me to make floating sky camps either but I'm yet to see anyone banned for that yet.
---
I'm well aware the SBQ scales. I'm also aware she does not scale down to "10-20 shots with an un-optimized build and a handmade".
---
You do realize other people play this game, right. Maybe some of them have indeed soloed and tag teamed the SBQ. Hrmmm.
---
Anyway, you have a great day.
---
I’ve played this game for roughly 50 hours. I disconnected maybe 10 times. My game has crashed however roughly 25 times or an average of once every 2 hours. I’m on PS4 with a FIOS connection. 
---
It’s in the store.
---
Right in the middle fam
---
I don't think they do.  They simply didn't have the monitoring in place that would  have caught it.
---
The only route they can take is a machine learning approach on what they have in inventory.
---
I have about 100 pounds of legendaries in carry weight because I don't have the guts to just drop my legendaries on the ground and leave them there in the hopes that someone might buy them. They would have been long gone now if I could just scrap them.
---
Impactful choices is kind of misleading. 
---
In FO games very few choices have actual real impact. 
---
In 3 for example, Megaton was really the only choice that had much impact. And in reality it's impact was quite minor. It potentially made one location closed off and NPCs would randomly make remarks about it. 
---
For all purpose rifles like my TS Combat Rifle, it's reflex.

For my Guass rifle that I use exclusively for sniping,  I use a recon scope.

Cultist dagger and blade require bone to repair

---
No clue. Most people nuke the Fissure Site or the Whitesprings.
---
So you admit you havent even bothered trying to solo her yourself. K I accept your apology. Maybe I embellished a bit but still I stand by my comment for how quick she fell.
---
wow she ran away :(
---
Well, I haven't sold it, but that doesn't mean I'm not stupid :)
---
It's also an absolutely excellent sandbox for role playing fans to explore. 
---
A wildcard tag added to flowers. Usually that is for a checklist of some type (crafting, quest, something 0/1). Excellent.
---
There's plans for that? 
---
Check Headwear
---
Only reason I can think of is for nuked flora for crafting perhaps. But I could be wrong.
---
I didnt know this either and I'm level 90
---
I had my bf drop the nuke and fast traveled to a station that had the pulowski preservation shelter and had my PA on. I didn’t die immediately and the achievement popped. Hope it helps.
---
Square
---
No, it should be weapon level, just as building higher level weapons needs higher amounts of materials. If it was scales by player levels, people would probably stop playing or be posting a massive amount of shit-posts.
---
My friend always just spams x
---
Display Case plans unlocks the black curio cabonet thats commonly in the whitesprings. I bought it before I had that item unlocked, and that was what was available after.
---
Honestly one of the worst and laziest additions to the Atomic Shop. Not only are the images not accurate to what you get, but there was little to almost effort made into it. 
---
It's literally the same thing as the regular door but with the Red Rocket logo slapped on to it. Its also 700 Atoms.. Cmon Bethesda.
---
This needs to be pinned. It is too valuable a resource to slip into obscurity.
---
I think Helmets and other headwears are currently bugged in that they don’t show up as craftable in the armor workbench. 
---
&gt;So you admit you havent even bothered trying to solo her yourself.
---
Oh, I see the problem. You're functionally illiterate.
---
&gt;Maybe I embellished a bit but still I stand by my comment for how quick she fell.
---
Sure.
---
There's a rumor about a 1% alien spawn chance at the crashed space station with the same hp as the queen and a unique weapon. I don't know if there's something similar for there
---
Haha my LED is like 12+ yrs old I have Civ Revolition burned into the screen 
---
I feel your pain luckily it's only ocassionally noticeable (bright whites just barely) give it some time you won't even notice its there
---
PS you kinda suck because I'm totally gonna start noticing it again I haven't paid any attention to it in years
---
Do you have 5 items at 10k or more?
---
10k loose screws?  4 other items or junk?
---
Square and square again I think
---
Also, Domestic tables are the mod/60s style coffee and end table set. Similar to the tv stand, but a different catagory.
---
Now I wish there were a Faschnacht Mask of the Father.
---
Giant Dad is too big for just one series.
---
Check the first two pictures and the third. You can see the metal side panels in the third picture on each side of the door. In the first two pictures those metal panels are not to be seen. It's clearly not the item some payed for.
---
Specifically, in the first picture I posted, where the rolling door is placed inside a house, you can't get that result in game. In the second picture, it's previewed as if the door is just surrounded by a red frame, while in game there are extra metal panels on each side.
---
I think the point the other guy was trying to make is that it's easier to remove one item that is not allowed at all.. As opposed to deleting duped items. They have no way of knowing, to my knowledge, what is duped and what is not
---
I don't run that build.  Good to know.
---
So the actual item is identical?
---
The garage door, the actual part that is garage door is identical in picture and in game? 
---
I wouldnt count on it. Im definitely never gonna buy bethesda's games in the future. Absolutely disgusting way of releasing games with 69,99 price tag. 
---
What a stupid post this is. There's different people with different viewpoints on the subject.
---
That's often a graphical glitch, it apparently happens more to folks on consoles.  If you go to the location most of the time it's not actually nuked but if you go to Whitesprings or SBQ Prime Fissure you will probably find one of those irradiated.
---
Only other reason it could be happening is that people are looking for more to do with nukes and they are trying different spots just because, but normally it's the above for that particular location.
---
The rolling door can be placed inside an house. My friend has it and he currently has it on his. 
---
You kids really need to stop with this shit. Not everyone you disagree with is a duper, and you only make yourself look pathetic when you act like they are.
---
Umm... what’s a duper??
---
Power armor has fixed Carry weight, and this can only be upgraded by modding the armor with calibrated shocks or using Excavator which apparently has innately higher base carry weight?
---
You are a godsend!! Doing Bethesda’s job because they refuse too.
---
ok thx
---
To blow up my base. Fucking assholes.
---
Might be for the same reason we sometimes nuke the Pumpkin House....  The yummy flux, fields upon fields of yummy flux...
---
😑
---
Nevermind, figured it out. 🙄
---
It's really curious how you said this to me and not ModAbuseo even though they accused me of being a duper.
---
It's a combination of having a metric crap ton of mobs (usually 30+ inside) on top of people getting close triggers respawns.   Emmet Disposal is used for farming mutations a lot and people there can trigger respawn, similar with National Radio and National Isolated as they are often farmed for springs/screws/etc.  It's a good spot, one of my go to spots when doing circuit farming.
---
thanks for the hook up. PM sent. 
---
I really don't understand this logic. Duping only gives a copy of an item you already have - people duplicating are duplicating to give it to someone else, they *already* have the OP weapon they're duplicating, so making more copies of it is *levelling* the playing field *against* them. And sure, plenty are benefitting in caps - not that there's much use with how easy they are to earn and a cap limit - or real money, but at the same time there's multiple other groups that are literally duplicating the best weapons in the game specifically just to hand them out for free, to undercut the real money sellers that are screwing up the in-game economy.
---
In what world is creating new copies of OP weapons, that you cannot personally benefit from and so are clearly going to be passing them on, fear of a level playing field?
---
Probably for the same reason I keep nuking the Palace of the Winding Path:

I've had less than 5 disconnects since launch. 
---
I've had 3 crashes. 
---
Then again I'm on console and not stealing WiFi from my neighbor who is also streaming on 3 devices while playing NHL19 online.
---
that would just give your next character a technically unfair head start for no reason.
---
Maybe your PC and Internet are trash?
---
Just quit the game through the menu, and relog.
---
They've already starting banning under the criteria "Too many of an item crafted in x amount of time" since most dupers were doing things like making 2000 boards, using tens of thousands of materials which the normal player would never have
---
oh darn thanks for telling me though!
---
Having your own vertibot at Grafton Steel is pretty cool
---
Half the time. 
---
For me anyway. 
---
Interesting, it had always been somewhere I wanted to explore. I pretty much cleared the outside, went through the front door and immediately had 5 mutants in my face so I yeeted myself right back outside. 
---
On xbox you open the container and hit X to take all.

yeah i found them on a corpse near crevasse dam, i have an extra plan for them as well if you want one im on PS4.
---
Aaaaanndddd disconnect. 😤😠🤬😭😭😭
---
I shouldn't have been able to place parts of my CAMP (weird blueprinting physics) so just moving my CAMP will cause my character a brutal death through rage quit, whether or not I have survival peices separate from my building peices.
---
Yes the decal is there and it's clean and shiny. But in game it has some metal panels attached on each side. Making it bigger than it looks in the pictures. In fact, a lot of people thought this would be a smaller Rolling Door than the Garage Door that's already in game, just because those pictures show it to be, or that they would be able to attach the red frame to wooden walls, like the first picture I posted shows it to be possible, only to find out that in game, you can have that red frame attached on wooden walls, since it grew some metal panels around it.
---
Is it clear now?
---
Well the primary thing to keep in mind is that the camp circle is a sphere, so if you place it anywhere elevated enough youll be able to get alot more height. Never tried that specific place but thats gonna be your primary goal if you wanna build higher structures to tie into something taller like that
---
I wound up getting a nice action shot while attempting to photograph a severed Scorched head in a pile of Scorchbeast guano.

Yeah but combat knife and switch blade are freaking amazing.  Add in the sword from the Mistress of Mystery quest having huge armor piercing.  Also try over repairing those weapons using Weapon Artisan 3...  This will blow your mind brother.
---
Look how sad you are, asshole.
---
So insecure about your own sense of self you can't handle someone actually challenging your own preconceptions.
---
Go pretend to be an arbiter or righteousness to someone who doesn't laugh at fools who think insulting the other side actually substitutes for debating their argument.
---
Which for the record, you never did. And likely never will because you can't.
---
And you can't because there's no getting around how a little logic and reading would've have blown apart your original assertion.

This is news to me

It's dangerous to go alone.
---
It's dangerous to go in groups.

It's just dangerous.

Deserved gold. If I could; I would add to them. 
---
Thank you very much.

Wish they did this for power armor as well, but you need the helmet for you lose a good amount of protection. 
---
Great idea thumbs up 👍👍👍
---
He had thousands of pounds of junk. The wood alone was 510 lbs.
---
I am a filthy casual so yeah... Don't get it either.
---
Been saying this since the patch dropped on console. Have an upvote, with my hopes that your post gets more attention than mine did.
---
They shouldnt ban or wipe dupers. They should ban the ppl who are in charge of letting dupers do their thing for 2 months
---
Someone damned last month that wallpaper patterns were coming into the Atom store.  I'm saving and waiting.  :-)
---
My poor blackberries can get the protection they deserve.
---
Is your friends door like the one on the first picture? I mean without those metal panels on each side? If so Id like to see it.
---
How much damage do you do per hit? just out of curiousity.
---
Meanwhile all the opossums book it.
---
Same here. 2 disconnects within 20 minutes of patching last night. 3 disconnects today so far and I've only been playing for an hour.
---
I have to ask as well. I found a 3 star TSE cryolator in a lunch bag that someone left. Since it is explosive would this mess up keeping the queen grounded?
---
Can't tell the difference but idk
---
Yikes
---
It's got some pretty freaking sweat information and story to be found that fills in some of the blanks and is completely worth clearing.  It's one of my favorite places to farm solo.
---
I don't think I've ever felt as grateful for a post on Reddit as I do for this one. As far as I have found, this is the only reference like this available anywhere. If there is another, I certainly haven't found it. Maybe now I can stop wasting caps on duplicate plans. Maybe!
---
Shotguns aren't that accurate anyhow, and the TS mod reduces it to ridiculous levels. I think a TSE pump shotgun fully modded has like 14 accuracy with the Perception perk for shottys maxed out.
---
It’s bugged. For now you will only see them from the Watoga Train Station or Harper’s ferry vendor if you are level 15, 16, 17, 18, or 19. 
---
My alt is level 16 with 2 level ups available. And I see them every 4th or 5th Server hop. 
---
How am I supposed to know what is or isn't in the game yet?
---
When I'm on a server lagging out my friends and I immediately look for duper activity.  Only found it once, but man was it good.
---
Do it. 
---
This is hilarious to me for some reason
---
Hi man,
---
Do you have a handmade TSEor any other TSE in that line.
---
If so would it be under the 1k? If yes i would like.to reseeve one and buy it tommorow : Sunday.
---
Whats your psn.
---
Thanks!!
---
20 seconds?  Child's play
---
People dupe because a few tell them how. That's all I'm saying.
---
I'm on xbox. It's in the social menu.
---
The against argument would be:
---
1. Plans are easy to farm anyway
---
2. If you're using your camp correctly it does give you a gameplay advantage 
---
I could really care less though
---
Then you haven't heard people are selling in game items for real world money
---
Nice I was actually looking in to those since I e got theoutfit to go with it
---
Your point is meh. 
---
However what I find far more interesting is that I can very well see BGS introducing loot crates. 
---
If they did I'd almost guarantee they would be free drops, free to open crates. 
---
Kind of a randomized over the top quest reward. 
---
And likely entirely cosmetic. 
---
The community would still however rage. 
---
Is that illegal? 
---
You make a good point but the aoe from the explsosive  should compensate for it. Wouldn't you agree?
---
Well, I can't explain better, the first picture is just the rolling door and a red frame. The third picture is the rolling door, the red frame, and extra metal panels on each side. Like, are you even looking at the pictures? It's so visible.
---
Good point! I can't believe that hasn't been said to me 5 times!
---
No.  The devs will address it as soon as they can test all possible permutations.  Don't try and be a internet hero, let them do their job.
---
Thank you! You’re fixing the wiki too, right? :)
---
Yikes what? I seriously don’t understand everyone’s issue
---
Yeah, that event is super hard solo. I got a few shots of the Mothman in full spread-wing buzz-noise mode. I need to upload more of my photos.
---
God**
---
Sell them to vendors or drop them on new players. No need to horde garbage or meh legendaries (in FO4 I was 100% guilty of keeping every legendary that dropped for me)
---
I'm lv. 27 with a melee build and have missed zero times when using VATS with a melee weapon @ 95% accuracy. 
---
I spent 30 minutes just looting steel from various places and it took less than 3 minutes to convert it all to ammo. Ammosmith + Super Duper is great, but still. SBQ requires a LOT of .50
---
I think a combat blade has fast swing speed. Definitely would love to have a 3*** legendary one to go with my combat armor
---
Ah ha! I never knew there was somethings you can only learn by scrapping :)
---
because shit that should be very rare is in the hands of every third asshole and it's annoying.
---
Uh, YOU called them a duper higher up, out of the blue, when nothing in the conversation was even remotely about duping. Then you got salty when they used your own comment against you.  Just know that when people talk about how shitty this sub is, they are talking about people like you.
---
How about a machine that can grow the wild plants once enough samples are gathered. The schematics could be part of a quest. Basically fuel it with fertilizer. It would take up camp budget but the tech is lore friendly. It was part of the Old World Blues dlc in NV.
---
Sorry no handmades currently and I wouldn’t be able to get to that price sadly 
---
Not sure 
---
The only shitty things I know of is people walking around with 20,000,000 carry weight because of duplicating.
---
With my incomplete 1 handed build I am hitting 180+ per swing with a level 50 serrated switch blade and that thing swings fast as hell, plus I don't even have a 40% faster swing speed one yet, just vampire.
---
Too many to name if you have specifics let me know
---
Surely you can't be this stupid? It does impact everyone. Pvp is essentially a joke due to the Tse flood of duped weapons. Most people have a hard time selling weapons that aren't a god roll or tse due to the mass duping. I could continue, but it's all pretty obvious.
---
I am in support of this.
---
I hope innocents dont get banned
---
Especially because they very often have weekly challenges saying "LVL up 5 tines with a beer hat on your head" and at LVL 150 you don't LVL up very often unless you're in nuke zones where you need to be wearing the helmet.
---
The workshop to the west of the dried up lake bed, plus you can look at a resource map and set your camp up on a crystal node
---
I still can't get damage bobbleheads to stack. I've tried it with explosives, big guns, energy weapons, melee. No stacking, but it does refresh. 
---
Yes, this x1000
---
If only
---
They should just be classified as a rifle / shotgun or whatever. Explosive perk shouldn't affect it imo
---
&gt;There are no individual item ID's in the game, it's part of the reason duplication was possible in the first place. It's impossible to tell which weapons were duped vs which ones weren't.
---
Slight correction: there *are* unique IDs, but they are totally unique. When a weapon is duped it receives a new ID, which is necessary to make it a unique entity that can be modded. Because of this totally-unique-ID system they can't use WoW's system of giving a unique ID to each drop, which doesn't change when duplicated.
---
I run an unarmed build, so I prob have 300 or so screws gathering dust.
---
 I dont think so but in many other games if your  caught you get banned
---
I know of the one in the vault when you start, there is one in Grafton Dam, and the only other one I know of is at Dyer Chemical.
---
Under. He's put down several before I could even sight on them, at which point I start cussing. I bring him to do anti air and just watch the turrets because I can touch the scorch beasts most of the time.
---
Im on console and blue screen and disconnect enough. Good choice of games
---
That's from the berry mentats. Never worked but fixed in latest patch
---
[PS4] ocassionaly when my main weapon breaks and I press left d-pad to switch to my last equiped weapon I get a notification "Broken weapons cannot be equiped" despite my secondary weapon being fully repaired. Probably happens on 1 out of every 4 times I play.
---
I've posted about this recently on the fallout76 reddit I didn't realize there was a sub reddit for bugs... my bad
---
I play on a PS4 slim 500gb
---
When the problem happens again I'll try and add a vid if I can figure out how to I'm new to Reddit
---
Jeez, idk what i would use 100 wood on, let alone thousands...
---
Having played enough MMO style games I can promise you removing explosive will just cause a shift.  Someone will crunch the numbers and come up with an equally effective combo.  Then that gets nerfed and a new one rises and so on and so on.  It’s the nature of games for there to be a best stat.
---
Maybe instead of getting on reddit and telling us to mind how we play you should have just told “billy” how to hop servers.
---
Yeah but who cares if that’s how they enjoy the game? 
---
The Better inventory mod does this and more.   Made my playing experience so much better.
---
Which is the point of my post.  What algorithm would be 100% accurate?  Letting some of the low to middle offenders squeak by.
---
No it's not, I agree with that. Just cheating aside, it's strange to compare ones feeling of progress so heavily to others
---
Yeah but if it doesn’t effect you personally then who cares how they enjoy the game?
---
#Only 700 in the Atomic Shop!
---
Fallout 76 is like Donald Trump, media hates him but fans love him.
---
Hey why are you so hostile dude chill out 
---
"doesn't impact you in any way"
---
It's almost as if we're constantly on a server with other people or something.
---
This is an online game. Whether or not  you yourself choose  to play solo doesn't change the fact others actually interacting with people run into these asshats.
---
This selfish ass "Oh I'm cool with it, why is everyone else mad?" type of thinking ridiculous.
---
It is huge hypocrisy. I saw two duped TSE lmgs at a vendor last night. I could have played dumb and bought one but I didn't. I consider buying both to dump in the river. Sadly I couldn't afford to diminish my caps so badly.
---
Even if you see these in the wild in pairs or more don't buy them. If they are in a crate dump them in a river 
---
It does *affect* me personally, which I just explained.
---
You say that until some dude with a TSE shotgun kills all the ghouls in Whitespring before you can even tag them or get killed by one in PVP where you have zero chance of fighting back. 
---
It definitely does affect others. 
---
You have to be next level trashy to pay for duped items in this game. I'm not even mad, people like that deserve to spend money on those duped items, and then get banned. :)
---
What? Is this true?
---
Whitesprings recipe vendor inside the main mansion is where I got it the last few times but it also has a chance to spawn in most of the high level areas that have food recipe spawns.  I have seen it in the wild multiple times by the cabins/ski lodges near top of the world.  Pleasant Valley Ski Resort has like 7+ recipe spawns so hit them all, then whitesprings vendor, then hop.
---
You have literally done God's work.  Thank you so much for this guide!
---
That's my doggo
---
Blade of Bastet from Mistress of Mystery questline is awesome.
---
Dude.. Doesnt matter how fast it is, using a powerfist I am dealing 1.9k damage using 1 piece of Unyiedling at low hp, its doing more than 9x the damage per hit, they really really REALLY need to buff them and fix the mods since legit NONE of the Energy damage appling ones work
---
Why not both?
---
I think the main issue is it commonly crashes the game? I’ve yet to run into anyone actually doing it on the Xbox. Though I’m sure the constant disconnects are due to the exploit.
---
But will that did the issue?  I just want a drywall-on-both-sides wall...
---
Come to think of it, if also like to be able to open my windows... (On any set other then wood)
---
Yeah....
---
Now, allow me to clarify why I had all the questions. I already knew the answers. I already saw the item. I already knew it was a re-skin of the existing item. Not a newly created door with different dimensions.
---
You see, the camp items in the Atomic shop are almost exclusively re-skins of existing items. 
---
In fact they are labelled as variants in the build menu.  
---
It will shift to things that aren't as powerful though. And without AOE at the same time.
---
It's illegal. It's a practise that impacts other players negatively economically and server-wide. It's even worse than DDOS. It's the ultimate hobby for a jobless degenerate, who wasn't taught what's right and wrong.
---
This is my melee setup:
---
Targeting HUD (Helm)
---
Tesla Coil(Torso)
---
Optimized Bracers(Arms)
---
Optimized Servos (legs)
---
There isn't anything to lessen the costs BUT if you use Weapon Artisan 3 you can repair them to 200% durability basically doubling their usage for the same cost (or cutting a 100% repair in half).
---
Hope that helps!
---
So it's easier. You have explained very well, and I think I understand why the process involved is different. Are you still asserting that they CAN'T restore items to players lost due to glitches, or that they COULDN'T clear duped items from players with clearly inflated inventories? Because that is what bethesda has said. Or is your point simply that it would be more difficult?
---
The Blade of Bastet begs to differ...
---
Just stop.  Dupers dupe items.  Transfer these items to others.  Everyone knows this.  Acting dumb doesn’t justify duping in a multiplayer game.  
---
Wasn't sure if Dorothy was gonna make it back to Kansas after that one,I thought about that attempt very early,didn't work out well for me lol
---
Damn I’m looking for a 3* combat knife with 40% faster swing speed. And 40% more power damage
---
What do you think would be the best roll for the last effect?
---
Depends on case capacity and other things, like targets range and the bullets wind resistance, etc.  Frex, almost any rifle round has more energy, and thus damage, than the Deagle 5-point-0 pistol round.
---
That's more than my two short combat rifle.
---
1H melee definitely isn't weak. Lol. Pistols are weak. Energy weapons in general are weak (mostly due to bugs, durability and not benefitting from certain perks). Melee isn't weak. XD
---
None i suppose 
---
I personally reported the artillery dupe in beta. They never said crap to me and it was never addressed until someone put it on YouTube. It’s sad really.
---
Because that affects the stability of everyone else's game. There are limits to how many items can be tracked, hence the stash limits. If people are walking around with way, way more than they're supposed to be then the game struggles to process it all
---
Because this game has pvp, stimpaks/pyschobuffs/bobbleheads/legendaries and on and on kinda ruins the fun for anyone wanting to play that aspect of the game. Cheaters don't have to worry about resupply when it comes to consumables and aren't impacted by repair.
---
Another group of players in a different aspect of the game will lose ambition in playing, why play and find cool new stuff or work for stuff when it's become so common to cheat and flooded the market so badly everyone has anything already worth while and consuming to get, it's an ambition killed.
---
Why not just have a couple of vending machines right outside the vault, one for each category that hold unlimited quantities of stuff and doesn't cost anything, so everyone can have an unlimited amount of everything .. what would be the point of playing.
---
Honestly this game has had some really malicious people playing from the beginning. Once every major trade hub banned any posts remotely indicating duped items, your every day kid couldn't find all of this free awesome stuff the entirety of this games social media bubble has buzzed about.
---
Abusable glitches and bugs had comments revealing what was going on downvoted to hell and comments saying to shut up. Shit is kept hush hush in the actually person to person active community areas. While initial duping and crap actually front paged the first time right here in an attempt to force Bethesda to "fix it" now that it was public, you never saw it after that.
---
First month I'd see a lot of free stuff posts. Not throwing out that they're obviously duping, but the shit they're giving is great. Posts I saw for Christmas Giveaways had post after post asking to get in. People were randomly given amazing things and would post about it here. If you wanted a certain weapon type, it seemed like someone had an extra and was willing to help out. 
---
Not my cup of tea as I got lucky drops and felt fine, but duping was here to stay so I'm not going to judge players seeking these things out when the sharing was so pervasive early on.
---
With the "duping" inventory blackout from places that actually show up with searches on google as they're all hidden away on the discords the dupers moved to, you have a continued blight on item availability screwing up intended time sinks, but instead of it being the public giving and getting, you have a select few people who took the whole duping idea to the nth fucking degree in control of all of it.
---
Now we have an isolated and arguably hidden market with infinite supply, where people gouge insane real world money prices onto items with 0 supply constraints. 
---
It's fucked. Even with duping stopped, people have real world value items in the 100s of thousands that will maintain viability likely for the better part of a year, and that's if we ever have a difficulty/SPECIAL level increase.
---
Basically means there's a guaranteed exploitative market for at LEAST 6 months abusing and gathering shit they did in a couple of hours of breaking servers.
---
Worst part is you can't really full blame Bethesda. Sure the duping has been around for ages, longer than it ever should have. Very valid complaint. Seems like it was an issue kinda hard baked into how servers work. I imagine its a bitch. No excuse.
---
It's the unintentional self policing we did of accessible resources. Shit for this game is SO spread out. Regulate the wild west of accesible internet, deal with those who will exploit that.
---
Fucked.
---
Having high luck only affects the maximum condition your loot comes in, it does not affect drop rate.
---
I nuke it quite often for just the violet flux.
---
Is there anything worse than those little bitches that use the word "entitled" and call others crybabies. You superior hardcore gamers love using these words you learned on Reddit though.
---
Redditor commented about it a month ago. Not confirmed 
---
So you're saying that its fine for them to be this weak cause one weapon is okay? I'm not picking an entire class to use one okay weapon
---
Except your Fist has to deal with ever-increasing armor and resistances, like the Queen has.  The BoB IGNORES 100% of all of the above.
---
Getting into the room required using an aimbot trainer, so anyone who got in there was explicitly cheating anyway and not just finding a weird glitch, and actually could be tracked by noticing corruption in their save file server-side. That's fair. It would definitely not be fair to go attacking every single person who happened to buy something acquired from there - how is someone to know that this one outfit, or plan, is unreleased and not simply rare, given I know there's several things that are legit which I haven't seen?
---
Probably reduced damage blocking to reduce telegraphed damage incoming, at least thats what I would want.
---
Yeah Queen Glitched off the map I’m going to bed...later 
---
You can't get swing speed and power damage on the same weapon 
---
I am going to make it my goal to nuke weird locations just to see what I can find and break up the monotony. 
---
Based on what I've seen from vudeos and screenshots, the sheer VOLUME of items is clear evidence of dupery. Bethesda hasn't said anything about the difficulty of *identifying* duper accounts, but they have repeatedly said they couldn't do anything about the items themselves. Even the current track and ban procedure doesn't remove the duped items. 
---
No it doesnt cause the mod you can use on it *That actually works* Called Puncturing, ignores armor AND increases damage
---
&gt;Uh, YOU called them a duper higher up, out of the blue, when nothing in the conversation was even remotely about duping. Then you got salty when they used your own comment against you. Just know that when people talk about how shitty this sub is, they are talking about people like you.
---
I'm going to assume you're saying things in good faith and explain a few things.
---
This entire thread is based on duped bobbleheads. When people say things that don't jive with reality I think to myself, "Hey, maybe they've said other entertaining things". So what I'll typically do is go through their past comments and get a read on the person.
---
Sometimes people misspeak. Sometimes they exaggerate. Things happen. I've made mistakes.
---
So I went through their comments. [Sarcastic comment defending dupers](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/af8t6b/major_problems_with_disconnects_since_january_10/edxk498/), hrm. [They dupe their stash](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aeokfy/im_really_surprised_that_nobody_has_really_said/edrlmc4/?context=3), hrm. Admittedly I stopped about there because then they said, further down in the other comment chain: ["Maybe I embellished a bit but still I stand by my comment for how quick she fell."](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/af6kei/people_one_shotting_you_in_pacifist_is_because_of/edxz9i5/)
---
Funny thing is that TSE isn't even the most powerful build or the one currently in need of a nerf.
---
Yea that’s what I was thinking
---
People are killing the queen quickly due to BOBBLEHEADS. Not explosive weapons.
---
I am actually and i have most base building bps and i gave out my springs and screws before i left and they haven't added new content but trying to fix their game. Jesus you're such a loser assuming shit i like the game dumb fuck just want more to do.
---
So you picked an entire class to use blade of bastet?
---
Oh I wasn’t aware of that. That sucks
---
It most certainly does not get you what you want? Were you spoilt as a child? That's the exact mindset of a toddler who doesnt get what they want.
---
"Maybe if I kick and scream and cry I can get one more cookie..." 
---
Its pathetic and unreasonable. Really it must be more a nuisance to BGS to come across that type of post/behaviour.
---
There are other ways of bringing things to light that dont involve carrying on like a child and usually it's more effective.
---
Rejoice! The power of the Atom provides! 
---
Nice to know the expensive plan I saw today was the neons letters one I’ve been wanting. I had a feeling, but I was a few thousand caps short. At least I’ll know next time.
---
I love the vat room. I was so tempted to jump in until I read that it's inert (and just toxic). 
---
You cannot DENNIS from here.
---
Pretty sure you found the "Marine Tactical Helmet"-plan and not the "Marine Combat Helmet". 
---
Its a glitch.  The nuke will actually be on Whitesprings 
---
Thanks. Ill stop by each of them
---
On a practical level it's impossible.  There's no way to tell who's lying and who isn't when it comes to existing items ingame.  There's no way of tracking.  So the Customer Service reps are not given the ability to alter inventory.  Removal of QA items, I'd theorize is done at the server level by scripted analytics.
---
I have had 3x that on Xbone and I’ve only lvl 26 with 100/100 Mb hard wired internet. Surprisingly changing to WiFi reduces the amount I disconnect but the I still crash to desktop or the game locks up every 4 hours or so.
---
I see what you're saying and am not attacking, nor condoning the attacking of anyone. My point is that items aquired by these means should be deleted regardless of how it was obtained. If people paid real money (for some reason) then it's what they deserve for breaking the ToS. If someone used caps on the market it sucks for them, but caps are easy to come by. 
---
You do realise that fists are not considered 1 handed melee right? gauntlets are op, 1 handed melee, are swords, knives etc etc
---
To anyone else still having the issue, I repaired/scanned my game and haven't crashed since. You can find scan/repair in the "game options"  menu above the play button. It's worth a shot if it works for me, hope this helps.
---
I did not know you could make the handmade semi. So the rifleman perks will work with it? Which receiver is ir?
---
I don't get how I have a gun that gives me "+100%" hit chance when out of combat and I still miss an enemy with a 95%. Makes no sense at all.
---
This explains it then lol. I was pretty sure I used those before but never noticed anything so really had me confused when it happened yday. I was guessing it might've been this patch that they enabled it when someone said berry mentats, but anyway.. started carrying those around now as it's really usefull for finding that one mob you might be missing. 
---
Do more research before commenting, thanks
---
Please tell me about your current rifleman build you macho end-game gamer. Oh don't forget to mention your mutations and how you found that cool perk combination to compliment the legendary modifications your guns have.
---
How can you be sure he was duping?  I'm not even level 30 and I have never not collected mats or have I used them all.  Most of the mats are out of balance at this level especially if you are trying to hold a workshop.
---
That's a fair point.  The BoB is an exceptional quest granted Legendary item.  So yes... It'd be nice for other 1-handers to be more effectively balanced.
---
They obviously don't know the core issue at hand so maybe another fire under their butt and another way of showing them how it's done might help. You know if you post it everyone who is in position to is gonna rehash it all over the place and flood the market again .. which at this point, does it really even matter, better now than later down the road.
---
You know once it's hit and it's all the rage their gonna be sure to get it patched so it probably will help to post.
---
Finally managed to find The Unstoppables 4 at black bear lodge of all places. That was quite the hassle.
---
The thing is what I seen in the buy/sell/trade isn't bobbleheads, it's TSE weapons. Now you could say that they are stacking with TSE weapons, buy if you were to remove them it would remove a good chunk of the OP builds.
---
I get what you are saying, my main is a low hp high rad unarmed build.  Energy damage across the board is pretty crap right now so I wasn't disagreeing with your specific examples just saying that they aren't all broken and unusable.  
---
As far as how fast it is, is part of why it works so well.  With a full set of unyielding, adrenal gland, a bloodied 40% swing speed knife, lining for increased STR, plus melee % food, x3 alcohol (whiskey for 6% str) and I am betting you can get a knife close enough in damage that with it's increased swing speed it's going to be comparable to the unarmed build.  The only thing I am not sure about is whether having the extra mutation for unarmed (talons) versus having more perks with raw damage will cause it to break.
---
For all current content, a combat or switch blade is plenty good enough.  Unarmed is pretty much overkill, which is why it's fun for so many of us, but I don't feel gimped when I play my one hander.  I mean hell, I have gotten a chainsaw up to 200+ damage per tick and its hitting for 10-20 ticks per second but that flamer addon is garbage.  
---
Wait.. People miss 95% chance shots? I thought this was going to be about how the 95% clearly is supposed to be 100%. :\
---
I was in Whitesprings for mine.  See the event start, walk out the door, blam if the nukeing player is a good aim.
---
It's a shame that's all it really has to offer, but hopefully they'll change that someday. It's probably the most "nuked-looking" place on the map normally.
---
Nuking for flux is a must also after you've dropped 10+ nukes you need to try new areas
---
Sounds like youre just bitter about how other people are enjoying the game. Well the simple solution would be to release a game without numerous exploits in the first place but hey what do I know *shrugs*
---
Oh, there was a bug that refreshed fusion cores when joining a server? That explains why I have so many even though I use power armor a lot. It gets refreshed after every dc and crash lol
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/af8pmq/i_collected_a_bounty_on_a_duper_and_after/edxwy43/?st=jqua6wg7&amp;sh=dca726f7
---
He doesn't give a shit, he's just a dickbag who cheats and doesn't like being told he's an asshole for doing it.
---
While I have not found TSE myself, I have found one TS weapon, and no less than *four* explosive weapons up to level 140. The randomiser is a possibility, but if that's the case, that would simply mean that TSE is actually quite common for those who are best suited to farm it; and my experience contrary to yours indicates that it is definitely not non-existent.
---
It doesn't ignore armor, it ignores 50% of it so used with incisor rank 2 it's pretty much at soft cap of armor penetration but yes it's good.
---
Fair enough. Perhaps I'm simply pressing the point too far. It bothers me that they would say they can't when they really mean that it's hard and they won't. The amount of CYA responses that we've seen from Bethesda in response to legitimate community complaints and feedback has left me with little patience for nonsense from them. 
---
I want to make it clear that I enjoy the game, amd hope ot becomes what we all wanted it to be. I just get tired of trying to give the devs the benefit of the doubt. 
---
I honestly appreciate the time and energy you spent here helping me to understand the issues a little better. Thanks, and cheers. =)
---
Because dupers don't deserve punishment. Neither glitchers. Hackers yes. It's too easy exploit that it's all bethesda's own fault. I dunno how they can even reason punishing their customers. The games stability is already the worst punishment.
---
So does the unyielding armor stack?
---
Indeed it does
---
The Tool Chest is the taller version of the toolbox next to it in your pictures. I worked it out because of the names of the workshop objects and found the plan called that. Which unlocked it.
---
The domestic kitchen tables is, I think, the only set of tables I'm missing. Seems to unlock the ones actually called Kitchen Table in the tables menu.
---
Simple modern bed! Bloody knew it. Grahm sells it but I didn't buy it because I wasn't sure. I will next time. The good news is that I only need about 4 plans before I've unlocked everything. Yessssssss.
---
Btw thank you. This is fantastic.
---
I think it’s just bugged. Got it on my second try tho. both times I didn’t have power armor on and died immediately. But you don’t have to be dead center and let it you hit you right in the face. That’s a myth. Just keep trying it’ll pop
---
Well that's fucking swell. That needs fixed.
---
Platform?
---
money first
---
It depends on which measurement they are going by, 95% in statistics or 95% in XCOM
---
Alright then, why isn't this a variant of the current door? And is instead listed a separate item? Doesn't really matter tho. There are things in atom shop that are limited and aren't reskins. Like the big Red Rocket limited item. So your argument about "exclusively re-skins of existing items" isn't valid, can you agree with that?
---
BAH, stick with pipe weapons cause not only are they dope and you'll look like a pimp (the females flock to my pipe) but licensed plumber 3 under intel reduces repair/creation costs by a bit and reduces durability by 90%.
---
Tried shotguns? I'm pretty sure the problem is with anything that has multiple bullets. It will "hit" in that the centre of its aim is pointed at the enemy, but it still allows multiple bullets to go in random directions, so you can "hit" then thread the needle with every shot going *around* them.
---
I have watched allot of videos on the different duping methods used (that were previously patched) only one person gets disconnected in the process, not everyone on the server.  So I am not sure why people keep going on about dupers wanting to disconnect everyone and them crashing servers.  And that all this instability is due to duping.  I think they have just said it so many times they believe it.  Supposedly the last duping method on the PC was fixed this past week, and the PC users are still complaining about the same disconnects, so I am guessing none of this instability is due to duping.  Just a buggy game/back end.  
---
well he said gt so i assume xbox
---
Haha and this is how we continue the problem. 
---
Congrats! 
---
Yea makes sense 
---
I usually walk down route 63 and try to find a bunch of super mutants, for some reason he loves to fight them, he spawns often when I get into a hectic fight with other Super Mutants in that area.
---
Why not?  You picked an entire class for power fist from the sounds of it right?  How he chooses to play is fine, just like yours is.  You think they are weak, cool I agree with some of what you are saying but disagree with other things, doesn't make anyone 100% right or wrong.
---
Anyone with stacked legendary weapons. Weapons don't stack unless they are exactly the same, and the chances of finding 2 of the exact same legendary are so small it shouldn't happen in normal gameplay.
---
"They were playing football and were angry the other team was using motorcycles on the field. They must just be bitter about how other people are enjoying the game."
---
Lol this guy.
---
I mean the demolitions expert perk card. If it's just classed as a rifle and the demolitions expert doesn't affect it, their damage will be halved 
---
He was carrying thousands of pounds of junk, most of which (like the 510 lbs of wood scraps) was so commn that it wouldn't be worth being massively overencumbered to keep. When you're that overweight your character barely crawls along. 
---
Puncturing provides a +12% penetration against armor.  You're on crack if you seriously equate that with a 100% ignoring of all armor and resistances.  
---
Do a search for random encounter locations. Those are the only places you can tame animals or creatures. Off the top of my head, near the sunflower on the far northeast side of the map is one, but there are many more scattered all over. 
---
Look, you don't need to attack people for contributing to the conversation mate.  He was accurate with the information he provided, doesn't need a lot of research ;-p
---
Good response to have for those who also may be unsure. I do use it myself, my concern originated in my use of a Gatling Plasma haha With Weapon Artisan 3, at 200% with Gunsmith 5, I get at least 4 cores before it breaks (never use it consistently, might be 1 or 2 more, maybe). And its a decent chunk of mats to fix, especially if theres others that need repair.
---
We have perks to reduce cost to repair and make both armor and Power Armor, and also at 200% durability. Im thinking they should add a perk that reduces repair/craft costs on weapons. 
---
He would have dropped a lvl 30 nocturnal wooden leg...you saves yourself the hassle of dropping it.  &lt;3

Stop being such a dick for no reason. I'm very sorry for whatever life did to you to make you this way.
---
Just to humor you, [here's what it looks like](https://i.imgur.com/1Xh7iDH.jpg) with opacity turned down, and not even that much - about halfway in fact. It looks like crap, you can't read stuff like the *item names*, and it's not a substitute for changing the HUD colors.
---
You'll also find that I'm not even the one who said there are no opacity options in the game, so I there goes your goal post comment.
---
Oh I got this one. You're the brother that doesn't matter. You were born to make his life better.
---
It's rough, but it's purpose. Keep with it! #brotherhood
---
No?  of course not, Powerfist was an example, Deathclaw gauntlet is even better, boxing golves are also good, etc etc, 1 weapon being **okay** at best doesnt justify how vad other ones are
---
New information, I got under the world, the second i started falling I was teleported out, so its more than likely above the world or only accessible by hacks in whatever space its in.
---
No worries brother, I understand what you mean and agree weapons could use a few more support perks especially since energy weapons get wrecked hard right now from such little usage.
---
What gun is that? I don't think +100% hit chance should make sense in any case. Surely they would just say "guaranteed hit"?
---
I’m aware of it being a sphere, and I’ve placed it in the elevated spot, but somehow when I did it it couldn’t reach the junk collector, it’s just a little frustrating cause now I can’t seem to find anybody that’s done it anymore 
---
That's more than fair and a very mature and adult response to this discussion.  Thank you for engaging in a mostly polite and educational discussion with me.  :-)
---
It is, actually. Have you read the ToS?
---
Beautiful. It's like you dropped hot cheetos into a blender with gogurt and slathered it onto your PA 
---
You didn't lose several hours of hard work. Simply repair and you are good to go
---
Yeah, I gotta try that, thanks.
---
The Gorrrmonnndsss
---
Do you even know what incisor is?
---
Ahhh, i actually did not realize that LP reduced repair/creation cost. Thanks 👍
---
"Mostly" polite... lol I deserved that, but I'm not proud. =/
---
LOL You have no idea what you are talking about.
---
It takes minutes to multiply your inventory.
---
It takes half an hour to make a mule to hold additional amounts.
---
It takes him / her no time to replace that.
---
It literally took you more time to write this and post it on Reddit than it does for him to get all of that back. WOW! LOL
---
Ok that makes sense, never thought of it that way
---
I have given you several examples of other weapons that are more than usable in the game currently for 1 handed builds but I guess my mistake was taking your angry complaints as a serious attempt to have a discussion.  My bad mate, you do you, I am gonna go play with reasonable monsters like death claws and scorch beasts.  Have a great evening!
---
Time to begin the purge!
---
Dupers deserve punishment as their actions degraded the player experience.  They acted in bad faith knowing that it caused issues.  
---
Attack people? he joined a conversation thinking a fist is a fucking melee 1 handed, accurate? are you high?
---
What crabz said. I treat a party a while back with soneone stating the games code is missing the headwear value, so things like this and the witch hat arent usable right now
---
also I'd go with the qounset huts you see everywhere and those vault tech pods 
---
It was known via testing from dupers that some of their techniques did tend to cause people to disconnect around them. The most popular method, however, that got fixed in this week's patch, did not, which was rather important as all the methods involve the duper disconnecting and reconnecting, which means they need a friend to stay in that world to be able to re-enter it - rather difficult if the friend gets disconnected.
---
What system 
---
Have they removed the damage drop off for people who don’t fight back yet? 
---
PvP is pointless still if they haven’t. You shouldn’t be any more “safe” just because you don’t engage. 
---
It’s a simple concept really. And if you don’t want to PvP, don’t play an online game. 
---
I don't dupe, but I'm currently carrying around 4500.  I've learned that I can't even login if it's more than that, the load screen just locks as the game crashes.  I'm constantly dumping stuff, but constantly scavenging for the mats I need to keep moving forward.
---
But yeah, I carry a lot.  I've been encumbered since the first day of beta.  I can hardly ever find a vendor that isn't already at 0 caps, and most of my mates quit the game because of the lag, the inadequate storage space, getting nuked as they enter the game and then doing a corpse run only to find all the stuff they've been farming for the last few hours gone.
---
I'm soloing all the time now, but without a decent amount of storage, I'm always encumbered.  
---
Here's why I do it: I like to help people.  I find people as I wander around, and I give them food, healing goods, armour, weapons, all that.  Then I kill more glowing blubbery ghouls while I sing "You're the One for Me, Fatty."
---
So you simultaneously guarantee that some of the devs wanted to move on to the next project, AND hold back release and not move on to the next project. Good logic.
---
Game developement is their job.
---
The only rightful way is if they tracked it or have some code magic that allows them to identify items and from who those items were duped ….
---
At this time so many things were duped and sold to legit players ANNDD this game is loaded with hoarders, just cause some player is holding 80k worth of stuff doesn't mean anything other than they hoard shit, there are multiple levels of overweight and if some people actually play that way cause they want to hoard all this crap then let them if the devs were so worried about performance so badly you would think they would make some hard cap on what you could carry or make you unable to move or randomly drop stuff from other categories besides junk to further lower weight etc.
---
Strange, I wonder if that’s the case for me
---
"Sir we left this loophole in the tax forms and now people are abusing it and and avoiding paying millions in taxes!"

Thank you for doing this.

I'm low level no water purifier and I swear I had 1 purified water I didnt find any out looking around I server hoped alot that day well when I got done I went to making stuff and I had 28 purified water in my stash. I know for sure I only had 1 to start with because I never have bulk of that due to diluted stimpaks
---
Saved. 
---
I'm a lazy sack of shit. I've seen posts with reccomended routes over and over now and never pay them any attention, but always wish I'd read when I'm standing at my CAMP wondering where to even start killin shit for the day.
---
Still didn't read it. No time man, life's short. Looks like some work and a lot of thought. Bet you're a smart cookie. I'll come back to your wisdom sometime soonish.
---
I think the more you turn in at a time, the better it's "meant" to be
---
Items which had to be obtained in the first place. Ergo they had an advantage, and by creating more of it, they are lessening that advantage. Your claim is they fear a level playing field. How are these supposed to coexist?
---
You know yohr lactose intolerant!
---
Yeah but the stash only holds 600.  It's quite annoying for pack rats like me.
---
Holy shit are you dense. I give up trying to explain. Have fun with your expertise and experience.
---
Give me the Bozar from GRA
---
That's not what I read... reading comprehension is hard.  I understand.  Have a great night!

RNG
---
Fyi, if you grab two technical documenta before you hand in, it'll give you 40 caps instead of 25
---
wold full for like 10 min now :(
---
Do you see a discussion flair? It says bug, all you provided was useless baseless info, you got a chainsaw to tick 200? you had to spend your life on reddit buying unyielding pieces and hunting for legendary buzz on markets while also going with weapon artisian to give it fake tempo damage, so please, if you dont know what you're talking about, keep it shut, have a WONDERFUL evening
---
You get a bounty for taking a workshop? I took one last night and nothing came of it, just here's your workshop. 
---
Obtained by someone else.  And duplicated.  Free value.  Something from nothing.  Stop trying to use 13 year old logic to legitimizing cheat items.  Blocking you.  Go post on hacker forums if you want an echoing chamber.
---
Thank you, thank you!
---
It's unfortunate that you couldn't locate the metal Vault Tec table (it's the metal picnic table, it's usually seen in vault cafeterias) as it's the last thing I'm looking for, but you've done tons of elimination which is a huge help in of itself!
---
Thanks again for having the patience.
---
Here is the list of all things you can do in this room: leave list complete
---
Have a good night too :)
---
I enjoy it. Definitely worth it if you like fallout. Yeah you kind of have to make your own fun, and dont expect an amazing experience playing solo but I personally had a blast oing story quests with similarly leveled players. So if you got someone to play with, or even just random people. it can be quite fun. Plus it will probably get better over time. BOS quests are actually good and were enjoyable, while they lasted. There is also building camps, which I had fun doing once I found a place to settle (Cranberry Bog right behind Brotherhood of steel headqaurters)
---
Got no idea how it works myself, i've stopped duping for good.
---
The people who Grief specifically for the reason of “having fun” or just being a misandrist because their a higher level are the main problem.
---
There’s not really much point to destroying a camp unless you’re being an asshole or trying to coax someone into PvP because you’re hiding behind your team, or you have an overpowered weapon/build.
---
Thank you :&gt;
---
Go to your camp
---
The little box you place down whenever you move
---
Has an option to repair all
---
And you lack conviction.
---
It would be a real shame if you got flagged by bethesda when they logged you picking up all that stuff and changing servers.
---
Heh no worries mate, just ask and someone can get you the info you need.
---
Right back at you. Make sure you click that downvote button.
---
Only unsellable to vendors. Every spare plan I have is available at a most reasonable price, but no freebies. I can see there being some exceptions like the handmade rifle plans, as those are bugged for certain levels right now - so most people would just try to rip you off. 
---
Hey mark spoiler fr
---
Lvl160, farm white spring repeatedly I found a two shot cryolator and that's all. Not a single explosive weapon yet
---
Dunno why you got downvoted. My hardened sniper does 86 and my .50 does 85.  Honestly.308 is worthless. LMG and .308 sniper &gt; .50 HMG and .50 Sniper
---
I'm starting to think the game wants me to change to a melee build, with all the melee weapons the game gives me.
---
Yeah it got me confused to. I was at watago station and a team challenged my team to have a fight with them. When the fighting started one of them used berry mentats which we had never seen before. Even when using our chameleon abilities the purple smoke would still be active. The largest part of the fight took place at range though and with the berry mentats only working on enemies at close range it became irrelevant.
---
Starstutter says: I should be the one to rule the Derderpercons!
---
Didnt you know? If all exploits (even those unkown) aren't fixed immediately it's bethesda's fault. All hail anthem and atlas /s
---
Where did you get that’s 40% number from?  
---
They just copying xcom lol
---
It does not. The snappy receiver I put on did exactly as much as the stock caliber hardened
---
I bought the metal picnic table plan from Grahm, it unlocked exactly what it was supposed to.
---
So yes, that first person obtained it, and duplicated it ... which means they no longer hold a godly advantage over everyone who doesn't have a TSE weapon. By duplicating it they are levelling the playing field over the original. 13 year old logic is saying "I don't like these people so I'm going to call them scaredy weenies" when it makes absolutely no sense to duplicate the item if that's what they actually are. Keep it to yourself and have the advantage.
---
Blocking instead of actually addressing your 13 year old logic is also pretty 13 year old, too.
---
Why spend three valuable perk card slots when a weapon can do it for you?  My original point stands, you keep moving the goalposts backwards everytime I point out a flawbin your assertion.
---
Yeah rifles are crazy heavy
---
I hit 95% of the time i wait a half second and am not pulling the trigger the second i hit vats.
---
Except fucking mole rats. Fuck them.
---
how do you grab 2? it only ever lets me hold one
---
I did quite a large write up on it here brother.  Hope this helps!

I got it to play during my X-Mas break from work.  I had seen it had dropped down to $35 around black friday and I thought it would stay that price because of all of the, err, fallout.
---
It was $60 when I went to buy it, I was disappointed but I still picked it up.  So far I haven't run into any bugs that I'm aware of and it's only crashed on me once and that was today.
---
I was surprised because from what I'd been reading it was FUBAR but I'm finding out that's not the case for me.  It's different, I'm used to playing Fallout 4 with 200 modes, not worrying about anything killing me, or running out of caps or ammo, free crafting tables, supplies, etc.
---
So it's been a learning experience for me.  I mostly kill stuff with my axe to save ammo, I died once from hunger, I creep around everywhere I go, and run from most things.  I've only gotten to level 5, started over once and haven't been able to play more than an hour or so a day, but I'm liking it.
---
I do truly feel like I'm in a post-apocalyptic society, barely surviving and scrounging for scraps and I love it.  It's challenging and exciting and has given me a new appreciation for the game the more that I play it.   
---
I received the "Marine Armor Helmet" from someone, I didn't know it was from the dev room until later on, after I had already learned the plan from it by scrapping.  
---
I contacted Bethesda to make sure my account was safe, and they said:
---
&gt;Thank you for reaching out to us on this issue! I have informed my supervisors and they believe this to be already obtainable in game and as you received it from another player you are alright. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask.
---
I'm still kind of worried about my account, it doesn't sound like they are referring to the Marine Armor Helmet, since it's not exactly obtainable legitimately.
---
I almost. ALMOST gave in and bought one. But I was like, 'whats the difference between this and buying a lootbox? 'None. Zero. I hate the lootbox concept in any game.
---
So what did u do? Found some dupers, waited till they left server and a noob stood guard. Killed him, took loot, orbital struck camp, scrapped the dupes. 
---
Yes it does.
---
are you allowed to be within 1000 feet of one? ^^Kappa
---
I don't think Oxhorn is a bad person or deserves to be hated on, but what pissed people off was the fact that he lavished the game in praise while glossing over or completely failing to address its many glaring issues. That does reflect badly on him no matter how you slice it.
---
Oh also, for my chainsaw build this is the current perk loadout using unyielding gear.

Direct message the Bethesda Community Reps that are active here on the subreddit. They're all over the front page. Anything they post in is marked Bethesda Replied.
---
Agitate them. Make a non-public video if you'd like or write it out in excruciating detail. Send it.
---
Give it a day. If the account posts again without a response, maybe tweet the community manager to please check their inbox for a message from \_\_\_\_ as it's very important. 
---
Get them to give you more than a canned response (which they don't do for the most part, they'll ask questions). At that point you'll know it's on the radar of the team.
---
Please don't make it public. If it's a big one, please make a few more efforts to do the due diligence in letting people know and that your message was received.
---
Thanks for coming to a board to ask for insight instead of releasing it to the wolves off the bat. Shows you care about the game. If you're completely ignored, yeah. maybe dump some info in a public way, maybe at first showing just cause and effect and not showing steps.
---
A new dupe isn't a boon to the community anymore. More of it is just overkill. Whatever benefit people got from feeling powerful quick isn't really worth quadrupling down on for the server stability issues at this point.
---
If I believed in a god, this would be their work through you. 
---
All good, game is damn near ruined for me honestly. 
---
Never a fair fight on console anymore.. so duper’s will do duper things and grief others.. 
---
Maybe I will give it again in a few patches. 
---
Good for you to stop duping. 
---
Well, bobbleheads are Aids to be clear. And unfortunately there’s no way for them to punish dupers, and realistically it’s a waste of time to keep getting so bothered by them. The duping won’t stop until there’s a patch to fix it, so bethesda just needs to hurry up.
---
This op sounds like he is one of the dupers 
---
It is not the lightest weapon possible. Since the weight reduction ignores mods (actually kinda bad for most weapons...) you can have a baseball bat with 0 weight, why/how? The Material mod Allstar(Aluminium) *lowers* the weight of the weapon!
---
PS4 and internet is good. But who knows 
---
Somewhat of a not too offical estimate taking dupeing incedents and comparing the ammount bethesda related incedents, so take 40% with a grain of salt.
---
they cant do that yet, Cigs are 18 sometimes 19+ and Vodka is 21+
---
Kappa
---
Actually now that I think about it, yes. 
---
70% chance he pulled it straight out of his ass. 
---
You know who else need to be punished. The fo76 reddit dupers. You know the ones that duplicate posts like the OP's hour after hour day after day. I hate the dupers and the server issues they cause too. But topics like this do nothing to solve the problem.
---
Why don’t you have a seat over there. 
---
"You lack conviction.".... how so? I didn't knowingly pick up duped goods, and when I realized that I had, I got rid of those goods. You just can't stand to be wrong, and keep grasping at straws. Have a nice day.
---
Laser, too.
---
No amount of trying to compare Wushu Sword Practice to cranking a Gatling gun makes any sense _plus_ you could read the actual perk. Sorry, but that's just silly. :P
---
There isn't one on the stash.
---
It's, "[Marine Armor Helmet](https://i.imgur.com/dRRsoBK.png)" 
---
Don't waste your time, just wait for Bethesda to pull their head out of their ass. They said they'll be looking into plans in the next patch (the one due at the end of the month). 
---
&gt;Beyond Monday’s patch, we’re working on another patch that we hope will hit near the end of the month. This patch will continue to add fixes for issues being voiced by the community, **including the number of plans Vendors have available**.
---
When they fix the duping they should revert everyone to lvl 1 in the vault.  
---
 I don't think Oxhorn is a bad person or deserves to be hated on, but  what pissed people off was the fact that he lavished the game in praise  while glossing over or neglecting to address its numerous glaring issues that he's no doubt encountered. That does reflect poorly on him no matter how you slice it.
---
Hey guys check out this badass! He doesn't even have to shoot budguys, they just die in his presence.

80% chance you are right...
---
Yes unless they “fixed it”

Wait how were bobbleheads in a bag? Now im confused i didnt realise that at first

No worries dude, I will be watching this thread and hopefully some other folks fill in the blanks on the others!

We're two months since release, we've only received QoL/Bug patches.

Naturally we'll be running out of things to do, even with Daily/Weekly challenges/quests.

Nothing wrong with taking a hiatus and just waiting for the first dlc
---
Nobody likes TSE on PVP because is nerf and duping is creating a lot of TSE that's why in a future update of Bethesda they are gonna disabled TSE for PVP, That affect everyone and the TSE is suppose to be a unique hard to get prize, not to be banned for PVP and get hated.
---
Thats really hot.
---
Take it with a grain of salt?  You said it. So basically, you’re 40% full of shit?
---
Are you guys sure?  I swear I sand bagged a few and it gave me rewards for one and I lost the others.. I think you can only turn in one at a time
---
Granted he could have dropped them for some reason then got his ass kicked, but who knows the mind of a duper?
---
... why bring up TSE yet again, after OP asks people not to, on a video that kills her with a *nocturnal explosive* rifle? TSE is definitely not causing any issue here.
---
Damn son. Daddy like

Look what diablo 2 did and all the other online games they ban dupers glitches no questions asked

Heh I do remember thinking to myself that having it turn you into a super mutant would be a pretty freaking awesome method of adding some variety to the game.
---
I think they barely look at their report system and it seems like they only act on major problems. The dupe glitch I found probably won’t hurt server stability like the one that just got patched so I’m kind of worried that they’ll take even longer on it and won’t care.
---
look, you seem the smartest out the bunch of trolls up top, so I'll try and have a civil conversation with you, your BoB ignores armor, sure, but. it doesnt have other legendary variation effects to have it challenge other weapons, 2nd you have to waste, not 3 perk slots but 9, to make 1 handed melee even viable, cause you will need all 3 Of its perks, Gladiator that is, while unarmed has one and still out damages by a long shot, you will also need more damage increasing perks (bloody mess) all this AND it does 1/10 the damage of a fist, your measly 28% extra armor pen, can go down the garbage bin, BoB is excellent compared to other 1 handed, but a piece of garbage compared to any other weapon in the game
---
Wait what? I'm desperate for a source lol
---
Godspeed, you fucking psycho. I love it.
---
Did you add me? Just send me a message so I know your psn and Ill keep a lookout for when you are on
---
Bruh it happend to me so many times lolol
---
That’s what I was thinking but I can’t really be sure that they’ll even do it in time for a major update. I’m conflicted on it.
---
The servers connect internationally but they do not do international matchmaking. Ping between western europe and east-coast US is only just playable, they do not want to be mixing people anywhere in the world into the same server.
---
yea i can only hold one at a time personally that guy must be special
---
Yup. Inflicts ballistic and rad damage as far as I’m aware
---
There are more eggs if you go west from the statue to the alter by the river side.  It's only 4-5 seconds west.  Good way to grind out levels on a low level character too.  3-4 levels a week for 20 minutes of work to get you past the first ten levels :-)
---
I don't think it is. Like power armor chassis that you can interact with, those technical data objects are just glitches.

I've never lost technical data from my inventory.

Okay, it may just be me, but I cannot find walls that have room for doors. Or half walls that are cut vertically, only ones cut horizontally. I've ended up making a gate that you have to jump over to come inside. Do I need to find plans to make this?

It's the classic "You made me hit you" type of argument. Doesn't fly there. Doesn't fly with this either.

I can't think of too many people that just outright own the cheating for what it is. There's always some weasel excuse that somehow justifies it.

Why do you need the 2 and 1 combined if you already have a 3? Leaving them as is gives you more flexibility

What i don't want is for example macro-changing from a melee to a heavy-gunner whilst in combat.
---
Who says this?
---
It’s better that way. Since you already have a three star.   You are now free to use only a 2 or 1 star in case you need to use your agility points for something else. 
---
*SOOTHING VOICE*
---
Could’ve already had a 3 fully upgraded, got 2 more to make a 2, and then got another as a 1. You probably can’t connect the 1 and 2 because you already have a 3, so there’f be no point? Maybe?
---
Oh the trauma...
---
Pretty sure she made her preference clear here. Lol
---
For real. I just need a little more Cobalt Flux, but there's no sources of it around Fissure Site Prime and only a few around the Whitesprings - and I was just one plant away from having enough to upgrade my Vault Suit before I got a disconnect last night.
---
This happened before. Usually fixes itself by logging out and back in
---
Does he have more?
---
What was the exploit?
---
You can, that's how I got all the Gattling Plasma mods 😁
---
She's more vulnerable to splash damage; with explosive weapons, get her to land, then shoot the ground under her. She positively melts versus a TSE shotgun aimed there.
---
This is wonderful. Thanks so much for your hard work. 
---
Not duped
---
It’s actually been this way for weeks. Idk. But thanks for the input!
---

---
Latest patch on pc has caused me many issues with crashing that I did not have before.  Not sure why though.
---
Just attempted her and it did not go well. The queens health wasn’t moving, no enemy was searchable, and the frame rate was abysmal. Guess I’ll try some other time. 
---
Wrong thread
---
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
---
I've been working on photoing the stuff, but not nearly as organized. What a great reference.  
---
I didn’t think of that possibility. That’s a solid way to look at it. Thanks!
---
One solution to this would be to make a new recipe, for example 'Disease Cure: Farming' that has an assortment of ingredients from all the different zones but also takes some amount of a rare mat like stable flux or some new mat that's hard to find or has a really long cooldown to harvest or limited ones you could plant, etc. 
---
It kinda sucks, you can only use the paint on a few items.  
---
No thanks
---
He just doesn't want to hit a grind.
---
Try using vats on hoards of radrats and ants
---
Not a bad idea,  but since you can't craft legendaries, it wouldn't get used in end game much
---
That's what Antmans hoping for
---
Im on ps4 and i crash at least once a day but usually more. When at a vendor or looking in my stash.
---
You can only have 1, extras disappear
---
Well shit. Ill have to try again. So if I hit her directly it would do less damage?
---
True. Like the other guy said, it gives me an option on freeing up some agility points if I need to. 
---
True, but there's always potential to add something like that (in a hopefully non broken way) later.
---
Consumables would still have a spotlight at least.
---
What was his name? 
---
Not sure if it helps but with the database someone compiled and Im checking off against these are the only handmade mods...you wont learn anymore after you have these.  
---

---
RRUUHHHHHHHHH RRRUHHH RRRRUUUHHHHH!
---
Heh, probably need to get over that, I dump stuff on the ground or give it away all the time.  It's pixels, just leave it and never feel bad about it.
---
I wish I had a dollar for every duping post I see.
---
"Oops! I just dropped my monster condom that I use for my magnum dong."
---
That's incredibly! I love the style.
---
Was this just done in Photoshop?
---
Thanks for sharing that.  Love spreadsheets of recipes and such!
---
I have an oled tv that I play on. So far 507 hours and no burn in from playing the game. Most of them have a setting for games with static images on the screen and mone has a pixel refresher that runs everytime I turn it off.
---
Not really trying to be a hero more than just I would rather have all the issues worked out now so in the future when I come back to play it’s not full of the same problems
---
All attempted five finger discounts will be reclaimed and paid for, with said fingers.
---
Don't get any ideas... chump.
---
Buy your loot(?) here. Or don't. I don't care.
---
No, it means you could see the other players inventory, to see if they had junk, before they accepted trade. Then you knew to PK them or not to take their junk
---
God level Achieved 
---
thats the way duplicating works, they do (something) to create an autosave then give it to their teammate or drop it on the ground, and then do (something), and revert back to the autosave
---
after the first process they are only duplicating the "new" inventory and the original never leaves their inventory
---
That you could supposedly steal items from players during trade.
---
I find it pathetic that people like you would rather side with the giant faceless company and defend any criticism of them rather than side with your fellow hobbyists and be GLAD that they are essentially robbed of their money because they had the audacity to play a video game the "wrong" way.
---
Bootlicker.
---
Try deleting your fallout76prefs.ini file in the documents/my games/fallout 76 directory, I had that issue a few patches ago and this resolved it.  If that doesn't fix it try scan and repair under the Bethesda launcher.  If that doesn't find anything you can put in a ticket for support with Bethesda for more in depth support with this link.
---
[https://help.bethesda.net/](https://help.bethesda.net/)
---
Then click submit a ticket.
---
Hope this helps mate and that you can get back into the wasteland soon!
---
oh shit.
---
this is fucking hot.
---
thank you, friend.
---
Thanks for looking!  Im still working on it right now but its a great jump off point.  I will add recipes to it at some point as well.  Id like to make it so that you can pull up a list have/have not.
---
Im looking for a complete list of Atomic Shop items with past/limited/present items as well but haven't found one.  
---
I have that house on a character in PC.
---
I did message a dev today, I won’t be posting anything today but I’m hoping someone at least responds soon. If not I’ll probably post it just because I don’t want these problems when more content is released
---
Thanks for this. Now I know not to buy an OLED. No need for 4k anyway unless your sitting litterally a few feet away from the screen. Your eyes can't tell the difference. So I'll be happy with my old LCDs for a long time.
---
Samesies. Though it's usually after playing for a few hours so I think that's the universe telling me to get some work done or go to sleep at a healthy hour. 
---
I had been on a workshop claiming spree because "why not?" I claimed Charleston Landfill a few times today without issue; my problem location seems to be Grafton Steel. There, Super Mutants are often invisible and/or floating several feet off the ground. If visible, they take their unarmored, "base" form. (I'm sure there's a formal name, I just don't know what it is.) 
---
But note how I said "a few times" - because myself and my teammates have endured several server disconnects as well today. I do wish we had someone to be an anchor such as yourself to hold down the claims, but these seem to be serverwide disconnects, as all three of us go down simultaneously. I enjoy Fallout immensely - don't get me wrong - but these crashes are incredibly frustrating in the moment. And they are a massive deterrent from chasing high-value quests and loot, TBH, because I find myself disappointed more often than not when I've spent so much time grinding just to lose progress when the server disconnects at any given moment. 🤷‍♀️
---
I mean, I'm not hoarding all this shit, but if my brother was online more often for me to transfer stuff to alts, I would definitely have an alt with a buttload more junk on it than I do now.  I end up just dropping junk items on the floor every now and then and throwing away 3 star legendary items because they are not TSE and no time to sell them/hold in stash lol
---
Totally agree. 
---
The thing that disappoints me the most is, like with bugs in the game, we shouldn't have to be the ones to fix it. 
---
Maybe it's just me but I get the feeling that we have to shoulder a lot more responsibility than we should since it seems Bethesda is way too in the weeds to be on top of the issue.
---
Things have shown some improvement of late but that's taken, what, 3 months to even get to this stage? Even this is far from adequate.
---
Our responsibility should be just to enjoy the game, not trying to minimise the influence of these cheaters on the game.
---
It spawns in the display cases in Harper's Ferry quite often.
---
Thanks 
---
I’m just tired of seeing people cry about it.
---
Someone who duplicates items by exploiting the game. Cheating. 
---
Where is that exacly?  Is on the place that requieres a 3 lock ?
---
Do remember that it's a big patch this week. Big enough that they rolled it out on PC to iron out issues for console at the end of the week. A lot of in house stuff going on. Maybe give that time window time to settle down so they're looking at bug reports again instead of a time table release of a current bug fix implement. 
---
The rating probably has more to do with the multiple storylines about rampant rape, murder, and cannibalism rather than what some rando ahole says in mic.  To say nothing of the extremely disturbing voice acting of some NPCs dying horrifically.  
---
I kept server hopping at Drop Site C2.
---
This has bothered me since launch. 
---
Underarmor should stay on and work in PA. There is no logical reason it should not. Right now you can spend a large amount of time trying to get shielded plans and then use flux to make it only for it to be worthless when your in PA.
---
People complain about PA being a requirement which is BS cause you can kill the queen outside of a nuke zone in normal armor and you get all your legendary buffs, you just need to learn how to aim your nukes.
---
It doesn't show as two, but if you grab one, take it over
---
25c
---
Grab two, take that over. 40c
---
Doesn't do anything over grabbing two though
---
Black powder weapons uses bone. Not enough to justify 10's of thousands but still.
---
Not at all, super easy to farm by server hopping, here is a video showing exactly where you need to go and check.  Hope this answers your question and helps mate!  Best of luck farming!
---
The reason it happens is because when your melee weapon breaks, it "equips" your fists. So when pressing left on d pad to switch to previous weapon, that previously equipped weapon is now your broken melee weapon, which you arent able to equip. You can still equip a different weapon by using the hotkey wheel. 
---
It's most likely the way its coded. Not sure if it's patchable, as its technically working the way it should according to the coding.
---
I’m on Xbox also and I have a spare frame with a modded chest piece. You can have that if you want. I may have some spare Ultracite pieces too! If not I can craft you some more. 
---
How do they do this? asking for a friend, haha,  do they have to alter the code, or just exploit a glitch the programmers left in?  
---
It's against the sub rules to provide info like that.
---
Which one does this effect exactly and modded how? Only thing ive noticed about pipe weapons is the auto rifle doesnt benefit from Commando perks.
---
I was specifically talking about New Vegas since that’s the game originally mentioned. But maybe impactful is still too strong a word.
---
Really that would be great
---
I haven't gotten it yet but there is a spawn point...Watoga vendor translation. Go outside and run west on the train tracks to the next two broken train cars.  It will be half inside a box.  If it isnt the plan you want DONT TOUCH ANYTHING and server hop.  If you pick up anything there it will take 20-24 hours to spawn again.   
---
Link to plan in train because it isnt laying on top like a normal plan  [https://xboxclips.com/Amber%2071%20Stars/screenshots/a421e0a8-6158-4423-b0a5-437cff215b03](https://xboxclips.com/Amber%2071%20Stars/screenshots/a421e0a8-6158-4423-b0a5-437cff215b03) 
---
Umm... I wouldn't do it. But why is it dumb or gullible? If they want to buy it and they get more enjoyment out of it then what's wrong with that?
---
Heck, if you pre-ordered then you paid around 60 for it. They could have bought it on sale and used the rest for duped items. Then you paid the same amount as them. Does that make you dumb and gullible?
---
I turned in like 6 in all today and got one Scribe outfit which I already had two of and then just ammo and RadAways.
---
The kicker? I was making ammo for a friend and just spammed the button too many times. I wasn't even making bullets for me.
---
Pick up two and hand in at the dispenser (without changing servers, not sure if it works with a server swap)
---
40 caps instead of 25
---
Harpers ferry Hole in wall right in front of where you spawn if you fast travel. Look in the display cases.
---
You just saved me so many more caps, after I’ve lost nearly 2000 caps just trying to buy plans I thought I didn’t have. Thank you!
---
Also finally know the name of the table set I didn’t have! 
---
(I have some plans that you don’t have if you still need verification, as it says) 
---
&gt; Edit: I'm actually surprised how many people have agreed on this being an issue. 
---
I don't get why you're surprised. It's a pretty clear cut case of false advertising.
---
Have you looked into getting an atom refund?
---
I had it working with all the pipe weapons but was using semi weapons.  When you go to the mod screen and start rolling through the different stocks with rifleman and pistoleer perks equipped you will see the damage jump from just pistol perks to pistol +rifle when you roll over the right ones.
---
Im aware but I did report it 2 weeks ago so I was just looking for some confirmation that they’re aware and working on it
---
Upvote for "god to goddess"
---
I think it should make mods more effective, considering the durability boost you get during crafting. That way, it does base damage with a higher durability and then gets more damage/accuracy/range/weight reduction than usual when modding. That would promote people creating and modding their own weapons, especially when they need a good enough gun to hold them over until they find what they want. 
---
I actually found one blood leaf when someone nuked prime. Dont remember exactly, but it was in one of the trenches haha
---
Usually I just get screeched at and I hide till she goes away, or I just leave. 
---
Why's it only say one in inventory then?
---
Better chance that OP is just making up bullshit for internet Karma 
---
You beautiful genius, you!
---
Rosie actually mocks you and basically says good luck because the robot wants a claim ticket.  I assumed there would be one or a hint on how to find one.  Here I am, at the robot, no ticket. sai=d face

Please there is a dorito glaze as well.

I preferred the revolver with a stock, scope, and silencer and it was pretty good damage, insane vats accuracy and range.  Here is the build I was using when I tested it a few weeks ago.

The only thing I would change now is to drop all the end cards and grab starched genes and class freak.
---
Wow. 
---
I just need a single unit of Cobalt for my vault suit. I can give you caps, or trade for a different kind of flux, I'm sitting on a bunch of plans I already know, or I can craft a variety of ye olde weapons for you. My Bethnet name is simply "Hoon".
---
Neat!  Winnie's the best roommate ever. 
---
It's new to the patch. I've found it actually takes longer for me to get into the game than in the previous patch. Not a huge deal, what are a few extra seconds but still.
---
With explosives at least, that definitely seems to be the case. If I had to guess, every bodypart does damage reduction (similar to the headshot bonus you get on other enemies), but by hitting her only with splash damage, you're skipping that and getting to do full damage.
---
Thank you for calling out this shit liar. Now I don’t have to
---
If you place a brick door wall down, then try to place another one against it, it'll face the other and you'll have white on both sides. Then change it to flat wall on both sides. 
---
I didn’t drop technical data from my inventory. The game isn’t tracking the object properly.
---
Huh. I heard people turning in 6 at a time. I guess if the rest disappear it's just down to luck and maybe level
---
No shit people are pissed at the dupers for creating server instability and they should be banned on the spot and never allowed to play the game again.
---
Just go and try ur for yourself...
---
thats true, hopefully it helps with this kind of situations. because even after 10 or so posts to each of the markets i havent had any luck
---
It just came to mind, aha.
---
No problem! I just realized I didn’t clarify that it is an excavator chest piece. So if you want to hold off on building one this will save you materials. 
---
Sounds like youve got a drinking solution 
---
I had a good time last time Morgantown was nuked. The city was a fun place to hunt glowing ones.
---
r/Molemen76 I done did it, I'll have to spice it up on PC sometime!
---
It focuses mods before bulk steel. If you’re going to camp build unbulk your steel first. 
---
Yes his apparently likes to change it up.  I noticed that too after this battle because next time i saw him, he was wearing the propane tank helmet.
---
Already made a full set of Excavator sadly
---
It might also need to have had the rifle stock equipped with the automatic pipey.  Haven't tried an auto build with it sadly because I wasn't sure how well .38 would hold up end game.
---
Gotta optimize where exactly we target our nukes, to get the right types of flora in the radius. I've had times where the blast radius around Whitesprings didn't get to the Silt Beans or Glowing Resin outside the grounds and we were SOL for Cobalt. And if people target Fissure Site prime directly, then half the blast radius will be outside the map's invisible wall. 
---
bethesda never fixes anything until it becomes big on youtube
---
however methods also dont get used very often until they become big on youtube so i suggest sitting on it until you suspect others are doing it and then blow it up
---
Yeah... I had a feeling that would happen so I switched to an anti armor. 20 bullets would be soooo bad. 4x as bad to be exact!
---
The enclave mask could totally work with all helmets and hats!
---
I hear the mods that control most of the fallout subreddits dont want to let them in and has been deleted any mention of them.
---
Yikes! Glad that’s never happened to me. 
---
Honestly I'd love a ban and inventory reset, even for all, if it's not possible to find out who has duped items and so on
---
Any questions?
---
8 to 10 per server. So if you really need them quick you can farm them here. 
---
This!  A thousand times THIS!!
---
Well, it's a paradox. Because if helmets had resistance nothing would have gone through their heads.
---
I wish theyd introduce saved perk card loadouts.
---
For my Day time builds, my Heavy Guns, My Night builds, Nuke Zone.
---
If we can blueprint workshops, why cant i get 4 slots for my perkcards
---
They trade dupe was and is never real 
---
Cdo
---
Welp, time for me to starting dropping some bombs! 
---
Over your head, apparently.
---
Yeah, the wording is vague, but I lean in your direction. It would specifically say "trade items," if the supposed exploit were true. 
---
250. 😝
---
You can stack melee or strength bobbleheads too, should we remove melee from the game too?
---
... Hmm an utmost interesting right Arm PA armor...
---
(Soon on Trade)
---
W: Sentient PA X01  H: max caps 
---
I hope after reading this you have a epiphany or you're obviously just rolling at this point.
---
Get it.
---
Subscribed!
---
Yeah, except they have armor and then outfits that go on top of them. No reason they couldn't do that for the head too.
---
But, do they come anywhere near the damage of TSE though?
---
That's some mental gymnastics there skippo.  
---
\[We no longer let trades occur\] 
---
...means Player A receives something from Player B and Player B receives something in return from Player A... 
---
\[before the requested player has consented to a trade\] 
---
...which implies that Player A is able to receive something from Player B before Player B has consented... good 'ol chloroform cuddles in other words.  
---
Regarding FO76 trade mechanic, consent in the context of a trade would be Player B setting an item for sale (including quantity if its many), and a price per.  
---
So in essence the statement as it's WRITTEN implies Player A could trade for Player B's TSE Shotgun without Player B consenting, which means Player A gets a legandary weapon for free as no price was set from Player B.  Without consent, most ethical nations that existed before the bombs dropped would qualify that as stealing. 
---
TLDR; Bethesda's statement does appear to read to this layman as there being a legitimate trade glitch where players could get stuff stolen (although there was no posted proof to a convincing degree), they were guilty it seems after all O\_o.  
---
I want log cabin walls like the hunting lodge 
---
Always un equips my T60 Jetpack Chest. I think if we take the pieces off and re fit them at the power armor station it fixes the bug.
---
Using a mule character is exploiting, your bypassing the stash limit with the mule character.  This is not okay.
---
Those are hospital bed plans. I’ve seen them all over. 
---
I'm convinced that they were meant to have a function/quest of their own, but it was cut because it wasn't ready in time for the game's (premature) launch.  Perhaps we'll get that functionality in a future patch or DLC.
---
Or the server is suffering and just because you don't see it immediately doesn't mean it isn't the issue.
---
I knowww it's awful. I want one! I thought it'd be a reward from like, raider events
---
So I thought this armor added a 100 extra pounds of carry weight. Do I have to get some kind of mods for the legs?
---
They also don’t have any legendary except for named event awards that are garbage. Worst armor in the game IMO
---
Statistically 20 people is a very small sample size. And you are making assumptions about the reason that people aren't talking. 
---
You got the game at a good time. The game is a lot less buggy and runs better. The game is slowing getting there. Future patches and new content info made me happy.
---
I haven’t been following, what’s going to happen?
---
Prepare for lots of gear grinding.  Some of us are still low level and eeking an existance in the wasteland, and the most basic and effective (at quickly placing) design is the go-to until we are more secure in our powers and resources.  I get it, it's fuggly as hell.  But brother, after making several beautiful designs that would later NEVER EVER PLACE AGAIN, and realizing you still need some kind of functional base for support, the floating Baba-Yaga House (tm) will get lots of use yet.
---
The dupe glitches involved crashing the server so..
---
Sounds like the just dumped their entire inventory when duping to save time.  Not even sophisticated cheaters, just lazy ones...
---
I would love a gladiator like arena where we could bet on people and host events. You could choose to fight two deathclaws for X amount of caps and they’ll be scaled to your level. 
---
Very cool
---
Nope, it was the vault tec bed 2
---
Apparently he has no qualms about selling to a duper though? LOL 
---
Huh? Confused. I wouldn’t sell to a duper
---
Exploiting is abusing a function of the game that is not working as it was intended to work. Mule characters are not exploiting because there is no limit to how many items a player can carry, just a movement speed and travel hindrance past certain points.
---
I would trade out pack rat, travelling pharm, steong bacn for the 3 shotgun feats for more reliability to trade out. Super thanks though.
---
To literally "one-shot" the Scorched Queen you would need to exploit. It is not possible to do it legitimately even with scaling on your side. If someone knows how then I would welcome their wisdom but most likely they are either full of rubbish or they're a disgruntled Fallout 76 former developer with access to a top-secret debugger. 
---
This is a cool idea! I just wonder how and where the player hub would be ? 
---
What system are you on?
---
Agreed w/server hopping or logging off. I don’t pvp, atleast I won’t till it’s more evenly matched.
---
Idk why, but this comment literally made me think of every Army combat medic I knew.. “My arm is gone Doc!” Doc: “here are two ibuprofen.. take these and drink water, you will be alright kid.”
---
You must need cloth. I wish I had a cap. 😉
---
+karma where u at on map?
---
The title of your post says "... is your own dropped loot" so you seem to be in conflict with yourself here. O.o
---
It's pretty obvious the game is doing something weird, like when you end up with the power armor chassis you can't interact with in the same spot a player has fast traveled from.
---
If I come across it I may raid it, unless you’re a raider too
---
Thank you very much, this will be very useful.  I love the sounds of what you hope to do in the future too. =)
---
"super duper mart" 
---
That made me laugh more than it should have.
---
I'd be down if I weren't out right now.
---
Yeah one shotting everything doesn't need a nerf..........
---
Bloodied.
---
looks cool but im very surprised it took 20 hours
---
What if I told you that some people would consider what you've just described to be a trash base compared to what they think is good base design?  Quit throwing shade at others, let people build wtf they want to / works for them at the time.
---
Tygart, east of camp mclintock
---
Think it’s because of the 20,000 5.56 is why he made his comment above.  Still very bold assumption 
---
PC update fixed the duping exploit, but consoles are getting this update a few days later
---
It would have to be in the nuke free zone, right? Maybe Flatwoods.
---
How about one shotting players outside of consented PvP? A TSE cannot do that but a few builds right now can.
---
Can't remember as I'm not home to check but it is a 10mm pistol.
---
There are two guaranteed places I can tell you that you will get animals to tame. You will most likely need to server hop to find one but if you keep up with it you will defiantly find them......eventually.
---
So position number one is the lake next to the Thunder Mountain Energy plant (east side of the map). Fast Travel to the Power plant and head south and run along the south side of the shore of the lake until you find pieces of a crashed yellow plane. From here I have tamed a Mega Sloth, a Rad Toad and a Yao guai but there may be more.
---
This is where in the map you want to mark (where my player icon is set): [https://imgur.com/YlHLJwX](https://imgur.com/YlHLJwX)This is what the plane pieces look like: [https://imgur.com/GbavR07](https://imgur.com/GbavR07)
---
Just a head up this does glitch a few times so if you see a dead Yao guai floating in the air that was probably the tamable animal, I have seen it loads of times: [https://imgur.com/kRYsuSY](https://imgur.com/kRYsuSY)
---
The second place is in the top right of the map. Fast travel to the Fissure Site at the top right to the map and run East (and run because there will be a Scorchbeast there). Keep heading east and you will eventually come to a lake with a crash Vertibird in it. From here I have tamed a Snallygaster and a Rad Toad and I have seen other people found Mega Sloths and Deathclaws here as well.
---

These sites also spawn some pretty interesting events sometimes so its normally pretty entertaining anyway and other times its more scary stuff (one time I went there and there were literally 3 Scorchbeast right on top of each other just above the ground). If you come across an Albino Deathclaw he is an event and is NOT an tamable animal, there is normally a dead Brahmin around him as well.
---
I am very interested in finding more of these sites if anyone knows of any really specific locations they have found animals that can be tamed.
---
nope i havent, tell me what they say pls
---
I like keeping my health close to full
---
Could just make it so that the original doesn’t no damage and the explosions damage is replaced by the normal damage of the weapon. Also make the gun use explosives expert only to increase the damage. 
---
Was the glow purple? When I found the monster he and everything around had a purple glow.
---
That gun...pls Bethesda pls 
---
Sure, you can play it however makes sense to you mate, only reason I took the carry weight items was because there wasn't anything else that directly contributed to the chainsaw damage out put, thats why I asked which weapon you were targeting.  Ripper I would put in Glad perks, incisor, martial artist instead.  Mr Handy I would do slugger, incisor, and martial artist instead.  The damage on these is more than high enough you won't need a shotty past level 20 anyways.  If you do take a shotty take enforcer with it.  Enforcer by itself with a shotty is godlike for crippling everything so you can make short work of it with the chainsaw saving on shotgun ammo.
---
I know where he found it
---
In drop site v9 I found cigarettes arranged to spell LHM any idea what that means
---
Vampire's then would be my second choice.
---
Are you talking Grafton dam? Im game to give it a shot but was scouting around Clarksburg and wasnt getting much for normal spawns.
---
For me the camera movement in first person is really jerky and weird now , like if I turn around it jumps foward a few frames , I honestly thought I was having micro blackouts 
---
Bethesda” because, fuck you!”
---
They probably can’t see you but I know for sure they can spawn on your location
---
Oh okay, gotcha! 
---
It’s very appropriate for a survival base that’s easy to move around whenever it’s needed. 
---
Wouldnt furious be best for the queen though?
---
I dropped around 200 to a guy in PA (i dont use PA - so the 300 i have in my stash will last a while)
---
And from experience - melee/shotguns is more stat friendly, than melee rifles.
---
Excavator PA adds 100lbs of carry weight when wearing the full suit (all 6 pieces). But just having the two arms equipped will net you double ore when mining.
---
 But wearing any PA will automatically unequip (nullify) any other armor effects/resistances. You can't stack underarmor/regular armor with power armor. 
---
i want greenhouses with planters inside.. or at least clear/see through walls. at least somewhere where mole rats dont constantly tear up my junk
---
You can’t have two shot and furious together. 
---
they don’t destroy immersion. but they are defiantly not going to help the case of fallout 76 being the most immersive game.  especially when prefaced that these graphics are 16x better then fallout 4’s supposedly.
---
Morrowind was immersive due to the character, wold building and lore which again was shat in in this particular installment
---
Nope, once you entered PA all other gear stats were removed
---
Yep, more disconnects and even some CTDs, even though the "game client and servers have received additional stability improvements."
---
I wish that vendor would give me anything useful.
---
On, still there?
---
Omw
---
That’s just cool as shit! I love what you did with that!
---
Just try and tag it with 1 bullet and let the robots kill it, you still get the loot and xp.
---
In retrospect “your own dropped loot bag” would have been better phrasing.
---
I had done a couple of playthroughs and never found it. When i went on an all out playthrough (all DLCs done before I met Benny)  that gun with its AP rounds was my bread and butter. with OH BABY! as melee backup.
---
76 is the first fallout ive had fun with unarmed. Just waiting on a Leg. Deathclaw Gauntlet
---
If they can’t see you, how do they spawn in on you? Do you mean they can’t see my character, and still see my blimp on the map?
---
Yup
---
I agree and I have a feeling we will get this in the future, once we "rebuilt" WV in a future dlc.
---
Yeah Defiantly somewhere nukes can't reach. maybe add a expansion to the map and add the hub?
---
Playing on the Xbox, I just hit level 18 and haven't gotten a S.P.E.C.I.A.L. point in a couple levels.. Kinda sticks since I upgraded a card to help lower my weight of armor, since I didn't get the point I now can't use it.. Can anyone explain the levels we actually get the points to spend?
---
How else am I gonna get loot to sell? Gotta take from the poor to sell to the rich. 
---
But I also get my own loot as well, I mainly take from people being a nuisance to lower levels. 
---
Why are you leaping to the conclusion that they have nothing else lined up?  Why are you all such cynical pricks?
---
Ps4
---
It’s not actually dropping it. This happens consistently to my buddy because he never turns in the data. It happened to me for a few weeks with the broken/repaired relay 
---
I think they would just remove the ability to wear armour while in PA before they allowed them to stack. It's not realistic that it would fit while all that armour was equipped anyway.
---
I don't know... Most mmos leave open ended eggs.  Doors that don't open, npcs (haha) that are obviously for the future.  
---
That said... I am a proponent of the game. But, ... I beleive that if the issues were taken more seriously by management (NOT THE DEVS) and even delated launch to week before xmas... Alas, will never know.
---
It’s easy to identify items nobody should have.  It’s possibly impossible to know if a duped but obtainable item was duped.  Do you understand the difference?
---
when you're looking at the walls (when in building mode), scroll to the right
---
About every 2-3 hours on Xbox 
---
Awesome, me too! What's your PSN?
---
Ayyyyy
---
You’re being a bit of an ass about this.
---
Yeah, it is fine in a single player game, but come, they know they are ruining it for others with the crashes and servers disconnecting...even low frame rates. Yes, even without dupes there will be these issues, I just don't think it would be as bad. I rarely was disconnected until dupes became popular.
---
To be honest at this point I think I would be excited about doing a nuke site that is anywhere but the main fissure site or the whitesprings.
---
Because, god forbid the possibility those are just potential rewards at the end of an event, such as maybe I dunno... (checks ranked PA) a faction quest line?
---
Atom Cat paint is interesting.. I understand most if not all of these designs were from Fallout 4.. but if it is released then I would hope theres at least *SOME* backstory as to how Atom Cats are in Appalachia
---
I often put stuff i the cash registers at vendors for other people to pick up. Usually stuff I can't sell and such. Ammo, plans etc
---
America: [✓] Rebuilt
---
Thank you you god
---
Same as my reddit username!
---
Only ones I've found are for electric doors
---
do you have any ammo wieght reduction perks?
---
How about don’t seek revenge if you’re getting your ass kicked? 
---
Do you have perks that lower the weight of your ammo? It doesn't work for stash
---
That is a good point, there are a few farms up that way that have plenty of vegetables that would turn into flux.
---
Not the dam, further north...the one with a shooting range. If you have that town in the southwest corner of the nuke zone, you will have quite a few good little pockets of enemies inside
---
PSA the websuit is a PS4 exclusive.
---
If you like stabbin, do it with a ski sword and think of meeeeeeeee when you kill
---
It's negligable. Queen is not full time melee accessible, furious multiplier does have a cap, and last but not least - it's pretty much pointless to pick a weapon based on one 10-min encounter.
---
Is it because you have a perk making them lighter while your carrying them, and said perk doesn’t effect them in stash?
---
Very true, I will try it next time
---
Seconded. 
---
I didn’t spend $60 on the game. I got it at a discount because I’m a conscientious consumer and I’m not a dick to salespeople. But I also didn’t buy into the hype and assume this game was going to be something it’s not. I knew about the faults in the game. I have eyes and could tell from the livestream and the info they were presenting that it was going to need some work. 
---
I’ve known of Bethesda’s faults for a long time. So I was was not really shocked it played out how it did. I still got the game and enjoy it for what it is regardless. It’s not perfect by any means, but it’s not the worst either. 
---
You call me an npc, but you’re the one who is complaining about the game. Also, the least inspired insult ever, btw. The rest of us knew what we were getting ourselves into. 
---
You are familiar with Bethesda’s previous works aren’t you? Until about a decade ago, they were known for buggy rpgs and crappy ports for a niche audience. FO3 included. Hell, it seems everyone’s favorite game in the series is New Vegas and Bethesda didn’t even make that. Their shit has always been buggy and dated. For the most part, no one who liked that kind of game really cared. 
---
Until fucking Skyrim, no one gave two shits about Bethesda, so gtfo with this “omg what happened to them?! They changed. Fuck them wah!” Dude, they have *always* been this way! Horse armor anyone?
---
What’s your problem? That businesses want to make money? That the current industry trend is all about overpriced special editions and micro transactions, and a company has the audacity to follow that trend?
---
 Not Bethesda’s fault you morons throw money down on overpriced and useless bullshit. And for what? The prestige? Who cares about your canvas bag or shitty rum? Seriously, how fucking lame! No one in the real world wants to see your man baby trophies!
---
You think people would’ve learned their lesson after the shitty cheap plastic pip boy they packaged with Fallout 4. But nope. You idiots throw your money at obviously scammy shit and then bitch you got scammed. Well no shit Sherlock!  Of course corporations only give a shit about making money! It’s called Capitalism!
---
As for the game itself. Bethesda said from the beginning that it was a side project they were just testing out. It was pretty clear from the start that this was pretty experimental on their part. They weren’t sure how it was going to play out. So naturally, they aren’t going to waste a bunch of resources if they don’t have to. Since online games can be easily patched and updated, and it’s traditionally the industry standard, then that is what they are going to do. Is there something about the game development process you don’t understand?
---
Should they have charged $60? Probably not. I wouldn’t pay $60. (So I didn’t.) I certainly wouldn’t throw down $100+ for some collectors edition garbage to take up space and gather dust. No matter what mental gymnastics I have to do to justify it. 
---
But people do spend their (or their parents) money on all kinds of dumb shit, so what do you expect a company to do? You want noble fan service, try an indie developer or something. Bethesda is not and never has been anything other then a developer/publisher out to make money in an industry rife with predatory practices. Practices that industry standard. 
---
Sure they have a closer relationship with their fans but that is still in the service of making money. 
---
Let me put it this way. You think a bartender calls you honey and sweetie be sure they like you or want to be your friend? Hell no! They are being nice to you because they want your money.
---
Telling people they need to raise their standards. What standard? When the fuck did Bethesda have a standard? Y’all angry little babies give them *way* too much credit.
---
Y’all seriously, it’s kinda sad. You got scammed, they got your money. You were ignorant and got played. It’s over. Move on.
---
I hate to be all tough love and shit. But damn, you force my hand with your asinine insults. NPC. How lame. Are you freakin’ 12 or something? Lol.
---
Coming at me with your insults and bullshit. You don’t even know, man! You couldn’t even begin to understand what you’re talking about.
---
Marked, thank you.
---
Caps available for p i l l a g e d  l o o t. P i l l a g e d  l o o t available for caps. 
---
Yeah exactly. It's just cringe reply after one another. The irony is that they are calling dupers losers in life while they are playing the same game crying about them.
---
Yes, most of my ballistic ammo is 0.000 .308 and 10mm are 0.001 so very little each. 
---
It seemed clear to me that they can’t identify if an item was a dupe or obtained as a legit drop.  Which means they can’t remove duped items from players, if they can’t ID them.
---
If you actually try to believe what they say instead of taking a default adversarial stance, this is completely in line with it.
---
Not really
---
The one true God!
---
Did you have a turret base next to the golf club? Because if so imma smash that shit 
---
They can’t see you from the social menu but they can still see and join you from the PS4 friends list so you have to go offline there as well. Unfortunately once they are in your world they can still see your dot.
---
With the newest patch, ballistic fibre will be a requirement for crafting level 25 and above armor.
---
If you were really sorry for the rant you wouldn't have clicked post.
---
Well then you must have low standards sir, I'm sorry.
---
Ultra Light + Weightless still works with PA.
---
i am launching a nuke, after i finish that up i can go to you but if you can join me on my server i’d appreciate that too. my IGN is luficr :) if u can trade violet? if not i’ll take caps. 
---
It’s an option in the social menu
---
3 into bandolier and 1 into batteries included, but I have very little energy ammo
---
That sucks, but you should be careful with your gear
---
Is there anyone left in this game without tse? I shit you not - I sold a tse handmade to lvl16 2 days ago. Where the hell did he get 4000 caps?
---
Copy that, thanks! Gonna give it a try!
---
The sun does shine ya know
---
The weight reduction perks don't work for your stash
---
You are being overly pedantic and uncharitable with their language.  Them saying they can’t remove duped items (if they can’t identify them) then they are not lying.  If there is an item type that should not be possessed by any player, it’s easily identifiable.
---
They never said they couldn’t remove anything from a player inventory, just that they can’t do what people are asking bu removing all duped items.
---
Yesssss. Every time I see the arena by Top of The World I always think of how cool it could of been to have a gladiator-like arena.
---
Come to think of it,  Top of the World would of made a great player hub. 
---
Gauss takes too long to charge. You can get 3 shots off with the hunting rifle compared to 1 shot with Gauss. If you somehow found a TSE hunting rifle slap a refined .50 receiver on it and call it a day
---
I was minding my own business building my camp in what I thought was the middle of nowhere. Grahm walked past my base twice in the span of two hours.. TWICE and once again late last night randomly. Up until that point I've only seen him 3 other times besides that. Although, only the first time he had his cow - I'm worried it got lost
---
Bought the hot rod PA station and couldn't even place it (totally inconsistent z-axis to rest of camp). Ended up just placing a normal yellow variant 2 out of frustration. No word from Bethesda on any kind of refund.
---
Yeah, I just realized that. I didn't think the EC was affected by either of the perks which is why I thought that was the problem. 
---
Until you can sit everybody down at a table, put a 1,000 dollars on it, and say don't take it and they won't, this 'difference in philosophies' between dupers and hippies will always go on.

Please downvote them to oblivion every time they post in defense or try and troll people posting against hacking, cheating, glitching and duping.

Please upvote anyone like OP who makes posts or comments against hacking, cheating, glitching and duping.

That’s cool.  For every one of you there are countless more that are cheating.  It’s not really a statement that can be argued.  It’s a fact.

My next nuke is Harpers Ferry. With all those super mutants, it should yield fairly good results
---
Got them powered gates :)
---
We were at the ammunition factory and Grahm walked right up to the door.
---
Maybe if they add a vault by an empty area near Flatwoods? If its something like a vault,  they could make it into an indoor area that you have to load into. That way it won't look like a huge eyesore to add a completely new city on to the map.  
---
I would love that Super Sledge if you aren't using it!
---
The handmade is by default semi-auto. I use the hardened receiver. To make it automatic you have to craft the automatic receiver. Rifleman perks work with it
---
Yes, I except a video game that works at least 3 hours without server disconnects and thats "high standards". Ok bud XD
---
That is a great idea!! I never even thought about vaults haha 
---
Well would ya look at that
---
your world is full :( 
---
Funilly enough I have much more respect for people that bug abuse for their items than those that just MTX for them.
---
You lucky sob! Thats what im goin for. Im gonna relog and see if his inventory refreshes
---
I am the same way, I squat the bag until they get back. I did that to one guy with a 50 cap bounty (just had to, was kinda cool, waited a few minutes for a perfect head-shot while they tried to avoid it, knowing I was there), waited for them to come back and moved off the bag, gave them a cheery wave. They waved back... and logged. They had a few springs and everything, but nothing you can't get easy enough, so I dunno. Felt kinda bad.
---
pc, damn silo bugged somehow, one section chief died, I rebuild one, the new chief walked all the way to his station,  but the quest marker stays on the build terminal. so launch prep is stuck at the existing percentage... then i let a 2nd chief get killed, that one keeps his marker even dead... https://imgur.com/a/2fc02Uk

Im not sure if your intentionally being obtuse or just ignorant of game mechanics and how a bounty can be achieved in taking a workshop

Build advice is kinda useless without knowing where you want to go as you head towards endgame. I recomended going into Power armour, as it's almost nessasary for nuke zones.
---
 If you keep going along the shotgun path your go a be high STR as that's were the shotgun perks are. Rifle perks are under Perception. Some good END is generally a Dumpstat for most people. I whould recomended taking at least 3 in every stat, mostly just to be able to swap anything in temporarily.
---
I whould play around with the builder at nukesdragons.com to get an idea of what you want to do and where to put your points.

Reverse sexual panther

You still aren’t getting it.  Go back and read the replies again.
---
Yeah, vector and paintbrush for texture
---
Thank you all. I didn't think the EC was affected by either perks. I will pull a few 10mm to get all of my EC in storage. I am saving for a while to see what the patch next week does. I will probably sell most of my 10mm and all of the EC later, as well as a number of other ballistic types. 
---
I am really bummed that perks dont go into the stash. 
---
Yes it was!
---
oh so this is where all these things came from!
---
That doesn't happen to me. Must be your internet.

It is possible to have high standards of an audience to expect only what is possible. If bethesda printed the letters BETA on the cover, charged the same price: you would still buy it and have no power to argue. Replying to you has to be one of the most insignificant moments in my entire life, so this is the last that I will. Thankyou for your contributions to my post.

Sure, "he" has tons. Totally not duped. 😉 And I'm not advertising for "him" at all. 
---
OP reads like an Amazon review of an item sold out of China.
---
Is not so much comparing it as it is losing its value of achievement when others did it in a none legit way that’s all I feel. As for cheaters it suck specially when you know the only reason he kill you is because he cheated and not because he has better skill. 
---
Maybe some of the suggestions others have provided can help you.

The hard time selling is hitting me hard right now. Right now trading and collecting weapons armor and blueprints are all the end game consists of but there’s no one buying anything that isn’t a god roll because the duper’s have an infinite supply. I’ve been holding on to tons of stuff to sell that’s damn good but no one wants to pay even dirt cheap prices because they can get the rarest most powerful rolls in the game cheaper. 
---
Get the health factor mutation and you'll find you end up with a crap ton of stimpacks and super  ones that you'll be dropping them here and there for weight mgmt. 
---
How would I know? I dont abuse this meta yet
---
Awesome totally adding ya. How long to ya open
---
Ahh sorry I misunderstood.
---
People cheating to get ahead then taunting ot every 2 seconds does make getting a weapon or build seem more like a race than an achievement in that case.
---
If you want good place to farm low level legendary stuff there is a fairest wheel in the top left of the map.there is a event that happens there called “leader of the pack” this event is very easy at low level and you get 3 lengendary items. This is a good place to get lengedary for low level player
---
They are not useless after the last patch you will need it to craft higher level armor.
---
I mean I would like some caps or a trade but nothing crazy. 
---
Try reading legit and then say that an infinite supply of dirt cheap god roll legendaries doesn’t affect anyone else. 
---
You don't have to keep hunter/hunted radio on, just long enough for the quest to become active.

But yeah, less players would be good. Ive only succeeded once and I tune in almost every sesh :(

I’m down, CrispyBits1

I wonder if I go around blasting that annoying 'Blue' or 'Macarena' song on infinite repeat how long it will take the whole server to hate me lol

Star Wars galaxies had the best crafting system that basically revolved around resource quality, and crafter skill. Resources would spawn in the world of varying quality. Players would go out into the world and survey the resources. When they eventually track it down to a good area they would place an extractor. The highest quality resources were rare and thus took much more work to find. The best crafters had a crafting suit with stats that boosted their crafting quality also. It wasn't easy to get the mods for the crafting suit so another level of difficulty to be the best. Once you had the best crafting suit, maxed skills, and the perfect resoruces crafting was a multilayered system where you had to craft the components and then assemble them into the items. It was so complex, but very rewarding if you were the best crafting. Items you crafted had your name on them. People would come from all over to find the best crafters and buy their items, and they were well known. That was a perfect system in my opinion. No other game has ever come close to the complexity and attention to detail.
---
I guess this person wanted to get some sort of response from the other party but he/she didn't like what he got so this person posted it on Reddit to get the reaction he/she was looking for.
---
Yeah, I don't know how to read that statement any other way.
---
Combat for fire rate is my preference.  Double barrel for most damage and long shot distance if that's your style. 
---
Creepy
---
Would you be interested in some donations? I've got some good items that aren't great so I've not found a buyer, but I've also not tried hard haha.

Lvl25 3* Hunter Trapper left arm, +1 strength, weapon weight reduced %20
---
Lvl45 2* Unyielding Raider left arm, +1 str

Lvl35 3* Anti-Armor Board, 40% power atk dmg, 90% reduced weight
---
Lvl50 1* Furious Gatling gun
---
Lvl45 1* Vampire's Multi-Purpose Axe
---
They're all free, I'd hate to just drop them to rot. I can also craft Witch's outfits, they sell to vendors at 40 caps a pop, and seeing you're a vendor, I'll sell them to you for that special price!
---
Ugh - there needs to be a quest item tab. I thought I had enough mats to build my 4 cause it allowed me to make and now I think it was just recycling the one or two I already made. Such a huge pain dealing with this and server outages :(
---
Really depends. For whitespring i like instigating as its an easy 1 shot but with adrenaline built up everything is a one shot.....
---
Swing speed and bonus power attack are wonderful though.
---
Haha, "must be your internet" or try like %80 of the launch player base internet as well. Also sorry I got you so worked up.
---
There was an outage earlier today. What happens if you view the images you added to the albums (in your normal screenshot list) then check the album again? 
---
I honestly would be pissed for awhile, but would understand if I legit picked up a TSE weapon or bought one for caps. Especially if they are as rare as people say. 
---
Been playing since launch.  Never happened till today.

Fast traveled to Harpers Ferry and black screen no sound.    Map visible when brought up.

Same thing, black screen no sound.

Power armor indicator is up and shows no armor pieces.  Game flickers then crashes.

Shows power armor indicator without armor pieces again.

I hold E (button to exit power armor) and screen now looks normal with all my armor there.

Still at my base.

Fast travel to Harpers Ferry is officially a black hole now.

Walking to Harpers Ferry......

Another couple of random spawn locations are: East of Cranberry Glade. Follow the wooden deck east through the trees and into the swamp. I've had a radtoad and a sloth here. (https://imgur.com/a/pkDqIs1).
---
Also follow the road from Big B's Rest Stop north around the bend, and just past the overpass there's a random spawn on the road. Happy hunting!
---
You aren't playing your mule character (if you did you wouldn't call it a mule) your just using it as a stash box, so you are BYPASSING a game mechanic of limited storage space, it is exploiting, it is cheating.
---
What sort of item are you looking for, or how many caps?
---
Not sure is someone has said so already, but I think you're missing a grill. Also, don't know about PC or PS4, but can confirm domestic kitchen tables work on XB1. 
---
Thats cool and all, but they better add some shitty looking ones to the game at least.
---
For biulding you want a sealed room(3 wall , door, roof) and want all different crafting tables. I would recommend biuld ing next to a water source since the you can place water purifiers and get purified water that you can sell or use. You will need generators witch you get from the “powering up &lt;power station&gt;” events. Try to protect these. Dont make more than 2 turret since they don’t work well and take up huge amounts of your base buget.
---
it may be to stop people from taking weight affecting perks and then filling their stash then changing the perks so they may possibly exploit the stash being overloaded. 
---
Yeah, there was a big debate about whether or not it was real because there was no proof it was happening other than people saying it happened to them.
---
I’ll take 10 crimson
---
I agree, I haven't been to every location nor fought/killed every enemy. The only reason I know something is a no no, if read it here or see it on YouTube, but not everyone reads or watches stuff on FO76.

If some one needs to be taken off the pool gene 🧬 is them guys good are they dumb.

Nope

Left leg, sometimes that and the chest. 
---
Happenes to me too, not so strong tho, just a small camera jumps.
---
Yes. I'd post any glitch you find so that the developers will know about it if they don't already and ignore anyone saying no as they may or may not be exploiting said glitch if they know about it.
---
Set up your camp just west of The Whitesprings Golf Club (as close as you can get to that side of the building) and setup at least one turret (of any type). It's not ideal, but it works for what you are looking for.
---
I got the plans for the gun and the fletchette mod from cranberry bog maps.

I'm gonna go aginst the other guy and say go with Instagating. Then you will be one-shoting almost everything outside the SBQ with a super sledge so swing speed won't matter much at all.
---
Nice choice. My post has already named you.
---
Who needs that when you have Addictol?
---
I'd gladly take donations if you don't wanna drop the items and witch costumes eh? I'll probably buy some from you since some people have been searching for the costume! 
---
Agreed. OP is reminiscent of a Herbalife promoter. It’s almost cringe worthy
---
I like to mix this into the fiction of the game. A Vault full of WV's brightest minds opens and they pour out into Appalachia and.... pepper the country side with 1x1 Floaters.
---
This is badass! Kudos man!
---
I'm gonna be spending all night collecting ammo, grenades, resources and gear so maybe today and half of tomorrow. I may open tonight depending on how looting goes!
---
Owch I'd buy that for 700 caps 😆
---
Agree. The only things I know about that game mode so far is that it is PvP, and that nobody plays it. So I haven't even bothered trying it. Getting notified when other people want to play it would probably make more people join.
---
If your hybrid build is cutting corners in the same way mine is, the most important effect is the weight one. A 2h melee is often above 20lbs.
---
Me also. Happens especially after fast travel for me or logging in.
---
This sure seems the same as the debate about how to disclose security vulnerabilities in software:
---
* https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure
---
* https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_disclosure_%28computer_security%29
---
I actually love the idea that civilians could own laser weapons, based on one of the General Atomics posters. 
---
 It's a free ride when you've already paid!
---
I think I've seen Barbed and Flechette mods at Watoga both as plans and mods.
---
I don't know where to find the plans, but I've gotten a few harpoon guns from drops in Cranberry Bog.
---
Well you can make that two people, only time I ever had crashes or disconnects was when the infinite weight exploit was running rampant and I tried it for myself. Soon as I stopped doing it I stopped disconnecting. Played all day today and yesterday not a single D/C or crash either.
---
This is great, thank you! You didn't note it, but the office desk is a stash box as well. 
---
It's great to add the desk and office chair that way your player can chill out at their desk while you're rummaging through your stash. 
---
I think many of us don't.  That being said, it appears that doing that is one legitimate way of enjoying the game and is completely enabled by the game developers.
---
Good on you, responsible parent.
---
It's a video game. They're gonna learn right from wrong somewhere. You can bet your ass that if they're not homeschooled, the 12 year old at least knows the word "fuck" and why you don't use that word around polite company. If the parents are there, keeping an eye out for the kid, then ~~fuck~~ heck yeah, high five to the good parent, because they're supervising their child's growth and learning experiences rather than trying to stop them from doing so. 
---
I'd tone it down around the kids, because I like to think I am a reasonable human and I am capable of the lowest obligation of decent behavior, and if I slip up or don't know that there's kids listening in, mum or dad will be there to explain why we don't say "fuck that ghoul in the ass" in the real world.
---
this fucking shit right here dude.. i've been looking for something like this forever. good job
---
That's a pretty accurate analogy. I'm not defending dupers, quite the opposite. I don't like the ruined game economy either (if there ever was a healthy one), but if the devs leave such a large field for experimentation as this game does, something like the current situation was bound to happen.
---
I generally am carrying 800+ lbs for similar reasons. 
---
Just now trying to build a small camp and figure out how to lower my weight enout to be able to fast travel. 
---
sometimes they trigger, mostly they wont, bethesda
---
I've got a few hats, but they have to be farmed around pumpkin house so I'd do more for those, maybe a couple hundred each?
---
Also, sorry about interrupting your PvP, didn't realize you weren't at you shop! Haha
---
What is there to check? It clearly says Two-Shot in the name and explosive in the undertext. Either the person didn't even know what it was, or they knew and didn't care.
---
It's fine the way it is. 
---
I drop usable, replaceable things (ammo, guns, ect) in containers, and irreplaceable or rarer things (recipies ect) I drop to specific players as I meet them, so if they don't want them, I can save them for the next person.
---
I was offline (hidden mode?) on the PS4, and I had him blocked from the social menu before I joined a lobby. I even double checked to see if he was in it. Within a minute he ported over to my location in the middle of no where, and comes up to me.
---
Hmm? I'm not doing pvp at the moment I'm gathering loot to sell for when I open. Are you in my server atm?
---
*Why you would think this was anything but a paint job for the existing door is beyond me.*
---
Did you look at the picture?
---
If you’re oneshot by a rifle, it might not even be TSE. It could just be explosive. I have an exterminators explosive Gatling and it melts Mobs. PvP it’s hit or miss because it still takes the shots landing and it takes more than one. 
---
A decent combat rifle or handmade or hunting rifle. I really don't know what these things are worth with caps so if you just want to make an offer I will likely accept it long as it doesn't seem ridiculously low lol.
---
Sloths can't be salty I call troll.
---
I found a flechette mod on Phoenix 
---
The way it needs to work is, ESRB is a suggestion, and you are free to supervise your kid as they play if you wish, and if something *bad* happens you hold Bethesda and all other players in the game completely blameless in the legal sense.  They are absolved of responsibility.  This works for me.
---
Wow, what a unique opinion! Glad you shared that with us. Thankyou.
---
For sure man. Really think the community managers are the way to go. Tickets and such do get properly organized and noticed, but as more of a report to them than a dialogue. In my experiences with bug reporting with many companies over the years, many never contact back unless they need to ask questions on the process.
---
Open dialogue for each ticket would be ideal, but considering the amounts of reports that flood in for a typical AAA game like this, the personal touch is usually abandoned for efficiency in addressing it. 
---
You might have written a good enough ticket to give them all they need to know. It would definitely be sorted into a high priority pile compared to something like a texture bug report, but the approach to whether or not they need to speak with a writer of a bug report is going to be equally low unless they need more info.
---
Getting CM confirmation is likely your best bet 
---
For someone who compares playing this game to being held hostage, you sure do post about it a lot. 
---
Thank you so much for doing this - awesome job!
---
Someone might have felt guilty owning it, but didn't want to drop it on the ground either.
---
After scorchbeast queen fights I like to check the Watoga vendors to see what people are getting rid of. Sometimes I find nice things at the Artisan's Corner in the Whitespring too. I haven't had any such luck with the Enclave bunker though.
---
I think I ran into your camp at one point. Xbox? Great looking camp! 
---
Yeppers
---
Fiddle and banjo?
---
Lol I feel silly now I've listened to that same repeat for over 40 hours 🤗
---
You could tell me that, and I’d still call any single foundation floating base a dumpster fire and a travesty. I’d also tell you you’re wrong. But I’d say it nicely and offer to build you some sexy bear skin rings because I’m not a total jerk. 
---
There's a surprising amount of lore in posters and billboards. I have a bunch of them strewn around my camp for this specific reason. This one in particular is next to my weapons workbench
---
Took forever for me to find a ts plasma had to buy it never seen a tse plasma rifle or pistol though sadness :( but thats pretty lucky man got a freind whoa Legandary drop consist of nocturnal and junkies lol
---
I think you didn't get the definition of the syndrome
---
My ign is Jemtz23
---
All of the images are there in my screen shot list.  However they are no longer in my albums.  Now each album is still showing only 3-4 screenshots instead of the 20-30 that should be in there.   
---
I have heard that with the changes to Fireproof, you can take all three levels of that perk and get the Dense mod on  your torso (reduction to explosive) and it will pretty much negate Explosive damage. That'll take the jam out of their doughnut long enough for you to take care of business.
---
The simple solution to the problem is to give players an option between playing on servers where PvP is allowed and servers where it isn't. Where it isn't even enabled. 
---
Then the folks who enjoy attacking one another out of the blue can have at it. 
---
A good portion of the people who bought the game have enjoyed Fallout for years as a single player game. They bought it because it's a Fallout game, not because it's multiplayer. Many bought it in spite of it being multiplayer. 
---
We're kind of on a tangent here, but that might actually be a partial way of dealing with having kids all over the place. 
---
Luck. I get shit like +1 perception armor and stuff i dont use
---
And when I say variants I mean, shotgun, combat rifle, homemade ect.
---
Did not know about the glassed caverns thing. Will try that, thanks. Any luck with legendary spawns there?
---
I know this is a necro, but can I get it too?
---
Whiskey? You mean Sad Champagne?
---
You're very welcome.  Between her photos and hopefully this spreadsheet we can start buying the things we want and not duplicates or guessing games! :)
---
They should have the hub inside vault 76
---
Martial artist works on saw?
---
gee, too bad at the center of the game theres a giant hotel with vast open spaces, countless locked rooms and 2 floors we cant go to yet
---
And they will either a) turn out interesting, or b) rack up the bill at the shrink their parents get them.  Either way they are going to be learning some new vocabulary in this game probably.  Less sarcastically, nobody needs to be extra spicy to them but at the same time nobody should coddle them in the game.  Play and talk however you want in a M rated game.
---
Keeping it forever? Lol that thing is trash
---
I never said TSE. I said just the explosive affix, as did the OP. What has higher dps and completely nullifies an entire weapon class(explosive weapons)?
---
Bad idea also farming in this game is nothing the grind is weak if 5 hours of searching for something is so bad buy them for caps off the market?
---
Are you implying you’ve been held against your will and forced to sympathize with your captors? 
---
Is someone forcing you to play the game still? 
---
I noticed I’m averaging at least one pick up a day
---
oh boy the hunter hood i loved the hunters pelt outfit set in Fo4
---
also anyone have pictures of the Faschnacht masks im really want to know what they look like
---
I pass through the Trapper's Camp all the time, it has always been a recipe for me.
---
We do this all the time.. We know by the 3rd nuke server will crash if not right before launch within 10 mins after...
---
Because half that shit is reused assets from Fallout 4.  Bethesda are a complete joke at this point.
---
This was a pve thread (as most are, since PVP is a pre-alpha state tacked on mess most don't bother with).
---
I got an two shot with boosted fire damage today from west tech 
---
Nah, those are the only handmade mods that you *can't* get by scrapping. There are 40-odd others that you can.
---
Ill make an exceptional reply to ask for a source on your 80% unable to connect statistic. If that was reality, Bethesda would be facing a class action lawsuit on behalf of the consumer base.
---
I will be blocking you because yes you have indeed bothered me and my respect to a fair debate. But I'm sure anyone else reading, if anyone would care, would like to hear the source behind your claim. 
---
Which i believe is wishwash, just like your ridiculous rant on my appreciation post.
---
I dont hunt legendarys, but have had no luck
---
Whaaaaa xbox?
---
so that person died but then you crashed picking it up? sounds unrelated and this whole post has too many maybes. do you know for fact the server crashed after or just using that to back up why you think you crashed? Was the crashing directly related to you picking up the bag or just coincidence? 
---
what are the majority of the problems faced by servers, that aren't related to bugs or technical stuff?? Aren't the majority of crashes attributed to technical stuff or do you know exactly why the game crashes every time it has?? 
---
Duping has become the bogey man of fo76 and anytime the game chops for whatever reason it definitely has to be due to dupers. Why just the other day my lamp fell off my bench because I picked up a package with 'MILLIONS OF DUPED STUFF'
---
Fast honest sale 6 stars! He also threw in 20,000 ultracite rounds for free when I bought 3 rifles!
---
Do people consider the Super Sledge or Grognak the best? I have a pole hook with +swing speed and +power attack damage, and havent used much else in eons. still no pole hook plans though :(
---
I'm 135 and only have seen two 1 star two shot weapon drops - gauss and pipe gun.
---
Come on buddy. How do you misspell Ghoul? The name is right there above their heads when you shoot them 
---
My game is bugging out. Going to relogin
---
Definitely a fiddle. 
---
Yaaassss! I really wanted to do something like this but ultimately was just too lazy. Thank you!
---
It does on the swing portions of them, if you use power attacks with them it's worth using, if you are just doing the straight multiple ticks per second primary attack it doesn't.
---
The daily quests are broken and only popup when they feel like it. I pass in front of Boomer a lot and his daily only triggered about 3 times.
---
alright, i will wait here 
---
you know what. Shout out to Bethesda, thanks heaps for the great updates, keep em coming, people like the OP really appreciate it
---
I got my 2 shot action pump shotgun from my friend, He is a melee build and was never going to use it, he knew I  am a shotgun build. Sure it is pretty great but it still takes multiple shots for higher level enemies and I can easily kill myself with it. I don't PvP nor will I dupe it. I have issues just trying to get enough materials for repairs and building.
---
It's pretty sad that you have nothing better to do.
---
I experienced a bad bug today in a nuke zone where I was stuck in my PA upon entering it and couldn't move, and then I pressed the button to exit it but nothing happened, but I did actually exit it but the screen was frozen on the PA. Luckily I was wearing the hazmat suit and I wasn't receiving rads from another bug. Then after a minute the suit recalled. Then I couldn't see the popup to interact with things, like looting. I was 2 Raw Crimson Flux short, but I found one ran over to it and did the action to pick it up, even though nothing popped up I got it. Instantly logged off and back on. All good. Then in the Enclave bunker I was 3 caps short to buy the plan to finally upgrade my Urban Underarmor. I drank some Nuka Colas and got it. So everything worked out ok. I think that is a bit of good luck. It could have all turned out terrible but it worked out just fine and my session wasn't completely ruined by bugs.
---
I do and i will! Tx for the location tip.
---
If you don't really know how it works exactly, why do you spread potential misinformation then?
---
No offense, but as much as I hate cheating in games, I also hate when people default to that hive-mind bullshit with spreading unconfirmed rumors. There's too much of that here (and everywhere else tbh) already, why even be that thousandth person who reiterates on that?
---
Really? You enjoy reloading for 5 hours? You'd rather reload for 5 hours than support the devs?
---
Aww buddy. 
---
Ps4 
---
Legendaries as a whole are not, but specific ones are.  
---
Hell looking at WoW, do you know how hard/long it takes to get a raid set for a particular class, for a particular build type, such as restoshammy?  It's part of what drives the AH economy in the game, is how hard/rare items can be to get
---
I have seen one or two in glassed but nothing to write home about unfortunately.  For legendaries with exp you want West Tek, Sugar Grove, Dolly Sods, Harpers Ferry, Generals Steakhouse, Robco, Watoga Streets, Watoga EMS, and Watoga Civic Center.  West Tek, Sugar Grove, Robco, and the Watogas are VERY legend rich areas.
---
Bought one! Looks awesome
---
You need to sacrifice a virgin to Lootcifer for more legendaries 
---
Good tip, ill try that! Wat lvl were u seeing it from them?
---
"The atom shop doesn't work how I think it should so its bad"
---
I don't server hop for 5 hours lol I play the game.  And I do support the devs but I am also not looming for easier way to play a game where they throw loot at you.
---
Bone Hammer is up there. Looks savage, too.
---
total worth it tho right? 
---
I think there is a timer in your eletronic stuff, I never tried using it so i'm not sure how it works but it can probably help you for your decontamination shower issue. I should start doing some experimentation with those things.
---
yeah i saw a post about the owl mask a couple days ago
---
People are dicks
---
Appreciate the patience!
---
Literally everything Mr. Fluffy says.  
---
If you need to call in your buddy who knows about civil war memorabilia I'm your guy
---
Last time I checked, atoms were earned.... we playing the same game?
---
Don't be ridiculous.  This is a video game.  It's rated M for mature.  Those kids are nobody's responsibility but their legal guardian / family, except in times of emergency (the village helps out if the kid's safety is threatened, like falling down a well or something).  Trying to shame someone for "not showing empathy" in a video game like this is just shitty.  Let Bethesda make a separate server that is rated PG or PG-13 and then you can play there with all these kids to your hearts content.  We'll be on the regular servers enjoying the regular M rated version.  Everybody wins!
---
Jesus Christ dude. Nobody cares how much money you make. If you want pay to win go to eBay and give your money to some neck beard duper. 
---
I have had full sets of gear in WoW. And I disagree with their mechanics that attempt to limit with time gating. If I want to grind like crazy and get a full suit of armor in the fastest time possible I should be able to. I shouldn't be held back by artificial barriers.
---
Agreed, or just make the shops carry more plans
---
I'll let you know! I need to save up some caps still but I'll call you when I get set up!
---
Only people defendin this shit are dupers themselves lmao. Dupers broke TOS, which means they earned that ban hammer. 
---
This is like speeding own the freeway at 120 mph. You know it’s wrong. You know you’re affecting other drivers, but man you wanna get home quicker. You only hope there isn’t a cop around the corner to catch your ass with a ticket.
---
Can confirm.  
---
Evening before last at least 4 disconnects within a 2 hour time span.
---
Last evening was the same thing, followed by some funky graphical error (not my card) that rendered certain textures invisible until i went back to camp and logged out for the night - though upon exiting the client the client decided to keep running the background all day today. ran repair before booting up tonight and encountered an infinite load screen when attempting to log into a server.
---
If they didn't want me to run them over they would have stayed in their house. All these care bears acting like running over a couple people is really hurting anyone, do you even realise how many people there are on earth? And let's be real if I wasn't supposed to run people over they would have patched it out so I couldn't do it by now.
---
I've got most of these items.....in Fallout 4 lol
---
Not sure but I got a level 35 explosive bloodied pump from it
---
If anything that means the online interactions could be rated as way more restricted than the posted rating.  Not...the other way around.  
---
Holy shit, very detailed, very awesome, if I could afford gold I'd give it to you. Thanks!!!

Morgantown is a great location for cobalt flux. Check the west and south-west sides and also don't forget the bloodleaf in the river. If you loot every available cobalt flux plant (with the perk card "Green Thumb" equiped or shared from a team-mate) you can walk out with an easy 60+ raw cobalt.
---
No.
---
If some asshole posts it on the internet after finding it, word will get out and they'll fix it, assuming they don't fix it ahead of time.
---
But if YOU post it, you face the chance of being banned or having legal action taken against you if they decided to do so (remember, they don't have to win to make an example of you, they just have to make you lose), and you up the timeframe, giving dupers who might be getting closer to giving up another breath of fresh air.
---
You would not be helping the situation if you do a video or tell someone else about it. The only conceivable reason to do a video outside of wanting to spread this info to the assholes who do it, would be for short lived internet fame, a brief moment of acknowledgement from a thankless and fickle crowd.
---
ITT:  Entitled parent apologists, and people who wuv playing wit kids in a M rated game.  wtf people...
---
I use mine with Starched Genes rank 1 to remove one mutation at a time. It does remove multiple mutations simultaneously without any Starched Genes equipped though.
---
Eh kinda we just server hop anymore.. Not gonna lie though at level 180 im not having much fun anymore lol. Killing the Queen about 20 times a day just to get the same old plans over and over isn't fun
---
Hahaha this was great :)
---
Intersting!  I have never gotten a plan for the Medium NV Scope by find/purchase.  But I can craft it.  I think Ive scrapped maybe 4-5 handmade. 
---
I'd rather give it to the devs.
---
Some people just go on farming runs and sell all of the legendaries they get en masse. 
---
My first guess is that he just sold it because LMGs tend to be crap in this game.
---
Hey Bethesda. 
---
A lot of us hate PvP. We hate that players will just randomly walk up and start blasting us with their duped, 2 shot exploding shotguns while we're standing around at a train station or crafting in the overseer's camp. 
---
We hate that there's a bounty system that somehow creates an incentive for them to team up and attack individuals. 
---
Many of us prefer to wander around exploring how amazingly creative your team is, and occasionally stopping to help other players. 
---
We acknowledge that many players enjoy PvP, but we don't want to fool with those people. ... You implied when Fallout 76 was in development that we wouldn't have to. 
---
It would seem to be a simple matter to create servers where PvP is allowed, and servers where it isn't.
---
It would seem like a good idea to keep players from being able to cross back and forth between servers. For example, saying that a player must go a week without pvp before joining the pacifist servers.  That way, a player couldn't attack someone and flee to safety. 
---
Similarly, if a player were to switch to pacifist servers, he/she should have to stay for a while. 
---
From a programming perspective, it doesn't seem like it would take many lines of code to implement this fix. 
---
Please give it some thought. 
---
I don't get IT
---
Party Boy/Girl basically means “Supreme Buffout has worn off”.
---
NO. Man people. Individual servers go through their own maintenance.
---
well, this was my first time doing 3 at once. it gave me a lil hope
---
The main reason SB are a problem is they most commonly appear out of thin air to rip a new asshole out of people less than level 50. I'm level 26 and today all I did was fast travel to prickets fort and was bombarded by SB blasts the moment I loaded in. I tried killing it but GOD FUCKING DAMN it took forever to get it to like 60 percent health. I ran out of stimpaks, it only landed 3 times, and once when it landed it went straight back fucking up after a literal 2 seconds, so that doesn't really count. I eventually crippled its wing but it still flew. Theres supposed to be a benefit to disabling enemies. Head deals more damage, when crippled it normally lowers enemies accuracy, crippling arms makes their melee weaker and aim worse. Broken legs make them slow. BUT THIS BITCH HAS NO WEAKNESS FROM CRIPPLED LIMBS. Like why Bethesda? But there should be penalties to crippled limbs for crippled limbs, like slower flying with one broken wing, no flying with both, AND ESPECIALLY NO SONIC ATTACKS WITH A CRIPPLED HEAD. Also they need to give SBs attacks the aesthetics of mirelurk king screeches, cause they're transparent.
---
Gotta agree with you there.  I always figured it was something I just didn't get since I see this kinda stuff pretty often in gaming subreddits.  It is weird though, you're right.
---
I mean I still 1 shot 99% of things even with that perk card off. And I don't see this listed anywere btw.
---
And Uranium Fever is the best place to do other stuff and get that meat
---
I've done that with the barn outside of Charleston station. Kept it super minimal so to the untrained eye, the things I added just look like they were always there.
---
Personally, I’d probably try and trade somebody instead of getting rid of it. You could probably get some really nice stuff with it.
---
I don't think the stairs are destructible but honestly I haven't tried much. 
---
No I provided plenty of other reasons as to why I would create a video you just didn’t like them. As far as legal action goes that seems like a horrible pr move especially considering people who have duped since beta and made thousands
---
 I've scrapped about 8 Hand Made Rifles now. Since I got the plans I make and scrap one whenever I can. Got Hardened last time. ;)
---
Wait there's carriages?
---
I was like, heck, anyone could make 20k 5.56 rounds.. Until I realised he was holding 20k ultracite rounds.
---
Can't wait to see this weapon pop up on eBay or something. 😒
---
Well there was still running, it just wasn't sprinting. But yeah. It was slow going
---
I understand that one issue. Maybe they need to differentiate between the weight of the items in the stash vs. the items on the player if there is a difference due to perks. At least that way we can do the math easier on trying to maximize the crap going into the stash box. 
---
Woah didn't know there's a red color hmmmm
---
It's almost like someones not reading what you are writing over and over.

I play on PC with an Xbox controller. There are some buttons that aren't mapped. Like push to talk

I think that would be a great solution.

It took me like ~200 combined character levels to get my first Two Shot, so... enjoy your luck xD
---
You're welcome?
---
I agree, buy them from the market and other players.. make a good trading buddy, maybe a friend, it seems like that’s what the devs wanted, build a hunting, trading, etc. community. 
---
MVPess
---
It is one of the primary mods for the armor.
---
I am unsure which, as I use BoS on mine, which turned it BoS gray.
---
atom shop?
---
Around mid 50s
---
But there was big patch just recently 
---
They didn’t fix that one?!
---
Log off, you're drunk.
---
I'm out an x01 calibrated
---
And a bunch of T-60 mods
---
Kicker is, I keep hundreds of steel to try to avoid this very fucking thing
---
Mmm, that good Saturday Night Shitpost Action
---
Well damn :(
---
Brick/metal plans, doors, lights? 
---
The fact that all of the content is soloable including SBQ proves that is a lie.
---
Bethesda themselves even stated as much.
---
The strengthened mod makes combat armor red. Maybe it does the same for Marine.
---
Well yeah, what else am I supposed to do server hopping for 5 hours.
---
It also only takes 14 bone to repair. :) It isn't best in damage but it is good enough for trash mobs and such. 
---
No patch yet on console.
---
Is most of your game time spent hunting legendaries?
---
I've randomly found a game on a table outside of those cabins at the Whitespring, but I don't think it's a 100% chance since I've found some random magazines on other occasions as well
---
I snipe with the reflex. You don't really have long range shots in this game, and you wouldn't need to take them anyway. It's not exactly Arma.
---
I don't use the gauss because the reflex sight is broken on it.
---
This is a prudish way to assume how adults interact.  And most adults in this game are assuming that others in the game are adults or at least young adults or at least people who accept what they are getting into.  This game is built upon a fantasy of violence, and people will enjoy it accordingly.  Interactions sometimes will happen with the offending person not realizing the other participant is a minor.  To have to first always assume an unknown-to-you player is a minor *just in case* is bullshit, and unnecessary.  What's necessary is the people responsible for said minor need to offer better supervision.  Look, I get it you want to be nice.  But telling others they are assholes if they don't act as nice as you would were you them, in a game (again) build upon a fantasy of violence (seen in: animations, sound effects, audio dialog, actions allowed, realistic weapons, brutal death, mature themes, etc etc) makes you seem really entitled or at least out of touch.
---
You have no point. If people are selling TSEs for X price that's the price they're going for. You think anyone cares if they pinky swear on their dear grammies grave that this TSE they're selling for twenty times regular price is *totally legit* and therefore worth overpaying for something that could easily be a lie.

You don’t need to have a friend in the world. You just message a random in the world, then join his session. If their only fix was to dc nearby people too, they didn’t fix duping.
---
Right on, I can respect that. I get irritated easily by this subject, but I appreciate your understanding. 
---
X-COM could teach them a thing or two.
---
I'm not gonna lie.  You had me at *sexy bear skin*.  
---
That movie is real.
---
This feeling you have right now? Remember it next time you are about to give Bethesda any more of your money in future.
---
Holy shit dude..... damn I can't believe you would do this, you sure showed me. 
---
Is worth check the WS train station as well. 
---
This will haunt my dreams forever.  If they ever make those creepy cutouts be able to move or talk that is the one guaranteed way I will NEVER take your workshop!  Heh, nicely done!  Tell your buddies it's damned impressive and to keep up the good work mate!

Cranberry cobbler is a decent early game substitute until you can craft Cranberry relish. It is significantly cheaper to produce at the cost of 5% reduced xp versus relish. To be clear: Cranberry Relish gives a 10% xp buff and costs 3 wood, 3 boiled water, 3 gourd, 3 cranberries, and 3 sugar to produce 1 cranberry relish. Cranberry cobbler gives a 5% xp buff and costs 1 wood and 1 cranberry to produce 1 cranberry cobbler.
---
It's a bug, just like the NPC robots who randomly die. Seems to happen more frequently around the Whitespring
---
What's the 3rd effect? 
---
Whu. I thought you wrote Dopers and thought, come oh eh', I just wanna play my game my way. ;)
---
I wouldn't be against a PG/PVE only server that was more heavily enforced or moderated, so that people who wanted to could play there.  I feel many MMO's do this so it's reasonable to hope Bethesda would maybe do it too.
---
Haha it was a struggle we had guys come over and try to take it over but after several hours of trial and error we finally got it! Thanks lol!
---
most people knew what you meant
---
https://youtu.be/U1mlCPMYtPk
---
AMERICA FUCK YEAH!!!
---
I found it on PC.
---
Nice hehe.
---
I wish there was a Hecate II Sniper Rifle. A girl can dream.
---
Bs lol, the day that Bethesda actually tracks and bans dupers I’ll give you silver. 
---
nope, beth needs to get better coders
---
the rebuild database wont help at all, i did it earlier this week and still get crashes. reason it crashes is poor coding otherwise every other game on the system would have crashes at times
---
i can put in over 200 hours in single player games and never have a crash, fallout 76 day one pop in the game let it fully install, press play and it instantly gave me a bluescreen crash before anything happened(didnt even boot to a loading screen yet)
---
Stimpak recipe location?
---
Shadowed makes it Black I believe
---
You've never built a wall out of four pencils? 
---
I know I’ve seen the plans for the weapon itself at vendors, probably Watoga Station.
---
(Note: needs Gunsmith 5 to craft)
---
so it is duped right? and the ammo too
---
Anyone have pics of the Winterized PA in 76 or the Marine Armor Helmet.  Not condoning this just.....
---
....for Science you know.
---
I've found the best thing to do is just burn through them, then don't pick up what you won't use. Or a friend/random person in your server that wants them. I'd take your shotgun shells if youre on Xbox. 
---
For sure; I completely agree. I have found this to be extremely annoying, but I was not intending to attack anyone personally here on this forum. Truly, it is the game designers and developers at fault here. Many have suggested that the game should have been more thoroughly tested before releasing a purchasable version. It seems that more and more, video game developers are basically forcing the public to be testers for their new products. I am sure this saves them some money if done correctly. Still that business model is always going to impact the customers/gamers negatively. The whole point of testing for bugs and exploits before releasing into open markets, is to remove as much concern as possible that a game will cause people to become upset or downright outraged. Unfortunately, many people will buy practically anything as long as it is marketed correctly. I am a very curious person as well, sometimes to my own detriment. :/
---
did you get in a truck accident mid sentence?
---
I am working so hard on getting better at this, but it seems as though either...
---
1: get mobbed so fast when alone that I accidentally kill the legendaries before they regen, or
---
2: I successfully kite them out, start popping &amp; taking my time, only to have someone else run over &amp; one-shot them all &amp; run off. I am really struggling with this current state of Whitesprings.
---
I’m new to Fallout 76 so I’m trying to understand this whole duping thing. What does TSE stand for? And is this why there’s always a crowd of level 100+ dudes crowding Whitespring?
---
Woosh 
---
I'm onPC, and I've been trying to burn through my shotgun and 38, but at this point, I might as well swap perks to use them or find a mod for a 38 receiver for literally any gun
---
The very first interaction with my post is a down vote and the person doesn't have enough decency to even comment as to why. This is just another shining example of how Reddit can be ineffective at measuring and analysis.   
---
* Do you think this post shouldn't have been made in FO76?
---
* Did you find something disagreeable with the content of my post?
---
* It was a very long post, does this mean you at least disagree with 50% or more of it?
---
* Do you believe I've reached the wrong conclusion?
---
Then I'd also like to ask you:
---
* What field and industry do you work in?
---
* Do you develop products, or do you develop services?
---
* What level of involvement do you have with market analysis and research?
---
* Do you spend time with or work on a product development team?
---
* What opinions or experience are you able to share with me that influenced your down vote?
---
Like I said, it was a store.
---
I went to one last night down near watoga, buggy and slow as fuck, so I just stuck out a bit to mop up the hordes while the higher levels where going at the queen and running in and hitting people with stimpaks. Then at about half health Bam blue screen thanks for coming cunt.
---
Is power attack worth for those?
---
At least you only lost those! Today while crafting new x01 PA I put on 2 calibrated shocks and a medic pump and 2 Optimized Bracers and then hard crashed. Log back into less mats, no mods, and no PA. 
---
Is this fixed yet?
---
I have seen some great bridge camps, I want to try one out eventually but for now a simple, easy to relocate camp is where I am at while leveling and saving caps.
---
That's how it works actually, you can have one of every rank of every perk. So a t3 perk actually has 6 points you can put into it
---
It's locked but someone's going to call you a duper just for having more than one.
---
Shops are going to carry more plans patch notes.
---
Yeah, I had one repeatedly fragging my camp, too. Made  like 500 caps killing him, repeatedly. But, my camp is in a low level area. And I was a higher level than him.Imagine his surprise when I showed up and smoked him with a rocket launcher.
---
But seriously, this is griefing. If I weren't an already established, and just starting out, it would have been more than an annoyance. Something needs to be done about it.
---
Not sure, but i believe "Display Cases" unlocked this set for me.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/ifQbY5y.png](https://i.imgur.com/ifQbY5y.png)
---
Shops are going to carry more plans.
---
Fortnite skins range from $8-$20. Pretty much the same as 76
---
Start using the reduced durability damage to armor and weapons religiously. Like, if you're not running explosive, run 5 for gun or 5 for melee. Run 3 points in the agility perk.
---
If you have the luck to play with on the fly, get the armor and weapon chance on repair perks. It can proc pretty heavily in just a few area clears.
---
I've not once had to look around for Ballistic. Literally like cloth and leather for me, I just know not to bulk it and sell it. Screws can be rough, but again the power armor low durability damage perk is sooo nice. They're a focused pickup for me and I seem to have decent luck in keeping supply.
---
I barely have to repair, and when I do, The power armor trait makes it cheap or the weapon artisan trait makes it cheap.
---
Unless I'm on a real multi step endeavor like crafting a full new suit of PA, I haven't struggled with materials beyond forgetting to pick up wind chimes for spare aluminum or something.
---
Yaaas these were my fav in NV
---
What does earning atoms have anything to do with buying plans from the atom shop. Cosmetics is totally different froma leg up on the other guy cause you can drop some cash.
---
You are an absolute legend. Thank you for this. 
---
What do you do when youve chainsawd a few mobs and your overcharge is half drained? the damage falls way off. do you suck it up until you can repair it again?
---
I was actually waiting for that one lol but would kinda make the post pointless. Kinda figured must  be luck just curious to what others results were.
---
Is it any better since patch? It seemed like the notes seemed to do a lot of energy weapon work. Don't have one that I was used to to compare now though. 
---
&gt;ATX\_ENTM\_CAMP\_StashBox\_PrincessCastle
---
100% what I am most interested in!  Im probably over-imagining a gorgeous dog house sized glittery Princess Castle that I can place all over my camp but...I can dream!
---
Add perk cards and ammo, and PA max durability to the Atom shop too. Yes, that was sarcasm. 
---
vendors just kinda suck in general. they’re overpriced and you’re under priced. i just drop it cause it’s hard to sell them. 
---
It can be played solo, doesn't mean it is a solo game.
---
Some of the abilites apparently only proc off power attack, vampiric for instance doesnt proc on rippers unless you power attack and for that you want the increase swing speed.  I would most likely just go deeper into damage to rack up faster kills, I just wanted to illustrate above that the build changes depending on the weapon, no matter what you need as much str as you can get because that directly increase ALL of their damage, the perks are more fluid, especially for the drill or chainsaw which gets no direct damage increase from anything in the STR tree.
---
Oh shit i didnt even realize . i went to edit the post but i changed my mind and i guess i left some in
---
I have noticed this too. Especially at the whitesprings and other places 
---
How often do pixels have to change to prevent burn in?
---
How readable is it at 80-90% opacity? Would that be enough to prevent burn in?
---
You've accessed this terminal? Where did you get the password?
---
25% crash rate when I respawn and the game jsut isn't able to load all the assets or something and shits itself. RIP all my junk drops
---
I feel like those black tables are unlocked from the very beginning. I've had them since I built my very first camp. 
---
You may get server disconnects but use console players get game crashes
---
I love it! Haven't built in a multi structure/multi addon area. Love pre existing locations myself, just usually go crazy on one piece. That's really cool dude. Really feels like that's all your little block.
---
good question... I thought it was a bug, but still happening randomly to me too
---
Think the only dupers getting banned ATM are streamers who are doing it on stream.  I'd love to find out that the non-tarded dupers are also getting axed.
---
I usually farm up 6-8 chainsaws, over repair them all and use the top repair ones for tougher stuff, lower end ones for every day farming and running around or when lower levels proc low level mobs in high level areas.  When they drop to about 125% or so I just drop them and go get another one.  There are four guaranteed spawn locations (clarkesburg hardware store, to the west of top of the world in a small unmarked camp, bed and breakfast SE of whitespring, and ranger headquarters) and not many folks are picking them up as anything other than an oddity so I can replace them super easy.
---
I've got so many pieces of chameleon wood armour..
---
OP seems like a simple jack
---
I would consider the harvesting tools part of those skins, considering they're developed, released, and promoted as a set. They're an extra $8. 
---
Happens to me often as well. When I log in or spawn after a fast travel, I can hear something drop. Usually I see this. My technical data. Unable to pick it up though. Checking my inventory, I still have mine, so seems that it is just a visual glitch. Nothing is really lost.
---
I would build an auto combat shotgun for that ammo, then a standard pipe rifle if you can't find a 38 receiver combat rifle. 
---
Im building a spreadsheet keeping track of all Plans [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j\_InJD8HVYE-YIW9S2kc\_0B\_VqgQPCMtQQJssP9NOF0/edit#gid=1801980623](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j_InJD8HVYE-YIW9S2kc_0B_VqgQPCMtQQJssP9NOF0/edit#gid=1801980623) 
---
I want to turn it into a check list for Plans so I quit buying stuff I already have.  Do you know if there is an updated database list I can work from?  Im using this database   [http://incendar.com/fallout76\_plans.php](http://incendar.com/fallout76_plans.php)
---
Id love to see a list of all Atomic Shop items past and present too to add to the spreadsheet if anyone knows where I can grab it :)
---
Also - YEAH PRINCESS CASTLE I ALREADY LOVE YOU WHATEVER YOU ARE!  :) 
---
Gonna have to try this. Next time I'm.not playing.
---
lolz
---
This happened to me twice before. Don't think it's new.
---
Well that explains a lot of my salt I had with this game today 
---
There’s black, white, blue , green and red
---
Happened to me too! I just thought it was a glitch 
---
there is a player icon in the shop of a vault boy with tank legs, it looks straight up cropped from a perk card, with some half cropped text at top right. i wonder if it's just my install showing it wrong, because it's really sloppy if it's true...
---
You did the right thing.
---
Message to the- GOURRRRRMAAAAANNNNDDDSSSSS
---
Go conquer the HZ-21 Disposal Field for a couple of hours, that's how I farm nuclear material. Just remember to take a hazmat suit.
---
I deleted and reinstalled and haven’t crashed fighting a SBQ since
---
Please explain this?? I am very sure I will find your opinion amusing. 
---
Yep this game has a litany of problems but instead of fixing them they decide to take away the one good thing the players had. 
---
No more farming the whitesprings
---
Looks cool. My base quality matches the landscape around it.
---
Do you still have him?
---
you going to take the cobalt? 
---
Just like donuts, suddenly gone and appear straight back at the waist - also impossible to get rid of 
---
Hmm maybe try switching characters for a day 
---
Or die and have someone collect your bag, maybe it’s only not visible to you 
---
dc, stuck on terminal and power armor, other than than lovely game
---
besides the one inside 76 and grognak, the other are random iirc. farm magazine spawns.
---
DEFINITELY need to check it this out tomorrow. I always wondered how it worked. The small
---
Purifier provides what? 5/hr? But whenever I’d return to it, I’d only find 2 to transfer. I’ll post here to confirm. 
---
Same here I thought it was strange but figured it would be fixed at some point 
---
Yep... Chest usually
---
Also chainsaw durability is MUCH less of an issue as you get the damage higher and higher.
---
More damage = less ticks to kill the enemy, so it lasts much longer.  With 3-4 chainsaws I can farm hard for 2-3 hours no problem.  1 Chainsaw per SBQ about too.
---
Same with using the shredding minigun melee bash trick, the more damage you can get it to do the longer it lasts.
---
Is it the same with flux ? Cause I been noticing it for flux 
---
The Happening was so bad
---
Lol
---
&gt; and glitched out bobblehead
---
I am not looking to argue. I stated, "Weapons that instakill, because of TSE, **and glitched out bobbleheads**  usage are cheap. Not even fun to play like this in my opinion." I am not saying that TSE weapons are the only cause of problems. In my opinion, they are too overpowered, but that is not the point I was trying to make originally. When a person manages to take advantage of the mechanics to the degree that they can 1 shot kill a scorchbeast queen, the developers obviously didn't intend that. Also, as someone else mentioned, it ruins it for other people for more than one reason. For one, people have to get at least one shot on an enemy for it to count for them as a kill. If someone walks up and one shots everything, others in the area are not able to participate. Not to mention all the bullshit involved with pvp because of peoples ridiculously glitched stats. Then there's a problem with the item diversity in-game. I don't care if the original poster is tired of hearing about TSE weapons, or if it triggers you when someone mentions it. This is a prevalent topic of debate for many people atm, and for good reason.
---
Do you have the card equipped which makes it lighter?
---
Also the scout gasmask. It only covers the face, i should be allowed to wear a hat as well. You can wear a hat with the normal gas mask, why not thw scout one?
---
Supposebly its just the game catching up and no ammo is lost from what I've read ppl say but I swear I see me losing ammo.
---
125c at the Modus Medical Terminal at the Whitespring Bunker. May have to do some enclave quests to gain access. 
---
You are 100% right! Remove these OP weapons from the game and the gameplay suddenly becomes 10x better. 
---
The biggest issue with F76 atm is the existence of these guns. Removing them from pvp entity would also be dream come true
---
Oh, you're probably right. My newer level 15 character has them too.
---
No, another reason children should not be in adult games.  Next question
---
because you are a clumsy fool, and fix up your holes in pockets
---
I'm sorry but I have to disagree with your statement about power armor based on my own personal experience. Power armor is 100% not needed for any part of the game. If you disagree please voice your concerns in a reply or a new thread and I'm sure someone else or myself can help you overcome whatever challenge you feel you can't without power armor.
---
Blueprint it, store the parts, place the blueprint. It sucks.
---
https://giphy.com/gifs/wmuqpmtGeVv1K
---
In Skyrim? 
---
I'm pretty sure it is always the last ammo you used. I dont think it's actually taking ammo from you.
---
Maybe just the ammo you've expended in the last 10 secs or so.
---
Well shit. I didn't realize it was that easy, or cheap.
---
Met one in 60 hours.  Switched servers and was back on task in 30 seconds.
---
Most of the outrage should be at Bethesda, not the hackers. If people can cheat, they will. Its terrible that they would release an online only game in the state that it is in.  People in this subreddit are not critical enough of what Bethesda has done.  This has really been the worst game launch that I have ever witnessed, with all the cheating, people's ticket info including addresses getting leaked to everyone, all the crashes.  
---
Its beyond frustrating, considering if they had just waited to release the game when it was actually ready, it would probably be critically acclaimed.
---
too bad no one will see this in person as everything is lost when you log off 
---
&gt;Learns a new big sounding word and tries to sound clever using it but looks like an idiot for not knowing what it really means.
---
I am amazed at the title and what must have entailed to make “batheseda” happen
---
Very well done!  Best thing we've got until they name stuff right in game.
---
I tried hard to give FO76 a try but after the lame launch and the kick in the guts from having shelled over money for the tricentennial edition (which had a handful of crappy skins and nothing else) to see the price drop by almost half days after launch, I've given up
---
I've stopped playing
---
I'll not buy another Bethesda title again
---
I won't give Bethesda another cent of my hard earned money
---
I feel let down
---
I loved 4 and will probably play that if I feel like going back to the franchise
---
I've tried complaining directly to Bethesda but no response
---
These nothing burger patches aren't going to change the upset I feel
---
I need more than this if they want to see me back playing and even more for paying
---
It's been an absolute disgrace and a horrible way to ruin a good franchise
---
It deserves a 2/10 rating
---
I hope this message gets through to them
---
Lmfao they don’t come with the sling and you don’t have to buy them. I’ve bought prolly 10 skins in Fortnite I’ve bought 2 harvesting tools. Plus Fortnite has a battle pass that you buy once and if you don’t spend the currency it gives them you can buy every battle pass for free afterwards and that’s 5 skins+ on top of multiple gliders, emotes , and harvesting tools for free. Not of the skins, pick axes, or gliders have any competitive advantage and when you’re shooting you can’t even see the pickaxe or glider so why’re completely necessary  
---
The obvious and most likely explanation is that they obviously knew Two-Shot was going to be an extremely desirable 1★ effect and the same with Explosive for a 2★ effect and made them the least likely to appear in their respective effect tier slot so naturally getting both of what are the least likely to appear effects at the same time is naturally going to make them incredibly rare without needing any other crazy thing going on behind the scenes to explain it.
---
I'm glad you're enjoying it. I've been enjoying it as well. I pre-ordered knowing full well what to expect--an incomplete game full of bugs. But I am also hopeful that the game will end up where I expect it to be in due time. People bash the bugs, but when there's no "Unofficial Game Patch, " you HAVE to know what to expect! That's why the single player games, including TES, are so loved. The community fixed the game and provided options...any gamer has to realize that. It truly takes a special person to love what is offered and accept the flaws, but continue to roll with it. Kind of like a marriage...
---
I am pleased that the community is laying it on Bethesda to fix their damn bugs. They joke about it, but it's a serious issue they need to realize can sink their ivory ship if they don't get it together. We can all be friends, but when it comes to business, BGS better realize shit gets real, real quick. It's high time Bethesda stops high-fiving every time they walk past each other in the office and take care of business.
---
Anyhoo, I like the story and think it's unique for a Fallout game. I play 100% solo and have enjoyed it quite a bit. I hope it doesn't go out like Mass Effect: Andromeda. That game was actually pretty decent, but it needed more content to save it. I think it goes to show that rushing a (unfinished) product to market won't end well. That "strategy" worked for a small period of time, but no longer.
---
I just died, was like 15 feet away from my junk bag, and got disconnected. 40 screws, 30 ultracite, too much wood, gears, and steel to count... all fucking lost. I think if there was a Bethesda employee in my house right now I'd slap them into next week. Fuck.
---
Great help it is, to finally be able to easily tell what we do and don't have; recognize the names of the plans we need. Much appreciated! &lt;3
---
This happens all the time, specially a while after nukes fade
---
A head start in what? You still need perks for turrets and crafting mats for everything else 
---
No sorry I lost him, then I froze
---
How overdramatic can you be?
---
And if you use them for pvp, you're even worse. The game would be so much better without these guns being usable in pvp
---
Grey? Mine turns Blue.
---
Yeah :( we destroyed it all and had a little battle before we all logged. I’ll update it with videos some time
---
It's just server lag, the game fixing your inventory when it finally catches up. 
---
Bethesda with misleading advertising?  Well I never...
---
It was not. You could look in their inventory at most. It's been proven that it couldn't be done  time after time.
---
You are not loosing any ammo, as u said, its just a log of things that normally shouldnt display, but in some cases, ie. picking flowers causes it to show, the ammo being "removed" is always the last type u used, and will be from whatever previous gunfight u had.
---
Ok man. 
---
Here's the thing. You have to do something, for the sake of the internet.
---
You know how when your computer fucks up, and you're scouring the internet for people with a similar issue, and you find the one guy that seems to have exactly your problem?
---
Then he responds with nevermind fixed it?
---
This will trend on google my friend. I plan on sitting through the game in the near future. 
---
What did it take to get through the spot worth coming to the internet to figure out, where there was 0 information? You hold cutting edge knawledge reference info for an ENTIRE GAME STRAT (within a game). That's a big deal.
---
flamer on the chainsaw is the best looking mod in the game imo. the thing is a goddamn deadly flashlight
---
This looks like shit.
---
It's Perfect!
---
If you are on XBX1 I’ll sell you the recipe for 125c
---
Right on thank you for the more desriptive answer mostly have gotten ppl just say no you are not 😆
---
Modding is a disaster on a LOT of community trade networks. Can't imagine endorsing one or another would be a good idea, even if one has a good track record.
---
having access to the high tier water purifiers, having all of the crafting stations, being able to build your base however you please from the get-go. You could just be that guy and invest in home defense and whatever else as your first perks and then go farm exp with turrets on your base. Materials are super easy to get either way.
---
Tldr 
---
do you have junk reduction perks?
---
Probably a combination of my garbage monitor and vision.
---
dont you have to use scrap to rebuild a blueprint?
---
Marine tac helmets for sure 
---
Gauss rifle is the weapon you're looking for. Hits like a truck and now that it's affected by rifle perks it hits like an even bigger truck.
---
It's also beyond stupid efficient. The ammo is cheap to make, and the durability lasts for fucking ever (because everything dies in one hit) if you can get an anti armor one with instigating or explosive (can instigating and anti armor roll on the same gun?) then it will probably do more damage than any AMR or 50 cal rifle ever will.
---
You can also suppress it for some ungodly reason to benefit from the suppressed weapons sneak attack perks. 
---
Which chems?
---
We get both on pc....
---
I'm pretty sure it used to work against friends and they removed it, since people had accidentally blocked their friends and then could never unblock or play with them again. 
---
They had updated it so that items will pull from your stored before crafting it, but I don't know if that only works with individual items or if it would work for blueprints. Might be better to not risk it
---
Same here. Cheap to make and sell for a pretty cap
---
ftw
---
You're literally admitting in this post that you just assume everyone making a complaint about the game fucked something up on their own. That's complete ignorance on your part.
---
I'm bitching because I am not the type of person to scrap shit I don't want to scrap. I don't drop weapons and complain when they disappear or fall through foundations.
---
What I do complain about is when Bethesda tells us the disappearing base issue was resolved, and then weeks later my base vanishes, and I'm not provided with a single in-game prompt of any kinda whatsoever informing me of such. I'm given no prompt to change to a new server at all.
---
Instead, I'm met with multiple disconnects (with stable 100+ mbps internet) within the span of 60 minutes, as is my friend from several cities over. During one of these disconnects, my base vanished, and a gun I was attempting to give him vanished.
---
So yeah, I'm going to complain about those things, being that I'm someone who knows how to play the game and isn't full of shit. So I can tell you these things directly, but see you just end up saying it's my fault, so there's no getting anywhere with someone as ignorant as you.
---
Glowing mass would actually be covered by Food and Drink weight reduction (Thru-Hiker in Agility tree). If you have that equipped it only affects items on your person, not going to reduce the weight once you stash it. 
---
That seems to be exactly what happens.  Seen it several times.  Scorched, supers, yao guais.
---
This is incredibly helpful. Sending it to everyone I play with ❤️

Possible to find fusion cores over 100% my luck is 15, but never noticed if fusion cores dropped better.
---
The gauss rifle takes like a second to charge. The hunting rifle bolt cycling animation takes about the same time without a rapid receiver. 
---
Plus the Gauss Rifle does like 600 damage with a fully charged shot. Who cares if the hunting rifle can get more shots off. The Gauss rifle only needs one. 
---
If you found a TSE gauss rifle then it will eclipse any legendary hunting rifle by miles. 
---
I'm still looking for a Two Shot, Explosive web shooter myself. 
---
Where's the plans for it?
---
My theory is that they applied a bandaid fix to prevent duping and all these CTDs or lock ups are a direct result of it.
---
Others on here have pointed out it has something to do with the game taking filling up either our cache, memory or page file. Thus causing these lockups.
---
Yeah I have multiple combinations where sometimes I'll use one of the lower onesit gives you a lot more flexibility when you want to start messing around with your build-out.
---
It’ll likely be up on YouTube sometime this week anyway. 
---
Dunno sorry I had to buy mine 
---
Honestly, it would be so useful.

There was a bug that was patched a while ago where when you ranked up a perk card, you got the ranked up one but kept the originals too.

My hardened 308 hunting rifle does 113 damage.  With a .50 receiver it does 97.  For comparison, .308 bullets have a mass ranging from 8 to 11 grams or so, while .50 bullets have a mass between 42 and 52 grams. Both have similar muzzle velocities.

Get a friend and have him put his camp where yours is, if he/she doesnt want to move thier camp just have them use an alt. Once you buddy puts thier camp where yours is supposed to spawn then join that server. You'll get that message about your camp not being able to be placed and everything will store as blueprints. Have your friend leave the world so you can place your camp back down in the same spot and can place them as blueprints. Your house should be one whole blueprint by itself including all the stuff inside it.

You on PS4? I've get extra shells and 45.
---
yep. Im going through all the parts in the menu thinking, "why is there a port-a-potty if I can run indoor plumbing everywhere."
---
Saved. Plan - pictures

Ultracite pistols are a special exception, they're made special and use normal cells. I think the brotherhood has something to do with this kind of technology.
---
I feel you. Me and about 15 other players were fighting the scorch queen. After spending about 2k bullets and 15 stimpacks, we finally killed her. I tried to loot her corpse but it was loading. After 2 minutes i saw all the loot aaand... the corpse despawns
---
And you prefer the chainsaw over Mr Buzzy or Ripper? i want to use my 3 star ripper a lot but its constantly low damage after 5 mins. your chainsaw stash sounds reasonable for me considering my camp proximity to a chainsaw spawn. ty
---
As long as we can leave the chat when we don't want to see nonstop scrolling...
---
I can almost guarantee any item that was a limited release will show up again. Especially the holiday items.
---
Thank you you defending me. I am honestly super confused over why these people are jumping on me, as if I've said something completely outlandish or offensive.
---
I have a legit complaint, and yes I use sarcasm in my post, but definitely no exaggeration of any kind. Shit is still fucked in this game. Do I enjoy it? Yes, aspects of it. But I also don't enjoy that things are fucked that they are telling us isn't fucked.
---
Do these people think that a valid complaint means we hate the game or something?
---
I made a suggestion its built into your pipboy if you don't wanna look at it just don't click the tab.
---
^ This
---
You're fantastic and that's a great sheet! Any chance you've got anything similar for food/drink/chem recipes?
---
I'm working from a spreadsheet very similar to yours, but the only comprehensive tab I have so far is weapon mods. You can see the current state here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14OtWjBJAkQX652kjizRzHYsUldICEzNDCK1HB3E13iM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14OtWjBJAkQX652kjizRzHYsUldICEzNDCK1HB3E13iM/edit?usp=sharing)
---
That includes both weapon mods you learn from scrapping as well as mods learned from plans, and all mods are categorized by type. The rest of the tabs, so far, are basically just lists of what I've found since I started keeping track, but I'll be filling that out thanks to yours and OP's work :D
---
Credit for the initial work on the weapon mods goes to [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a5pbsr/every\_weapon\_mods\_learn\_chance/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a5pbsr/every_weapon_mods_learn_chance/).

My favorite is when I log in while wearing Excavator Power Armor and get an additional 200 carry weight as opposed to the usual 100.
---
Say Hi to Chally the moo-moo for me

Post saved :)

Thanks for this!

Crafted ammo. Have 600+ steel. Game prioritised scrapping my X-01 Calibrated shock and a bunch a t-60 mods over my scrap steel
---
Look how upset you're getting, kiddo
---
Go throw a tantrum to someone who cares
---
113, one two shot, two explosives, three vampires, two bloody, two instigating, two furious, two anti-armor, several of these on silly stuff like wrenches.  Oh, and a bunch of junk like hunters wood armor.
---
"Stick em up! Ha...ha...ha...just kidding."
---
Everyone saying "it's only junk" has never had to repair their decontamination shower. Stable flux is a pain. 
---
Also, it seems cheaper to walk up to each item and repair than use the "repair all" feature. 
---
Yep! Or if you don’t want to go to the Mire, I’ve had both the Witch and Skelton Trick or Treaters spawn on the road directly east of Uncanny Caverns
---
Oh wow, this is very good info to know, thank you!
---
I do have a checklist for food/drink/chem recipes in my Notes so far but not in a spreadsheet yet.  These databases appear to be from December and I am trying to find a current DB.
---
TSEs just need to die. Seriously. PVP is a joke when crap like these guns exist. There is little to no defense against a TSE. 
---
Any work around for repairing them back to 200 after they are used up a bit but over 100
---
Sentry bots inside the Whitesprings bunker, IIRC.
---
Well the DU scrap should be as a result of spent or even scrapped nuclear material. Used for crafting DU ammo (100% AP but not DU armor) and DU armor. Though I must say my irl experience of DU is that it is really heavy.
---
I got a Furious .50cal with exploding shots that I use when my friends and I take on the queen. While doing so I got a Junkies exploding .50cal
---
You also may be in a situation where you picked it up, read it, knew it, game froze or got DCed and have to read it again.....
---
I had to read it again....
---
Bethesda please!
---
PC - Playing on ASUS ROG G752 laptop. Load times have at least tripled since the last time we've played. Game crashed immediately as soon as a nuke launched (within about 5 minutes of starting the game) I thought the patch was supposed to address crashing, load times and stability. Apparently Bethesda fixes bugs by making them easier for more players to reproduce them :(
---
Thanks, I hate it.

The Mire (near the river) is good for cobalt. Blood leaf becomes cobalt. There's a good amount of violet too from the Strangler pods. 
---
You all assume this isn't just another experiment 
---
Just play the game.  Jesus Christ some of you whine way too much on here.
---
I've stopped on two separate occasions for lengthy sessions of just listening to this bot. It's my favorite so far. Did you know he whistles too?!
---
Because I know some dupers personally. I know they have duped TSE weapons to oblivion because they have told me so. And they are also the type of people who constantly fuck with other players. I know the fuck with other players because they have told me that too.

A guy I know was banned, he is not a YouTuber. May be he was manually reported, but he was banned for duping.

Aka you have nothing and bitching about nothing. Okay a different game 
---
I like non-Whitesprings nukes. Everyone spreads out, and you can explore and kill in peace. 
---
Last nuke I was in was nuked Mire, and there was a nuke at Whitesprings at the same time so I had the whole zone to myself. The launcher didn't even show up, he was at Whitesprings too.

Because sometimes I swear they need to clean uo their act.

Send it to juicehead or a youtuber with some pull with Bethesda who won't show it off.

100% agree. Its a pain trying to put things in your stash and juggle junk you may or may not use and find you have to really declutter just to keep a couple cool items you may want to use
---
I just want a "That Gun". 
---
And craftable weapon repair kits. 
---
OMG shut up already.  You should have told that kid to get off the game.   This is what's wrong with parents/adults now a days.  They sugar coat everything and don't make corrections.  Talk about "accepting the reality" that kids are on this game but you're willing to ignore the reality people don't give a shit lol.  What a waste of time.  Why I replied I don't know but I did so might as well post.  Bye.
---
I mean, ya, but can you make me a deathclaw gauntlet or what mr. fancy pants.
---
you keep using that word, i do not think it means what you think it means
---
I was around level 70 when I found them--are they level-gated?
---
...but underarmor fits and should stack.
---
Legendary weapons didn't become a thing until Fallout 4. Was fine for a single player game, but a pretty serious mistake for an online multiplayer, IMO. Full disclosure: I own some high damage two shot explosive weapons. Bethesda can have them. I'd be cool with losing them if everyone else lost their too.
---
Bethesda has nothing to do with it. It's a sacred tradition from Fallout 1 and Fallout 2.
---
I've also bought the pre-war locker from the Watoga train station.  Twice, lol.
---
It’s something I found on my own randomly so doubtful
---
the .50 AE is a pistol round. They're talking about .50 cal rifle rounds.  Huuuge difference. 
---
had this happen to me a couple of times.  Supremely uncool :(
---
I've got killed an innocent in this game yet but you're making me want to get a set of raider armor right now.   
---
This is probably the reason none of these are plantable crops in either 4 or 76.  Silt beans are one of the only things that I'd like to be able to plant which(I'm 90% sure) aren't part of a chem recipe.
---
I did this with reflective plates once. Nowhere near as bad as calibrates shocks but it was early and it hurt
---
From your comment history, you're a duping cheater trying to justify his actions. Your actions affect everyone, not only in that server but the wider community. Stop being a willfully ignorant jerk. 
---
Welcome to the DEA. Duping Enforcement Agency 
---
When this happens you are just catching them before they get a chance to disperse due to server lag.  They spawn in a close group like that then start moving about once you enter the cell, sometimes it takes them awhile to actually start moving (they lag).  3 SB happens every now and then, I think its a random thing, I've been jumped by them nowhere near fissures on occasion, seems to be 1-3.  The 3s are usually the most memorable because it used to be such a pita or a run/server hop thing.
---
I would love that. I'm a heavy weapons build and have wanted a good minigun forever but have yet to find one even worth using. Lol
---
The one at Grafton Dam is related to a quest you receive from the nanny-bot at the Toxic Valley water park. I don't know if it only spawns during the quest but it'll be inside the dam facility, next to a Grognak magazine and some camping gear, if I recall correctly.
---
Try the NAR Repair Yard inside the small building there on a table. Think that’s where mine spawned. It CAN be something else though. Think other Marine armor plans can spawn
---
i see 5 people in the pic! (awesome pic)
---
How was it proven?
---
I got downvoted heavily for saying its not the dupers  lol
---
haha i was excluding me 😅 
---
They mean X-Com 95%.
---
When I look at all the mistakes, mechanically and technologically, bethesda repeated as if they're the first company to ever to an online game..
---
It probably just involves some fiddling with wireshark and packet injection.
---
oic.  so 5 amazing people!  well done!
---
AWH thank you 
---
The negative effects are supressed for the length of the serum. The mutation is permanent. 
---
Losing 7 special stats in PA is kinda sad. 
---
That's not the problem, it's the lack of QA on the patches.
---
Probably repairing one piece of armor.
---
I've done the same thing (in a spreadsheet) and added up all the weights of my items in the stash.  They total 500.8 lbs but my stash says it's at 609.  Are there other items to track for stash limit?  For instance, does the weight of your CAMP items add into the total.  I do not have any stored items.
---
He turned up when I was defending a workshop while the Mire was nuked the other day. Just running around normally, Chally must've popped some Rad-X. 
---
that's not really that big a deal, I'd vendor that.  Doesn't suit my build, I don't really like trading, just get it gone.
---
Sunday bros cabin next to Harper's ferry has a plan spawn on the barrels in shed. If it's there it's almost always a random marine plan
---
Took a snap shot so when these next updates settle in and I’m not getting disconnected I’ll fully enjoy these thanks 
---
I'd also point out that loot crates are completely random. At least with buying the weapons whether they use caps or real money, people know exactly what they're getting.
---
If you didn't sell it but want to, I'd buy it for some caps. I'm on PC. I'm not implying you should sell to me. Just offering in case you want to get rid of it. Especially if it's legit and not duped 😁
---
Help you how? Get better friends? 
---
100 caps is chump change. He'll make it back easy.
---
Even if they just added silt beans, pumpkins, ginseng and starlight berries, that would be really great.  I can only think of a couple locations with ginseng plants offhand.
---
~~the mutation is permanent~~
---
If you equip starched genes. No starched genes perk means you can cure them with radaway / showers
---
They last forever if you have starched genes
---
When I get home ( Can't pull up videos at work) I'll post the video links of people attempting to "do" this for ya
---
I'd prefer the removal of TSE weapons, and the introduction of ammo types to fill the gap. Removes the rng Elements if we are able to craft explosive ammo. Also makes the dupers weapons obsolete overnight.
---
Frankly I was surprised tse made it through the first l level of alpha testing. They make any other weapon useless. 
---
I like the idea that when I put my character to rest and start a new one, I start totally fresh. Only build with crappy wood, only use a bed without a blanket. I just got out of the vault, I haven't been a mile from Vault 76. Why should I be able to build a decontamination shower or a fusion generator, or even brick walls? 
---
Just a roleplay thing for me, I guess. Everything from the Atomic shop will carry over, so I guess you'll have decoration if you've unlocked anything. 
---
Meh, it does half the dps of Rifles (which also are good in VATS) while having perk issues (AGI has too much good stuff).
---
Home defence is level 22, and turrets are unlocked with the perk and not a plan, so no. I get your point about water and generators, but you can get them at level 2 if you just walk to the cache, so again, no. 
---
I added your sheet to my Plan sheet Im trying to use as a checklist when purchasing things.  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j\_InJD8HVYE-YIW9S2kc\_0B\_VqgQPCMtQQJssP9NOF0/edit#gid=1801980623](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j_InJD8HVYE-YIW9S2kc_0B_VqgQPCMtQQJssP9NOF0/edit#gid=1801980623) 
---
Not sure how I will integrate it yet but credited you and pointed to your spreadsheet sheet at the top of the sheet called 'weapon mods from scrapping'
---
I have all my doors open, why bother locking anything?  I did lock my outhouse, just for giggles. 
---
but thats only equivalent to a nicotine patch
---
Anyone on?
---
Error, smalltalk entry not found.
---
Look up how much a standard thompson smg weighs.  It's something like 12 lbs unloaded.  50 rounds of .45acp has got to be at least 8 lbs.  Those are really heavy bullets.  The reason the weapon is so controllable is the weight.
---
I really wish that the duration of alcohol effects would increase with the effects themselves when you have Party Boy/Girl equipped. 
---
Paying to win in any format is garbage. 
---
We've all heard "kill em all and let God sort em out," but sometimes Gutsies will also say "Kill em all! God will understand." 
---
Level 60 and never thought to do this :(
---
He hasn’t even reached the point where he gets server disconnects while fighting the queen/s  or scraps his jet pack mods for materials?
---
Maybe it’s for the better or your friend will blow a blood vessel - fallout 76 is full of rage inducing design choices 
---
I've definitely walked into people's camps thinking they were part of the world. This is awesome. I especially love the port-a-potty.
---
Not exactly the same, but build a campfire, place plant on it. Weird, but it works. I too would love plots, but do grow a few plants on one of my balconies. *Original source: another redittor who discovered it.*
---
For real. I spent 900 on fancy tables from a fucking golf course lol
---
The one that frustrates me is that in the second or two that it takes to calculate hit chance it floats at 0%. I don't know how many times I've fired and missed simply because I'm faster than the game is.
---
I've noticed some of the walls extend their texture differently and so it can make things look strange when set into them. I really don't think this is some conspiracy. In the atomic shop it's on a wood wall, in your image it's on the wharehouse wall. Try to replicate the atomic shop picture and place it flanked by wood. 
---
Don’t think that’s possible
---
Just because people one shot stuff doesn't make them a duper. Your anger is misplaced.
---
Lumberjack Protection definitely made me laugh the hardest. That and the venderbot that calls you a chump.
---
\&gt;  two weeks ago and didn’t receive and feedback from it 
---
That would make me release it. It's time bethesda ups their game, indie games have better transparency, communication and care. They need to learn a lesson that we're not in the 90s anymore for the sake of better products for everyone.
---
Not sure where you’re getting “level 22” from, because I’m pretty sure there’s no level requirement for unlocking perks, it just depends on which one you choose and when.
---
Duped or not how much is it.
---
I have a feeling the quest hasn't ended yet Bethesda haven't said anything about this so I believe the mission may carry on it's just an assumption as we don't know if the overseer is even dead 
---
Nope. Go start a new character, perks are level locked. 
---
No it will actually stay till the server crashes. Yet still who am I kidding, you’re still right no one will see it
---
There's some kind of place called Freddy's Meat shack or something weird in the lower half of the map and I clearly remember playing a Zeta Invaders holo game I got from a magazine. It might be a random Mag spawn though like fakeshemp said.
---
 This happened to me yesterday by some jerk who's PSN ID is:  "ringabell954". He built a camp at Charleston station, waiting for  people to try and find the traveling responder vendor bot I imagine(His  camp blocks that random encounter from spawning). He had a bounty and  was taunting another player when I arrived. I went up to him and he one  shot killed me without me even attacking. I was level 72 yesterday, so I  lost 72 caps.. I respawned without selecting revenge, shot him once,  and it said I was initiating combat with him, as if he didn't have a  bounty. But, he did have a bounty still. He then killed me again, one shot,  with an OP explosive shotgun. I lost another 72 caps. The caps aren't that big of a deal, I am just confused as to the mechanics of this. It should not have been a pvp combat, and caught me entirely off guard.  
---
After chasing all the way to Belching Betty, and getting a more powerful weapon from my stash, I managed to sneak up and collect the bounty on this person  for a measly 15 cap reward... "ringabell954" on PS4, and apparently others are  now able to kill without there being a bounty on their target. Whether their weapons are just that OP, or they are cheating, exploiting duped bobbleheads, or modding  somehow, idk. Today I encountered another  player with a bounty. When I shot them, it said I was initiating combat again, and it did no damage! They then shot me, one shot, with some stupid OP  explosive weapon. I was downed, and closed application before I died  this time tho. This needs to be fixed. Otherwise, what's the damn point  of bounties?! 
---
Right before I got offline, I was speaking to a friend who told me there is an exploit people have learned and that it has to do with crouching as you're attacking or being attacked when you have a bounty. It was loosely explained to me, but he said that he had personally witnessed this as well. People are able to get low cap bounties to attract other players into attacking. They then kill their attackers after they have unwittingly initiated pvp, trying to simply collect a bounty. He told me he used to make it his mission to hunt bounties, but since encountering this, he doesn't even risk it anymore. I feel the same way, why even bother if people can cheat like that?
---
&gt;Durability favors slow attacks right now.
---
"Luck of the Draw" should favour fast attacks though, did you try that?
---
Yes. Do you ever feel like you're trapped in a loop?
---
Nuke it!
---
I like this idea but feel like I would be forced to  make a crafter alt just to max his int to for when I craft. Right now I never go above 5 int for the durability reduction perk for my characters build.  I already made a second account with 9 charisma strictly to share perks with whatever main I’m playing. A crafting alt might be too much. 
---
Thanks for SGA!
---
Gotcha. Well the argument still stands even without the access to turrets and such.
---
Theres not a single reply from a duper here u stupid troll
---
Ah I see you have met the Radrats.  Also they have more health than me 
---
go to atom shop and equip it, i bought it and didnt even realize i had it. But you have to equip it and then go to your hello emote and you can change between them
---
Has happened to me too. Total morale killer 
---
How does someone attempting to do it and failing prove it doesn't exist?  
---
Like you couldn't do the dupe glitch without someone explicitly telling you how to do it, or without some understanding of what mechanics in the game need to be exploited to make it work.
---
Yes, ive noticed this a few times. 
---
If there's people selling, there's people buying.
---
Have to dedicate 2 luck slots to Starched Genes
---
No shits, just giggles. 
---
Passive mode *does not* stop you taking damage from other players, it only stops you damaging them. With a high enough damage output, PVPers can still kill you through slap damage. 
---
The food/stimpak sharing ones require you to be pretty dang close. I find 9 point of charisma to great for sharing level 3 perks, and then I've a bunch of QoL perks like aquaboy, sun kissed, serendipity,etc. that can be applied from across the map. Also, if you get "X effect when reviving players" perks, they can be applied to yourself with life saving armor.
---
Yup 4x the weight. Use to shoot 150 grain out of my m14, the gun seemed to like it best. Either way I wouldn't want to be hit by either irl, being shot by a 308 hunting round would take your legs off or what ever else it hit. so I guess it's all moot at that point.
---
When you take a serum do you unequip Starched Genes first and then keep it equipped after?
---
Well you only mention screws, wood, and aluminum. I’m just saying that 1-2k isn’t unreasonable. Though I have basically 0 wood, maybe mention more than 3 commonly stockpiled items.
---
If you get a Dense armor mod, it pretty much negates explosive damage. Works for me. I stacked Fireproof with it (since the new patch) and I'm almost immune to explosions. 
---
I got mine at  Harper's Ferry. 
---
I had this happen to me once (that I noticed) yesterday, but it was after a fast travel to the whitesprings service enterance and not first load.
---
Same for me. Idk if its a glitch or on purpose. 
---
Hi and welcome to... CAP'N KIDS!
---
Currently, this game rewards players for instigating fights with anyone. It further rewards players who cleverly entrap other players - willingly or not. It is built into the design of the game and may not ever change. Anonymity simply compounds your "issue" by enabling psychopathic behavior. I am not disagreeing with you by any stretch of the imagination but I do feel my approach is more pragmatic. Billy's parents have decided that it's fine for him to play this particular game and whether we like it or not - it's none of our business.
---
I don't see why they wouldn't. I WANT to use the same gear I liked in FO4 in FO76. I don't think anybody complains about having more content. There are plenty of new outfits, new weapons, and a whole giant new map. I'm fine with getting more old stuff mixed in with new stuff. It takes virtually no effort to put it in, it's not like it subtracts from their ability to make anything new
---
Did we every figure out if the pump has sight mods?
---
&gt; could have cancelled after the beta
---
The problem with your argument is that I do not, in fact, play betas. I wait for the release date, I pay my $60 (+tax), and then I play a game that's supposed to be in fine condition, as befits a major release.
---
I've bought every single Fallout game on the day of the release, starting with Fallout-3 over 10 years ago, and none of them were so obnoxiously buggy. "But they always suck" is neither an excuse nor a justification. Would you like to try another half-baked defense of the company that managed to shoot itself in the foot, or shall we call this a day?
---
No use to waste any time on people like that, let him go.
---
There's a mod on the Nexus for this, it is VERY convenient. 8 save slots and it's just an archive mod, everyone should be using it. 
---
Unfriend, kill, friend again. Unless you had some sort of tracker on if people had been friends but I'm sure people would still find a way to work the system. 
---

Found 2 at once from Chad in Camden Park
---
Happened to me one or two times.
---
I tried making a post saying as much a few days ago, and the response I got was "obviously you should just grind for it". I agree though, it's about a 1/40 chance to get any outfit from an event, and a lot of the event exclusive outfits feel like they should be things you can buy from vendors or just find when you're exploring. 
---
Wow, I've triggered you so bad all energy has left your body. Except that one little bit that decided that *you had* to respond to me.
---
So you really do care!
---
The woman in the second pic is T H I C C.
---
Both myself and friend were just one shot killed by some lvl 242 guy. We were both in pacifist mode, and neither of us were wanted.
---
He wasn't wanted shortly after killing us.
---
It's not just bad luck? I can get critically injured pretty often from good ol' Gutsy or Deathclaw, etc.
---
What else do you have equipped? Unyielding? Nerd Rage? Emergency Protocols?
---
So you'll doubt that it doesn't exist due to someone trying it? but believe someone on base word that it happened? One has a video of attempts one has nothing but words.

I hear vault dwellers have good loot, but possibly we can trade instead of M u r d e r 
---
Instigating isn't very good for queen, bloodied will do you better there. I have a bloodied swing speed Fire Axe with the spike mod, it's great for its damage to speed ratio
---
None of those but shouldnt be a issue since im not getting hit i also get resurected and then i get downed instantly
---
Duping sea crits
---
Yeah but he'll be doing that encounter multiple times

Most games do this nowadays. They tend to put in files like this ahead of time, and new updates either just unlock it or they unlock by themselves. If you noticed, we got new christmas themed skins in the atom shop over the holidays despite there not being any new updates. I do feel like they're going overboard though; we still don't have plenty of skins that were datamined on launch, including super basic stuff like camo/vault boy skins for the hunting rifle. Still, it doesn't mean that's all they're doing; this is just the stuff that's already finished, and it's sneaked into a smaller update for further testing and to decrease future download size.

I'm on 200 broken down gauss.  No suppressor.  Either I have really bad luck but dang

Fallout 76 version of Smoughs leg armor for Dark Souls.
---
should have shot their base up
---
Graham, Strong and Fawkes... in space?
---
Sure. Just curious if something wasn't working together..... Bethesda is pretty good with math on things like Class Freak (that is, they're horrible at math)...
---
You aren't even getting hit? You're going into KO (rez with stimpak) mode out of nowhere with no enemies or damage?
---
The clean shelves give you up.
---
Would fix nothing, they need to remove two shot
---
&gt;REEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Damn, champ
---
Imagine gamblers threatening other players to take a dive, ha. That would be great
---
It was meant to be the best and brightest, a few people likely paid their way in. Like the [bratty kid from the Cold Case quest. He made it into a vault, with the best option arguably being 76](/spoiler)
---
If ur on PC I'm planning on doing a Scorch beast queen with one other person. You could join
---
Would you mind taking a clip of it, Xbox records the last several minutes of gameplay and I believe pc can as well
---
Yes I have to agree there.  But stuff like my favorite outfit of fallout 4 (Silver shroud) has been confirmed to be an atom store purchase which sucks.  I hope what I read on this sub was wrong. 
---
thank you

Re: *Sex Panther*

No clue. That's just when I noticed them for the first time
---
“You’re going to take on 3 wendigos, kill two and fall victim to the third. If you do not do this we will follow you from server to server destroying your base and killing you.”
---
He could spend 20$ on weed and chill the hell out
---
Saw it in Grafton at the responder vendor. - not the train station. 
---
If also seen mods there but I know that’s not what you want. 
---
Yep, seemed to happen when i was below 20% hp resurrecting doesnt work as i get downed again instantly
---
Or just really lazy like everyone who worked on this game
---
Only half decent energy weapon I've seen so far is the Tesla Rifle 
---
9k on neon signage. 100 is in fact chump change.
---
 Sex Panther
---
Did a double take because that PA character is wearing the EXACT same paint and armor combination as I am - as long as that chest and left arm are t-45 and not t-60.
---
Still, the woman just looks like she has smough's leggings. I used to run a [DS1 character](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/843710310010942270/683858C5242EE6BBB208054C6ACC0630A49FB38C/) that had a similar look - the legs are hilariously oversized if you pair it with anything other than the rest of smough's set
---
Literally haven't been in a Whitespring nuke in 2 weeks. Just. Nahhhh.
---
Mr Torgue approved.
---
The screaming is normal. I built my first camp around there. The nuke things is probably a glitch 
---
Once so far. After a disconnect (or server crash) I joined another server and for some reason I suddenly got another loading screen after I had spawned. As the second loading screen disappeared I noticed something falling past my vision. Looked down and found the technical documents at my feet. Couldn't pick it up either. Happened at the radio tower far south in the Divide.
---
You ask for too much 
---
I have heard people talking about it. Some areas are haunted apparently.
---
They could easily drop an expansion like this and literally just call it Gun Runners, exactly like the original dlc for FO:NV. This could be a dlc based on how you essentially help pave the way for the gun runners to be what they are by the time New Vegas happens. Would be super cool
---
Hit me up maxx3412
---
If xbone, handmade. 1000
---
Damn, that does suck. When we got the mistress of mystery quest I was sure the silver shroud would make an appearance (other than just being mentioned on the computer logs). I want the silly stuff back though - the nuka quantum fat man mod, the spray gun from nuka world, an alien blaster that's not garbage...at least there's hope for the spray gun, I saw weaponized nuka ammo in one of the crates people showed off from the dev room
---
How about 1500? And yes xbox 
---
Yes if the handmade is lvl 45
---
I get both on pc ctd and disconnects
---
Interesting.  I was partied up with a buddy preparing for a site charlie run that whitesprings bunker at his camp near the asylum, and this guy comes around and drops a bag of trapper hoods and marine helmets for us.  I was like wow cool I've never found those (which doesn't mean anything since I randomly found a scribes outfit and have never seen it again, and found maybe 2-3 combat helmets on the road to lvl 120).  I forgot to vendor at Whitesprings station, so while my pal was buying some stuff I was selling over there and the same guy unloaded more marine helmets. (I'm sure he didn't pay attention to my name.)  I remarked to my friend that I think I have a duper, but he thought it might be a cosmetic plan that sells for a lot of money and the guy was being generous.  I found plans for the halloween skull mask and make a few of those to vendor when i remember I have it.  Between duping and honest generosity, it's hard to tell.  I've certainly given away my fair share of legendary stuff that I think someone might like.
---
I'll be sure to dump the trapper hood and marine mask in a lake when I log in tomorrow.  Thanks for the info!
---
&gt; how anyone enjoys the game while having the ability to one shot anything
---
dude, I love one shotting stuff.  If that makes me bad, I'm bad.
---
Alright its level 45 
---
Here to trade or just here to hear me soothing voice?
---
It's from Child's Play.  That's an easy one!
---
Any third perk on the ts tesla?
---
I'm on Xbox, so I couldn't tell ya until next week.
---
Wouldn’t pay over 500 tbh.
---
That place is haunted, sometimes pictures on the walls will spin too! 
---
Freaked me out too, when I first went their earlier today
---
Tesla is 90 percent reduced weight 
---
I got 20000 caps anyways

1. github

Almost at the max cap
---
Oh crap is it explosive?  hope not wording kinda got me messed up
---
Because he is trolling
---
How about no to lunchboxes 
---
I picked up Automatron at the church near Berkley Springs.  
---
But in had been there before and didnt see it then.
---
Yeah its explosive 
---
Would it be possible to build a big farm at your camp then nuke it? Would the plants change or get destroyed?
---
Ah poo lost all value then nvm ty fir the quick responses.
---
Just when I thought you couldn’t get any lamer. Omg. You’re so pathetic. Really dude, get help. Go troll somewhere else. You’re seriously bad at it.
---
Statistically i have met hundreds/thousands of people in my life and encountered 0 mutes.  
---
Also when a server holds only 24 people a sample size of 20 is a very large proportion of the entire game world
---
Actually I have to sell it for 3000 thousand if still buying my GT is Purty P0tat0
---
Follow the cables they lead to a terminal that you can control everything from up on the hill
---
That's fair. I disagree that water and power are an "unfair advantage" but never mind haha
---
At least power armor doesnt require you to re equip ot all like the hazmat suit....
---
Hmm too high
---
Admiral Akhbar says.... 
---
Stacks without a number. They're right. Makes caps go up. Only 1 physical reward though, so better to leave the doc and come back if you're gonna be on the server a minute.
---
The duper’s are in mad swing trying to get the last few duped in before the patch coming up. 
---
Sorry that's what I sell it for 
---
How about how almost everything they add in the Atomic Shop has images in it with other Atomic Shop items that have yet to be released? Has anyone else noticed this? Why do they show stuff that isn't even available yet? Is this a way of visually advertising items that are coming soon without directly telling us? 🤔
---
Stash all your fusion cells but 1 then shoot it. Go to stash and get your fusion cells. Now it will work. If you stash it then it will become bugged again. Besides that you will be good to go. Just learned this the other day from another Reddit Post. 
---
Im not canadian so i dont have the ability to hockey punch people unfortunately
---
Yeah i made some amd had a CaD
---
The patch that killed duping has been active for like 3 days now
---
I imagine people do it for the physical rewards lol that's neat to know though thanks for confirming
---
This bug has been around since beta... good thing we fixed the carry weight glitch though, and bobby pins finally weigh less than ammunition. Praise the Lord, and 
---
That way  we can grow glowing fungus to make and farm rad away
---
Gauss Rifles are now affected by both rifle and energy weapon perks, last patch fixed them so they are now seen as both
---
Haven't been messed with once unless I had a bounty. Even then, have had 2 of those bounties go away with time.
---
Either some people have bad luck or are instigators or something, I dunno. Different experiences from what you see here by a mile.
---
Well, that's lame. I'm running a pretty similar build so uh.... that's going to be fun, I guess.
---
/r/whooosh
---
I had 4 people respond via emotes that they could hear me so my guess if the rest just have xhat turned off entirely
---
o I see.   Unfortunately my friends don’t play as much as me and don’t have the caps to move around like that 
---
In fact YOU CAN PLANT CRANBERRIES.  
---
I do not remember whether I was able to do it after collecting some plan for it, but at some point I was able to plant my own cranberries. 
---
I like the idea.  At that point I've already seen the game and played as a pauper.  
---
I can already craft godly equipment on another character and trade it to my alt so all this does is save me a step of having to move the equipment around.
---
I thought the atom cats were an east coast car club prewar? Like Hell's Angels with pompadours. 
---
I think fundamentally you boost melee damage either with a low hp high rads build (radicool, nerd rage, serendipity,  bloodied weapon, unyielding armor) or high agi sneak attack
---
ok I thought I should be able to do that but how do I blueprint the whole structure??
---
So you would wager a large number of players are anti social
---
Well that solves that one. Been wondering since I came across it first day of BETA. hah.
---
Just drop it already. Its worthless. And dont pick up everything like a vacuum cleaner🤦🏼‍♂️
---
Not going to lie if I really really really wanted the munitions factory and I saw that shit I turn around and walk away.
---
You said it was proven to not exist and all I'm saying it that it hasn't been. Because you can't prove it doesn't exist. The most you can do is be skeptical.  
---
And no, I don't find it strange that no one has posted a video because a trade exploit would directly exploit other players, unlike the dupe glitch. No one makes videos on how to exploit other players.
---
It is confusing and inconsistent.
---
I was wondering about that myself.  Lol good to know 
---
It's t-60, mixed them up until I can find the rest of the set, those t-51 pieces are really underleveled for me.
---
How are you banned? Your card, address, etc?
---
That seems like something Bethesda would do/overlook with this game. Shame on them.
---
Spent 753 on piano plans... I already had piano plans. Side note: Anyone looking for piano plans... 
---
Everyone benefits from duping they just don't admit it. I've bought from guys on the f76 market and seen the inventory of the players to prove it. 99% of the time if you're buying a decent weapon ita either been duped already by the person or the person received the duped item. Its hilarious how people take this huge stance against duped items and then go and buy ammo/weaps/ or mods that were duped.
---
I know--the Simple Modern Bed is in all the rooms in vault 76, so why wouldn't it be called a vault bed?  The Vault-Tec Bed was a workshop item from Fallout 4's Vault-Tec DLC, and they just carried the name over into the new game.
---
I think you just got whoooshed yourself here buddy, because it's obviously not from childs play
---
For the most part, a lot of my caps come from collecting materials everywhere I go and bulking what I don't need. You could've profited off of the duper's efforts and kept some of that, especially screws. 
---
I personally wasn't spoiled but in this particular case all the outrage caused by **other** people got us some things done and i benefit from that as well in the end. That's why im saying that.
---
It's one of the rare cases where overracting can actually brings a positive. Make an issue bigger than it is so it gets picked by medias and there you go you have bgs attention on the issue that is probably Nothing more than an inconvenience, so it gets fixed in no time or at least looked into sooner than if we did bring it up reasonably. It's a gamble whether this tactic works but so far it did.
---
If that makes me childish for thinking this way, so be it. I'll live and so will you.
---
I see almost exclusively people with melee weapons 1 shoting everything at the Uranium Fever dvent. It's to the point I don't even bother with it anymore I just farm the clubhouse now. About 1 in 10 legendary drops is worth a couple thousand caps in the market subs on Reddit. I get way more legendary drops for my time as well
---
Gauss with a silencer is the best sniping gun IMO
---
When blueprinting a single item, you can either manually add items or select 'grow selection' to spread to adjacent items
---
For PC 
---
This type of stuff is why I will keep coming back to Bethesda games no matter the bad/false press. Small details and Easter eggs like this are awesome to discover. 
---
Considering there's far easier legendary farming spots you just sound like the asshole in that situation
---
That would have been almost as wrong as actually duping the items myself.
---
I’ve started just claiming and defending the initial wave, and that’s it.  I don’t build extractors etc just a few free crafting stations.  It’s worth it for the mats chems plans and XP, but way too many crashes and disconnects to invest in building it up and holding it IMO.  Which is a shame, I love the concept 
---
Which is what I'm on
---
Mine was bright blue when he died.
---
How are the legendaries? Was there a decent amount? Or a shit ton? Hardly any?
---
Through your mic so it broadcasts as your voice? Don't think it's ever been illegal to blast your background music into your mic during gameplay, its an age old online voice tradition. Clean up the quality and have it not be shitty metal and I don't think people will be too bothered.

Did you have your first sexual encounter as a very matured 12 year old?
---
yes this is know dont drop your junk quickly or this happens
---
Literally unplayable 
---
Correct but Bethesda cant blame their shitty servers on PC on duping this time around
---
What's that on xbox? 
---
Nor I. Including this one. 
---
Yeah, I only stack them when I know I'm feeling lazy or know I'm not going to be on the server long. Not ideal but I'll take the caps.
---
Pics?
---
I was killed by a mr gutsy today, my junk consisted of 300 ballistic fiber, 758 steel, 157 screws to name some of the items lost because the game decided to eat my junk bag, and my stash is full.
---
It's a trap 
---
You'd be surprised someone already found a way and has been banned since 
---
Honestly, a purge after they fix duping might get me to come back to the game.
---
It's the X button
---
And it always will be. 
---
If you don't use it, you don't use it. It's just carry weight you can't get rid of. 
---
This might be the most colossaly economics-ignorant comment I've seen yet. 
---
How exactly is the economy ruined? I sell all sorts of random weapons for hundreds to a few thousand caps. None of them TSE all of them melee weapons with decent to great rolls I find farming Whitesprings
---
Just the legs tho xD the rest of her is thin like a twig 
---
I'd love a pic of the tool chest!
---
Go to r/fo76bazaar. Someone will definitely by those shells for 600 caps. You can sell and buy tons of things over there.
---
Awww, idk either but thanks!!
---
It seems like Atom shop items are 50/50 hit or miss. I only get them at the last 5 hour mark when people show how shitty they are or I can pre see them in build mode.
---
It looks spooky
---
Thanks! Appreciate it. 
---
Nope, because you didn't post this question under and alt account, lol.
---
I did see a post recently from someone who tested this.   They were not able to gain flux this way. 
---
Np! Happy to make things a little easier!
---
Finally binged it last night, very great series and I cant believe their got Rudy go play himself, that is freaking unreal 
---
What's this?
---
Wow what a fresh perspective. 
---
You're entitled to your opinion
---
Mass? Maybe. Duping explosive two shot weapons? Not at all. Items don't have unique ids so there is no way to determine where someone got an item and when unless it checks off some kind of suspicious behavior box which as far as I can tell they still haven't put in serverside in any way. 
---
Basically as long. As you aren't making 200+ of an item repeatedly people would probably ghost under it. It sucks and I wish there was more Bethesda could do about it but as of right now I don't think they have the systems in place. Hopefully soon. 
---
Here me out my man. You don't have to fight all those robots. And when you spawn in the elevator, go out of it, open that door and instead of going left - go right to bio id terminal, get instructions from it, clear the card, get your bio id in, create new one, swipe you new bio id in control room and go. Don't have to go left first, in short.
---
After that just run, shutdown reactor, make a circle around reactor room repairing, reactivate and run again. 
---
Next, if you have explosive weapon just shoot that cores from a distance.
---
Then in the room where you need replace cores, clear this section and peacefully find all the cores.
---
In the launch room the same, just clear it and sit somewhere rekin all the robots from a distance.
---
Well all this works for me. I'm in PA btw. If you're not you can take on this ricochet perk card.
---
Oh yeah, try doing a queen on consoles since those patch notes fam 😂
---
The anger lmao you really are mad about this.  I wonder how you are when things actually happen in real life.  
---
LOL lies? Why don't you get on my pc and try to play this fucking game for over twenty minutes without getting a crash to desktop or a disconnect
---
😉
---
I played with a guy the other day who was waiting for a guy to get inline and trade him a  two shot explosive combat shotgun.
---
I asked how many caps and he said $8...
---
Ohhhh you're retatded lol my bad 
---
The theory is that vendor Phoenix sells the vault (white paint) style.  Needs more science though.
---
I too almost bought one.  Then I thought...would I care more or less about the game....less skipped it.  Friend found a furious .50. 1 star.  Still making me happy.  
---
It's actually easier to do the space fights by flying in reverse the whole time and just unloading on them when they come in on attack runs because they fly straight and the ai trys to evade and attack at the same time so the attack often goes wide. 
---
Once I discovered that encourage fights from taking forever to let me take on several ships and be done faster than 1v1 would take flying forwards 
---
TSE stands for Two Shot Explosive which are the two most powerful legendary effects in the game. When combine together with weapon damage perk and demolitions expert, they become seriously overpowered,  especially shotguns. 
---
Everyone crowds Whitesprings because a lot of ghouls spawn there,  especially during nuke zones. They used to give crazy XP, but that's nerfed this patch. But that many ghouls will still give decent XP plus a lot of legendaries. 
---
Great, head over to r/theouterworlds and talk about it. 
---
The true wasteland hero. Thanks!
---
[I almost certainly cannot miss](http://i.imgur.com/Czh3blo.gif)
---
Earlier today I slowly and methodically dropped legendaries that I didn't want in a nuke zone. It's not just junk and not just spamming the button.
---
It was good in the beginning but then later new crafters got shut out since sometimes the best materials spawned the first week and if you didn’t have multiple accounts so you could put down 50 extractors on the material to get a big surplus you where always working with sup par materials. On top of that the richest crafters would buy all the experimentation tapes for hundreds of millions or even billions of credits locking out any other crafters from buying them and getting to 12 experimentation points which was crucial.  I did all of this and loved it but looking back it wasn’t the best system to foster virtual monopolies. It was a blast being the first master weaponsmith on Eclipse. Some of the best memories I’ve ever made in gaming were when I posted weapon stats for sale on the forums with my shop location which was next to Jabbas palace. Hundreds of people came. But I imagine being some of the other weapon crafters probably sucked.
---
😎
---
I think he means armour pieces, not the underarmour(for anyone else confused, underarmour is like the vault suit or BoS suit, where armour pieces are leather left arm, raider right leg, etc.).
---
My experience after some testing was that time has to pass ingame before things respawn.  
---
Or you just let people destroy it and not realize so you can get that sweet cap bounty and ruin a level 10's day lol
---
What energy weapon perks?
---
Not a sarcastic comment. The only thing I think that would effect this would be science, and by effect, I mean let me modify the gun. Otherwise, idk any particular energy perks that change specifically energy rifle damage.
---
The console patch should arrive on Tuesday. Until then, also be careful not to auto-scrap if you're carrying any hardened mass which you get from nuke zone enemies.
---
Mad props
---
Oh boy.
---
I feel like 45 would be a good cap, at least 35
---
I think the servers are way unstable for this right now.
---
Hell, expanding stashes to 600 was jumping the gun.
---
If they can make things more stable I'm all for it but the heavy lag when you get 5 players on screen has to be addressed first
---
Paladin Tag..ag..gar..ty in command

"IS THAT SOMEBODY WHO NEEDS ME TO KICK THEIR ASS?"
---
 F R E S H
---
only happens to me if i spam
---
In my opinion, that _is_ the way it works.
---
Single player games are neat like that
---
This is still a mistery to me. I thought this happens if you have more than one Technical Document picked up in game at some point, but the game always only lets you really have one. If i do not have a Technical Document, i never see those at my feet. 
---
No matter how many Technical Documents i pick up, i can only really "carry" one and give it to that slot. Even if i know i picked up like 3 or 4, after that one they are all gone. 
---
People say that was something Bethesda either Stealthnerfed or "broke" with a patch, since they say before you could have multiple in your Inventory and deliver them all at once.
---
But just recently i had a glitch where i had unlimited Technical Documents for some reason. With that i mean i were able to login, deliver the Document and relog and had it again without losing the rewards.
---
Even there i always had Documents at my feet. Tho i have no clue what i did to glitch that out. Since i however hate cheating, i tried to fix it by dropping them somewhere. After that i were again only able to carry one at a time and the bug was gone.
---
I do not know if Bethesda did "fix" this like that so you can't bulk up on those (Which is kinda dumb, since you can also bulk up on US Supply Drops) or they really broke it somehow.
---
Welcome to the crap-loot support group. Feel free to grab a chair. There's coffee and biscuits in the back.

Kittyyyyyyyyyy 🐈😽😻😺😸🐱🐾❤️
---
First SB kill each day should have a sweet reward, most easily accomplished with a daily quest 
---
Well the game is supposed to be a bit of a challenge at first, slow going..
---
What level are you and how many hours in?
---
Level 10. Not sure on hours maybe 10?
---
And I'll go ahead and mention that this isn't in the known issues list.  Thanks for the help though.
---
I've lost two CS to ammo. I assume Bethesda has absolutely no one working QA on their products.
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/151?tab=files
---
Oh, I know it's not non-existent, I'm just saying that, for me, subjectively, it might as well be, because I wouldn't be able to tell the difference.
---
New patch has me CTDing all the time
---
Hmmm I have a three star raider piece.  Poison.  Auto stim. And something else.  Yours if you want it and all my ammo other than .45, .50, and 5.56. 
---
Only one I've seen is the way to get into the cheat room but all those people get banned within hours. I dont see anything on YT about a new one which is good if there is another. Plus they're banning YouTubers now
---
When they finally buff energy weapons you’ll be sad you sold the thing.
---
We've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on that Super Star Destroyer.
---
That's true. There are a lot of problems with the game that Bethesda would have to address before upping the player limit, But I'm just hoping they can do it in the future. It would be a lot of fun to have lots of people playing at once and I think there would be a lot more player interaction.
---
Evidence of the real reason servers are unstable ^^^^^^/s
---
Any that affect the gun and ammo. Sure there isnt any direct damage ones but combined with all the rifle ones they are still nice to have, especially the energy ammo weight reduction that 2mmec ammo is heavy as fuck.
---
Same, since patch on PC
---
Well that sucks then , I spend 3-4 hours a night in game playing . The respawn timer on loot must be lengthy then .. lame lol 
---
4 DC's and 2 crashes to home in 28 minutes. This is getting ridiculous. I'm done until they fix this BS. Don't think it'll happen though. Bethesda has been pumping out buggy shit since oblivion. 
---
What is flux for?
---
"I kill. Moo Moo carrys. I hear no complaint so far" 
---
If your also doing the story as well, that's not terrible, to have a better chance at Legendaries look for the events, many of the ones around the Forest will have legendary bosses at the end, and net good rewards and xp
---
We'll have to agree to disagree on this. Have a good night man!
---
What platform?
---
&gt; 15% XP perkcard
---
Which one are you meaning?
---
Never mind, PC here

You can buy Simple Modern Bed from Pendleton at The Whitespring, no waiting!

Had a guy one shot me and i didn't do any dmg to him with my furious explosive shotty. This shotgun destroys legendary mobs. Dude Exploiting bobble heads like crazy. Kind of sad to be honest lol. Hope a fix is in soon.
---
I randomly got a garage door plan when I was a Silo Charlie 
---
Bringing assault into the hypothetical is a bit of a strawman, since assault isn't legal in any context.
---
But harassing? Sure. They should harass the kid until he leaves. He doesn't belong there. If anything, it's for his own good. There are reasons why kids aren't allowed in bars, and there are reasons why there are age limits on games and warnings about online interactions.
---
I'm doing Todd's work.
---
Or the random water purifiers. 
---
I do think it's cool you can hook up the power substations. That said, I don't really want to tie my base power to a nuclear plant being operational on a given day... 
---
Had one fail, makes sense now..
---
Guess I’ll keep at it then. 
---
Sadly, have to agree. Increaseing the server limit would honestly just cause more crashes for more people. Currently you can get lucky by getting on a good server and have a good time, but increase the amount a server can hold and you'll see even more crashes. And that just upsetting.
---
The setting makes YOU the pacifist.
---
Just like real life, being a pacifist doesn't prevent others from hurting you. 
---
That was my first thinking too, but it didn't do the trick.
---
In all honesty, i would even be happier with less sometimes.
---
Once you are at a certain level there are so few places you can have a decent farm for legendaries or mats, before you constantly run into "heartattacking" mobs which got killed just 2 minutes before you arrive at that place.
---
Everytime i see a Legendary enemy just right ahead and i try to switch to my Assault Rifle, KNOWING it will probably die of an heartattack right away, because it was supposed to be dead, the server just didn't sync with you yet, it dies before i can shoot it so i at least can tag it for myself.
---
So yeah.. Sometimes.. i wish i would even be able to go completely solo there. There are times where i wish i had some fellow players and there are times where i wish everyone else would just leave. Especially when you meet those kinda people who just try to annoy you. Tricking you either into PvP or griefing your base, forcing you to either watch while they taunt you or leave the server, if you don't want to engage in PvP.
---
You get the thumb for “giant murder crab”.  That is now the only name I shall use. 
---
Well fallout is not outer worlds so
---
Yeah easily obtainable junk like coal - when buying some asked what it is because they never saw it before. And of course it's easy if you craft 10 serums for yourself.      
---
      
---
Well craft just 20 serums of every kind - have fun gathering all fluxes and materials. Then tell me again it has nearly no production costs....
---
Weird flex, but ok. 
---
‘What are ya dupin’ here?’
---
My tse gauss does close to 1.5k and I've had it as high as 2.4k with radicool and nerd rage, tse is ridiculous. 
---
That's how it is right now in reality.  Go ahead and build yourself a giant laser, they're regulated by the FDA so all you need to comply with is their requirements like powerful ones have several safety mechanisms.
---
Arent swing speed and power attack in the same category though? 
---
&gt; It really doesn( matter if it's an 8 year old, a 14 year old, or a 40 year old
---
If it doesn't matter, then why is your post specifically concentrating on the 8 year old? Don't move the goalposts.
---
A in game one is still appreciated 
---
I build my shop there. Now I have a cat named Murgle 😁 http://imgur.com/8FOXgFA
---
I love what you did with the bar area facing both nuke sites! 
---
Unfortunately I think they essentially dragged most every mob type over and scorched them as an enemy for the SBQ fight. You see potentially literally everything else. 
---
Wish it weren't true but yeah. We'll see puppers. This just isn't a bread crumb.
---
goddess thank you
---
Watoga.  Send me your money. 
---
Wha..? How? Where? Pics?
---
Honestly my head cannon was that in the Fallout universe .50 was a pistol round because the rifles chambered in it do hilariously low damage. The .50 MG and pictures of the ammo but that all to rest though, they really need to buff the rifle. 
---
You're very welcome!  I think the vault table is just a super rare spawn.  Or it's bugged on pc.  One of these things.
---
That was in the Black Isle OG fallouts too, 99% chance of success meant you fail 99 times out of 100 for some rolls.
---
That's a good one
---
No, I definitely have one that I found.  (through an event or randomly, i have no idea.  I do a lot of events)  Are you on PC?  I'll be happy to dig it out of my stash and give it to you.
---
Okay,yeah it seems very exploitive. It was a thought that popped up after reading a few of these comments
---
Also you can craft a shit load of .50 at a time. With the right perks 10 lead, 40 steel, and a bit of gunpoweder will get you 180 or 360 .50 rounds which would go a long way with the rifle. 
---
I'm pushing a theory Bethesda used a "a Character See" for their RNG during account or character creation...
---
I have terrible loot luck, I'm Lvl 307, not a single TSE and only 3 explosive weapons (2 being black powder pistols..)
---
Now I have a couple friends who will loot up to (12) two shot weapons per WhiteSprings, so many they toss them in bags, and record of half of them being TSE's (no, I'm serious)...
---
Fast forward to treasure maps, I use 70 and get complete garbage, 6 motion assist servos, couple knuckles, that's it.. They get 16 unique T-60 plans off 30'ish maps...
---
BTW my base luck is 15 and there's are 5 or less..
---
That's not where we're all telling you to look.  You have to be spending a point to see all the cards you have to choose from.  There's a specific button for that from the perk card screen, or it tries to make you do it first if you go to perk cards and have any points to spend.
---
Then on the next thread complain the game is too easy
---
Or how about Bethesda implements private servers like Ark: Survival Evolved.  Bethesda provides certain cheat codes that players can use that flags cheating players as unable to play on public servers or flags anyone that uses an unofficial cheat as private server only.  Bethesda can still get money from cheaters through Atom purchases and they get to play the game the way they want without hurting others.  Maybe have the Atom challenges give half the rewards for people that cheat while on private servers and no rewards for any cheaters that are caught on the public servers.  
---
There is also the Titanfall method where cheaters are forced to play against other cheaters. However, implementing this method in Fallout 76 won't be as fun since PvP is lacking in this game.
---
He had terrible loot
---
yeah just bring the mats and the legs and shoot me a friend request and comment your IGN. Sometime tomorrow maybe. I can do shocks for all the craftable power armor now and some jetpacks
---
I love how they can spring from the ground that isn't even there, out of midair when you're up high on a narrow CAMP balcony.  It's immersive and pleasing to see.
---
One thing to note: While BGS may have the numbers for both the actual drop rates and obviously they know the intended drop chances, I'm not sure they really have tools that can analyze whether the one is properly and consistently resulting from the other. If there's some pernicious bug in the drop code that means it mostly works right, but in some cases does not, it may have been misbehaving for generations of games, with this being the first time that there was a great deal of player-to-player comparisons going on.
---
Dense armor mod with 3 points of End Fireproof. 
---
You are now immune to 90% of the pvp end game meta. They likely aren't going to even shoot you in good spots because they're used to the blast radius doing the work. Use them being confused to use whatever you have that hopefully beats a two shot with garbage accuracy.
---
Ssshhh! This must be a secret
---
Isn't that just the handmade?
---
I think it has something to do with adding items into your inventory. I’ve had this happen multiple times. Something similar happened while I was farming at Whitesprings as well. I killed a legendary at the clubhouse and saw an item spawn next to the corpse before disappearing and reappearing in the corpses inventory. Anyone else observed this?
---
Ah rip. I can't tell the difference between t45 and t60 for the life of me. 
---
I only played the complete edition, but it definitely was. Maybe not in the base game, but a dlc added a suppressor for the anti-material rifle. 
---
Are you talking Crafting, or Perk cards? I'm being serious when I ask this. 
---
If you mean crafting, I know. If you mean Perk Cards, I have work to do, cause that means Rifleman and Heavy Gunner will BOTH up this weapon's damage.
---
My reproductive organ evaporated.

Try server hopping at Grafton Station. IIRC that's where it is.  Check the station and the vendor bot inside Grafton. Best of luck. 
---
The red bits actually do look cleaner. It removed some of the grime which is nice... except I really just didn't want those ugly side walls. Which it has but which remain conveniently hidden in the shop screenshots. Sigh. 
---
Please no, we don't need any more instability than we're already experiencing.
---
Time to download more
---
The t-60 has blockier shoulders and more room under the neck for the helmet since it's bigger, the helmet is also quite different, other than that they look nearly the same.
---
Don't get me wrong. The game really looks fun and i will enjoy it. But i will avoid 76% of all players there, since they be constant dicks about Fallout 76. Judging a game they never played themselves but feel entitled to judge it. 
---
And i can guarantee you. Outer Worlds will have problems too. And when people don't treat it like theat treated Fallout 76 for it you know what that makes them. Hypocrites. 
---
Was the same how everyone shuns Bethesda for having the Atomic Shop and offering cosmetics. There they go nuts about, claiming Bethesda is the worst company ever. But when Rockstar sells you a car for 60 bucks in their GTA Online or makes their RDR2 Online complete Pay to Win... then they (nearly) get a GOTY Award as a thanks. 
---
Tseh..
---
You can’t fix something you aren’t aware of, can you?
---
My name is EpicZephos. Can you do the t51 jet pack as well? I can supply all the materials for both legs and the jet pack 
---
I always just take out the generator and power poles. Now you have to do the annoying wiring again suckaaaa.
---
Yeah on PC, though I won't be online for a little while. If you can dm you user name, I'll hit you up when I get online.
---
That aside though, still genuinely curious as to how you can get it. 
---
I mean I had a similar situation before they raised the stash size and decreased drops. I'd have several thousand pounds of junk and legendaries on me because I was too much of a hoarder to throw them away. I'm not saying he *wasn't* a duper, just that I can see other explanations 
---
Sounds like a Baki Villain.
---
Kinda same basic shape but damage wise there’s really no comparison 
---
I love that house, I pass by it every time there's a scorchbeast queen fight to see if I can snag a 3 star legendary from her. The kings and glowing mirelurks are pretty good xp too
---
Sent you a PM.
---
Maybe I've just had bad luck. I think I remember seeing some deep pocketed there but it's never been leather chest. Seen limbs a number of times there or one of the vendors in the ash heap. 
---
Plenty of vendors have plans for that kind of armor. Idk if it's specific to each type (for example only responder vendors have leather), but I recall pretty much every time I trade I see some combination of plans for deep pocketed, ultra light, strengthened, and shadowed armor
---
The Descendant of The Guy Who Put Power Button On Keyboard?
---
Yeah that was dumb on my part! I realized I have to have the full set on. I just can't make the RIGHT ONE! The mods for the legs, bracers, right?
---
The cylindrical red grill with the gas tank underneath is a default item, no plan needed.  I think at least one other XB1 player has said they have the Domestic Kitchen Tables.  Do you remember where you picked them up?  
---
The bug were my dragoon as 24 bullet
---
Doesn't matter, other people can open the shutters
---
Yeah I know vendors have different mods but knowing which one has that specific one is the question. 
---
Surely. I would also be fully for it for Bethesda doing their own. But i am sorry.. this is the best i can serve you with myself here. But to be fair. Before Bethesda runs in and adds a Textchat i would say they first have to fix most bugs and finally get their Servers fully stable.
---
Nicely done friend 
---
As a software engineer, I've never had to regard my very medium with reverence. It has to be sobering at times. I do recall quietly giving thanks to whatever donor supplied the bone graft to fill my socket.
---
Anyway, yes, a nice little unexpected wasteland chat. Cheers. :)
---
Existence of a few dumb people doesn't mean the community would support pay-2-win. There are always idiots who are willing to shoot themselves in the leg, shouldn't be a surprise, really.
---
Devs have teams dedicated to new content and bugs separately realistically we should be getting a even influx of both but I agree servers need to be stable 
---
So worth it. 👍👍👍
---
Awesome, thanks
---
Does that fix the mod scrapping issue?
---
If you’re talking about server stability this one definitely doesn’t kill servers like the patched one
---
Yes and sometimes we have hookers over for funsies 🤦 
---
I bought the game *for me*. They live here. They see me playing, they want to play. I let them play as long as it's with my supervision or on my team. No mics unless they're *only* talking to me. They like taking down digital monsters with mom. I let them, since I'm just the worst parent *ever*. 
---
It's hard to report bugs through support tickets with most companies, since requests go to the wrong people by default, who's job is to help solve your own problems. I didn't see a category for reporting serious bugs (rather than asking for help), but I noticed if I choose the "feedback" category it claims that it'll go directly to the developers instead of support people.
---
Alternatively it might help if your ticket starts with a sentence like "please forward this bug/exploit to developers" so they're less likely to mistake it for a support request. It's the weekend so I wouldn't expect a response before Monday/Tuesday.
---
Or maybe one of Bethesda's redditors like /u/LoneVaultWanderer might be able to pass the exploit information on.
---
No joke
---
How the shit does it decide to break things down instead of using raw stuff first
---
It's mind boggling
---
I saw 0 but i left early. S:
---
 you deserve the poster plan of you 
---
u still have him?
---
Already messaged him haven’t got a response back yet
---
I love the tower design.  Great work!
---
It isn't made super obvious, but if you really like building, two perks to get early are Contractor (Int perk that unlocks at lvl 18) and Home Defense (Ag perk unlocked at lvl 22).  Contractor lets you build for 50% reduced cost and Home Defense allows you to build better turrets.  Happy Camper (cha tree 80% less hunger and thirst in camp) is also good when on an extended building spree or going AFK while sleeping.
---
If you're on PC I have a bunch of plans I've been saving in anticipation of camp vendoring (desks, beds, chairs, etc) and would be happy to give them to you for free.  I have so many that they're starting to dig into my CAMP budget.
---
Also, the brick set plans are very common to buy from Wallace at Harper's Ferry.  (His anti-establishment rhetoric is pretty amusing, too)  The metal bunker plans are somewhat rarer, but they're sold by Phoenix at Watoga shopping center, the undisputed baddest robot on the planet.  Personally, the brick is my favorite aesthetically and it's really durable against enemy attack.  The metal bunker plans are pretty nice too, just not my personal taste.
---
Sounds like you're banned. 
---
They're both AK knockoffs and the Handmade is the best semi-auto rifle in the game. Idk what more you'd want besides a name change. 
---
it's over Anakin
---
Inspirational 3 from charisma tree
---
Afraid I can't help with specifics then. I got mine a while ago so I don't really pay attention anymore. 
---
What did you do?
---
I'll have to check out Harper's ferry. And sure, I'd be grateful for the plans!
---
Shit I barely see 10-12 on my server sometimes. The other night there was like 4 of us for over an hour. 
---
I'm not sure what is right, but lack of their response - even a simple "thanks, we'll look at this" - is very upsetting.
---
Once the servers can handle more load, I would absolutely love 30-50 players 
---
I remember how I saw a two robots that talked to each other. They dialogues reminded me about oblivion, because they way they answered each other, was the same as in that game lmao
---
Which quest?
---
Wouldn't surprise me. If I ever get time to learn it I wonder if that FO76 Edit mod program would let me look at the right files to figure out what the plan should be called as well as its source.
---
Oh, and when it comes to the "lockers". One variant is sold by the BoS vendor, the other Harper's Ferry IIRC. I think someone posted that weeks ago.
---
Oh, well massive progress with this thread. Thanks again!
---
XBOX ONE X - DAS CASADY - when will the server stability get fixed? I still get glitched and booted at least three times in a four hour period. Every time I play.

Plan: Tool Chest can be found at the raider vendors. 
---
I guess my memory is faulty. I read over the notes again and couldn't find it. Sorry.
---
On the other side of the coin, I launched my first nuke today with the help of a friend, and the Queen got stuck on the ground.  She just sat there looking angry, didn't attack and the 12 or so players got some really easy xp and loot.  The best part was this one guy in a hazmat suit jumping up in her face with marsupial and hitting her in the nose with his battle axe like a freakish mario character.
---
Great response, 100% agree..
---
I've found at this point (5) reproducible server crash bugs (and a ton of less things) and after the second one I reported got no traction I did a Reddit post (giving carefully worded outline to avoid making it easy to reproduce but to try and get attention of someone).  
---
It worked and I chatted with a couple community managers (and finally got responses on the 1st two Related tickets).
---
Part of the conversation with the Rep was making it clear they are reading all the submissions, but are very very rarely reaching out, only if they are having trouble reproducing it, need more info, etc...  
---
I know It feels like the reports are going into a black hole, but this weeks patch, even though it's introduced a ton of new issues, really address allot of outstanding problems so they are listening, have faith..
---
This is cool! I just made a post last week about pre-existing locations to build your CAMP in! Here are some places I found that you can build at. It really makes your CAMP look a lot more lifelike:

Need some spiky bits to stab people with?
---
I emailed them directly as well, that was over a month ago. I feel like a dipshit for continuing to play when it keeps being buggy and I wish it was fallout 5 (Fallout 4, but a new storyline and graphics). I don’t give a shot about playing with my friends anymore.
---
My name is Shankwell.  I likely won't be on until tomorrow evening, but I'll be happy to give you the plans.
---
Like one or two. They are spaced out way more than whitesprings. So you don't fight hordes of them. Meaning less legendaries. 
---
Great for lower levels to rank up. You know since you aren't getting overwhelmed and you can find places to get out of reach.
---
I'd really like to know.
---
I am completely against this. The balance is perfect as it is. Its easy to team when I want to, but sometimes its hard to avoid people when I want to. The competition for some areas is already too much.
---
Thank you. Yes, they both know the bad words and keep swear jars for all offenders. They even have notepads where they write you tickets 😂 We even sent a letter to Eminem requesting a 1 time payment of $12.50 for his violations. This was at the behest of my 9 year old who walked outside while the grown-ups were listening to Kamikaze. 
---
My whole approach to parenthood is - what did my siblings and I do growing up that we were confused about? What did we want to know more about? What did we do that we hid from our parents? What did we wish our parents did with us? I take those situations and I approach them outright. I try to teach/guide them, answer their questions, explain what and why, partner with them. My boys are fantastic kids so it seems to be working ❤️
---
Sorry abut that, my bad, didn't know. I got them plan farming so I'm not 100% but I'm mostly positive Lakeside Cabins. 
---
Why do you think the game is rated 17+. Gore, blood, shooting people in the face. That’s exactly what impressionable young children need. I guarantee you are American, and that’s why every day people gun down other people.......
---
Is this a reference to “Spray'n Pray“ from Fallout 4?
---
My name is Shankwell online.  I'm usually on during the evening EST from 6-10 on PC, and I have voice chat.  Send me a party invite, or visit my camp and I'll fast travel back to you.  My camp (schrute farms) is just across the street N of whitesprings station.  Everyone is welcome to pick beets and enjoy the America, night-time and irrigation themed suites.  If I'm not at camp, I'm probably vendoring the previous day's haul or wandering around Watoga hoping for a two shot handmade rifle.
---
Coo! Thanks!
---
If you were exploiting, I’m glad you were banned.
---
If you were not exploiting, I’m really sad you were banned.
---
Lmao wow
---
You had to have done something to get banned.
---
I was like, "this better be a kitty" and it actually was. Amazing.
---
Oh yeah....if you go to the whitesprings hotel, there's a vendor in the shopping area at a store called Studio 50 or something of that nature that sells a ton of plans, mostly the resort and fancy stuff.
---
I've getting non-stop (or so it feels) CTD's with App crashes reported in the Windows error log, and I've lost about 15 - 20 FPS, and the game it "jittery"..
---
But the insane thing is I've got a couple friends who used to crash all the time, and they have been buttery smooth, on for 5 hours straight, on the same server, which is what I was like until this weeks patch..
---
Only guess is they messed around with some memory usage, and it's resolved the issue for some, and completely borked over others.
---
Oh, but atleast my clients are closing now, instead of sitting in the background with several gigs of memory reserved until I force close the application.
---
*r/prequelmemes wants to knows your location*
---
They aren't that bad but I'd suggest maybe bringing a backup melee weapon because there are quite a few that spawn. I'd also suggest some form of power armor just to get through it.
---
I have that gun too. Its armor piercing, explosive, and then something else i cant remember because my dad is borrowing it.
---
9 charisma is probably best, because you can share most of the best cards. There are only a few rank 4 or 5 cards that can be shared, and most arent super exciting. That said, I have Charisma 15 and I love it. Its actually good solo or team. I usually run suppressor 3 and tenderizer 3 and field surgeon (2) and the cheaper travel card. Plus lone wanderer (4) and happy camper 2. On teams I run suppressor 3, tenderizer 3, inspirational 3, rad sponge 3, and then whatever else I think is helpful. I picked up most of the rank 3 cards people like, and I also went ahead and snagged adrenaline 5.
---
Anyway, I like it, but charisma 15 is a heavy investment. Charisma 9 is probably best.
---
I’d kill for repair kits tbh 
---
I run a low hp build and the same keeps happening to me. Really annoying. 
---
OP - start by removing yourself from the game please!
---
Also if you look up or ask for the codes on here I'm sure someone will have them, all you'll need is the key card and of course the code they told you. 
---
No idea. But why is this question in this post?
---
It's bugged (confirmed I looked in the game files), it's missing the needed keywords to show up in the bench
---
PC - 9700k, 1080Ti, 16GB, Win10
---
Making another post as there's now more issues, again, never had issues really worth posting about since the patch.
---
\- Significantly more lag since the patch, disconnections at least once every 1-2 hours. 
---
\- Lvl 50 T60 right leg, with Calibrated Shocks keeps unequipping randomly while running around and also after fast travelling/loading in.
---
well, I've played about 8h so far and still looking forward to more and I paid 19€ for it. I've paid 20€ for 2h movies in the cinema that sucked. So I would argue it has given me my moneys worth ;)
---
under heavy weapon in the craft menu. the rifleman cards have effect on semi-auto and shotgun barrels, and the heavy weapon perks aswell. in two words its counts as heavy weapon.

Never buying a other mod again
---
No fucking way the queen was killed with regular tse weapons in under 2 mins. Some bobbleheads involved for sure
---
Infiltrator was in FO3 as a variant of the assault rifle added in the Pitt. It was cool but it’d basically be a decked out handmade rifle with a black paint.
---
That said, I’d love to see some NV weapons like the LAER, the BAR (forget the in game name), etc. or just unique skins for the weapons like they did in NV
---
Oops, dropped it in the wrong thread

It's a rifle, but it's in the "Heavy Weapons" section of the crafting menu.

I think just repairing the poles in the correct order or hitting repair all would bring the wires back, no?

rng happens :(  I was looking for dense combat torso for the last few days, no love, then got a leveling alt today and first vendor... BOOM there it was.  Crazy.

So, what did you do to earn it? 
---
belive that...
---
PA is always recalled on a log out mate
---
If I'm on a low alt, I'll stack heavy pieces I can't use yet on a chass then log out
---
Today I was at my camp and there were Scorched attacking my camp. After all the Scorched were killed by me and my turrets, I saw only one still shooting so I figure there was still an enemy,then I realized it was shooting at me. I scrapped it and placed a new one. I do not know why it happened.
---
They'll more than likely be identical to the versions available in Fallout 4. I'm actually excited for the Marine helmet.
---
Can't you also just kill the scorched instead of marking them?
---
I really don't know what to use for my build.
---
BoS or Enclave? Which is it? Pick one! (BoS or GTFO)
---
This is amazing!!
---
Just had 2 successful ones on PC, but had to wait a few minutes for them.
---
The Atom Cat paintjobs aren't exactly super inspired. They're basically just hot rod paintjob schemes on power armor suits.
---
I agree with you about RDR2. I paid full price for it and I've barely got 25% of the game done. I just don't care. It's a fine game, but I've never been big on GTA games, and online doesn't interest me. In fact, I've only logged in one to the online, and that was only on the first day it was available. 
---
Anyway, at the end of the day, Fallout 76 isn't the game I want it to be, and it probably won't ever be. And Fallout 4 was that great *to me*. Just as good as Skyrim, Fallout 3 and NV that I sunk well over 1000 combined into, possibly over 1500. Those games, and Dead Rising 2, were the only games I ever cared about enough to try and get 100% on and do every quest for every faction. And to have Fallout 76 not even get close to that, is a huge disappointment to me. I want something that engrosses me, not repells me. I want a game that's a joy to play, not one tbat makes playing a chore. Fallout 76 isn't it right now, but that's okay. 
---
items in real mmopgs with epic and legendaray effect pretty common but need a serious performance to get them. but here u need one thing luck... (or u canbuy from dupers fro real money...)
---
but yes there is a problem with this legendary weapons: lack of balance only the two shot and the explosive or its combo viable the rest just junk.
---
If you go into the atomic Shop, there's now a bunch of "Heavy Metal" themed items. We don't get the heavy metal emote, but there's an awesome vault boy picture with a Minigun if you're interested. 
---
Hopefully they'll do a bit more, but it's still awesome to know BGS is listening
---
hahaha fix a bug huehueuhe, I got stuck entering power armor twice, stuck on terminal, I guess those bugs will stay to the next fallout game, until they remove these mechanics and replace them with something else. 
---
I wish it was fallout 5... Nothing wrong with a single player game with a rich story. This has just turned out to be a failure, right out the gate.
---
Had they started with single player and then introduced multiplayer elements once the client was working, it might have worked
---
Everyone and their gradma has a 2SE now.  If you don't have one in pvp you are dead.
---
They go for 1k caps on Xbox lfg.  That is nothing but a vendor run.  You know exactly what you are getting unlike a lootbox.  Also you don't pay real world money or Mickey mouse tokens that are atoms. 
---
Mods are consumed before bulk junk. There's no reason to bulk anything but lead and aluminum unless you're selling it.
---
it is horrible, I was gone for 2 month to let them patch the game, but seems the servers are even worse, lag all day, and DC. What have they been doing with those server stability patches is beyond me!
---
You are the best person alive. I love you.
---
I’ve scraped a X-01 jetpack and 2 T-60 shocks, so I feel your pain. I’ve noticed it seems to always use the mods for mats over bulked steel but not loose steel. I’ve had extra T-60 shocks sitting in my stash for 2-3 weeks now since I’ve stopped bulking steel. Crafted thousands of rounds of ammo in that time.
---
Do u know if there is a lvl cap on finding tse or legendaries in general? 
---
Settle down Maxim. If F3 has taught us anything it's that you should play both sides until you have as much unique loot as possible and then kill everyone for their clothes.
---
Wait.
---
What we we talking about?
---
I'd like to scrap ammo
---
Right? Looks really neat. Excited to try it. 
---
This is fantastic!
---
Do you mind if we use this to start getting pictures onto the wikis for these items? (The wikis really need work)
---
Does doing that still get you event drops? I could've sworn I did that the very first time I did the event because I didn't have the scope and I think it did complete the event but I don't think I got anything
---
I imagine so! Probably sold by others who bought it at Harper's Ferry. 
---
That's the only limitation of this/your system, others still get to see what people have sold previously.
---
Not knocking your efforts but data doesn't lie. That's the only level list that locker plan is in.
---
\*Bookmarks
---
Well this is gonna be useful as fuck to get what I want
---
This is some hardcore geek shit... I love it!
---
Yeah, I just eliminated them all and completed the event 
---
Of course not. But if fallout had used that engine instead, it would be running much smoother. And look a lot more polished. Same exact game, but a different engine with a significant graphics boost would be a huuuuuge difference. 
---
I never did find a reliable fix sorry, I seem to get it less often now, but I think that's just by pure luck.
---
Crafting. Lots of crafting. Thats what its used for x.x Craft enough and you can crash the server.
---
Yes, it is, lol
---
I didn't SEEK revenge, jackwagon. I opted out and it still counted him as an enemy for God knows why, which led to him hunting me down freely and without penalty until I shut down the game.
---
Is there a reason for the attitude or were you born this way? 
---
This is just an educated guess from a lvl 118, but I think it's just random.  I'd guess that events in the forest and toxic valley have a higher chance to drop plans for metal and leather armor, as they're considered lower end gear.  (I still wear a 3 star heavy leather left arm with great effects, so it's not junk to be able to put great mods on "low end" armor)
---
I know the recipe for deep pocketed leather armor mods, and I'll be happy to craft the mod onto every piece you have if you like.  It's xp and gives me a reason to pick up animal pelts and teddy bears again.  I'm more than happy to take the time to kit you out.  Otherwise I'm usually just wandering around Watoga killing robots for lead scrap and legendary gear.
---
Ok, why am I getting hate for saying that I know a guy who handed in 8000 tech data? I know he duped it, and he got about 1400 Initiate paints, but why are you guys hating on me? Like reddit makes me sick, i wish could cut my throat. I hate my life, what is the point anymore?
---
I have no issues whatsoever with the cosmetic shop, or the prices in it, or the way that you aquire atoms naturally. And while the loudest of us might complain about that I don't think many people do.
---
And I simply think has fallout 76 done everything the same but used that engine to build the game, most the issues that we have run into, and the bugs and such, wouldn't be issues at all. Using a 10yo engine for a AAA game just wasn't the best call. And I think it could have looked and felt immensely better had they went with something new and polished. 
---
Right? Looks awesome. 
---
EXPLOSIONS!
---
They took a page from XCOM
---
Lol. I am not looking to discuss outerworlds. I am looking to discuss how fallout 76 could have functioned, felt, looked and played much smoother had they went with that engine. Perhaps it wouldn't be nearly as unstable or glitchy, and it certainly would have looked and felt like a new age AAA game. 
---
Were these items responsibly procured?
---
I've never had my base cleared out by someone, but I have built some VERY intricate bases using a lot of tricks to make things look/clip right.
---
   
---
If someone destroyed my base it would literally uproot hours upon hours of effort, I'd have to repair all at the CAMP. There's no way I could ever in a million years replace my CAMP, considering I get a little wild with it everywhere I move.
---
I dread the day someone comes across what looks like a ton of effort and blows it away while I'm elsewhere or afk. Luckily people haven't, even weird strangers kinda just gawk at the base and give me a thumbs up. Still. It'd be nice if I had the same recovery method as everyone else. I *could* repair everything, but it'd take a day of real effort getting the fluxes for my arch and such.
---
Honestly don't think anyone would wreck it. I'm 150, and my CAMPs are a bit more nuanced than a brick box, so hopefully there'd be a tad bit of mercy. I don't pvp much at all, but I'll roll over someone if they need to be rolled over. Either way, knowing its a potential and there's a good chance I can't do a damn thing about it stinkssss.
---
Are there not action movies in your country? Never watched scary movies as a kid? Bet you're real fun at parties. Also they aren't shooting *people* in the face, they're shooting mutated creatures. You got mutated creatures where you live?
---
I picked up a TSE handmade and radium rifle for 400/200 caps from a vendor. People are just selling them for caps they're so common now lol. 
---
In what way? Having better graphics than online games? Or newer engines? 
---
Note: with padded armor mod, you need all 3 ranks of the perk in my experience 
---
Why do you have to hate on me? You make me want to kms, my friend who duped 8000 tech datas for himself and a few others handed all those in and see if they could get BoS paint, but they only got 1400 initiate paints only. I was there to watch them but did not contribute. So why are you hating on me? Is it cause you think I duped 8k data? Thanks for ruining people’s lives.
---
I think it happens when you press tab as soon as you load in. Really annoying though cause you have to go back to main menu and look for another server after
---
Your welcome.  Please excuse my constant sorting of the EVERYTHING tab.  Im wanting it to show in specific groupings where mods show up under the Base Item plan....and then mix that in with everything from weapons to wearables to camp items...just taking me a minute to OCD it out :)
---
Yes, and with the right build far beyond any TSE. 
---
As a pure sniper you will always have a hard time in a silo when it comes to damage and resistance. You should consider a change of perks to be a little more 'tanky', especially for silo runs.
---
Perks to use are e.g the sluggers (S) for melee, commando (P) for automatics, weapon artisan and/or makeshift warrior (both I) for weapon durability.
---
I prefer knocking out everything with my super sledge. Saves a lot of ammo. 
---
Scrapped junk is in the junk tab, but broken down to base components. You can bulk some junk components to reduce weight.
---
Pickup lead gears springs and screws
---
Ballistic Fiber is used to repair nearly every piece of armor 20-50. I'm surprised you haven't noticed, unless your in power armor 100% of the time. It's also very hard to come by. 
---
Rebuilding DLC in 2020
---
1. Steel, lead sometimes plastic for ammo and some repairs. Aluminum, fiber, screws, springs... You can figure all you need by just repairing your gear and looking what is needed for repair. Apart from steel and lead don't hold in your stash more than 100, and sometimes more than 50. 
---
2. You can roam from the start
---
Its alright bro, thanks tho. Im pretty sure the paint you’re talking about is Initiate which i have, unless you have another type of bos t60 paint, i’m on xbox so yeah.
---
Damn, bethesda was not prepared in the slightest
---
Some of yall are real fuckin killjoys. As if none of you guys ever played a game or watched something that was meant for an older audience. Yall act like yall didnt go to Pornhub when yall were 14 and clicked "I am 18 or older".
---
I do this all the time. Whenever I see some fresh vault dweller, I'll drop a couple plans, some ammo, a decked out level 1 pipe gun, and some diluted stimpacks in the cache at the Overseer's C.A.M.P. since my shop is just a bit North. 
---
Roam whenever you want. There's no timers on missions unless it's an event that shows a timer on your screen. So you can take your time and explore, and that's half of the fun in any Fallout game. Go wherever it looks interesting.
---
Collecting parts, look at your crafting options on a weapon or armor workbench, and take note of the items you need the most of. Good basic examples are things like adhesive, screws, and ballistic fiber, which come up in a lot of mods and crafting plans. If you find something with those parts (example: Desk Fans and Typewriters have screws), make sure to grab it.
---
"Scrap Junk" basically means take everything in the "junk" part of your inventory apart for spare parts. For example, a Desk Fan weighs 3 pounds base, but if you scrap it, you take it apart and get Gears, Screws, and Steel, which weigh less (think of it like taking the useful parts out and discarding the rest). Basically you should always use the "Scrap All Junk" option pretty much every time you're at a workbench, in order to reduce weight. Never store unscrapped Junk in your Stash Box or it'll fill up too fast.
---
If you did not dupe or access the QA room then the only thing reason I would think you got the ban might of been the fact you admitted to using the carry weight glitch
---
If you are using s weapon ensure to have make shift weapon perk equipped to increase the life if the weapon. Similar to the gunsmith perk.
---
You will find a weapons bench and other crafting stations after getting to a depth if the silo
---
Of you have trouble shooters armor or weapons I highly recommend equipping them as the Mr.Gutys can deal a lot of dmg.
---
Of you do not use power armor be sure to have white Knight equipped to increase your armors durabilility
---
Make sure you have plenty of healing items such as stimpaks or food buffs to regenerate health fast.
---
Also Med+x and Rad-X help reduce a lot of dmg and potential dmg
---
At a certain point if you can hack any terminal you encounter to disable or use the turrets to kill the randomly generated mobs.
---
Also from personal experience it feels like every time the silo generates new waves of mobs they become increasingly stronger
---
The proper preparation will either lead to success or a waste of time and be ready to spend a minimum of 15-20 mins k. The silo if you do not know what you are doing. My first attempt took 40 then I was able to stream line it from experience.
---
A good perk balance and weapon kit will help you a lot. I recommend doing the AWOL event at robco to test out your chances because it spawn's the exact same mobs. 
---
Good luck
---
Are you doing a lot of Cranberry Bog events?
---
You haven't seen the Plan: Ultracite Gatling Laser go by, have you?
---
I have not seen it, no.
---
Its a Rifle no matter the barrel. I only care if Heavy Gunner actually affects it. Thus I might need to make a new character, haha... or just play around with my Perk allocations. Give my Melee monster a Heavy side build.
---
Right next to top of the world, almost directly right of the pleasant valley train station, there’s a T shaped road intersection. You can build there, there’s dirt, water, near a train station, it’s flat, and it’s almost perfectly centralized. It’s quite literally the perfect spot. You can make a base or a checkpoint there or something 
---
It's a progressing story. so we'll have to see.
---
I've been hunting for that thing for weeks. :'(
---
I'm going to try Distant Thunder with the recon scope. I usually just kill all the scorched.
---
Go outside, build a small low key rug, and place the pressure plate on it. Pick up the rug. You'll have the plate coming along with it. Now you can place it on any level you'd like!
---
Mild bitch to get the plate to stick to the rug, do it on a level surface.
---
I'm doing the same thing on ps4. A word of warning - learning mods for this gun is really tough! 
---
Mr. De Worde
---
Thanks.. That's kind of what's making me think I'll should just pass.
---
It is used for higher level weapon, armour and power armour mods and recipes (like mutation serums) etc.
---
It's the first ever Institute Synth, Prototype Kitty 1.0
---
The games completely fucked and i have seen alot of complaints about it but never that the story is way to depressing. I bet youre super intelligent and im not being sarcastic. Anyways i gave up on the game about a month ago. Good luck. 
---
I can't even stay connected for 5 minutes. Just boots me. I'm on 50/20 Megabit internet connection with no downloads happening and it boots me every single time! I haven't been able to play for weeks!
---
The guy said to go look at them in other games. Read man it isnt a hard concept.
---
Does a catheter count?
---
I can confirm this works as a viable work around, rather than relogging or not using PA.
---
I haven't bought it. So I can't try.
---
I'm on PlayStation and it's been terriable all day. I just lost out on all my loot from a long whitesprings run. Over 25 harden mass gone because I got kicked then spawned couldn't move got killed and kicked again. I was on my way to drop off my stuff when. I got kicked the first time. 
---
All that flux collected gone. All that loot gone. Ugh.
---
As responsibly as possible. Not bought from obvious or known dupers. Most of it self farmed. The high end items are traded or bought and their path the me is about as hard to trace as a dollar bill.
---
I've never seen a legendary mirelurk queen, but then again, the number of queens I've run across outside of Scorched Earth probably amounts to less than 20.  They usually pop up with some breathing room and it's kinda obvious something is amiss, but this one came out of nowhere.  I usually carry a handful of plasma grenades and toss a couple into the middle of a lake area to draw mirelurks out of the mud.  I guess I was just overconfident because I'd already killed 3-4 glowing mirelurks and 2 kings.  I wasn't expecting more.
---
After the first couple of times I tried just sitting still for a minute or 2 and make sure everything loads in and it was still doing it. It's a little better now but still happening for a couple seconds after loading in
---
Mine didn't work tonight either
---
Do you have the link by any chance? Would like to see the original post, for curiosity if nothing else 
---
I cant use vats in this game. The idea of real time vats was so profoundly stupid that it stuns me. Vats doesnt hit anything at all and the percentage changes so fast that you fire its 95 but by the time the bullet hits the chance is 0 again. 
---
I recommend mapping out what you want using this...
---
[https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)
---
I don't personally like gun builds because maintaining ammo can be such a pain in the butt depending on how much you play. 
---
Console seem buggy af. 
---
Its a glitch that happens sometimes. Seen it for several weeks occasionally.
---
I'm still salty I paid full retail for it one week before prices fell
---
I have that recipe learned. Odds are I got it from an event, world spawn recipe, or mire/bog picked lock lvl3... farmed those pretty hard looking for something.
---
processing.... processing... continuing processing.
---
A scarecrow with a face
---
No mp removes the need for huge amounts of dev time.
---
No balancing, no netcode, no endgame, no extension of content.
---
It could pan out to be a one and done 30 hour playthrough and you can't be dissappointed as that is an expectation for single player story driven games.
---
I still die when shooting my harpoon gun closer than 6 feet away, so it depends on much damage you're doing. 
---
Yeah I feel bad for the guy in my last server that had just launched a nuke and didnt even land yet when the server crashed 
---
If you wanted to be taken seriously you shouldn't have posted using a clickbait title and a trailer for a video everyone has seen, and the comparisons of which we have heard a thousand times.
---
Why would Bethesda licence an engine when they have their own? Especially since 76 is a side project, a literal stopgap between games.   
---
The Outer Worlds looks great, I'll probably get it. It's a very different game from 76, or any Fallout game. 
---
I was annoyed the hot rod was a limited time.
---
First PA colour job for a while I was after.
---
This is where the fun begins 
---
/s 
---
Purely from functionality, I have been really enjoying my Pole Hook with swing speed, anti-armor, and reduced weight. It seems to reach further than other 2 hand weapons. Super Sledge for example I always miss with because Im too far away even though the enemies feel very close and with the pole hook I end up hitting things I think are way too far away.
---
For looks, its hard to hate on grogs axe. For random mobs Id say Instigator, +1 Strength\~
---
PC
---
How is this in a worse state than when it launched!? Just WOW! I came back after 3 weeks away... constant disconnects, and when i do get in, half of the time i open my inventory and the whole game locks up aside from being able to open the main menu and map... can't move, can't do jack but stand there. 
---
Also when i load into the game, the loading screen turns into a black image of the area i'm in, then it loads up a black screen, the loading icon in the bottom right spins like a top, and it dumps me into the world, with INSANE pop in! 
---
I wanted to grind the few atoms needed for the Red Rocket garage door... i can't even do that much anymore. What a disaster! 
---
the first step Beth should do is create another marine helm item and make the test room one a dunce cap.
---
I think Bethesda's reticent to add under-armor to the Atom Shop since it actually has non-cosmetic benefits with the various Lining mods, and they committed to only offering cosmetic microtransactions. I wonder how many people would cry foul about that, even if it was effectively the same thing as a weapon/armor skin and you still had to unlock and craft the Lining mod.
---
I just wish they didn't convert some of the under-armors from Fallout 4 into over-armor, like the Green Shirt &amp; Combat Boots or the Army Fatigues. And I'm not ashamed to admit I'd spend some of my f2p Atoms if they gave us the fancy suits the Operators wore as under-armor in Nuka World.
---
Steve is my neighbor too! He's quiet &amp; usually keeps to himself (best neighbor ever).
---
Or at least break it down. I got 1000 .38 rounds i wont use and should be able to convert it to .45 or .308. Or whatever. 
---
Is he the responder's companion. Love that thing, wish we could get him as a companion
---
I've had three spawn constantly, once at my camp I killied them all for messing up my lawn but. On a serious note it's a combination of server lag and timing.
---
Very well could be. It also doesn't have the budget of a triple A game. But as it's being made from the same producers of fallout NV I have high hopes. That was my favorite of the newer generation personally.
---
Fo76 has no pvp balancing and no end game thus far either haha.
---
And my post isn't really referencing what the game itself will be like so much as the difference in engine quality, graphics, and what looks to be a lot smoother combat. And how fo76 as the exact same game as it is now, but with their engine would have made for a much more beautiful and polished looking game. 
---
Bethesda had to know people would be duping. Why they weren’t prepared for this is beyond me. Then again it doesn’t shock me at all
---
Well don't let that stop you, "darling", I know you're burning to let everyone know how good of a gamer you are at optimizing your builds. You know we care sooo much about how the game is properly played, "darling". 
---
Test it out and tell me how much xp you get for doing it for an hour, then compare that to the much more fun option of killing things in the wasteland for an hour.
---
Show your work.
---
Am I too late? did I miss it?
---
I mean they could shill it off as a shin for like the harness or something. I love the corset because thicc thighs save lives.
---
I would be very careful making a video about this if Beth isn't responsive to your attempts to contact them. You don't want to end up being the messenger that gets shot if they decide to go zero tolerance and have a poor support system in place.
---
So the other Faschnacht masks are truly unobtainable until later? That's next level disappointing for me.
---
No response from OP from any comments, i'm thinking karma farmer. Also no proof of notice of ban. However, if you were banned and cheated the game. Good. You deserve it. 
---
That closed fissure has been there from launch, sorry to burst your bubble. 
---
The Unreal Engine was made in 1998. The Creation Engine was first used in 2011. Newer does not equal better. Updated equals better, BGS needs to upgrade their current engine to accommodate modern systems better. That's all. 
---
Yep
---
I've seen them in a couple places in the Forest but they haven't attacked me.
---
One's linked to the [Collision Course](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Collision_Course) event at the airport, non-hostile.
---
I saw the other fly over the Sutton station. I didn't notice if it was hostile but I didn't see it attack.
---
Haven't heard anyone else talk about the game. Haven't seen the trailer until today. Unlike many of you, I don't spend that much time on reddit. But I posted something which I thought was a pretty neat trailer. The title was no less "click baity" than any other title, and said exactly what I was thinking.
---
Bethesda is using an engine over 10 years old. And instead of coming out with a newer one or liscencing another one, they just keep eiditng their current engine. Patches upon patches. Why would they use another engine you ask? Because the visual and performance quality of the game would increase expenentially. Same game but with that engine wouldn't have come packed with all the issues this one has.
---
I have a feeling there might be one more non online fallout, before they all move to online, or at very least partial online. There is simply a lot more money to be made in online games.
---
It does look great, and I'm excited to try it out. It might be different but looks to have a similar feel. Which is what I'm excited about. Total fallout fan boy since fallout 1, so I enjoy anything that carries a similar feel. 
---
No I mean I literally scrap it while they’re smugly capping it waiting to one shot me lol. 
---
This is some really great work! Thank you! 
---
It also confirms my suspicion that the build categories were more or less thrown together haphazardly and rushed out the door. Hence the several plans with confusing names etc. 
---
I actually saw some people do it to get the scorched mirelurk queen. She spawned like 6 times so was easy xp. 
---
So that's where all the free non atom shop paints are. Locked away in the QA  room so we are forced to spend time or money for some shitty $18 paint set from their atom shop.
---
Fair point. And yes, upgrade or get a new one.
---
Hipfire or Accuracy is for VATS only, range benefits it, recoil shouldn't matter in VATS considering the snappy aimbot like feature of it. If you aim yourself accuracy (magnetic bullets) doesn't matter, only the range and recoil will matter from those 3 types.
---
Post it everywhere. All the duped items will be trash once they release 5 star legendary effects. Before that time comes, it's better to get them to patch this stuff and they dont give a fook about support ticket submissions. Basically mass public outcry is the only thing they care about.
---
Same here. Many freeze and some disconnects. Quite annoying.
---
There’s nothing wrong with duping 
---
Right on the money here!
---
The reason we see hundreds of extra junk and mods still get scrapped is because of bulking, (unless you have 50+ steel mods saved up)
---
Its closed? Looked very green and open to us and gave off rads but maybe we just missed it. Thank you. 
---
I was more referring the damage difference between the assault rifle in fallout 3 compared to the Chinese assault rifle in fallout 3, not to mention I’m not a big fan of the design of the hand made rifle it was clearly hand made, I prefer the elegant design of the Chinese assault rifle 
---
There is a perk card that you hear a sound when you are near a magazine. That is how I found most of mine. So far I have:
---
Nuka Tapper
---
Red Menace
---
Grognak &amp; The Ruby Ruins
---
Wastelad
---
Atomatron
---
Don't remember where I found them all, but 3 of them I found with the perk card.
---
Not saying you're wrong but afawk people might be doing the same procedure to try duping. Or other worse procedure. 
---
So it might be "wannabe dupers".
---
I know about the Morgantown one fro. That event. 2 of them have been left side of the map and not anywhere near Morgantown or anything else. 
---
In the time it takes you to build 150 crops, you could've killed way more than 1 glowing one (at least 450 xp)
---
Not exactly an efficient way to level. 
---
That would work if people would stop nuking it and making it impossible to go or leave the place without being decked out for war 
---
Slow down. You know that there's actually a screen there that will tell you you're about to scrap a mod for resources while crafting or repairing?  All you need to do is pay attention to what you're doing...
---
The vendor robot at harpers ferry carries decent plans and mods as well as weapons.. Worth a try.. Server hop if you can't see them at first
---
*raises hand* Never have gotten the drop. Have had a few TS drops, but nothing explosive for this vault-dweller yet (lvl 81, 200+ hrs)
---
There is no place that cannot be improved with MST3K refs.  Fallout 76 is no exception.
---
The only plan that sells for 11000 caps. It *has to be* a database error. 
---
Also, it's interesting that it's called "signs and lettering" instead of "neon letters" or something. 
---
Magic
---
And you can make bullets from the lead that is somehow totally not graphite.
---
This! I always thought it was weird that after left the vault it was just empty. If they make a second instance one would be for when we leave and we can't get back into that one but then another could be where forced open the door and made a trading hub of the vault and that one we can reenter and leave freely. 
---
I saw him alone and at full health, but I shot him with a TSE Shotgun assuming it was a nomal deathclaw. I was so sad when i went to loot and saw the name... Never seen him alive before.
---
Water, fire, air and dirt, fucking enclave bunker, how does it work?
---
Or, do you have empath?
---
Then why are you here 
---
Yes. Be certain the card is off first. Take serum and put it back on to lock it in. 
---
Are you people serious? Instead of telling Bethesda to get their head together and fix the issues you blame players for exploiting this buggy mess? These kind of things shouldn't be possible in the first place let alone being allowed to happen for so long.  
---
In any other mmo these kind of issues are being patched within hours yet in the case of this game it takes them days and days to fix.  
---
You can like the game all you want but if you are being so soft on Bethesda for all this mess, guess what, in the next game these things will happen again.
---
TSE miniguns are all over, I have like 20k ammo for mine
---
So I just did this yesterday and I love it
---
Very cool and creative.  If I'd never been to the locale before, I'd assume it was in the game until exploring the interior.  I have a degree in painting and work as a graphic designer, so I'm starting to get more into camp building now that I have a lot of plans and a few nice pieces from the shop.

I'm also a huge fan of the American version of The Office.  On PC, Schrute Farms is just north of Whitesprings station along the flat track area.  (my character is Dwayne Schrute, Dwight and Angela's great grandson) I have a two story brick farmhouse with a second story porch, complete with an interior and exterior garden, all the amenities and three upstairs guest suites with America, night-time and irrigation themes.  I've gotten so many visitors since moving adjacent to the train station.  It's (mostly) always pretty fun to have someone else at your house, except when they keep stepping in front of you as you're trying to cook some food.  I had a level 19 visitor today dressed in a clown suit that was relentlessly teabagging in front of me for a good 5 minutes until they got bored and left.  I almost gave them a lvl 15 two-shot 10mm smg I was saving until they started passive-aggressively harassing me.

Was fighting the SBQ 2 days ago with some friends. As Always we were fighting her at the Dropsite V9. We were killing her really quick, took us less then 7 minutes. However she died when she was in the air and fall back all the way from Dropsite v9 to the fissure. As soon as she was over the fissure, she dropped down into the fissure and disappeared. Nobody could loot her.
---
Had yao guai there; not as numerous as the ghouls, but they just seemed to keep spawning in front of the cabins. Has only happened once. Quite the teddy bear picnic.
---
My main speculation is, since they released the game earlier than they should. That they rushed even the CAMP feature of the game, there should have been half walls. But they cut content in order to release it quickly. And they had to patch the sides with some metal panels so that they could release it in the atom shop.

 That's in one or the prerelease videos(Fallout 76 An Intro to C.A.M.P.), you can see that they had a camp where it's front door is different than what we can build, and unsurprisingly, seem like our little red rocket rolling door would fit perfectly there!
---
They should delete the characters of the dupers with insane over encumbrance so the items are gone
---
Or just delete the dupers lol
---
What you should be collecting mostly depends on what you're trying to build. Universally useful crafting components are adhesive, aluminum, ballistic fiber, gears, lead, springs, and screws - you'll need some of those for crafting or repairing most everything. Steel and wood are the most common components you'll both find, and need. Also, from your inventory or crafting menus, you can tag certain crafting components for search; this makes it so that when you hover your crosshair over any junk that has a tagged component, it'll highlight with a magnifying glass item so you'll know it's something you want. You can bulk components at a Tinker's workbench with some plastic, but in most cases bulking doesn't lighten your load, it just makes it easier to sell off excess scrap.
---
You can roam whenever you want. It's an open-world game, that's the whole theme. Certain areas don't scale down to a certain level, so you won't be able to go *anywhere* and be comfortable taking on bad guys until level 30-35ish, but the game was built for you to explore at your own pace.
---
Scrap all junk just converts all of your junk into its base components - some junk items like Baseballs or Hardened Mass aren't auto-scrapped, this means they're used in certain crafting recipes but you can still manually scrap them if you want. It all goes in your normal inventory, and you can store it in your stash when you find a stash box. All crafting stations draw from your stash box, so you don't need to pull stuff out of it to craft anywhere. You should also spend some time collecting and manually scrapping excess weapons and armor, since that's the main way you learn mods. Just be careful not to scrap equipment you're actually using!
---
Where did you get the code?
---
Because he's the guy that goes "who's with me?" and no one responds. He's still waiting for validation a month later.
---
All of the BoS T60 paints are still included in LL_Armor_PowerArmor_T60_Mods_BoS_Materials, which is still included as a possible result in LLS_BoS_QuestRewards_Clothes, itself part of LLS_BoS_Event_QuestRewards, part of the reward structure for Forbidden Knowledge. As far as FO76Edit can determine, all of the T60 BoS paints are *supposed* to drop from that quest (but getting into the QA room is faster for cheaters).
---
Plus, the Brotherhood Fatigues are under armor and they're cosmetic items with no stats.
---
If they tried that, people would lose their minds
---
I get what you're saying, but Zenimax were never going to let BGS spend more money than absolutely necessary to get 76 out. It was never going to be an enormous success on the scale of Fallout 4 or Skyrim. It's a side project, with reused assets and code from Fallout 4. I don't say that to hate on the game, I'm loving it. 
---
Do I wish it were smoother? Sure. I definitely wish there were fewer bugs. But honestly, I think if they'd used the Unreal engine the development would've dragged even longer since it would be brand new to them. They know their engine, how it (mostly) works and its' quirks. For a side project, it's fine. The ability to have a short development time is probably a large reason this game was released in the first place, in my opinion. 
---
Now looking into the future with TES and Starfield, I'm really hoping for a more stable engine. I won't hold my breath. 
---
No problems with it ever on XBOX One X
---
I've had the two shot assault rifle and that was crap in Vats, so I kept using the handmade which is amazing in Vats, then I found a two shot handmade..and its was crap in Vats, this is a genuine bug..I wanna get rid of my crappy two handmade..but then they might fix it..and I have to find another..grrr
---
Amazon. They sent it to me in the mail. It was one of those disc cases that just has the cardboard circle with the code on it.
---
Giant flying bats with inbuilt sound cannons? Make sense.
---
Supermutant behemoths? Make sense.
---
A vast hive mind that operates between species? All good.
---
Innate ability to use all types of weapon and armor? No problem.
---
Nukes going off every 10 minutes but everything is OK a short time later? Sounds fine.
---
Floors not lining up between cells? Burn it all to the ground.
---
Lol, knew it.

Kinda over the top?

---
They don't care. They don't even have tools to remove items from the game. They can't do anything. They stated that.
---
When you see how they released the game... 
---
Would they though? I mean it's all cosmetic
---
There are only options to repair or scrap, there’s no option to store. Tried it on a broken generator and turret.
---
He’s got two left crab hands.
---
We technically only know of them from pre war new england area, nothing in the lore that i can remember suggested them being in any sort of area in the southern east coast
---
No, it further proves that a lot of items were to be in the game initially, but they cut as much as they could so they could release them later as MTX. But they didn't know which order they were gonna be released, so you can see in the first picture that they have a floor that it's gonna be released in the future.
---
A scorched literally will be holding the gun to its own head and still hit me lol 
---
Just got done playing for 2 hours without a disconnect on PC. 
---
I read somewhere that the next fallout and elder scrolls will be on the same engine.
---
I suppose as someone else pointed out that other engines are older and run smoother with better graphics. So what they really need to do is spend resources and time revamping the current engine from the ground up. If they want to use their own engine.
---
I've enjoyed the game a lot. Have hundreds of hours played. But it definitely is extremely glitchy and unpolished. And there is definitely no end game whatsoever. Which is kind of lame. I've put it aside until they release the first expansion. After killing the queen 50 times. Lol. But that is an entirely different story.
---
Mostly I think that a better or improved engine would do amazing things for any future games. 
---
I got that too damn it. I had to remove the top floor to place it.
---
No it shouldn't because then you could have armor that's resistant to everything. Why would you ever take it off
---
People are raging now over the lack of stuff and you want to give them stuff they cant see 24/7, just adding fuel to the fire IMO 
---
They should work on better pricing, better limited time ideas and maybe new items as a whole 
---
Just a joke about two shot explosive weapons and the massive amount of duping that happened to everybody has some. I don't think this poster existed in fallout 4, at least I couldn't find a picture of it
---
Ohhhhh. That sucks. I've had her fall off the map
---
Add me - okaypirate
---
It's clearly from Problem Child.
---
Figured that out too. Was limited to use shot, medium or long normal or recon scope and that was a big inconvenience for me as I only use it as sidearm for my melee character.
---
Nah it’s true. Speed demon makes it so that no other speed boosts work. Not sure if it’s intended tho
---
Plus that has been the trade off in literally every other game to my knowledge.
---
I didn't buy it. I was confused for the first 5 minutes of looking it as I logged in. I had to go in game to my camp and see for the ingame preview. Then I made this post, and fortunately it stopped some people from spending 700 atoms on that. Others got it though.
---
It has been
---
This. My camp was up there. It happened all the time but no nukes were ever dropped. 
---
You can see the under armor if you just don't wear an outfit over it.   
---
I agree with the better pricing and stuff too, I just feel they should also add under armor in with the new items.
---
Send a E-Mail to Amazon and Tell them the code is already redeemed. 
---
You’ve only reached level 5. You aren’t special, the game is messed up for everyone. 
---
yes, yes and you banged my mum too didn't you?
---
It'd be mine but I'm melee and they didn't add Ballistic Fists. :(
---
there are many fisures closed or open around the map that are not marked. 
---
I have stumbled on at least four spread out through the savage divide and cranberry bog. 
---
Take a look at this prerelease picture, it's from an official video about C.A.M.P.s http://imgur.com/a/Ftoi6z6
---
I had noticed that in a while. And was expecting them to add these half walls. You can see that without those metal panels on each side, it would fit perfectly in their entrance in the picture. Guess they had to cut content to release it in the time schedule.
---
Woosh
---
My first jump scare was a doll next to a pile of various junk items on the floor behind a locked door in the Helvetia meadhouse.  There’s a random Ferris wheel animal in there which initially made me wonder, then I start scrounging around through the junk and the doll launches at me and bounces around the room.  I had my mic on at the time and I yelped, my friends teased me but in the end it was funny.
---
\~sniff sniff\~ Whats that smell? Oh... Oh I think its your shoes... you've been walking on the ranch a little too long cowpoke.
---
What lv is the shotgun and does it have a third trait 
---
I’ve found hidden junk and power armour, I’ve dumped literally everything to bring my weight to 0 picking it all back up sometimes has surprises or resets “missing” things
---
Players shouldn't be penalized for wanting to just roam around  in under armour so I get where you are coming from.
---
I wish the skins would more general - one for all PA models and one for all other armors (combat, under armour etc) 
---
Thank u for the information ! I finally decided to buy it. As u mentioned earlier, the garage door looks cleaner and much more decorated. Lovin it !

ONE FUCKING ONLINE GAME, Bethesa makes. One online game. And it's not so great as everyone expected. And suddenly they're the worst company in the world.
---
You unloyal fucks have no back bone.
---
Reported.
---
Umm actually, pretty sure those plans are for the ultimately silly "Picket Sign Weapon"
---
“Oops”
---
Like the idea but the nerf affected all glowing ones so it’s really just down to concentration of ghouls and time to kill. I really don’t think there’s any place with more ghoul mobs than white spring in the game right now so in my mind white spring is still king.
---
Yes and yes. If you get a hit on the legendary you'll get your own loot. Same goes with the SBQ.
---
Yeah I know! Sometimes I’ll just travel to random people on the map and demand caps. 20 caps and I’ll leave ya alone!  Some people pay, but most don’t. So I break their stuff until they decide to retaliate. To which I two shot melee them to death then run away because shit. I got the kill and their junk haha. PvP is a bunch of funun this game. I gotta try to get my bounty up like this. That sounds like fun!!
---
I’ll give you 1500 for it 
---
There's plenty of player demand for shotgun shells. Find someone to trade them to.
---
Can you wait until tomorrow?
---
For a sec I thought this was gonna be about low level players in high level areas ruining all the enemy levels. :s
---
Shame on them though.
---
Ya sure just remind me
---
Touching on private servers, but it would be nice if they had variety with player caps and other settings, I wouldn’t mind 32 or more players. 
---
Alright
---
You'd be surprised how much sloppiness I have found in game. Like I remember seeing some chalk drawings in some roof in Grafton. They had little butterflies drawn with chalk, and every butterfly was the same, like, pure copy paste, at least put some effort! As a graphics designer, I hate to see so much sloppiness and "whateverness".

The fallout 76.exe account for most errors in event log. Most of them indicate unknown or cross thread.

I don't know what to say.

People have been paying actual cash for items. 
---
I don't think you'd get in trouble for picking up dropped junk. 
---
Exotic weapons and locksmith both already existed. 
---
Granted if you put that on macro when it's bed time..
---
They added it patch, it kinda annoys me cuz I generally load fast so flickers to new image for like 0.5 seconds and just seems unnecessary. :s
---
you have to damage the enemy to get loot
---
Can confirm. Speed demon, as nice to have as it is doesn't stack. Although it's probably affected by 'strange in numbers'. Just like your jump height gets a decent boost from it, at least it did pre-patch. 
---
Am indeed a lady... and no disrespect taken.  Glad to see that you support women with male-patterned baldness or that like to cosplay as Colin Mochrie.
---
Either get them tagged or no loot for you. Drops are only shared within the team. Great fun competing against those armed with explosive weapons, who will use them despite bugging out the mobs, so that they become unlootable.
---
You're a God amongst men! 
---
That's ridiculous. All that does is encourage Griefers to ruin the game for everyone else. What's wrong with these Bethesda people? Another reason not to bother with work-shops. So if someone is a grub player, we should log out to escape? How ridiculous. 
---
Happy Cake Day adrkhrse! Today is your day. Dance with fairies, ride a unicorn, swim with mermaids, and chase rainbows.
---
why the hell isn't the marine helmet already in the base game? what the *fuck?*
---
Because with this engine, everything just works
---
I do see Locksmith here but nowhere else: https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/perk=1213
---
you got more info?
---
95% if they're not moving. It doesn't seem to account for that at all.
---
Put in a friend request. Will hit you up when I see you online. Thanks!
---
I could wear that dress and we could pass as twins!
---
Mine was in Valley Galleria, in the appliances store. Was just searching around, crouched, by a line of stoves and suddenly a radroach pops out an oven. Wasn't expecting it and it got me good,  haha 
---
For me, it works with dense + level 3 fireproof ONLY if I don't equip demolitionist. If I have demolitionist and shoot the ground below me or a player using demolitionist hits the ground below me, I'll take damage. Sitting at around 460 DR and 390 ER.
---
Used for CAMP lockmaking to protect your base. You can lock doors and containers. 
---
check his path on the map and then run along that stretch. a good chunk of his path takes only 10-20 min to do, and if you do it every day (i do it to gather plants and meat from mobs along the road), you're sure to run into him.
---
It’s very simple why you lose hair and facial hair. 
---
Bethesda is a lazy low effort company that utilize technology/tools from last century.
---
now hear me out before you downvote me, 
---
instead of taking some time and effort to actually optimize hairs to fit the hat/hoodie/ in order to avoid hairs clipping through them, they just do it the lazy way, it takes literally 1 second, make the hoodie occupy the hair slots, bam, your character is now magically bald, it looks ugly af and makes no sense. 
---
Or they could spend some of the money made from sales to actually develope a dynamic feature that automatically hide and scale part of the hair that clip through the hoodie, a lot of modern games nowadays already have this similar features, heck, even The Sim 4 has this feature, damn it makes me sad sometimes that Bethesda is so backwards thinking and lazy. (Same goes for the armor pieces, all the sweet armor pieces models goes to waste, why bother making them a model even if you are gonna hide them?)
---
Yeah, I just think that having more under armor and less outfits would be beneficial. You'd think that the outfits would be special items you could obtain by doing certain things, like say the ritual bindings if you went to a certain place and picked an average level lock at level 19, but no the outfits are more plentiful than the under armor.
---
Is that glitch back? I know it was a major issue just after release
---
The old fix was to unequip all the armour, store all cores so the only one you have is in the power armour, then run around till the core is out of charge then die and after respawn you should be able to exit the armour 
---
By no means should you get back in and you may lose the frame 
---
awesome cheers mate
---
I think those are deprecated perks, actually - like they existed during development, but Bethesda decided to cut them. "Exotic weapons" like the Crossbow or Black Powder guns just use Gunsmith, and iirc the effects of Locksmith (can lock settlement objects) are active by default for all characters. 
---
That said, they explicitly designed the perk card system in a way that they could easily add new perks, so I'm excited to see what they add.
---
Appreciate the help! Really just after the plans for now. Mostly a solo player as I like the challenge and also take my time with reading all the notes and stuff.
---
I may move on from Leather but I really just need something to cover my when I'm not in power armour. Might consider other armour options later when/if FCs become too rare/costly.
---
Anyhow, thanks again for your help man. We'll catch up soon :)
---
I bet you wished they were never miss...  huh?
---
I'm fairly sure I don't remember seeing this perk. it's not in Nukes and Dragons, either. or Exotic Weapons for that matter.
---
At least they banned people who entered the test room and some dupers apparently.
---
Warehouse?? Im intrested
---
Stalker legendary mod claims to add 100% vats when out of combat. That it does not BTW. 
---
How do you know that, that this is not the problem? The engine has a lot of issues. Skyrims Engine issues are also fixed by modders, because Bethesda doesn't care. They only care for their microtransaction updates... 
---
If only it were straight RNG. There seems to be some underlying funkiness with BGS's RNG in 76. Like Handmade plan at Watoga. 
---
Like it's impossible after a certain level. Wonder if that's the case elsewhere too. Maybe I missed my window to pickup those plans.
---
Maybe when the screen is loading our characters get in an elevator. I don’t know have to make our own sense for a lot of things. Also sense you brought this up I was just thinking the other day that there is a hanging sign in watoga that’s really low that doesn’t make sense because the cars driving on the road would definitely hit it.
---
Thanks anyhow. The general info is easy enough. It's the specifics that no one seems to be able to lock down anywhere I've looked.
---
Except its been in the game before all that tse duping madness. It probably is just a reference to spray n pray
---
you can get atoms by playing the game so i dont see problem :V 
---
I'll bear it in mind. Haven't been there yet so will add it to the to-do list :)
---
Sorry. Had read too many shitposts and was being cranky. 
---
Thankyou sir, may I have another.
---
I will give you 200 caps since ive been searching for ever and never found them
---
I'm very ok with that as well. Less outfits mean less weight lol 
---
Lore wise there’s good reasons but mechanically not so much.  The fact that we physically cannot go back in and jury rig the place with air vents and turn it into a trading hub is annoying.
---
Third rank fireproof and dense mod, no empathy mutation, still dying. What's wrong with my char?
---
Please make a video. If enough people start doing it, Bethesda will have no choice but to go the “nuclear option” and wipe everyone’s characters. 
---
People who absolutely love this game to death should have no problem starting back in Vault 76. Maybe with all the bug fixes, the game will be better the second time ‘round. 
---
Post your current build please.
---
Yeah, I know you didn't buy it. I mean refund on the free Atoms you spent. They're Atoms falsely spent on something that could be used for something else. 
---
Unless you're going to spend money on the game, those Atoms are only going to get more valuable over time as it gets harder to grind them out in-game.
---
I think at the most, if they buff the hazmat suits, they should just give them the same lining mods as underarmor like the Vault Suit, or adding them to the legendary pool. But yeah, the drawback for Hazmat suits' rad resistance is that you have to give up your regular armor, otherwise there'd be no reason to ever take the suit off. Same reason Gas Masks have the PER -2 debuff.
---
You know though... I have 15 Endurance and max rank Ironclad and Lifegiver cards. It won't be as good as power armor, but maybe I can get away with wearing a Hazmat suit to a nuke zone.
---
It's a shotgun, even if your aim is off the cluster of shots might hit cause of spread. It's even more stupid of its also explosive. Also two shot have bad acc for some weird reason the second shot tends to be way off the first
---
I felt this way, until I went to whitespring and made a [friend](https://i.imgur.com/C97UHvb.jpg) XD
---
I hate, absolutely HATE the floating houses. It offends me on some level. I think because I’m disappointed at the lack of imagination being used when there’s so much possibility. 
---
One of my favorite things to do is join randos and build stuff for them they don’t have plans for. 
---
So yeah, I probably shouldn’t be so harsh, but I just wanna smack everyone and shout “Do better!”
---
Spammed the craft button? But how did it got scrapped since it's not even the same menu?
---
My first one ever failed, weeks ago and another the other day, they just buggy. That's why I have about 90 of them in my inv...
---
WE LOVE YOU BOLSEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Maaaybe. Are you... single?
---
(every time I find those robots I think of the NPC conversations in Oblivion)
---
Have you considered adding these to one of the F76 wikis? I know some of them are quite lacking compared to older Fallout games. 
---
List of ressources ? Missed that on do you have link ? 
---
It seems most cba with launching nukes. Just not rewarding enough for the ball ache of smashing 100 bunker turrets.
---
The Enclave Bots on Parade events slay me. "Are those some new customers? ELIMINATE."
---
No, I mean, I didn't spend Atoms on the item(I didn't buy it with atoms). I don't have the item. I can't place it. I was previewing it, and said if I'm expected to spend Atoms on it it should be like in the pictures.
---
But yeah, bought/paid/spent use for real money/atoms gets people confused.
---
I know they are valuable since I am not gonna spend real money. I even had a nightmare the other day where I spent all my atoms on outfits and didn't have enough for floors!
---
I remember doing a strike once in destiny where this Blueberry was KICKING ASS. Dude saved my ass multiple times, clutched it at the end, and was generally just a badass. I sent an invite to my fire team after and when he joined it was a 7-8 yo kid. 
---
Immediately had to say, “hey man sorry, I don’t chat with kids on games. Good job though. You rock.” 
---
How anybody thinks it’s okay to do that is beyond me. 
---
But isn't every modern online game this generation an unreliable one at launch... 
---
Or at least more often than not. At least enough to break up a circle jerk.
---
They weigh more because they dont have the perks applied in your stash. If you notice a difference in your stash limit overnight you should check if you have any Inert flux in the Aid tab of your stash. When you store unstable flux it is fairly light but when it expires it turns into Inert flux that weight 1 each.
---
This happened to me before and my stash went passed the actual weight limit, was like 615/600.
---
I use stash boxes as a way to pad it out. Box on a shelf, toolbox next to a power armor station, stack metal or wood boxes in a corner. 
---
Playeress?  doesn't make sense.
---
Simple just add a recipe that converts Purified Water to Boiled Water. Make it not cost anything or have it make 5 or some number and only require one wood. Lore reason it would take less wood could be your only heating it not disinfecting it so less time needed on the heat. Would only need to add a simple recipe instead of modifications to all the recipes.
---
Why were you using explosives in a nuke zone without passive mode turned on?
---
Jesus Christ... I don't think the game was meant to be played that hard... Don't you ever just sit back and relax? Or play any other games?
---
You know you dont get wanted for shooting another player right?
---
Why the fuck dont you have pacifist on? Getting tired of ppl whining about that. Especially if u farming mats
---
Yup. I can’t tell you how many people I’ve joined are like, “wait what? Bulking makes stuff heavier?”
---
Only thing I bulk is lead and aluminum because they are lighter. 
---
Crafting can auto break down bulk, but it will take scrap or unscrapped junk (which is what mods count as) in preference to bulk because bulking costs plastic and you don’t get the plastic back from scrapping bulk. 
---
I’ve never had this be an issue since learning about it
---
There's two stash boxd in the whitesprings building.
---
I know that’s frustrating what they did, but if you plan on throwing grenades and/or mines  in crowds - especially the only place in the game people farm XP and legendaries AND if you have important junk on you; you need to have pacifist mode on. 
---
Why would you go into a nuke zone without pacifist on? 
---
A. Pacifist mode B. Don't take scrap to a nuke zone. Not BGS' fault.
---
How is that not fair that's how real life works. 
---
BOS vendor sells the mods afaik, I've never bothered scrapping for .50 mods.  
---
Price depends on your charisma and perks.
---
Or Y'know, the game could just not scrap items that aren't intended to be scrapped.... 
---
Hardened Mass would be auto scrapped too before this new update, so it isn't unfounded to think that maybe, just maybe they'd have spent the few extra seconds to fix autoscrap mods too... but w/e. I guess since they can't sell you the mods from the atomic shop they don't see a reason to fix anything thats wrong with them.
---
I made another design where a power connector that led to powered door wpuld be desroyed upon activating the switch, closing them permanently, but it doesnt work too. The moment the conmector is destoyed nothing happens and current still flows.
---
No way. Where'd they say that? About time big so. 
---
Pacifist. Use it, or lose it.
---
Yeah whats wrong is that people are saying tone it down because kids and....no.
---
The ERSB isn't binding, it is a guideline. The reason it doesn't include online content is because they obviously can't control that. They can say a game is a hard G rating but they can't stop you having |) 1ckface_McRap3 as your player name nor prevent you swearing over voice chat. It is annoying enough that games like Battlefield censor the text chat but have avatars who curse and swear and the game is also Mature rated. The fact ERSB doesn't cover online content also doesn't negate the fact the game is, at its core, a Mature audience game.
---
What you are literally trying to do is demand people stop going to XXX shows in case someone brings a kid along.

In a game marked Mature with the ability to swear like a sailor with touretts and kill others regardless of their IRL age I SHOULD be free to do exactly that. There is nothing wrong with wanting to do that. That's what the game caters for. What it doesn't and shouldn't cater for is underage kids being let unsupervised into a mature content world. Kids literally shouldn't be there, nor should I be expected to act like they have some sort of right to be there and to curtail my actions in case they are present. Do you not see what is wrong with your argument? Down your road is no blood, no drug use, no violence, no... well no Fallout game. No COD game. No BF game. No many many games.
---
And you still haven't explained how an underage kid who got the game for free has a higher right to the gaming experience than a person who had to pay for it out of their own pocket. 
---
This argument again :P  You don't get many atoms after a Power armor skin and a few camp items, they go quick!  
---
Waiting for them to do a "Where Carry Weight &gt; 100,000 -&gt; Delete character"
---
do a high pass and get the most bang for your buck.
---
I figured out it's actually a great way to farm stimpacks. Which I still run out of sometimes. 
---
It is easier though to just let the workshop get taken, and then do the event to capture it back 
---
Think it has to do with them limiting the number of armor slots that are tracked on your character at any given time. In FO4 the PA was tracked as a separate part of your inventor slots, in FO 76 it seems to be tracked in the same slots as standard armor. I'd venture to guess to save on data between client and server side to reduce packets. But that's me talking out my ass. But it seems reasonable. 
---
I clicked through and did *not* expect Peter Hollens. HA! He's definitely at Peak Geek in this one.
---
To be fair, Bethesda ruined it first. 
---
What platform are you on? I'll sell you some screws and springs. Also have a full excavator armour for sale or trade 😁
---
Alopecia in Appalachia :P
---
Well, I don't own one either. I had quite a few pass thru my hands while trading, buying low - selling high, but didn't keep one. I do own an AA-exp shotgun, which, arguably, is even a worse offender, but use it only for queen, as it's just boring otherwise.
---
It happens when you have non equipped armour for that body part in your inventory, like combat or leather, stash it and it'll stop.. 
---
Locksmith existed during BETA, then they got rid of it and now anyone can create locks in their CAMP. 
---
Exotic Weapons was in BETA too, but seems to have been deleted and not replaced with anything else. Which is annoying.
---
Holy, thank you for reminding me. Good times!
---
Or in the train station just outside, also usually outside of the blast zone where players wait.
---
Also the spa across the hall has way too many clipboards on the front desk, each containing springs.
---
After hours of collecting you never once thought to store it? That sounds like a you problem.
---
Even a $15 game shouldn't be released in that state. That's an insult to all the great indie games. 
---
I recently bought FO76 also and really enjoying it. The only thing that bothers me is that coming straight from RDR2 to this, I'm finding that the graphics are quite poor, specifically the building textures. It can be a bit immersion breaking but I think that's more to do with how ridiculously good they are in RDR2 and being spoilt by that. Other than that, happy with my purchase
---
Welcome to online games kid we grind here :V
---
is the mouthpiece a part of the doctors outfit or is it separate? if it’s separate do you know what the item is? thank you!
---
Agreed if we can build power armor, the most advanced guns tech wise in the game like gatling lasers and gatling plasmas and a whole freaking building we can definitely jam open the vault door and jury rig the support system back on
---
I think I like the concept of event exclusives. Its cool that I can get a special Responder after doing Responder events. 
---
The chance for that to happen is just way too low. And the loot tables are horrible. There arent just exclusives on there, but also many cosmetics that you can already find elsewhere. For example the Black Cowboy Hat. You can get it in under 5 minutes in whitespring. Who would want to get it as a reward after hours or days of grinding events?
---
I'm not sure if I'd call [this](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/a/a1/Chinese_assault_rifle.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/2000?cb=20110211025816) elegant. 
---
The handmade assault rifle was an excellent addition IMO. Way more true to the gun it's based on and it offers way more customization. Anything from a short barrel assault rifle to [long range sniper.](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/f/fd/Handmade_Rifle_Gear_Loading_Screen.png/revision/latest?cb=20170106004901)
---
I'm all for them adding more guns, but the only way to add a Chinese Assault rifle that wouldn't be a downgrade would be to just rename the handmade. I'd rather they add the HK style assault rifle, or something that hasn't been in previous games. 
---
On what platform, as consoles are a separate network from PC’s.  Or is this feeding back in the Bethesda client servers across all platforms?
---
I think it's intended to be. For Raiders, almost certainly it will be. When the faction wars DLC comes out, that'll be where raiders congregate for sure, everything's already there waiting to be used. Whitesprings will be for the Enclave. Fort Defiance for BOS and Nuka Truck stop for Free states. All conveniently located in the Great divide too.They will become hubs. In time...grrr..in time. My new Bethesda mantra. 
---
All consoles im assuming, Did it on PC &amp; Xbox One
---
all consoles im assuming, did it on PC and Xbox One.
---
It does not, by the way
---
It will say "Steel" and take it from the mods
---
So, you need to be a little less ignorant in your comments on things you are not versed in
---
I did notice that for the past week or two that I've been hardcore playing, ive gotten disconnected only a handful of times, but today specifically i crashed maybe 15-20 times within about 8 hours
---
Wait what is it even used for? I have 200+ hours yet I never tuned in to it
---
I saw a german click bait gaming news article yesterday with the title:"There IS a human NPC in Fallout 76, and who sees him gets BANNED". I guess at least some people got banned after visiting the dev room.
---
Cant wait for the update. Still dont understand how you can ruin your own experience. Wheres the fun if you have everything? 
---
I mean, ive played my share of games that were past my age rating in my time. And the Internet wasnt really much of a thing back then. But aside from the fact of how bad an idea it is to let preteens roam unsupervised in online games, you bet i would not have cried to my mommy about how people massacred me in Unreal.
---
It's meant to be a free for all with contestants recieving targets ,but I've yet to successfully find a match due to lack of participants and it's not exactly easy to find if you haven't looked for guides and explanations on it
---
Faat moving enemies like the liberator robots, mole rats and rats aswell as running ghouls are often almost impossible to hit bc the fast movement the 0% chance appears more often than 95%. Sometimes im standing 1m away and the shot goes eight through. Pretty annoying bc it alwaya happen to my Dragon. 
---
Wow that's so creep well done! 
---
This has been around quite awhile actually, but luckily hasn’t been spread around.  
---
Was actually the first one I heard about, before the artillery was so popular 
---
...rebuild it?
---
Honestly ,i would start banning people like OP. They spread lies and BS.
---
What a fine citizen you are!
---
Given that _nobody_ reviews the terms of service, I guess I would have to say, "no"...? ;)
---
Or are you here for my soothing voice? 
---
He’s got that good ole FO3 vault suit
---
I really miss being able to build those greenhouse walls and roofs 
---
Fyi
---
Go to the C.A.M.P.
---
The little box you place when you move a camp. Will have an option to "Repair all"
---
All it costs is a bit of junk. Rebuilds everything you had
---
MAAAHMM
---
It was the first time in around 80 hours that this happened. I'm just pissed off that it happened the literal first time she's ever played the game
---
You literally get a massage of whats about to get scraped ...
---
Once you can invest in maxed home defense and know where the enemies will commonly spawn from, a couple missile turrets coupled with a spotlight (increases detection range of turrets) will make short work of most attackers.  I had a camp in Cranberry Bog for a while and got attacked by a lvl 50 scorchbeast when I traveled in at least once a day.  Between myself and two missile turrets with a searchlight range buff, it was a pretty easy fight with minimal structural damage.  I wound up moving near Whitesprings station for a more community oriented bed and breakfast farmhouse that required minimal upkeep, and I've been enjoying coming home to find players sleeping in the multiple suites upstairs, playing music and just checking out my place.  My house is hopping during a whitesprings nuke, and I tend to forego legendary farming to act as a proprietor with a dirty tan suit on and placing down bags of food, purified water and ammo to enjoy watching people take a pile of 50 cal ammo or mirelurk meat and give me a heart emote.  You'd be surprised how many players leave plans and legendary stuff in return.  Most of it is one star armor, but I've been clearing out all seven vendors the past couple days with one star legendary armor people have left me.  If I could put up a sign asking to trade good prices for legendary rifles, I absolutely would.  My grail is a two shot/armor-piercing/quad ammo handmade rifle for close quarters.  A CQC explosive weapon is a fantastic way to one-shot yourself with friendly fire with maxed rifleman/sneak damage/demo expert perks.  I won't use my explosive long range combat rifle during Scorched Earth unless I can perch up in a spot that other players won't be jumping in front of me, because I will one-shot myself even with a padded chest piece if someone jumps in front of my shot.
---
 If I can fit it into the budget, I'll set up an additional chem stations and armor/weapon benches.  It's really cool to set up a house in a premium spot and have a constant influx of visitors.  I can't wait to set up a vending machine and sell choice plans and legendary gear for bargain prices.
---
If you're on PC and vendoring at Whitespring Station, look north up the tracks.  If you see a brick farmhouse please visit, grab some purified water, take all the veg you want to make some soups, have a nap upstairs in my themed suites and maybe noodle a bit on the banjo or just enjoy the view from a patio chair.  Killing dozens of glowing ghouls is thankless work.
---
If you plan on getting the Excavator Armor then you might to grab any Black Titainium ore, but you will also need acid to turn it into “junk”.  The amount needed is mind boggling, but if you start getting it early then the parts are not an issue once you hit 25 and it does make a big difference in solo game play

I read both reddit and bethesda forums and i've gotten really SICK of people complaining about PvP that i logged in and went through a killing spree. I shall make my only purpose in this game to kill whiners and their camps. ENJOY
---
*slaps side of perk card*  This bad boy can fit so many disease cures/stimpaks/radaways in it!
---
Same, i feels very relaxed even in the high level areas, 
---
Me too, today has been the worst day yet
---
You can also equip Raider Power Armor at lvl 15
---
Dude being a programmer i feel like is the only job you can go from feeling like a genius to feeling like you eat crayons for breakfast and wearing a helmet that says mommy special vault dweller in one fucking line
---
I could kiss you.
---
You literally don't
---
Not when it's taking your mods. Wtf do people not understand about this
---
rly, i never even knew. Heard theres another one involving your base as well
---
Battle royal mode confirmed your locked ina vault with 30 other dwellers and you have to fight to the death for 24 hours 
---
Same
---
Spent a while at the whitesprings trying to get someone to clear my 200 cap bounty after I leveled some assholes trash turret base at the golf club. People just kept ignoring me until some dude walked in and one shot me with an explosive weapon 
---
Reminds me of the time I was peacefully exploring in skyrim not knowing that my headphones (with 7.1 surround) were at max volume when a wolf attacked me out of nowhere... I got such a large fright that my father had thought someone was trying to break into the house. 
---
Only for him to come into my room and find that I had fallen back in my chair and my chair had landed on the floor...
---
TL:DR : Reminds me of skyrim jumpscare, dad thought someone was breaking in, and I fell back on the floor in my chair. 
---
That really sucks I hope it doesn't happen again 
---
Yeah, I thought it was called “Neon Letters”, so when I saw it at a vendor I thought it must have been something else.
---
This is lovely :) 
---
It took the shocks because they scrap into steel and I ran out of loose steep scrap.
---
You're the kind of guy I hope I run into.. Hell yaa lvl 100s need springs tooooo
---
Wow. How does that even happen? 
---
I thought the reason why duping even existed was because of how the game 'rolled back' a bit when crashes occured? 
---
Sorry man. 
---
Nah, its more like buying a car but it has no radio when you pick it up.
---
I use brick, it’s looks really nice and is damn good when my camp gets attacked 
---
Just to make sure you know...
---
Since the beta I thought prospector’s hats were only the yellowish tan color. My husband found a black one a gave it to me. If you haven’t found one yet, they’re a thing, and may look better with the dress.
---
Well considering it might take like a full mag to fill a mutie with before they die and you're constantly repeating this process genociding every hostile creature you come across for sweet loot and xp then I'd consider it okay making ammo like a tenth of it's actual weight allowing you to carry ten times more because you're in combat ten times more often than you would be if this was realistic.
---
If you have a blimp, it's no wonder they can see,you. Those things are massive! ;)
---
I'm very happy for you. Half my friends are not getting disconnected, half are. 
---
Your steel is lose or bulked?
---
Me neither but i was disappointed too.
---
You have to buy the .50, there are 3 different .50 plans that i know of, none of them makes more dmg than the .308 hardened receiver.
---
I got a quad one once and immediately dropped it because of this bug. 
---
Wow, no amount of text can begin to define my (our) gratitude. So good.
---
Thank you.
---
Yea, seems once you find a decent server you stay stable for hours. Make sure you're not mass crafting too much as that seems to disconnect often.
---
Two things I don’t do solo:
---
Claim workshops
---
Launch nukes
---
Ooh 😖 Currently spamming the vendor so harper's. It's a long way to get there but I think i see PA parts there more often than at other vendors.
---
My alt character deals 400 dmg with all rise. Not to mention few points invested in perception give you % dmg boost against certain enemies.
---
And my 3rd alt deals 900(from weapon description) without stealth by using unarmed weapon. 
---
40% faster doesn't really matter when you basically one hit kill.
---
I still think 1 hand build needs more love.
---
Yeah I hear ya, other have provided you the rebuild solution so you should be good to go and try again. Good luck
---
Can you buy the plans or the mods only? And yeah I heard they are not as powerful but ammo is easier to craft in bulk? 
---
You know if you stay in his menu too long he just disappears 
---
Robobrains have pretty funny lines during combat. One of them is, "They could have programmed me to love, but noooooo."
---
I have crashed there twice now on PS4, both times on the top floor when I finally get to kill Colonel Gutsy. It is a quit out of the game freeze as well, it doesn't end the game for me, just leaves me frozen. Really infuriating as that's twice I've just about got to the end and it's done it. Can't seem to report the bug as it doesn't kill the game. Is there actually anything good there? 
---
I just started making myself a list tonight, and now I don't have to. THANK YOU!!!!!!!! :) :)
---
Tbh that’s a bit of a dick move imo
---
I’d pay 2000 caps for that
---
Nice ... Everybody should team up against dupers and throw their stuff away ... 500 thumbs up from me..
---
But you can craft locks for things without that perk.
---
There's a metric butt load of Cobalt at whitespring just beyond the walls and across the highway. Especially east towards blackwater mine. Tons of glowing sap, and neutron pods. I've pulled 100+ depending on where the nuke is. Just make sure you go east and north to get optimal results.
---
He found one. No longer needed.
---
I have no idea how this keep happening to other people, my mods are always the last part in the  queue.
---
also why are you not using your mods?! Its your own fault.
---
It's part of the Order of Mysteries questline.  You get a 'lesser version' at first, but at the conclusion of the entire questline when worn with the Eye of Ra, it achieves its full potential.
---
Quack surgeon level 2 confirmed

---
The problem is (at least with most people I've met so far - including me). PvP isn't really that much fun. You easily get oneshot with not much chance of doing something against it and the little chances you have are gated behind RNG loot grinding.
---
I avoid any PvP in this game like the plague. Even the few times when I was plan farming at workshops and someone (usually 100 levels above me) initiated PvP, I possibly made it the most boring encounter for them since I don't wear any meaningful armour and didn't shoot back. If they insist on not letting me finish my defend event and try to kill me over and over, I hop to another server.
---
If I want to PvP, I play a different game. In Fallout I stick to my peaceful character who only hunts animals and abominations.
---
Hello “Dragunov”
---
Oh man, I feel the pain, motherfuckers scrapped my x01 jetpack mod. 
---
SBQ is the only reason to worry about min-maxing tbh but I need those recipes lol
---
I read this picturing the Jasper Beardley meme, a la "win pvp, that's a bounty, shoot your own camp, that's a bounty, get murdered? Oh you better believe THAT'S a bounty". And now I can't stop giggling.
---
My t-60 shocks, and the only excavator shock I've ever seen both came from Harper's ferry.
---
I used T-60 legs
---
Was planning to sell the X-01 as a slush fund
---
How can you even say it's my own fault? This is just piss poor design, and I you're acting like a bit of a sociopath there
---
You obviously don't know what the BoB does when the entire questline it is linked to finishes.  It's not a measly 28% penetration.  When combined with the Eye of Ra, it provides 100% penetration of all armor and resistances.  That means nothing stops it.  Nothing.  I don't care how awesome you think your power fist is, it doesn't ignore resistances that way.  Are the Power Fists powerful? 
---
 Absolutely.  But they still have to deal with additive bonuses vs resistances, not multiplicative.  BoB just has a straight ignore 100% effect.  I value that more at endgame.
---
500 loose
---
10 bulked
---
This game is so fucked. Can’t wait for Anthem to release. 
---
Im not a psycho,  Im jet ;)
---
Oh, I thought this was the case so I put it in my mods in my stash... It scrapped it from my stash...
---
And you haven't done your homework.  When combined with the Eye of Ra, the Blade of Bastet (like the rest of the Mystery regalia) gains extra benefits.  In this case, the penetration increase to 100%.  Do some reading, you'll see that I am right about this.  
---
Shit I've always thought I was wasting that space.
---
I guess it’s all really up to taste I’ve always loved the design of the ak 47 
---
I think a compromise could be the damaged hazmat suit could let you equip limb armor but not chest pieces. Similar to grognaks outfit. 
---
Or a hazmat styled under suit with 250 rad resist and the hidden hazmat/PA buff. Otherwise it’s too OP
---
Drop your price and put those points into luck=better luck
---
Explains why some asshole just hunted me down for the pure idea of just using this exploit to make me rage. He's been going around doing it to a lot of people but like hunted me down one shotted me and basically said "you gonna let me take your junk, bitch?"

You are a G! This is exactly what the game desperately needs. Wish I could upvote you 10000 times

That one vault boy with the party hat made me chuckle 
---
Thanks bro radshield is one item I will go to lengths to acquire a decent supply of.. it's never for sale and it's so much better for mutants than rad-x.. I haven't used a single rad-x since going down the mutation path I have every one I want and hate when they bug out and I'm less than normal... they best fix that bug fast lol it's annoying af

So you said that you got two two-shot weapons over the period of 119 levels. I was 'skeptical' that I was THAT far off, so I went farming tonight. Forget a week or a month, I got 5 two shot weapons in 1 day of farming and only gained 7 levels in that period. Sooooooo... I don't know what you're doing differently, or what the other players on this thread are doing differently, but there is definitely something wrong with the WAY you are farming, because you should be getting way better drops. Now I admit that I didn't get an explosive weapon tonight, but frankly, I bet it would only take me 3 days of farming at this rate. Also it wasn't RIDICULOUS amounts of time, I'm talking 3 hours of farming, that's an entire two hour nuke zone plus keeping the zone going for 1 hour after the end of the nuke by exiting and reloading in to make the zone respawn enemies...   
---
Honestly? I invite ANYONE who wants to learn how to farm properly to come play with me so they can see that I'm not full of shit, but I will say for now that I just my experience tonight alone makes me think that a good portion of this thread is just about completely invalid. I was not off in my estimations, me and the players I play with definitely have managed to get reliably way more TSE drops than other players just by knowing what we are doing, and I don't think what other players are calling 'farming' really qualifies. More like casually killing things in the nuke zone, maybe getting 1 or 2 legendaries every 10 minutes or something, and thinking that counts as farming. If you're not killing a glowing 1 every 15 seconds, you're doing something wrong, and I'm of the opinion that most players are doing things quite wrong.
---
I value not looking like a clown too, but hey, everyone to themselves, if you want to look like a WoW player, by all means, the stage is yours, what I am discussing and what you're on about are two very different things, plus, end game wont be fun to you, everyone is rolling with assassin and sentinal armor, which decreases damage recieved via precentage, not resist, cant wait to see you running around with your skirt trying to kill people with your 10 damage dealing weapon, oh, and I was wrong, you're not smarter than the rest of the bunch up, please vanish into the dark of which you came, have a wonderful day !

The Marine Armor Helmet when created at 209% provides 18 DR and is a gas mask with -2 perception. 18 DR is not that much but better than zero.

But luring them in morgantown is fun. Trust me try it. Just go where noone is and lure everything lol

1. Go through menopause

they are spawning markers for cells,camps. not collectible afaik.
---
What is the QA room and can you access it by accident or does it have to be a deliberate act? I don't want to stumble into it on accident. 
---
listening to despacito is their own personal purgatory, no more effort required to punish them further
---
Certain perk cards are situational cards, such as hackerx3, ammosmith and gunsmith, consider those points in other categories (make sure you leave at least 5 in INT though). Pharma Farma and scrounger are good early game imo, not necessary for later game.
---
remember to have a nuke keycard on you or the entire op is a bust
---
There are still a handful of ways to dupe. I've reported all the ways I know but it seems whenever someone posts it to youtube than they try fix it. Even ways i tried during the beta still work today on the pc.
---
No no I mean I recipe to build the consumable stealth boy. That's a mod for power armour, I'm talking about the consumable that makes you invisible for a period of time.
---
If it does exist the enclave or the order of mysteries will have it.. 
---
I’ll be server hopping enclave so I’ll keep you posted
---
Well.. I [crash servers](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/afhx6t/i_have_no_pipboy_or_inventory_im_naked_and_i) on death, trade or just by punching players - also if friends come too near... I feel like I'm a horrible person :/     
---
     
---
In case you're on PS4:     
---
Sorry ! It's not my intention, I'm just trying to get my main to load in completely...
---
ok thanks, I've only seen one at a vendor but can't remember which one
---
And normally with most explosive builds, 1-2 hits instantly kills most enemies so when it doesnt it Vats you often end up just scoping the target if it happens 2 be mid-long range instead even though that is pretty much exactly what vats are for. 
---
Fuck this TSE weapons, every 100+ lvl player runs with them and mows everything on their path. 
---
I’m not talking about pvp either, what’s the point if those bastards oneshot you all the time?
---
I’m level 60+ and actively avoiding Whitesprings and Nukezones now, these locations are ruined by those explosive doubleshooting fuckers. They absolutely rule the game and absolutely ruin it for everyone else - you simply can’t compete with tse shotgun and there is nothing you can do about it. 
---
Thanks, Bethesda, great work. 
---
Oh, sorry
---
Server hop the production terminal
---
Costs caps though
---
Its funny how I just built what you describe, placed symnetrically to yours, but from the golf club, not the station :)
---
Stockpile caps, you need 9k to be able to leave other players visible text messages.
---
My advice regarding explosive - they modified the fireproof perk, its musthave now, 3rd level gives -45% explosive damage reduction rate. I coupled this with a dense marine armor and began testing. I took my TSE pump action shotgun, and unloaded magazine directly into my feet. It broke my armor, broke my legs, and did me ZERO damage. No damage reduction legendary perks were used in my testing, just perk cards and crafted mods.
---
Hey man, I'm sorry too. Been an off day for me as well. Hope tomorrow is better for both of us. 
---
Lol I never said be a dick to kids I said, quite clearly, stop trying to curtail adult activities in an age restricted environment just incase kids are around. Anyone being the turd here is you trying to SJW kids into an environment not suitable for them by demanding people stop being adult.
---
And no. 
---
If this happens again just go to main menu and join another server, no point in feeding the griefers more :/
---
They definitely knew.
---
its a shitty weapon btw :)
---
This is awesome thanks everyone! big help. Hope to see you out in Appalachia
---
ok thanks, you've seen a recipe or just the consumables?
---
You building a community oriented camp indicates big chance of being a friendly person. I like friendly people. Let me know your IGN and add me if you want someone to hunt with. Mine is imprezobus.
---
I am on holiday right now, so I can send you only pics from Vietnam ;)
---
But believe me, I do plant my own cranberries :)
---
I don't think there's a stealthboy plan.
---
There is a special stealthboy you can make _from_ a normal stealthboy.
---
That sucks. If you're on PS4 I'll come trick out her base for you. I have a majority of the camp plans.
---
I'm sorry my dude, these white-knights will never accept that bethesda screwed them and will defend the game to no end. 
---
Pro tip: You can still play the damn game and have reservations about MAJOR issues that honestly shouldn't be present in a full Triple-A game, these issues are why Early Access exists. (Oh yeaaaah, I forgot about the whole B.E.T.A thing that just doubled as predatory marketing instead of fixing LITERALLY A SINGLE FUCKING BUG.)
---
There are several fissure sites spread around the map, good places to farm black titanium (check the dead deathclaws laying around) and ultracite.
---
My powrr armor knee gears don't work either
---
Yeah I know but that's useless unless you have stealth boys because I believe that requires base stealth boys to make those special ones.
---
Consumables only
---
Don't think a receipe exists
---
It does.
---
There are tons of stealthboy in-world and also stealthboy mkIII.
---
i have like 30 TSE weapons on PC, but i would play normal till the server would lag then took for dupers on the map and crouch and TP close to them use a stealth boy, get close then sprint up to the container and press R-R-Space and steal everything. never sold the weapons since they were duped but i would give then to friends whos build worked with them if they wanted them.
---
I live right next to you, down by the river! On Xbone though...
---
Thanks Chcuk. Can you tell me more about power armour? I see some high level players not in it? Is it just fashion choice? Are there pros for when I get one? Or do you where it for specific jobs 
---
We're on xbox, but thank you for the offer!
---
You’re a legend!
---
Great story lol. I've had mutant hounds jump up in my face while I'm doing things and startle the shit out of me before. Not that bad, but definitely involved some cursing.
---
Where did you find it? Do you have a screen shot?
---
I generally enjoy the game
---
Super pissy now though as I realise I also lost a stealthboy.........
---
hmm ok
---
Bethesda only fixes glitches when they are well known, in other words, spreading this as a wildfire is the most effective way of getting them to fix it, sadly :/
---
Of stealthboys in the world?
---
There's one you can collect at RobCo near the power armor stands. They spawn near the fire stations and BoS sites. They're all over the place.
---
I'm out of the loop. What's a stash in this context? I assume it relates to duping but I don't understand how knocking down your house would stop you from doing whatever it is.
---
It's not the same dupe proccess.  
---
What happened to you is a c.a.m.p. budget resource bug.
---
These guys are duping specific items (bobbleheads, legendary equipment) unrelated to c.a.m.p. resources.
---
He's not right. Just to test I went farming tonight, and I got 5 two shot weapon drops in the period of three hours. I'm pretty convinced at this point people are calling their casual killing of a few legendaries in white spring 'farming' when farming is really more like killing a glowing one every 15 seconds, and a legendary glowing one every minute non-stop for 2 hours. That's how you get good drops, that's what I do to get the legendaries. Just to demonstrate that a TSE weapon isn't needed to do that farming too, I use a combat rifle, non-legendary until I got a two-shot weapon and then switched to the best weapon I got a drop from during the farming. Literally using my drops from the same night my farming rate went up.  
---
I don't know what builds people are using, what they're calling farming, or how they're actually playing the game, but I will tell you if you go into a nuke zone, kill a dozen enemies, run out, sell shit for a half hour, wander around, bullshit with friends, and then log onto reddit to complain about how bad your drops were while the zone is still active, then it kinda makes sense to me why you're not getting the gear you're looking for...  
---
Maybe that is an EXTREME example, maybe people are JUST UNLUCKY, but it seems exceedingly unlikely to me that players aren't doing something wrong if I can go to 'check myself' one evening and discover that I was completely right in my estimation of the rarity of the drops, and that YES, they are common enough.   
---
Granted for every two-shot weapon I got I threw away literally 30-50 legendary pieces of gear, but that doesn't mean a thing, the point is they do drop. I would say at this rate I could get an explosive weapon in about 3 days... And to be clear, we're talking multiplicative results, so probably about two weeks for a TSE weapon, which matches my normal timescales perfectly, since I've gotten 2 so far, and should be PRETTY close to getting a third (Gamblers fallacy, I know I'm no closer, but my point is I've been UNLUCKY to not have gotten a third, not LUCKY to have gotten two).  
---
Point is some people actually know how to farm, and can legitimately acquire these weapons. Be happy to teach anyone who wants to learn. In the meantime in light of this experience, I'm actually totally cool with them wiping the servers of all TSE weapons. It will only take me two weeks to get another one, and then I'll be one of the only players on the servers with them since apparently, I thought everyone knew how to farm, and I was grossly mistaken. Funny thing is it's not even a real secret, I think it's really just lack of discipline and short attention span, people get distracted instead of focusing on the task at hand. Sure it's a grind, but it's HARDLY a 3 month grind that ends with you getting nothing. It's a 3 DAY grind that ends with you finally getting the weapon you were looking for. You should get a TSE weapon out of every 1,000 or so legendaries, and it shouldn't take you more than two weeks to farm that many legendary items.   
---
I really don't know I have a feeling this is gonna get downvoted like crazy, but I just don't get it, I'm telling you guys it's easy, any of you can do this, why you would be upset to learn that it's within your reach to farm these items is beyond me, unless the real issue isn't that you're INCAPABLE of farming them, but rather that you find the GRIND of ACTUALLY FARMING so unbearable that you'd rather say it's impossible then do the work to get the items your looking for... Definitely the latter I think.
---
Isn’t this because you duped items?
---
He cured the shits
---
Order of Mysteries just has a thing you can make with a Stealth Boy as one of the ingredients.
---
You must be overencumbered with all that salt in your inventory.
---
Not sure why you're getting down-voted. The combat rifle, AND submachine-gun, AND Lever Action rifle, AND pipe revolver all shoot .45 for cryin' out loud. So we've got at least two guns that should be considered carbines and not true rifles. 
---
I'm not really sure a 50 BMG would fit inside of the hunting rifle's model. But a 50 AE or 50 Beowulf would! 
---
Bullets haven't made sense in this franchise since Fo4, shhhh its ok.
---
Yes, once something is being used enough it forces them to fix it.
---
But dont expect it to be fixed, considering how long it took them to previous dupe
---
I prefer the chainsaw because it's been fun getting a weapon that no one took seriously to such high damage that it can do all content in the game, the fact that I can just go hope around for a couple minutes and grab 4 more, that the damage ticks are way faster than the ripper, that it has a level 20 requirement so if you have a friend with Weapon Artisan 3 or who can transfer them to your low level from a high level of your own that does you can basicly solo power level yourself from 20 to 50 in an evening of non-nuked whitesprings ghouls, and just for the entire feel of running around like a murder hobo in the wastes with a chainsaw :-) 
---
That said I also haven't spent nearly as much time on my one handed build trying to get it up to such feats... yet.  Although the ripper doesn't have any guaranteed spawn points that I am aware of you CAN craft it which is a nice tradeoff unless you get a legendary that you really want to use.  I have used the ripper to level from 45ish to 65ish on the one hander and can confirm it's more than viable it just does tick damage slower than the chainsaw.  I think that once I take another 20-30 hours and fine tune the build, get unyielding gear from my farms, get a +3 str lining on it, etc that it will likely be comparable in damage per second to the chainsaw.
---
The Mr. Handy Buzzblade has been getting a lot of use by others but the only thing I have tested with it was if two handed weapon perks affected it and to see how fast the damage ticks.  I currently have a level 20ish that I have been leveling to do the fair comparison on the buzzblade at level 50+ but it's likely a couple weeks away.  I have had several folks swear by it and 1-2 of them came hunting in whitesprings with me and it did indeed mow down mobs like a hand held lawnmower.    
---
I find building in slightly unusual places means that people dont often bother you. The forest builds are easy 2 find because you can see them for miles. I suggest building in the marsh or trees of the divide. No ever comes out there. Also Im guessing your worried about your gfs lvl in theses areas. Shouldnt matter 2 much tbh 
---
True, but out of all indi survival games I've played Subnautica is the only one that I personally think was better then this.
---
Im lazy, thats why they are in there :D
---
But youre rigth, i will swap those thanks 
---
I posted about this in the 'Issues and Feedback Thread' the other day, too.
---
No. I never duped anything. Moreover dupers seems to be safe because **different** item ids (especially weapons &amp; armors) cause this bug.
---
I quite like the Black Cowboy Hat, myself. 🤠
---
Additional Note:  In Intelligence the Contractor Perk unlocks at level 18.  First Rank is 25% discount on building CAMP items.  Second Rank is 50% discount.  
---
Even though the card does not explicitly say so this discount applies to repair costs as well.
---
Next time this happens hit repair all on CAMP to fix everything like it never happened for 1/2 the price!!
---
I have run into this with many different hats. It seems to happen whenever I have two of the same hat in my inventory.
---
I would love to just play the game, but when the game lends itself to being exploited so easily, there's no satisfaction in accomplishing anything... no appreciation for anything earned..
---
Why the hell are you hunting for springs and screws in ws nuke zone? So many better locations. Not to mention as others mentioned why didn't you have pacifist mode on when using explosive attacks.
---
i think you can find it in harpers ferry too
---
Have an upvote from me.
---
Picked up a lot of junk that dupers were dropping and logged out with it :/
---
Ok thanks i never see many
---
Picked up excessive amount of junk
---
Thank you 
---
 Did you somehow solve this? I have the exact same issue right now - server disconnected me shortly after entering Whitespring bunker. After re-logging I was placed outside, with the quest still active, without the access card in my inventory and I can't get in. It's not lootable again from the hidden locker behind the painting in the bunker, I tried that. 
---
I like that most of these screen shots are from Fallout 4 :P
---
Well I was going to create an account just to say I second this, but apparently I had already created an account at some point just to try to make a Heroes of the Dorm team.  
---
SO ANYWAYS I just built myself a store. Damn near a warehouse, honestly, but I have two switches to open the garage door to the public side, and I would LOVE to get an AND gate so I can have a failsafe where if someone is griefing I can just flip one switch and lock them out/in
---
It makes 2 every 10 minutes, but it can only hold two at a time. 
---
People do sleep but maybe you dont? Btw I was not looking to provide proof. I tried that on FB and too many inbred hillbillies messaged me. Was trying to see how widespread it was.
---
I would probably have the patience for this 
---
I got a bunch of XP once, about half a level, by crafting boiled water. Grabbed a bunch of wood at the lumber mill, combined that with my already ridiculous stash, slept for the XP boost, popped a rad x, got a bunch of dirty water out of a river, and boiled it all. 
---
Getting and boiling 200 bottles doesn't take long at all. 
---
I 100% agree! I haven't played a game so much or for so long in years, and it's for exactly that reason. I can just meander around the place, making up my own goals each day.
---
As far as I can tell. The Harper's ferry vendor only sells the grey lockers under lockers plan name. And the watoga vendor sells the white lockers under lockers plan name. 
---
I blue screen so much doing nukes or sbq I wont do it unless I have freinds in the game.
---
Picked up a dupers excess junk to mess with them. Didnt work out in my favor.
---
Impressive
---
That is fantastic!
---
When they hit 125% you can do two things.  For weapons I want to keep (legends and such) I set them aside until I have 2-3 that are at that point and then I go do my crafting mats runs with them.  I go hit all the low level areas I know of for screws, springs, steel, etc and generally a little bit of farming with power attacks (increased swing speed helps here) as PA and blocking use up more durability.  If you go fight mole men and find one that does the never ending blocking routine (usually when they equip a mole miner gauntlet) you can hit those as hitting someone blocking greatly reduces durability.
---
If it's a weapon you don't care about because it's a non legend, just scrap or drop it, craft or farm new ones.  A freshly crafted ripper at 100% durability is 5 blocked attacks away from being repairable to 200%. Easy peasy.  If you are running a higher int build use items that drop your int to get your durability when crafting to 100% rather than 133% etc otherwise you end up back at square one.
---
Also when using ripper/mr handy buzzsaw Makeshift Warrior greatly increases how long they last, which doesnt work on the chainsaw, and make sure to remove this when trying to get rid of those last durability points.
---
&gt;How dare you explore interesting things using glitches in this game, you better keep farming and grinding things with a 2% chance of dropping or else!
---
I assume it has to be done on purpose. I can't confirm that as I have not watched the videos on it. But every FO/EOS game you have to go out of your way to find it.
---
Wow, I am actually surprised at the amount of piece of shit cheaters itt. I really thought it was only a few people. 
---
I can't thank you guys enough for figuring this out! I found a reddit thread where a guy went into great detail about dense metal legs... I guess he might have been talking about fallout 4? It resulted in me spending the last 15 hours collecting mats to craft and scrap metal legs... No more of that!
---
Thank you again guys
---
As always, doing ~~god~~ Bethesda's work
---
I’ve loved fallout since the very beginning, and I think that’s why it hurts me so much to see just so much bad on Bethesda’s behalf, it’s literally every day it just gets worse and it genuinely hurts, but I still manage to find the drive to keep playing. The game has some legendarily bad things happening with it right now among the bugs/CONSTANT disconnections and plague of dupers, along with just awful design decisions about most things it seems, but I’m still here through all of it. 
---
I will say that the last patch was exactly what we needed and I applaud Bethesda for that, but sadly with so many glaring bigger issues at hand the few fixes seem to be a few plugged holes in a completely dissected ship, and the only reassurance we ever seem to get is “passed on to the dev team” 
---
As an Appalachian native, I love this game. 
---
As an avid fallout fan, I enjoy the game.
---
But as someone who just wants to unwind and play the game after work or to destress, I hate this game. 
---
Please Bethesda, you can make something special here, but you aren’t above the rule book either. 
---
So after 3 runs of Distant Thunder I want to say you get better loot using the recon scope than just killing the scorched.
---
Could just be a wave of good luck.
---
Its made by EA, you know that right?
---
Ok so you're basically set up like a storage character. You have a ton of weight reducers but no real combat perks. With your high Strength you could change to melee or heavy weapons, would recommend dropping points out of End and putting into Str for that.
---
If you're using power armour you won't need things like adamantium skeleton, sturdy frame and white knight. If using normal armour you don't need power patcher and portable power.
---
You can use this build planner to play around and decide what you want https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
Just as an example I'll post a kind of basic heavy weapons with mutations build as I don't know melee well. This would still leave you you a fair amount of special points to play with.
---

---
Well that's easy. Who says they have to be running the exact same code? You could remove the dev room code entirely from the retail copy and not affect the game. If nothing calls to it (nothing should) then nothing will miss it. You keep the dev version of the game on the dev servers. Nobody gets it. Test on the dev version. Test on retail just to make sure if you really want to. Then release to public. If you really feel you have to have it left in the game, do the dev testing/work in godmode, since they can enable the console, or just set their health to infinite. Have the dev room set to something stupid like 100 million rads per second. Regardless of protection and potions you'll be dead in a single frame. No time to do anything even if you find it.
---
Those  toilets are elevators to easily return to the surface after launching a nuke
---
You’re better off having a few (budget allowing) and just leaving them open for other players to help themselves if they come across your camp, your never going to keep jumping back just to collect water, I collect mine when I log in and leave the spawn for others
---
Gotcha. Thanks for clarifying 
---
You pretty much have to use scripts / cheat engine / etc to get into the test cell. So, barring the very rare accidental glitching in there, which im not gonna rule out, its fairly blatent violation of TOS if nothing else. 
---
That's what I think too

Find or launch nuke.  Equip Green Thumb.  Harvest 200+ flux from the plantlife.  Hit all seven faction vendors.   ?????????????.   Profit 1400 caps per day, per character.  Max out your characters stash in 17-19 days doing this.
---
I didn't think you could but apparently so?
---
Were you in control of any workshops at the time when this happened?
---
You can have someone help let you in so you can complete the quest line. Once completed you can access the bunker via resort. Unfortunately that's the only work around at the moment. 
---
I know there was glitch that you can steal from people's inventory
---
True, reducing 35% damage (6% reduction per 5 armor pieces) of 1.4k-6.5k damage still leaves enough to kill most folks.
---
I did too! I would always dump all my excess ammo, packaged food and scrap in the garbage cans out front with a sign so people would know. I picked up the RR jumpsuit from the Atom store, too, and always wore it while I was in camp. One day it vanished when I logged in (pre-patch) and it wouldn't let me rebuild there anymore. I'm always super-nostalgic when I'm up in that area. :) 
---
Similar thing happened to me except I was alone and sat and watched the camp I spent about a week customising get destroyed by some asshole with a shot gun. 
---
I actually didn't have enough materials to repair it.
---
Will probably never build a camp like that again. There's no point. I store away the few essential items I'll need, deploy them for use and then store them away again.
---
Still really pissed off about it.  
---
despite having a tse gatling gun, I can get behind this. 
---
But i do think they also need to fix weapon balance along with implementing this.
---
Right now only rifle and melee builds a viable 
---
and heavy and automatic are to much in the gutter for this to work right now. 
---
Thank you stuffinyamuffin for brightening up this man's Sunday morning.
---
You may have seen it referred to as a "mule" as well, basically a second character/account that's used purely to store stuff for a main account.
---
I've been playing MMOs since Everquest. I know how to farm. I've spent many, many nights making the rounds at a nuked Whitespring and/or doing Uranium Fever, always making sure to take out the three-star legendary mobs and loot them properly.
---
It's not something _I'm_ doing wrong unless there's a Loot Better Legendaries button in the UI that I've missed.
---
Why would I use real money to buy an item that I can find it the game.
---
Also I wouldn't buy dupes either.
---
Hopefully Bethesda will punish people like you.
---
I agree, I'm a heavy weapons build myself. Despite the weakness of the weapons, especially the energy based ones. I endure, lol. But, I'd be willing to wait for a buff to my plasma gat, just to see the duppers get a swift kick in the nuts with something like this. I finally got my TSE mini gun Thursday. It was wonderful, but the moment seemed dirty knowing all the dupped ones out there. Which is what inspired the post in the first place.
---
Ohhh. Thanks, I get it!
---
yup, i'm on pc. I'm glad you liked it
---
Reminder: any attempted five-finger discounts will be reclaimed...and paid for with said fingers.
---
Sorry, I sold them already. I think you get them from free states vendor
---
But there was no one around so idk how this player found out that i just got a 2 shot gatling gun. It seemed that he was waiting for it.  And somehow he got a notification that someone found a 2 shot gatling, also i asked him how he knew that i just picked up that weapon and he replied that a friend told him. But there was rly no one around 
---
He has my discord already. He'll tell me.
---
Sorry to hear this happened. Those guys sound like a bunch of tards.
---
**ANYONE HUNTING FOR DUPERS**: If **NONE** of the people you suspect of being a duper is so severely overencumbered that they cannot even run, then they are **NOT** dupers. Leave them alone.
---
Players didn't ruin this game - Bethesda did
---
Bethesda is busy milking cows like you. 
---
p.s. not everyone has time to grind the game. They can just spend their days salary to buy several good items instead of playing for an hour or two and getting nothing.
---
I said there WAS a glitch. Anyways they probably dropped it or placed it on a corpse.
---
Or ... are not looking for socialisation in their 76 gaming experience.
---
After several hundred “hey hows it going ?” openers, I dont bother as much any more.
---
That was a rumour that got way out of control but never had evidence. However there have been multiple reports of people knowing what is in other people's inventory
---
Where did you find this? Could use some quick resources 
---
Thank you so much for doing this!!!
---
You mean "Triggers broom"?
---
The only real duper in this game is Bethesda. They made duping possible. Don't blame anyone else
---
Same here, PSN said to have Bethesda fix it and Bethesda said to have PSN fix it. Looks like I have to start a new account for one trophy. 
---
A shitty part.  Unintentional splash damage should not pop a wanted.  A hit or two should be shook off.  Should take some reasonable amount of sustained "bad" hits to truly show "criminal" behavior.
---
I too would like to know.  Only ever got swamp itch from sleeping bags on the ground.  Shell shock from the queen.  The usual ones like blight, bone worms, rad worms from diseased creatures.
---
The theft from peoples inventory was false. You could see into people's inventory though.
---
Plot twist:
---
It's The Matrix, and Fallout 76 is the newest, deepest level of reality created to ensnare our minds - the perfect combination of awesomeness and infuriating buggy mess.
---
The guy's friend is Morpheus.
---
There were reports before of people knowing what was in other people's inventory. Did you have headphones on with a mic and you said out loud when you got it. Just because someone isn't on the map, doesn't mean their around. People in sneak don't show up on the map
---
An excerpt from a buddy I met playing this game regarding this quote:
---
"that quote really hits home for me. It reminds me of staying at a buddy's cabin and since the shitter was an outhouse outside, we had to remember to bring three things: toilet paper, a gun and a person. The bears were so prolific that we quoted the old man from Zelda multiple times a day."
---
This guy is a duper and scammer. Avoid at all costs.
---
i logged in Saturday. my t60 level 50 optimized bracers left arm was just gone, eaten by the game!!!
---
I believe if you ‘move’ the camp after it’s been destroyed, you can restore it an only the cap cost - not the best if you really like your spot, and I haven’t tested it personally, but saw it on a build thread here a while back
---
I saw it in a few YouTube videos but I never looked into it. Then again, those youtubers were constantly shitting on FO76
---
Not sure how Jesus will help you here.  I have other games it takes about 10 mins to launch a nuke and about 5-10 to kill the queen depending how fast she lands. We killed the queen yesterday 30 seconds after she landed. With her flying it was only about 1:30 total before she died. 
---
Level 180 really wasn't that hard to get. Nuke the white springs area. I Have a total of only 180 hours in this game been playing from beta...
---
&gt; Also the way the Foreman at Blackwater mine says 'Blackwater Mine' is hilarious. 
---
In his soothing voice, yeah xD
---
They're stuck in an infinite loop. First time I found them was at the destination of a messenger event and I felt compelled to put them out of my misery. 
---
... right next to the W key
---
That's why I'm watching people first while staying hidden with the chameleon effect so that I can decide if they are just a team that's having fun or a bunch of dupers.
---
Good to know. 
---
Thats a perk, no ?
---
SAVED! 
---
This is the greatest thing, Thank you so much for this!
---
Im on the exact same page as you! 
---
I paid 70€ for the game, bought a physical copy on day 1. Been playing ever since. Im level 79.
---
Its fun to play BUT that doesnt exclude the fact that the game has serious issues since the beta.
---
However, having an opinion here on reddit against the game seems to be a crime. You wouldnt believe the shit I got (including via pm) just for saying that banning players is a last resort excessive thing. Even for dupers.
---
I know its unfair and harms the game, but banning paying costumers is imo bad for business and subject to discussion in a court of law.
---
Having complaints or opinions contrary to bethesdas practices seems taboo in this sub reddit, and if you look attentively negative posts usually gets immediate negative feedback and lots of comments making serious negative/ability claims against the poster.
---
I wonder if these are actually real players/users or if bethesdas community management as something to do with it.
---
But this blind hate against all sorts of negativity against the game makes me think of the scorched. Blind hate and herd mentality.
---
It's really easy to scrap/drop your weapons/gear by accident and never notice it till much later. With the lack of proof of this bug and the fact people have tried time and time again to get it to work has pretty much (At least for me) confirmed that it was fake. I know theres a bug with the Favorite wheel currently that's causing items to go missing but that's about it.
---
i'm pretty sure this is an issue with two-shot weapons. my hunting rifle would never miss a 95% chance, but after switching to a two-shot pipe rifle, i'm missing constantly with 95% chance
---
Friggin fantastic facts friend.
---
You'll meet quest NPC's with more personality (especially Rose), just not human. It's all robots, talking supercomputers, radio transmissions, and recordings. They talk to you, but you can't talk back.
---
Running low on such quests (maybe 50 hours in), I find myself hanging around the Whitespring a lot, and jumping into action whenever someone launches a nuke.
---
I probably have a quarter of the map markers left to explore, and I do still find surprises, like today I found a Handy dressed as a pumpkin, but his quest was over in a few minutes.
---
Whitesprings is obviously designed to be a hub in my mind, with the artisans corner having a ton of crafting stations, for example.
---
There's really no mechanics to encourage player trading however. No way to advertise that you have trades available, or quickly offer up everything you have for sale. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yza6w/i_made_a_map_of_resource_deposits/
---
True. I accidentally sold a piece of my armor but I didnt realize it until hours later.

Fabulous 
---
You are a big damn hero. Awesome post, thanks 
---
I only use my power armour when fighting scorch beasts and other stronger enemies and I dont use heavy weapons alot im mainly a melee/ rifle player so I could lvl up rifeman again then remove rest of perception points
---
Dude!!!..... this isn't dumb at all! We tried to do this one time but the other two that were with us refused to jump on an instrument... I'm down 100% lol
---
It would make for a pretty good DLC, if they had associated quest lines on establishing a "safe zone" or faction based "outposts".  Like turning in certain materials, hunting down certain monsters, setting up a CAMP in a certain area, etc.
---
Have it track "globally", with all players contributing to these quests.  The area unlocks after enough quests.  
---
Then not only do you get a hub with some vacant lots for players to set up CAMP and maybe a few pre-populated vendors and workstations, but maybe you get a spot for additional dailies.  Such as repelling attacks, gathering supplies (or raiding for supplies), or even scouting for information.  
---
Could definitely contribute to longevity of play.
---
They're popping up all over now. I bought 5 different types earlier doing my cap farm running. Just think about that, I sell bulk junk for caps and the market for tse is so flooded people are selling them for caps to lighten inventory.
---
If Bethesda ever tried to say they where it would be a disaster.
---
The Enclave underarmor works fine with PA as well. Such a shame, since I much prefer my BOS Officer's Suit. 
---
Fuck dude remember when bobs son became the main character for awhile because the show was trying to be DBZ?
---
Then Bob came back from the dead because they were doubling down on trying to be DBZ? 
---
Happy cake day!
---
I remember there was a time that there was phantom weight idk if it exists still now. I hadn't played in a while. However, if you can, drop/store everything you can and see if your weight rests at 0. If it doesn't you have phantom weight. I never learned of a fix, but it doesn't carry over to new characters
---
The game sometimes gets confused regarding what items you have on you. Sometimes it will show up in the trade menu, but not stash menu or pipboy. 
---
Ok cool man. I'm trying to kill the scorchbeast queen rn but I'll join in a minute of your on Xbox.
---
Thank you for solving this for me. 
---
It seems every time I do something fun I immediately encounter a totally broken controller throwing glitch or big right after.
---
I want to but I can't bring myself to up vote your comment.
---
Been playing about 600 hrs with hundreds of different players.. this is pretty bad.. there are indeed some jerks in the game not sure why duper hunting is a thing they'll be gone after the update...and it's a pretty risky move picking up the dropped loot of a duper for whatever intension you have.. the sweep they're running might detect your inventory spike as proof of exploitation and bam... bye bye legit 140+ account... imo the boys behind the coding got this shit covered and noob hunting should be frowned upon heavily regardless... pick on someone your own size ... come pick on me ;) 
---
Oh yes, let’s all just gang up on the robot now
---
A fine fix to a frequent and flustering fact of living in this fantastic and fearful post-nuclear flux filled wasteland!
---
This is an alternate universe and in the future. They can make the flag look however they want '-'
---
Sure but is it really harming anyone, it's not like what little in game market this game has isn't already flooded with duplicate's of the best items of which you can't even get in the dev room, even the best gun you could find inside there is only just it's stock variant, along with all the aid too, the worst that could happen is people get unique armor paintjobs, clothes and plans, nothing too insane like a debug gun, hell I'd love a unique vault suit and winterized power armor.
---
I didn't want to spoil it if for anyone else if they wanted to figure it out! I'll absolutely give the secrets! It was actually pretty easy, I had just forgotten something. 
---
Damn
---
I think the patch stopped future duping. Players who have duped still have their game-breaking inventories to my understanding.
---
Yeah but players arent supposedly crashing servers now with the duping process 
---
Nothing. The amount of damage you are generating is probably higher than OP. 
---
Ive got 2 ranks of fireproof, dense chest and my Explo shotgun still insta gibs me.    
---
    
---
My explo handmade however no longer does. 
---
Just collect and scrap hunting rifles. Low level enemies use them a lot. You'll get it eventually 
---
Hahahahaha 
---
Impossible if you have even minor unique building with levels and such. Only stuff that likes to place are pre built units on stilts. Feels bad. 
---
Having alot of stability issues since the patch, on pc myself.
---
Hoping the next patch fan fix this patches stability issues.
---
I mostly enjoy my time wandering around exploring the wasteland but my god I do miss "Curie" from F4! I only had on goal in that game, help her become as human as possible, I even got the achievement for "helping" her a bit too much huehue... Anyways, F76 is nice but I miss having a companion for the conversations (I only play solo)
---
I've spawned in on other quest items before, but only when my connection is shit (I've been having internet issues unrelated to Bethesda's server issues.
---
Plans are a but more rare but you shuld see mods quite often at different vendors, both watoga vendors got them.
---
Cobalt flux
---
I dont think it was the process. I think it was the item quantities being produced that would stress the servers. Remember. The whole reason that the stash limit was at 400 was to avoid this very thing.
---
It seems we plugged the metaphorical leak, but the water is still in the boat, so to speak.
---
Wait til people are in base. Jetpack on roof. Shotgun blast roof. Get in. Wave. Kill everyone.
---
melee doesn't. had a tidy pile of 5 I tried out when I heard about it. No change after 1.
---
OP have a chat to u/LoneVaultWanderer in private, hopefully stop anothet wave of duping.
---
What is your tag. If you have people then we can do it. We need 3 more after us
---
man my dense marine armor already makes me invulnerable to my quad explosive double barrel
---
Scrapping or bulking ammo to sell would be a nice addition.
---
There is no maximum distance when sharing a card. However, certain card effects have distance restrictions. Team medic, which allows you to share stimpacks, has a pretty limited aoe radius. 
---
I have a 15 Charisma end game build. I've done the silos and dropped the queen. In a team, of course. I really enjoy the character, but it's not for the faint of heart. 
---
My first go at the build had me as a super rezer. I found that it wasn't useful. When people go down they tend to die outright. My final build focused on the ability to heal every type of health bar. I can take care of hunger and thirst, heal radiation, cure disease, boost defense, lower enemy defenses, and of course keep the health bar topped off. I even contracted empath to further reduce damage my team was taking.
---
Another perk of a high charisma build is better trading with NPC merchants. It won't make you rich, but knocking 1300 of a serum is a nice bonus.
---
Overall I found it a fulfilling style of play. Just be warned. You may have to give up some combat efficiency, but that's really just depends on how you prioritize your perks. 
---
with no fire proof yet (i’m on ps4)
---
Oooohhhh. Ok. Sorry, my bad.
---
Instead of dupping. Itll be like gta 
---
My man
---
Congrats ! I also did it by myself because i mostly play F76 solo. But i did it long ago when people were poor and weren't throwing plans and stuff for free to others. There were few good weapons and dupping wasn't a thing.
---
Already having all these problems on console, delaying the patch won't change anything. Especially the mainframe cores thing... I've sat staring at the damn thing for a good 6 or 7 minutes as they gradually placed themselves.
---
Wondering as I have had a 1 star instigating fat man sitting on my mule that I found ages ago. Just now working into heavy. Do you keep it as a basic launcher or MIRV it? Does the MIRV fuck up the added damage from the first hit by only having it on one mini nuke or something?
---
If you're on PS4 there's a glitch where people can see your inventory before you accept the trade invite.
---
This does not allow people to take your items as some have claimed though.
---
The only reason i really want a TSE weapon is because when other people have them they cant PvP normally, they just switch to their TSE shotgun and spam it at you, i would lime to be able to do the same until they get the message that that isnt a fun way to pvp
---
Go do one. You don’t know shit kid
---
I can make a Marsupial for you, I don't want anything in return, it lets you jump higher! Definitely a game changer if you don't feel like it ruins immersion.
---
We hunt griefers alot but recently have been finding ones we cannot beat. Likely using mass bobbles but are popping us in one hit from very long range. Normally can take a few TSE hits before dropping with our setup but these are a new breed.
---
Just block them, don't try to go for your junk they will have it watched and just jump server.
---
Until bethesda can rein in all the duped bobbles since they have been in the main light it may take abit.
---
For me for sure game is unstable, mainly lags, here and there graphic glithes (not like before but still) 
---
So I took the plunge and got into mutations, I put 2 down on starch gene and 1 on class freak, 
---
I have, Carnivore, Marsupial, plague Walker, Marsupial none of which have massive side effects that impacts way I place beside I have only 1 class freak card right now.
---
I then just on and added expert rifleman, so still have 6 point left, I’m at level 52 now.
---
Marsupial is awesome, a few of the others look interesting but I’m afraid to lose Marsupial.
---
When I first mutated I received plague Walker then bird eye and another one and both killed my strength so I rad showered one time, the last 2 mutations were removed or healed but plague walker remained. As the adverse effects I of plague Walker were ok I started to mutate again until I finally got Marsupial. Then stopped coz didn’t want to risk not be abt to remove the ones I do not want and losing Marsupial.
---
Does any one know if the removal is random or there is a sequence to the way it removes?
---
It could be that but tbh the servers are just as bad as when we had the carry weight glitch that almost everyone was using.
---
Even if it is just the weight I'm sure purposely crashing their game as they did probably put some stress on the servers as well. 
---
I think they just have shitty servers and we as fan boys are just making up excuses hoping that it's just the exploits people are using causing the issue
---
You clearly are a real salty jealous dude. Nothing wrong with promoting the guy I got it from? If you’re that unhappy with your life you have to shit post comments you got to take a long hard look at yourself
---
Really wish you had ended that with ‘FIRE ZE MISSILES’
---
Ok Mohammed. Go blaze it. Got those ultra from your prophet for free😃
---
Okay, I just responded to [your other comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/afa7pz/psa_we_are_not_entitled_to_cheat_hack_glitch_or/edyre5y/?context=0) where you actually let slip the real reason why you're getting so many more legendaries in your "real" farming.
---
You're exploiting the broken respawn system by anchoring with your team while you or someone else logs out and back in to force a respawn.
---
You know perfectly well that's not the way the game's supposed to work. It does work that way, because BGS are incompetent, but it's obviously not how it ought to work. You shouldn't get a fresh set of mobs every time someone on your team pops out of existence for 30 seconds. That makes no sense.
---
So here I am, playing legitimately, avoiding exploits for anything but workarounds for outright-broken systems, and you come along and tell me I'm doing it wrong.
---
No, I'm not doing it wrong. You are. It's just that doing it wrong is paradoxically the most profitable method right now.
---
Totally not appropriate to compare your experience to anyone who's just playing the game the way it's intended to be played.
---
15 strength but no shotguns, melees or heavy guns in sight. We are brothers, you and I. 
---
JUST got ANOTHER DC while investing tons of resources in a blast zone - SO FRUSTRATING. 
---
Got killed, dropped my stuff, DC. ARG. 
---
Makes me want to quit this game. 
---
If you'd like a good place to grind out circuits and plastic, get the scrapper perk and go kill the super mutants at Huntersville in the savage divide, the super mutants there almost always spawn with four or five of them having laser rifles and you can scrap them for plastic and circuits. 
---
I have my CAMP set up on a nearby Lead deposit and just go clear that area every 30 minutes or so while I'm playing, I actually end up having too much plastic/circuits and have to sell them.
---
It makes no sense, dense mod is 66% explosive damage reduction and 45% from fireproof should mean that explosive damage is totally neglected. People are reporting they take zero damage with dense and rank 3 fireproof
---
They have a weight limit of of storing only 2 in one purifier. Keep in mind that the 12 /hour production is global. So if you build 10 purifiers instead of 1 you still get only 12/ hour but you will be able to store 2 in each.
---
Your not alone bud we lost two nukes to dcing. The server stability is not doing much better since the patch. Its a legit 50 50 shot if you can make a nuke work the entire way through.
---
Hopefully the next planned patch will bring stability or something. Can deal with most bugs and issues but losing all progress over and over with nukes is driving me nuts.
---
Seems like they made it easier to get them there to balance the "difficulty" to get there. Oh btw have you found that secret place just below the roof of that vendor. 8/10 times it spawns a recipe for me.
---
My last C.A.M.P was in the same location. Had lots of super mutants with grenades spawning on the other side of the river. Not too difficult to kill, but they'd always blow something up. Had some mirelurks spawn inside the pre-existing buildings too.
---
Seems like racism
---
At this point I've lost at least 5-8 PA mods that I was interning to sell at least 500 each. I don't get why because this has been a known issue from day and it really can't be that hard of a fix becauss they literally just did it with Hardened Masses. Most likely just involves pulling up the appropriate item list and taking the PA mods off it. 
---
Unsure dude. Probably like 100k Caps or a few good end game trades or something ridiculous.
---
xXJokerXx
---
Why?
---
Be careful about saying stuff like that around this sub. You'll probably be shadowbanned
---
Wasnt on a corpse because i actually killed d the robot
---
I told a rando at Watoga cool helmet and he droped me one...
---
Do I need to drop this thing and log off or something? I had no idea it came from the dev room; what do I do?
---
How do you send messages to people?
---
You, madam, are my hero.
---
My only thought is what it would take?
---
What your suggestion would imply is the removal of all legendary weapons as is from the game. Then the addition of new ones, plus a new item, and a new mechanic. 
---
Even then if people found a new way to dup it would result in the same outcome we have now. And with they system as is, the roll back I think we will always have dupping. Just now they are starting to crack down on it.
---
That said I love the thought and one of you modders should start this project NOW. I know you all work in teams to and can probably get this done in a couple of months... Funny, thinking about that makes me think of B as the Dev..........
---
Doesn't matter. This patch only fixed this issue for Hardened Masses during the scrap all function. 
---
It’s Frustrating that our Fraternity is Filled with Fiends Finding Frivolous Fun in inFuriating our Fellow Farmhands and Pharmacists trying to Find a Foothold in these Flourishing Forests.
---
Think theres a sub for the enclave and BoS.
---
...fanks 😅
---
Did you equip the weapon right after and use it? Maybe one of those guys were spying on you and messing around.
---
Level up, utilize perks and upgrade according weapon that matches perks, my melee build had very little issue at level 16 with them
---
Thanks! Kinda blind on my end here, just now spotted it.
---
Fantastically Funny Friend
---
Same here, I thought that would be Vault Tec Bed 2. What a waste of money, not to mention I've been hunting for it for ages now when it was right in front of me all along!
---
Welcome to the wasteland. 
---
All good just thought I'd mention it :)
---
I have a legendary Mole Miner’s Gauntlet that can one to two shot any nuke zone ghoul and that’s without me being seriously spec’d into melee. My build also includes rifles and shotguns.
---
I've had PA parts unequipping if I'm carrying multiple Legendary armors of the same type (ie. Combat right leg). Try and check that.
---
Thank you, fellow ex-Ressie!
---
Yep. There's no pressure to save the world, to finish a major quest, to go do something. It's all at your own leisure, at your own pace. Wanna rush through finding the overlord's recording? Go ahead.
---
Wanna spend 30 hours just prettying up your camp near Vault 76? Knock yourself out.
---
Everyone is already dead, the scorched have already taken over. You can piece together the event at your own pace. Love it.
---
Keep looking when this happens. From my experience it just turns into a meat pile. Fucking HARD to find meat piles out in the bog, especially with the dozens around you from the swarms. 
---
You should just RP now.
---
Call yourself Armageddon, destroyer of servers. When you log in message everyone letting them know of their doom and their futile efforts will not save them. Then just go punch the highest level in the face.
---
Thats fine I will keep trying there
---
the fuck would you live stream it for
---
It's bethesda's fault for writing a multiplayer game with a client sided console and plain text netcoding.
---
This can't be fixed, not easily. It could take years to fix this shit and I doubt bethesda would bother.
---
Oh my god...I just realized [why he's called Wooby](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie)
---
I have a nice pc, and i am gettinf a few of the same things since patch. I get the weird loading screens into a half-loaded view of my spawnpoint, back to a loading screen and then into world. Only happens when i join a world. Crashes to desktop happening here and there as well now. Quite often the worlds i join are pretty unstable as well since. They patched duping, yet now the servers are worse? I'm not sure what they're doing.
---
I'm a regular lvl 80+ player.  I'd say up until about lvl 70 or so, I was running regularly at 800+ lbs in my excavator armor.  I didn't even realize that PA could even sprint!
---
I finally got to a point I felt comfortable dumping my stash and extra weapons just so I could fast travel (which I literally NEVER did for 70 lvls).  I was surprised how fast I could sprint in PA.  I thought my fast walking was actually sprinting.
---
Honestly, upgrade from the 1060.
---
It is a survival game, your girlfriend is not a vase, she will adapt.
---
Anything TSE other than a shotty 
---
&gt; the Hunting Rifle's .50 cal receiver is a step backwards. It's clearly a screwup
---
It's balanced out by the low cost of .50 bullets. 
---
&gt;I saw a german click bait gaming news article
---
Sounds legit.
---
Buddy of mine swears his problem was an older model processor. 
---
I have your setup. It is by all means NOT unplayable. You chose to play a demanding game with a mid tier computer. You shouldn’t expect to get “4K 240 FPS” You can live with a lag spike every now and then.
---
This is really amazing work! ty so much! I just wish the building budget wasn't so low though... :(
---
I play solo and am totally bored from 50 onwards. I've gone through two characters now... there's a big lack of motivation once the quests are all done and everything is being 1-shot.
---
I can see where your coming from, but since were not duping and got our weapons off drops im inclined to be ambivalent honestly. Your right though, your not doing it 'wrong' its an exploit,  and so your rate is more indicative. 
---
That said, many people who 'avoid' exploits ignorantly utilize them. Basically if you weren't exploiting you would leave the area after you kill everything since new spawns wont occur if you are the only one at a location and no one new either enters the world or fast travels to your location, and if either of those things happen the intended game mechanics is that those spawns are 'their' one time spawn not yours. So your either griefing by staying or exploiting.
---
Since i constantly see just about every player in white spring "wait for more spawns" and they don't seem to think they're griefing, I'm inclined to think the only difference between me and them is i understand the mechanic and am actively using it, whereas they are ignorant and passively using it. If its an exploit we are all exploiting though, just me to a different degree.
---
New spawns aren't a thing outside this 'exploit.'
---
So, you gave LSD to a 5yo and let him draw in front of a Boris playlist?
---
I heard crippling the wings makes them land, something with limb dmg would do good.
---
Do it with 15 people while 12 of them run around trying to give eachother prostate exams instead of helping.
---
I probably should have guessed, lol. But would you recommend automatic or a rifle?
---
You use the mouse to move the perspective and WASD to move the camera around, it's a bit like if you've used the TFC console command in previous games but way easier to control.
---
I have done but im aware that the more people the higher her armour 
---
Hopefully vault diving will be much much harder and designed for end players.
---
This.
---
And at least 8 of them don't carry a ranged weapon and the other 4 are sub level 20
---
I pray 
---
Get the rank 3 enforcer card and a shotgun.   Or any fun that has +limb crippling effect. 
---
Just dropped them all, it worked. But annoying. Thought it would have been FIXED by now 🙄
---
That sounds pretty dope, I'll have to look out for something like that. To be honest, I've mostly skipped over guns in this game so I'm not entirely sure what is good to use.
---
I actually love this game and I don’t even know why 😅
---
I do as well, nothing has that challenge to it that we crave. Need some Destiny or Warframe style push.
---
Maybe
---
I haven't played either but sounds good 
---
Do you mean semi or automatic?
---
What you asked was basically if you wanted a potato or a potato
---
SBs flap around like headless chickens with ADHD
---
Semi is generally best
---
Even if fo76 is a failure (it isnt) bethesda is going to make fo5 
---
Either you make stuff people want as a company or you go out of business. That's how this stuff works bro. 
---
In runescape there was a bug where you could kill anyone you want outside of the wild and no one could attack you back.
---
Yeah people exploited this.
---
The point is though that these exploits will continue until developers patch that fucking shit out. So telling people to "stop" is not going to get them to stop.
---
Maybe you should tell bethesda to fix this shit. These dupe glitches have been going on since oblivion. 
---
I wouldn't think so. I'm not a tech specifics guy, but from what I'd imagine, a VPN wouldn't be directly mirroring the data to another computer in an observable way like this statement implies. Because the data is pre-filtered via connection to the VPN, then delivered normally to you, then sent back through the same channel unchanged.
---
If your computer was the one processing the VPN, maybe. I'd think you're good otherwise? Haven't had VPN issues with other games.
---
Guesses here were pulled out of my ass, should probably wait for someone who can tell me I'm wrong(ish at least?).
---
Why are people holding on to these mods?
---
Use them.
---
I can't say I've EVER had this happen I still have mods in my stash from level 10, but it seems to be a thing that is becoming widespread as of late. People need to pay attention when others post these exact same topics if for nothing more than a heads up.
---
I guess moral is. Use the mods you buy when you buy them, don't sit on them.
---
Now this ... this is a huge kick in the gonads. :(
---
I personally can’t fucking stand the automatics in this game, but if you get a TSE handmade or LMG you could bring a scorch down in a couple of seconds 
---
lmao, yea probably should consider that
---
Super glue and not wood glue? 
---
They gonna lose a large amount of players with all these bugs lol
---
I got Heat Flashes in The Mire a lot.
---
I am down if you clowns are still around.  
---
Yeah, good luck with that. Unless your using a glitch to stack bobble heads or something, you’ll never do it in time. But who knows. Maybe you’ll get lucky. 
---
Oh no way! I must have looked past it hundreds of times!
---
Do you know where you got some of the plans?
---
Mole rats ... a hammer. It's so much easier to play whack a mole with those turds than to waste ammo.
---
Let them pop up them .. *Whack*. Knock its block off!
---
Sounds like CAMP raiders not anti dupers.
---
Also it sounds like you could be trying to deflect from dupers activity by misrepresenting the good work anti dupers do.
---
Thank you so much!
---
Ditto here. Both a buddy and I have been getting crashed to desktop since the last patch. 
---
All i know is that theres a radiation trap that activates and gives players around 50 rads for some seconds. Its very obvious tho and bad to hide.
---
I'm dissapointed by this to. I always thought ammo was a more legitamate currency for the game anyway. 
---
I'm guessing they're so restrictive on the vendors because of dumping, hopefully once they patch all those exploits they can revamp the vendor system. 
---
For less than a tenner? Buy it, play it and decide for yourself. I never find other people opinions helpful, but I'd say you'll definitely get £10 worth of entertainment out of it, whether you decide you really like it or not. 
---
Oh you know. Fallout things.
---
It's like a small time MMO. Level up, do quests, farm. Wait for more content to come out. No Human/Ghoul(Friendly Ghouls) NPCS. Just robots for now.
---
This pvp is not fun in 76, its not balanced and not done well at all. I just want pvp servers so we can have a PVE server option where griefers can't keep wrecking our camps.
---
If i want to pvp i will play a game meant for pvp. Lately i have been pvping to stop griefers especially those a holes that wreck the newbies bases at rhe overseers camp.
---
Unfortunately since the bobble / magazine stack issue went into the main light. A new breed has rocked up we can't deal with. A 200k+ weapon will still one shot even with reduced player damage and things like fireproof.
---
So thats where we are at and yeah... thats why hunter/hunted is not used by almost everyone.
---
Watch a couple of the ManyATrueNerd videos. He actually enjoys the game while also criticising some of the bad points, it’s a pretty unbiased view. Too many people jumped on the hate train and slandered it even though they had no clue what they were doing
---
Because dupers are arseholes who damage the server stabiliy and mess up the game economy.
---
When the law fails to serve us, we must become the law.
---
But yeah just repair it and move on. :p
---
I found one at Treetops.
---
Just looked it up, might just be what I want. I'll give it a try, thank you!
---
Thank you for this . Either they will sink or swim. If they don't get a new engine I'm guessing sink. I'm sure we'll see the same issues with the new Skyrim title without a doubt. 
---
Thanks, but these are the mole rat miners, like humans but big and stinky :) and they run fast as mole rats but are much more sturdy 😢
---
Same for me, the first launch was in solo and it's quite gratifying :) 
---
Out of curiosity, what was your target? 
---
Listen to them all in order and it should work from what ive heard
---
All Communism should be purged... from Californian Communism to Chinese.
---
You are a goddess godsend! This is amazing
---
Then people would just all turn on pacifist mode and never lose junk at all. 
---
Sucks that you lost your stuff but if pacifist mode = no losing junk then everyone would turn it on and it would make dying even more trivial.
---
Dont carry junk around, it's really simple.
---
This idea should have been there from the start but it would make the PvP even more watered down. At least now, if you kill someone, you might get some scraps here and there 
---
I want it
---
Nice thanks
---
Wrong... its required to destabilise servers...
---
My one and only launched nuke the game crashed the instant it hit the ground :)
---
Sure do. It's the little things like that which put a smile on my face. Little snapshots of what people were doing when the bombs dropped or how they met their fate afterwards. Some are pretty sinister, others amusing.
---
One I like a lot is in Nuka World, in Dry Rock Gulch. On the broken roller coaster thing, there's a skeleton sitting there, arms up just eternally enjoying the ride. 
---
The pyramid scheme fails when new entrants fail.
---
A follow up question: is there an easier way to move the camera up and down?
---
Nothing is working for me spoke to rose went to the terminal listened to the radio any more ideas?
---
This so much this.  As a melee player when I got hunting the big winged bats I always sub in Enforcer with a plan old combat shotty.  It's amazing how easily shotguns can cripple and force them down.  The damage doesn't matter, just fling those pellets whenever it's close enough to hit him as every pellet has a chance to proc the cripple effect, usually 8-12 rounds and they are down on the ground getting beaten in the face.
---
^ this!

OP, if we used this logic, I would kiss episode 9 of SW goodbye since TLJ was so polarizing 
---
Per character and not counting dupes of 1 million nuka colas
---
Ha ha yeah that's what I meant, my bad.
---
I did Silo Charlie by myself as a melee/rifles build around level 80 or so.
---
If you have a good mind for remembering a route (because you have a looooong run back to the end if you die) and either an Anti Armor or Troubleshooters weapon you'll probably do fine.
---
Also a stealth build in leather armor.
---
Do you understand the difference between duping and items existing in a room???
---
Speaking of the Handmade, what makes it special compared to other guns? 
---
You can get powerfist plans from the BoS vendor bot Phoenix in Watoga.
---
My camp for the last few levels has been opposite the skeleton in your first picture.  I’ve taken plenty of photos with that guy.
---
My laptop 1050 plays just fine on a mix of high and ultra
---
There are also only two mods, heated coils which is a hot garbage fire and puncturing which is sweet.
---
That would be a fair point but Bethesda is not some small indi developer and a lot of people paid triple what you did.
---
I'm in two minds about this, I was at the launch of Anarchy Online and that was even more of a shambles than this seems but I did eventually grow to love it despite the problems.   Not blessed with vast wealth, so any outlay is expensive for me, but I do love the fallout world so much....!  Tough decision ahead.
---
Sugar Grove has a list of halted development advanced tech with something like this. Basically emitted a rad cleansing bubble of space. Researched for potential tactical military support use. Discontinued due to power consumption requirements making the payload too large to be a reliable combat tech. Research is halted at that point. Could totally see one be put into practical use in CAMPs, have it require 2 fusion generators or something.
---
Sugar Grove has me thinking MODUS is aware and has been aware of their actions for a long while. Never know!
---
I've got a GTX 950 2GB, almost everything on ultra (except shadows) and I've got 40+++ fps at all times..
---
i5 4690K, 16GB 1600MHz RAM
---
Have you installed all motherboard chipset drivers?
---
Also try installing this - [https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/visual\_c\_redistributable\_runtimes\_aio\_repack.html](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/visual_c_redistributable_runtimes_aio_repack.html)
---
I spend 10 bucks on energy drinks without a second thought. You can spend 10 bucks on a game and try it yourself. Really only your opinion on the game is will what matter.
---
It’s one of the only online multiplayer games of its kind on console, the closest thing I can see is ESO, which I do not care a great deal for.
---
Fallout 76 is a multiplayer online world with survival elements, building elements, rpg elements, and has a story (told through holotapes and computer terminals) 
---
Is it perfect ? No.
---
Does it fill a void ? Yes. Especially on console.
---
If you want to rush to end game and try and max out what you can there you may not enjoy the game.
---
If you’re willing to take your time in the world and explore what it has to offer, all while they release fixes or content, then I’d say 10 bucks is worth spending.
---
The confusion comes from you calling them "rats" when they're mole miners.
---
Anyways, I can't confirm but it seems to me they're like mirelurks in that their faces are vulnerable and their "coats" are fairly resistant.
---
Trigger buttons on Xbox and I assume PS4
---
They even got the grills wrong. 
---
Let me guess its really rare and I have to server hop like hell? :/
---
... That is not at all what was said. The popular method was outright prevented, it can't be done at all, so now people are looking for alternate methods, when the previous alternatives (which also got patched, but there is a new one) would DC nearly whole servers
---
Oh .. hrm.
---
Those guys are tough. I suppose a shotty would be one of the better weapons to fight them with. Due to the spray effect in vats. 
---
Vats + shotgun = all pellets hitting the mob. You can even put a suppressor on it for stealth :D.
---
If some of you got pictures of what people did at the time the bombs fell then feel free to post links here .. would love to see your pictures..
---
Um. Okay. Thanks.
---
Not in my experience, I see it maybe every 2-3 times I visit the vendor.  I do vendor runs on all the different factions daily for 1400 caps and see it every day or two from single visits.  The ripper was rare as hell for me though :-p
---
Unbiased in this case meaning he isn't swearing until he's red in the face about how bad the game is and actually plays it (He just finished until new content comes out btw)
---
Fallout is however his *favorite thing ever,* so bear that in mind when watching his stuff. He connects a lot of lore together and it's a really good way to play/watch the game!
---
If it were then I'd be banned by now, I switch between VPN and normal several times a day because my internet speed is faster when on VPN lol (100mbit)
---
The card itself only refers to the crafting cost of workshop items with no mention of CAMPs. But you’re saying that it does apply to building in your CAMP as well?
---
I’m lvl 26, using combat shotgun and a silenced pipe 308 sniper rifle which does the trick from far away and up close. Often they roll in packs of 2-3 once startled so I frag grenade from afar but have little trouble taking down ones around lvl 22.
---
I do your point is? Servers are still dogshit on pc
---
That is exactly what I’m saying fellow wastelander.  I’ve done it numerous times myself and it’s fairly well known in the CAMP destroying/Got Destroyed circles.
---
if your still looking for one I've just found one at Lewisburg train station
---
Ok 'F'.
---
Reminds me of the good old days in FO4 Survival
---
All shops are random for each player. Your best of world hopping or join and friend check shop and rejoin  ( rejoining a friends server reloads the shops) 
---
I don't mind not being able to sale ammo, I hate that I can't break it down to make other ammo.... But that's me.
---
F Me
---
Imo the weird loading screen seems to be some half-assed way to correct  this:
---
" **\[PC\] Infinite Load**: Fixed an infinite load screen that could occur when attempting to join a server on PC. "
---
I beg to disagree. I am not ignoring perspective or field of view. Here, let me add to the image where each roof tile is and the connecting wall tile.

There's no time you're going to lose your junk outside of PVP anyway? Still drop the bag, just make it unlootable unless the person has PVP enabled.
---
Which would translate to left/right click on PC... if this works, thanks!
---
Oh hell yeah. Thanks for the help  :D
---
It is one of his favourite franchises, but he doesn’t really go “fanboy” over it. I mean if he spots something he doesn’t like he will say it, and doesn’t make excuses for it. He’s always hated the “look here” quest markers for example and openly says it ruins certain quests when other quests are great because they just give you a general area. He doesn’t sing it’s praises and says it’s amazing, but doesn’t try to follow the hate trend either to get views. He plays the game as he always has, so he seems pretty unbiased to me. I mean if you want to play a fallout game then surely you’ll have an interest in it anyway. 
---
PVP blows as it is, until it's fixed who cares?
---
I say this as someone who would love to PVP.
---
Only reason I had junk on me at Queen fight was because I was the one who dropped the nuke and I went straight there rather than go to my CAMP to junk, etc. because I had RL stuff to do in the 2 minutes until it started.
---
No worries my dude, enjoy beating things in the face in the wastes!
---
Yeah i did.  That could be possible.  But idk how you can recognise a legendary weapon just on sight
---
Did you ever find a solution for this?  I have the same issue.
---
I think my TSE and the lack of a melee build will be a Problem. TSE nice and good at range but up close really deadly for the user :D 
---
Stop supporting scummy behavior with the excuse that they're "supporting the economy". This isn't WoW or EVE Online; we don't need a massive player driven economy. F76's trading is supposed to be a person to person, spur of the moment style trading where prices are hashed out then and there and where you don't spend hours consulting forums for "market value".
---
Dupers are duping ***so they can cheat***. That's it. They're cheaters who want to get a massive pile of shit and caps without doing the work.
---
Fired my first nuke last night (Lv91). Server crashed half way through. But I was invested to wipe my last main quest of my pipboy. Started again, but it seemed to spawn lower level droids, but decided to spam with  turrets? Finally got to launch and "I became death". Looked at the cost with fast travel, two broken melee weapons, no ammo left of .45 and 308 (reduced to bashing turrets), 2 stimpacks left and no radaway. Literally had nothing left to farm the nuke site! Lesson learned, that it's better with freinds! 😂
---
You are not your fucking khakis
---
You don’t drop your bag if you’re killed without entering pvp though? or unless you’re killed by something out in the world that’s not a player. Pacifist is to stop you accidentally initiating pvp in crowded areas or with stray bullets. It does it’s job as intended. 
---
Subnautica is leagues better than this. 
---
God, it's so scary, too. lol
---
Oh my God, music to my ears my dude. I'm going to have to hop on over to a market and start looking around for a nice shotty with extra limb damage. Thanks for the tip! Now the Scorchbeast Cleansing can truly begin.
---
Sorry, edited now :)

Here the link to the VOD so you can watch. https://www.twitch.tv/videos/v362942383

You are the man!!!
---
He is the link to VOD to watch  https://www.twitch.tv/videos/v362942383
---
Awww are you OK someone hurt your feelings :c
---
Stack up some stimpacks, water and food.
---
Make sure you have nuke card and check the passcode at nukacrypt.com
---
People nuke whitesprings for xp and nuke prime fissure site for queen
---
You're weird. I like you. You should listen to the Comedy Bang Bang podcast. You'd like it.
---
Some mods require mats I haven't gotten yet(flux). Or mods require points in skills i Haven't gotten yet. Or are even for weapons I'm going to modify for friends. 
---
I did mine earlier in the week at like level 45
---
I lost a x01 armor that i was plscing to enter snd fame crashed.
---
I contacted suport and thay said they cant restore lodt items .
---
It is sad thst bethesda cant do what Blizzard could do 2006 and you got a apology from them too.
---
Her its just no we cant/wont restore what our game screwed upp.
---
This game keeps getting better and better, init?
---
Yes, but maybe use a VPN so they can't track you? 
---
In addition if you don't have the crops to repair them just scrap them. You get back exactly what you need to plant them.
---
I have a x01 Jetpack for Sale I’m on Xbox GT themisterphenix 
---
I have the tool chest and it works fine. I'm on Xbox. 
---
Yes you do, whenever you die you drop your bag.  I've TSE'd myself to death (many times) and dropped my bag, with Pacifist enabled.
---
This time I was killed by post-queen mobs causing me to drop my bag.
---
Anti-dupers don't do any goddamn good work.
---
You inconvenience them for five minutes then they server hop and go back to it.
---
Only Bethesda has the ability to do "good work" by fixing the bugs that allow it.
---
People just like that it looks like an AK, but it’s a good automatic if you can get the mods
---
Welcome! Have made a few friends because of helping or being helped by people.  Have fun.
---
Yah that’s right.  Great reminder.  I’ll probably Edit it in.
---
What?
---
I'm not special??  You mean mom lied to me??  :(
---
Grrr... Thanks to translators !! In French this challenge says "kill mole RAT" ...
---
And thanks again to translators, I had a "miner helmet"... which different from a mining hat ...
---
Thx beatty420 for all those clarification...I hope i will be able to complete it now :)
---
You should post a side pic of your character in game.
---
Amazing art style here !
---
Cause you can't put mods on something you don't have yet.
---
Like I have calibrated shocks for T-60, but haven't gotten the legs yet.
---
And if I found a x-01 jetpack, I'd surely buy it cause I know in the future I'll want it.
---
Really? I don’t recall ever dropping a bag when being killed by other players when I’ve not accepted combat or been in the middle of a workshop claim. Unless by chance I’ve never had junk on me at the time. I suppose that might be it. 
---
You should start some shit if a customer spits in your food, but what if a customer eats pasta with chopsticks? Are you going to start some shit with the customer breaks the uniform pattern of forks and spoons with a pair of chopsticks she brought from home?
---
If someone is duping materials, it won't ever affect you. If someone is trading paint jobs, it won't ever affect you. Someone eating spaghetti with chopsticks won't ever affect you.
---
This should be pinned. 
---
Yeah. I don't think that's how any of this works. 
---
I would've kept just the screws and spring so I won't have to worry about them again, or give them away depending on my mood
---
No worries my dude, welcome to the small but growing group introducing power tool fueled terror to all the enemies of Vault Dwellers :-)
---
Ahh ok, thanks for the info. 
---
You can always report them on xbox and take a video on the incident. 
---
You can always block other players in game in the social menu (will only be for that session) plus block their xbox profile (will be for any game and you'll never run across them again). 
---
You have to do those 2 separately. 
---
I wouldn’t call Fallout76 a failure yet. It might have had negative press at launch and didn’t met expectations or hype for the game. To early to call it a failure. Considering the plan for Fallout76 is to be the last Fallout for the next 5-10 years. It will be ported over to next gen consoles. They will added free content Paid DLCs and Expansions similar to what ELDER Scrolls Online did and Destiny has done.
---
I believe with in a couple of year this could be the best Fallout ever. Though most people will find that hard to swallow and believe. I believe it has the potential to get there.
---
Adding NPC’s and new enemies. Adding Raids and new content. Adding more game modes and new maps and areas. This game has a lot potential. Though the first 2 months has been rough. The game has gotten better. 
---
Just check the amount of folks over level 50 on the map before launching on queen, if your server is 90% sub 30 players pass on it, if it's at least half over level 50s it shouldn't be an issue.  I think I have only seen the queen fail to go down 1-2 times out of the dozens of times we have launched on her.
---
My biggest jump scare was that one bug where you would randomly be hit by something invisible. Not cause any real damage, just the sound and the screen effect.
---
It was so odd. I'd be walking, no-one near, no-one for miles, sunny day, all going well. Then suddenly the hit. Was very unsettling.
---
I’ll do the testing again but I’m pretty sure it’s a 3 or 4 second charge for the gauss. With the timing it was 2 or 3 shots with the hunting rifle in the same time frame. 
---
The hunting rifle will also take one shot  so that’s a moot point. So now we are gonna talk about multiple enemies. The Gauss TTK is poor compared to the hunting rifle. You can take out 3 to 1 enemies with the HR compared to the Gauss... It’s up to you if you want to care about that I guess.
---
A lot of peeps in this community just do not know, or care, about TTK. When you start putting up decent damage values with any weapon fire rate becomes a huge factor. The Gauss is just too slow
---
You definitely drop your junk regardless of how you die.  Even if a ghoul kills you
---
They should make it so the explosive effect only adds AoE effect to the bullets and nothing more, no increase in damage. It would make that effect more situational, balanced and it would be more of a double edged sword.
---
I think there is a problem with grognak axe and this perk because I have the same problem and only with the Grognak axe not another melee weapon. 
---
RIP
---
What would you want for the t60 n t51 bright headlamp
---
Ofcourse you drop it if you die to something (non player)  in the world, that’s not what I was talking about though was it 
---
Why is this game so cheap everywhere in the world but Canada 
---
It's still $60 here ugh I guess that's $30 cheaper than normal but still lol crazy 
---
I think I got mine in Harpers Ferry
---
I'm a sucker for alliteration.  
---
Duper trying to offload stuff before the patch lol
---
Pretty sure 2 completely different 
---
teams work on fo76 and the when ever to be fo5 
---
Maryland works on the main ones 
---
Austin is working on 76 
---
Killing yourself is not pacifist though, it’s your own fault. And you drop your bags dying to mobs. You do not drop your bag when other players kill you outside of pvp though. That’s not what pacifist was made for
---
[This](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/208) mod can help
---
/u/LoneVaultWanderer can we have an answer please, it's annoying cause this axe broke too quickly without that
---
1400 caps for both? IF that’s good for you Message me on Xbox Gt themisterphenix 
---
the queen's resistances scale with the number of players that share the event that you get when in range of the queen, so as long as you have moderately powerful weapons (and other people arent going AFK while in the event) you shouldn't worry about facing her alone.
---
You're fine and maybe that helmet should be obtainable in-game but due to a bug it isn't, that wouldn't surprise me. Anyways you got the helmet from someone else so you can't be banned by it since you didn't do anything wrong.
---
I confirm, it's annoying
---
I thought this was something from r/letterkenny for a second
---
Well then isn't that exactly how you accomplish the goal of this title?
---
Oh yeah? Find me a copy!
---
Nice little but plug at the end
---
Pain is weakness leaving the body
---
Same, it was cool for a while when the game came out but now it’s just a shit show at whitesprings, nuked or not, and I’m tired of it. It will surely be a less popular spot after the new patch though. They’re nerfing xp gains for glowing ghouls. Not much reason besides legendary farming anymore, if that.
---
I actually found out that this isn't a bug and the thing isn't invisible it's just hard to see. I was walking around and got hit by it one time and hit q and I ended up locking on to this like tiny egg like thing on the ground. I forgot the name but they are basically little mines that cause damage and cause your character to flinch. 
---
I am not familiar with this
---
Report them for what though?  Playing the game?
---
Thankyou! I used to do this all the time in the beginning and nobody would ever accept
---
I was helping some bastard defend Spruce Knob against a Scorchbeast that did not stop bombarding me with its ranged sonic ring attacks...there was absolutely no pause between its projectiles.
---
With limitless building there would be so many more pros than cons. For blocking certain quest buildings you could just switch server, problem solved.
---
I always target either Whitespring Resort or Fissure Site Prime.
---
You can't, only the initiate paint drops from that.
---
I had a guy wreck my camp because I wouldn’t let him fast travel off of me.
---
He spent caps to FT then went wanted for a couple hundred caps out of spite.
---
So yeah. Those players asking for a team invite can take said invite and shove it up their Geiger counter 
---
I always accept any invitation without looking. 
---
What CPU do you have?  
---
Might be a processor bottleneck.  
---
Either drop the game down to minimum settings or increase your resolution (enabled super resolution/DSR if you know how) and check your frame rate.  
---
If your frame rate stays mostly the same under either circumstance it may mean your CPU is choking.
---
https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/fallout-76-players-banned-for-accessing-secret-developer-room/
---
Ohhh Really?! Huh. Today I learned!
---
Still, fuck those little things then. Out of nowhere, I get hit. Always freaked me out when I was completely sure I was safe!
---
What the "F"?
---
Maybe in a future dlc, but I wouldn’t hold my breath
---
I can't imagine getting all the way to the end and forgetting a nuke card! I've definitely got one though, so all good! 
---
If you’re going to invest a lot of time into getting your gf to do something she initially doesn’t want to do it’s got to be anal 
---
You are not altering the data, you are encrypting it. The data is unaffected.
---
That's a good idea, thanks!
---
F you?  No, F me!
---
And sometimes they just need a party to complete a weekly challenge
---
Oh I thought shops were shared between players
---
Literally dying any at all you drop junk.
---
Fall off a building or ledge? Drop junk. 
---
Get dropped by an enemy? Drop junk.
---
Killed by rads due to environment? Drop junk.
---
just like the laser pistol, you can turn the pipe pistol into a rifle variant with mods
---
Was tired man.
---
Isn’t there a white subreddit dedicated to trades? 
---
Yup that too
---
I don’t think you craft pipe rifles. You craft a pipe pistol and then mod it with a stock. But you need the plans for the mods.
---
making a stock for the pistol makes it a rifle
---
I've got a couple of nice rifles, not two-shot explosive level but I can hold my own in most situations. Are AFKers common in the event? Seems weird to make the trip their just to do nothing..
---
One man army perk under luck
---
A minigun
---
You’re welcome
---
Yes but I wish the goal (killing the queen) was way harder than it actually is 
---
Like? 
---
Yes, I post on a couple of different sub Reddit’s.
---
no problem, just give it a stock and long barrel
---
Got a .50 mod scrapping if I remember it wright, was on the beta.
---
we need someone to make a mod so we can see this when browsing venders plans...
---
Sorry I didn’t get that. What do you mean you wouldn’t let him fast travel? You mean didn’t accept invite?
---
Don’t know why you got downvoted because that’s a valid reason.  
---
CPU is responsible for the maximum FPS your system can handle. If it can’t handle the load; your potential maximum drops.  
---
76 is poorly optimised and hinges on the processor a lot. Anything with less than 4c/4t ~3.3ghz is probably gonna bottleneck your GPU in this game.
---
Oh im an idiot. Yes you have to repair the pipes!
---
Nah it would be better if they were shared but its all rng on the players. 
---
[Sale Shelves](http://i.imgur.com/xvfNqqT.jpg)
---
Couple of new bugs arose with the latest patch for pc.  
---
A visual bug - I was with a teammate mowing down ghouls, both of us in power armors, in whitesprings, when he left my screen to do something and came back - Only this time he was transparent, and his weapon was flickering in his hand, and he was not in power armor in my screen, even though I'm pretty sure he was for him.  
---
When using Z and C key to change quantity of item sold, it now does not stop to 1, but instead starts from the max stack and you can loop this.  
---
Tried to take a screenshot of aforementioned ghost teammate, but normal screenshots only have power armor hud and rest of the screen is black. I dug some interwebz and this is a common issue as well, though from earlier patches.
---
I was in Whitesprings and the robots were behaving a bit off.  They said today was a code red day.  I then fought a lvl 42 Venegful Mothman and an lvl 80 Epic Behemoth at the back gate about 15 minutes later.
---
I remember the first time I dressed myself too! My mommy was so proud! I put one pant leg on at a time, the shirt was on backwards, but I did it!
---
Lol jk man gj on your first nuke. That place can be a maze for the first dozen or so launches 
---
If its the one to open the doors in any of the nuke sites, remove all the cores around the terminal, then repair them at the bench, then put them back around the terminal.  Its super laggy removing/replacing them just keep clicking on them.
---
Valid enough.
---
Oh thanks.
---
Ryzen 5 2400 
---
Still people crying about this? whoa
---
Never. No one rides for free. 
---
15th
---
Could be wrong but I read multiple times crits in vats are a guaranteed hit.
---
If 76 becomes a success then they won't make a 'Fallout 5'.  The next iteration of Fallout will be a live services mtx game.
---
BOS vendor sells the mod. I got mine from there.
---
And I can now see too much with bright lamp mod attached lol, it's way too bright now
---
They are.
---
i've only heard about them, never noticed any personally despite being in multiple SBQ fights.
---
mind that there are people who might seem to AFK but are actually just waiting to the queen to land so they could melee her. they usually compensate for their inactivity with their high melee damage once she lands though
---
You are certainly going to need ammosmith and super duper. I have a plasma flamer I use for Whitesprings and it eats through ammo. Also consider weight. You will want a few ranks of batteries included. Most importantly you need to decide pistol or long gun. With pistols look towards a vats build for your non flamer weapons. Commando is more your spray it down. This includes rifles and smgs as well as auto energy weapons. 
---
whats duping
---
I accept when I noticed them but honestly fast travel isn't that expensive. I fast travel everywhere and still earn thousands of caps through normal game play.
---
How does this end up as a PSA so often?
---
Find your own caps.
---
Very handy indeed! 
---
I can't seem to find the bar tables in the list though. Have I just missed them or?
---
I rarely except invites because I assume they want to play in a team and because I have children and 2 puppies I’m constantly afk. 
---
There's a difference between fantasy aspects of a game set in post-apocalyptic West Virginia and how buildings work lol. Supermutant behemoths make sense in this universe.
---
Yep, there's no motivation to pvp. Between being one shot by explosive weapons or melee, and doing piss all damage to sentinel/assassin armour sets, there's really no much one can do.
---
They have segments where they go through the alphabet like this is the show. It’s a fantastic watch if you have Hulu; or Crave in Canada
---
Sure !!! Buy it , then give it to someone you hate ..
---
Couple rad aways, if you are going trough the silo for the first time and you are going solo, it's gonna take you a while, I've done it 100+ times and I still get lost, radiation ain't much but if you take your time, will end up being a pita.
---
You are 96 so I'm assuming you hacking is lvl 3, instead of taking down the turrets, go to a terminal and change their target preference (that will save u so much ammo/effort since they are awesome at killing enemies) 
---
Soloing a silo ain't that hard, takes me 10-15 mins with my melee build, try not to hang out in a place for too long cause enemies respawn overtime, longer u take harder will get. Have fun! 
---
You get more per hour if you build one of each size.
---
Easiest would probably be the Uranium fever event.  It's spawns 3 legendary mole miners at lvl  40.  They drop legendaries at level 30 through 40 usually.  Could also try horde events around the Savage divide.
---
Really the difference is minor, like 5 or 10 points of damage. The armor pen is kinda pointless when you get 90% armor pen from perk cards.
---
All good information, thank you!
---
Somehow my hacking is only level one, but I think I have 6/7 level ups in stock so that works
---
Yes, afkers are common, I get a couple every nuke, queen ain't that hard ,you can go for the prime, just make sure your damage output is 400+ and you should be fine, that would be the minimum I would recommend for a solo try (will take u bout 15 mins) 
---
So the way around that is to be an asshole to anyone who's even slightly suspicious like these guys?
---
That's a bit hypocritical. Take some time to think dont just level every base with a low level character on it
---
Oh, okay. Your CPU definitely shouldn’t be struggling with 76.  
---
Here’s a quick checklist:  
---
Have you made sure everything is updated? GPU drivers (either via Geforce Experience or by manually downloading them) in particular and - if your comfortable doing it - BIOS.  
---
Ensure the power plan on your PC is set to “Maximum Performance”. Windows updates have a bad tendency to revert this change.  
---
Is it a consistently low FPS or does it spike/hang?
---
Ahh gotcha.  Might check that out.
---
Hey sorry to ask. Fall76 is the 1st online game I have played so I'm new to the dingo. What is mats is it short material? 
---
I generally ignore them.  They can pay the caps,  fast travel isn't expensive and caps aren't hard to get.
---
If u on Xbox I can babysit you, running radsponge and you get to do everything by yourself, plus having a teamate is always good in case you crash or die so the quest progress won't restart
---
That sucks dude, hope she doesnt feel too discouraged.
---
A lot of these anti duper whatever they're called people need to at least think before they do this, they'll discourage the new players of an already suffering game :/
---
I soloed my first nuke launch and it was pretty easy, but ammo consuming. As long as you are well geared and have enough ammo you will be fine.
---
I don't know if this is true, but someone here said, that soloing nuke launching is actually easier than doing it with a group, because of the scaling.
---
Thank god for you 
---
I'm on PC unfortunately, but thanks for the offer!
---
Ahhhh I see. Well most of the dudes I see at Whitesprings have these TSEs lol. Are these dupers easy to spot? Because personally, I haven’t come across any in my playthrough of the game yet. Or maybe, I just haven’t noticed them. 
---
No. Still getting this anomaly but I got used to it. I've experienced all but launching a nuke so I'm no longer bothered by the visuals.
---
Send me a message, not a random team invite. I ignore randoms that are not standing next to me. At least I know the guy next to me is doing the same quest and wants to team up on it.
---
https://youtu.be/Z0sq3T5fErQ
---
Yes, i have made all' this things. Now in gonna try to use lowest setting possibke
---
Duplicating mats. There are ways to do this and it imbalances the game because PvP isn’t optional.  
---
\&gt;can't wait for anthem. You mean the game that died a week after E3 reveal?
---
Maybe energy weapons in the intelligence tree perk and probably rifleman perk as well. Gauss rifle benefits from this as well.
---
Col. Gutsy when i was sneaking :"Chickenshit commie tactics !"
---
Not sure what you're pissed about. You die, you drop your junk, anyone can loot it. Pacifist doesn't enter the equation.
---
Farm harpers ferry for plans. I found the marine tactical helmet plan (i think it was in harpers ferry). Those are cheap to craft (rubber, aluminium, steal i guess, but definitely no uncommon materials) and sell for good caps.
---
Get pharma farma and can do!, level one is enough. You will find lots of canned food and drugs you can sell. Get the perk for extra meat and hunt some brahmin, radstag, etc. Cook and sell.
---
Kill miners, they give uncommon materials, assault rifles and rocket launchers which sell for good caps.
---
It’s good to know there’s a bobby on the beat in these lawless lands! I can get my Well Rested status securely and soundly at night.
---
My gf hasn't even had ps+ til now I'm really afraid this sort of thing is probably gonna happen. It's gonna be a huge deterrent to her if people are already acting like this. 
---
I'd intentionally encountered a group of exploiters before, but I stayed long enough to get a video to prove they were doing something fishy before I did anything. Sorry that group you encountered didn't even stay long enough to see you were just playing casually and jumped to their own conclusions.  
---
This might be my favourite, and because I, for some reason, never visited Sutton Station in my earlier hours of playing, it took me a long time to hear it regularly.
---
Unless the invite involves a nuke launch
---
This needs to be a sticky. We all need this guide.
---
Demolition Expert
---
I saw zero when someone nuke the city. Spent the entire nuke relogging to respawn the ghouls. 
---
You have to do everything and pray for no server disconnects.
---
It's worth it at that price. Wish I had waited to buy it. I would say get a couple copies for a friend because this game is loads better with friends.
---
It's not, these prices are at grey market retailers, where your key is 50% likely to be revoked a few days later.
---
&gt; now im overweight but useless  
---
r/me_irl
---
Where's that?
---
actualy matter if u use auto barel u need comando perks.
---
Buy it for 10, but don't cry here when your key will be revoked a few days later.
---
Didnt they nerf those attacks? I find them more avoidable nowadays. If you face the sb the rings come out in patterns, so they become avoidable.
---
My excavator PA is still bugged like that. I only have the 100 extra carry weight if I log in wearing the PA. So obviously, I always equip it before logging out. It's annoying because everytime I jump out of it to craft or mod something, I lose the bonus upon reentering (and am overencumbered most of the time).
---
No idea why this is still happening, and I would rather NOT be forced to server-hop just to be able to fast travel again.
---
That or people who fast travel to your camp and raid your junk node since it's not locked for teammates.
---
Will they be scaled to a TSE shotgun that everybody has?
---
Better not explain what duping is. We don't want more people googling for that.
---
Watoga's super duper mart. North East side.
---
After shooting a scorchbeast out of the sky, a Whitespring gardener said, “Oh great, another thing for me to clean up.”
---
That’s what I thought but for some reason this one just didn’t stop...didn’t even kill it, it flew away after what seemed like forever, and we completed the defense anyway. 
---
I hope it gives us a reason to run support builds
---
Np, dude. Glad I could help. 
---
?
---
There is no energy weapons in intelligence. The perks you might be thinking of are Science Expert and Science Master but they only have an effect on crafting and repair.
---
Seriously. How sad are these people. 
---
Remove all multiple legendaries all together and have the star represent the power of that effect?
---
Stimpaks, ammo, circuitry and pray that mid way theres no server disconnect.
---
Tip: if in the last part, the nuke assistant doesnt move to its location like its supposed to, let him be killed. The system will reload a new protectron and it will go to its assigned console.
---
I don't think so. My friends and I have no difference in melee vs ranged.
---
Would armor penetration affect this.  Essentially bypassing your dense mod on armor?
---
does anyone know what they do I've been picking them up but have no idea what to do with em
---
If you had a decent meal and see staff is over their head it's also common courtesy to take your stuff from your table and clean up after yourself so it at least it's easier on the crew. (If at least you know a spot to take plates like a bus boy bin or something.) I work I'm food industry and will often grab plates and things even though I'm tasked with other things. If I notice a team is in disarray I'll pass on the help by taking care of my plates so they don't have to make a trip to my table themselves. (More for like a café style place not like a full on sit down restaurant)! 
---
Bethesda isn't going to go bankrupt because one game doesn't sell well. They are going to make FO5 no matter what, because they know it will make money. Supporting fallout 76 is sending the message that releasing an unfinished game full of game breaking bugs is something they can get away with. That said I like 76, its an ok game. I wouldn't call it a good game but its ok. If I had know what this would be I wouldn't have pre ordered it. 
---
Bethesda deserves to take a hit on this game because how they handled it is unacceptable and the only way they will learn is to speak with your wallet.
---
I got very lucky and only server hop twice in the vendor and White Springs had it Thanks anyway
---
I keep my daisy-cutter for when I find mini nukes, it’s more fun to shoot one than to drop it or leave it behind.
---
Nice yeah I gotta stack up on Ammo first. But thanks I was losing hope because of the other comments :D 
---
It's sad to see this happen. My recommendation is, let her join a world first and check the average lvl in the server. Then you join and enjoy the game. I've been to different servers and sometimes I get placed in worlds with really low level players and starters, other times I'm in worlds where the lowest levels are 80+. And to be honest, it's better finding a low level server, lags less and chances of disconnecting are low.
---
Absolutely.  I have a solo stealth build and my silenced handmade is my workhorse
---
Maybe it wasn't perfect, but it was great. I wasn't best and didn't want to be the best. I had a character who faction made armor for herself. And did the quests for the RIS armor. I had poor materials and my stuff wasn't great, but it was mine. Not everyone needs to, or wants to be the best. But that was something a person could aspire to, and achieve if they really wanted to.
---
That is true, but only if they stack bobbleheads.
---
You sure you didn't scrap a baseball bat?
---
When the nerf hammer hits, the game will get harder.
---
Ridiculous that we need this, but great job!
---
The one called Phoenix? 
---
I hope so 
---
I did my solo in alpha at level 36. Took ages. 
---
Your are a shiny golden god and I thank you from the bottom of my heart
---
Next time it happens stop and look around and try and use vats around the ground, would be cool to know someone else saw it lol.
---
prepare for lagfest and DC
---
further personal PSA if you're on ps4 and you're a lower level player who gets an invite from CGJ15 accept it, I'm trying to give you free legendaries
---
Yes mats is material 
---
Love that you put it in somewhere where it would blend into the pre-existent environment.
---
metal powered doors? i only have wood and brick. where ca ni find the plan for metal ones?
---
nice, i tried my first time a month ago, in middle of setting nuke codes up server crashed, have not tried ever since, it is pain to get that far again.
---
How bad is it that ultimately you find the state of the industry acceptable as long as the products are eventually as good as they should be. This shouldn't become the normal even more so, the industry needs to figure out how to put out fully realized products again.

---
5 seconds after fast travel or join new world
---
Aim with gun
---
Just stand still afk for a while
---
Look at the queen
---
Try to loot something

Second nuke drops
---

But 'the server is not responding' shit is definitely reduction
---
I don't know what to say without insulting someone.
---
It's the skull bandana from pleasant valley station. A surgical mask is available there as well.
---
Published by EA. So? I bet it runs better than this garbage heap. Cosmetic micro transactions mean nothing to me because I don’t buy them. The Battlefront2 campaign was awesome. I enjoyed it and traded the game in once I finished it. If I can play Anthem for a few months and I don’t have to deal with disconnects and game killing crashes it will have been a better game than Fo76. 
---
If you do this, you are just as bad as a duper.
---
You're only going to know if you like it or not by forming your own opinion and not relying on some stranger on YouTube and it's £10 for god's sake what are you worried about ?
---
So instead of paying for skins, youd rather pay 2 win? Sounds good man 
---
I agree as well, but we all know they don't and I truly wish no grief for this, but simple kindness and positive interaction may be just what this kid needs.  I just be nice and quickly excuse myself so as to keep the boundary.
---
They likely don't stack to make 105% reduction. Instead, one probably is calculated after the other.
---
I bet it launches in a better state than Fo76. I bet it won’t be the worst user rated game in Metacritc history. 
---
Also, if you're playing solo, pretty much everyone is using Lone Wanderer, which is negated by a team-up. I'll usually accept the invite and let them travel, but then immediately de-team. 
---
I have a secondary character named Mule but I’ve never duped. He gets that name because he carries all the extra shit me and my friends find but don’t want to carry/get rid of.
---
I.e. chems, guns, armor, ammo, plans, etc
---
That was probably the Sentry bot animations.
---
I've seen them on ghouls. It's pretty funny.
---
And you can loot it back. I'm annoyed that the negative side of PVP (losing your junk) isn't locked to PVP. If I die to the environment the NPCs aren't going to loot me, they're not going to get my endgame mats. If I die to a player and they loot me go nuts, part of the game, losing your junk is a consequence of PVP, not of PVE.
---
It's literally the only negative of PVP, it's why nobody has PVP enabled, why am I suffering it from PVE? Especially if I have PVP disabled.
---
Wait, let mr kill this annoying scorchbeast and the deathclaw that is now coming out the power station. Then ill go to whitesprings and check for you if theres a jetpack there. :)
---
Did you scrap en masse? Cause I’ve learned plans from weapons I didn’t even scrap for instance I learn e heavy barrel for the .50 cal from scrapping a crap ton of combat rifles assault rifles and shotguns at a rapid pace I figured I just broke the server for a moment.

I abhor dupers. They are disgusting. I looked up dupe guides on youtube a few weeks ago. The method was so easy that anyone could dupe. That being said, if a significant and easy economic exploit such as duplicating any item, can be around for 2 months in an online game, game studio shouldnt ban anyone. They literally dont give a fuck at that point. But dear god if someone glitches your broken product: "yeah, get banned, now we feel much better about ourselves, it's your fault we deliver totally broken products that a 3 year old can exploit"
---
First buy, then decide?
---
Sweet thanks
---
That's awesome I was thinking about moving my camp nearby. There's a set of stairs going up to the broken monorail nearby I was considering using. Maybe we'll be neighbors. :) 
---
Wrong subreddit 
---
I don't think they necessarily need a nerf, I mean if Bethesda doesn't want us to one-shot their regular enemies then they will but 2 shot and especially explosive both shouldn't be the defacto modifiers, bring some other effects up to par at least
---
This exact same thing happened to me. Guy leveled my base and then proceeded to taunt me afterwards by sending me a message saying merry Christmas (it was Christmas Day when I was playing).  One of the worst experiences I’ve ever had in a video game. 
---
So... releasing unfinished buggy game while charging full price should become the norm?
---
Im not ok with paying 70€ for a work in progress. 
---
You think the solution is for adult players to chase kids off the servers or report them?
---
It's nothing like eso in literally any way.
---
It's closer to gta online, but where everyone doesn't go out of their way to murder you. 
---
Hopefully this whole, everyone is duping mass hysteria will end soon and the game is crashing because of it will end soon. (The game is just buggy!!)  Then maybe the misinformation will stop spreading.    There is an infinite carry weight bug, there has been for a LONG time.   I believe they just fixed it on the PC.  So no, if someone cannot run it does NOT mean they are a duper (after nuke zone runs I often am several hundred pounds over weight), and a duper can have the infinite carry weight work around in place and you will likely have 0 idea they are carrying too much. (At least on console at this point)
---
why does this look like a screenshot of an n64 game?
---
I edited the OP to include another point, but it's a hostile action against another player, Pacifist SHOULD enter the equation. If someone loots my bag I should have the opportunity to get my stuff back - make it flag someone for PVP. As it stands if I die and someone comes along and loots me dry because I died to a mob or whatever, they've got the benefit of "winning" PVP, and I've suffered the consequence of PVP (losing my junk) but I can't respond?
---
Christ I can't wait for PVP servers to be able to kill all these people.
---
Except now with the explosive guns rampant it’s hard to get a shot in the uranium fever event before everything dies. 
---
Vault 76 was a highly competitive vault, wasn't even the experiment but we're so competitive someone lost a tooth because they won the best dental hygiene award.
---
Mods don't require any mats at all; that's the whole point of a mod versus plans. It might show you the mat requirements to craft that mod but you can just hit A to attach it. 
---
It's a risk you take bro, calm down its just a game.
---
Happened to me yesterday as well
---
Because lowering graphics solve some crashes on Radeon hardware
---
My suspicion is that speed boosts don’t stack. So having speed demon negates the need for any other speed boost. I say suspicion because I have only tested it with Gun Runner and Sleek armor mods.
---
It’s so pretty! I love the style. 
---
wait what?!
---
No. Let fallout 76 sink so they dont make the same mistake again. You cant reward bad practices or they become the norm.
---
We want an outstanding TES IV, a great Starfield and an much better Fallout game.
---
That seems complicated, given the low number of players on a server and that you can't post any text messages asking for help. I opened a support ticket yesterday, maybe they can put the item in my inventory or reset my progress to the last step of the previous quest so I can get the card again.
---
Sounds like a great idea. Path of exile has a website that works well like this.
---
I wish you luck and success.
---
One question: How will you weed out dupers?
---
What you gonna do, what you gonna do when they come for you...
---
Same thing happened to me snd my wife tonight
---
Are you playing full screen?
---
&gt; they've said repeatedly that they can't remove duped items from player inventories. 
---
I would be curious to have a source for that. The **customer support can't modify inventories** certainly, but whoever has access to the data center can.  
---
I like to send invites to people right before I complete quests so they get the rewards. It's all about the community. Hmu on PS4 today If you enjoy "blazing" the Appalachian trail
---
So the correct solution, rather than just treating young players with a bit of civility is  harassing them until they leave?
---
Oh shit. This whole time no1 said anything. Thankyou
---
How does one transfer items from each character? I didn't think there was a shared account stash.
---
I don’t condone the stress on servers duping causes, but when they’re gone good luck finding that weapon you’ve been dreaming of for a reasonable price.
---
I am not a duper, but I don’t hate them as much as everyone else does. You can get some good shit for cheap from them and that will not be the case when they patch it. Do I find it annoying when the server I’m playing on disconnects? Of course. Do I let it ruin my day? Fuck no. It takes 2 minutes, tops, to join a new server. People act like it’s the end of the world. 
---
Concentrated fire perk, VATS their heads
---
Now this would be a fun mechanic! I experienced something like that last night, when I killed a three-star legendary Yao Guai, then got killed by a legendary Ant right after (and I HAD a full health bar, no idea how it happened).
---
Why are you getting so much hate? 
---
This is a game where part of it is being attacked lol. 
---
Or fallout 3 with no way to sprint.
---
A double barrel shotgun.
---
When I was low and mid level I used tis tactic. Approach the area from highground and snipe them a littel to reduce their health bar, then I would load my shotgun and go in guns blazing.
---
Nowadays I kill a glowing mole miner leader with 4 shots of my double barrel shotgun.
---
I've heard suggestions for turning the second floor of Top of the World into a trading hub. Right now it's just kinda there
---
Oh jesus. I spent literally all day yesterday hunting an X-01 stealth boy and X-01 calibrated shocks, never found either. To finally find them, only to lose them to automatic scrapping would probably make me stop playing.
---
I have no idea why Bethesda thinks mods should be subject to automatic scrapping. Junk? Sure! Mods? WTF!?
---
Tool chest works 
---
Pvp isn’t optional? Since when?
---
I disconnected last a few sessions ago, we were about 5 hours in. Since Christmas I've played a hell of a lot and had that one disconnect. I'm using an Xbox One X w/ (advertised) 300 ul/dl from my provider. 
---
I've seen it being nuked. It's okay area, but when you kill all the mobs once, you have to wait a long time for them to respawn. I think the golf club is the only place with such fast respawn timer.
---
It's logic like this that adds to the stupidity and mass hysteria.  Look around, they closed the duping loophole on the PC version last week.  The game is disconnecting PC users at the SAME rate (or more) as before.  I am starting to think this is just to give them a pass on how unstable this game is, just blame it on the dupers.. yeah.  No the game is just unstable as hell and they don't seem to be making it any better.   As the other guy said, if your stupid enough to pick up ANYTHING that a duper drops when killed, you risk being banned yourself if they ever figure out a way to identify these individuals and duped items.   You will likely be identified as a mule account.
---
I'm aware, but it's currently a completely unfair system to the victim.
---
I'm extra annoyed because it was a lvl 45 who stood around doing nothing in my Queen kill and I'm not the only persons bag he looted.
---
I think CAMPs are always spawn spots.
---
This is why I said “the closest thing I can compare to”
---
I agree it’s unlike eso in a lot of ways, but it’s the “ESO” I wanted.
---
Its a persistent online world with character leveling, dungeons/boss fights with the ability to craft and create a homestead.
---
That’s more like ESO than like GTAO.
---
The point I was trying to make is that it is unlike any other game that we currently have on console. That’s why I like it. I wasn’t trying to liken it to a specific game.
---
You basically gotta drop it all and have a friend pick it up and then drop it for your alt character. I give all my cool weapons and stash of nuka colas to my alt lol.
---
My team has also been accused of duping, when in fact we are just muling the legitimately acquired materials and items we get from our gameplay runs.  It's really effing annoying.  People, mind your own business!
---
Wouldn't explaining what it is prevent people from googling it in order to find an explanation? 
---
What a creep lol
---
Damn... they need to make it an alert then that camp is being attacked when an enemy or player starts murking your pet..
---
Gotcha
---
Is there a benefit of that bed over say the default?
---
Does it provide Quicker well rested perk or
---
Anything?
---
If they just call it Hot rod paint job, then no backstory needed
---
OK. I'll say that it shouldn't matter, because behavior takes place here that shouldn't be acceptable, such as the harassment he described. 
---
So harassing behavior shouldn't take place. It's unacceptable.  
---
But I raised the issue because it's clearly different when players are harassing kids. 
---
A couple of folks have recently stated outright that they have no problem with harassing kids online. Not sure how to even respond to that. 
---
 For the dupers we hope that the users will help us, otherwise, the ads are manually validated, so we can do a first check like that. 
---
For The platform,  they are already separated  thanks to the small navigation menu on the top left :) 
---
It's a poor UI decision but yes even though it looks like you need certain mats if you look closely the first option will say "attach mod". You will still need whatever relevant perk equipped to attach it though (armorer, gunsmith, etc).
---
No way in hell it's 3-4s it's like 1s. 
---
Thank you! You're amazing!
---
80-90% is barely any different from 100, I think it wouldn't be enough to stop it from burning.
---
At this point, the TV is already showing burn, so it's really too late. It doesn't show up too often watching TV or movies, so it's not the end of the world, but I'll need to replace it sooner rather than later.
---
I've seen it in phoenix's stock. But got through scrapping. 
---
You want to look like a hobo, then you get no armor.
---
I am not sure about this, but no matter where I build, the enemies spawn there, and I have build in many places and many times in the middle of nowhere.
---
I'm just saying, maybe, sometimes. But yeah I understand, even if no one explained he would search for it anyway.
---
But you know what they say, the more we talk about how bad something is the more people are doing it.
---
Then they go on and blame video games for causing violence in children. I hate seeing little kids playing gta and most of them will ask if any one has a Mic. When they don't get a response they blow and scream into the Mic. I try to avoid them but people who just go and bully them are just adding to the problem.
---
Ok, but loosing your stuff isn't a consequences of pvp its a penalty for dieing, and its a pretty light penalty too since you cam just go and pick it back up. It's not really a hostile act to tale your stuff because if they come across your bag they don't know of you died or just didn't want it.
---
Atm if you die there is a chance you might loose something, but its a small one, would you prefer to not drop a bag at all and just have the stuff deleted? Often times if I die I don't even bother for back for my stuff, its just scrap, its extremely rare I carry any rare or valuable scrap on me, like flux. If I do have it on me well that's on me for risking loosing it. I think the death system is pretty forgiving in this game already.
---
Tips posted above are very good to know, but the OP’s point is about unnecessary destruction that she did nothing to bring on. This game has a bad enough rep without clowns like that targeting a newbie whose just trying to have a good game experience. I’m all for removing dupers too, the game doesn’t need them. It also doesn’t need high levels attacking low on the assumption low = alt. 
---
I don't know what kind of idiot can't see or won"t acknowlede the difference between attacking someone in PvP and teaming up with another player and following the player around online and attacking them. How would anyone consider that acceptable behavior or defend it?
---
Thank you. 
---
Mules are a form of exploiting themselves.  Bethesda placed a stash limit to keep us from hording and/or overstressing the server, you are bypassing that limit by storing on a character rather than playing the game as intended.  That is exploiting and if people run around killing dupers, mules should be fair game as well.
---
I vote for the targeting hud. 
---
it is
---
If you are running guns then ammo, lots of ammo. Think of the biggest number of rounds you have ever started a mission with. Double it. And again. Then add some more.
---
If you are solo and have to leave a solo to resupply, it resets to zero.
---
Nice! I am sure once the game advances and the PvP weirdness is worked out this will be great. Also where do I get those letters
---
What does it do?
---
30% on super duper often times feels like 50%.
---
I tried submitting a ticket. Got no reply. Some others have had some issues too. What platform do you play on? 
---
Marine Armor Helmet is definitely not one of them. I've had it for months (dropped in like the second week after release). 
---
I doubt the Scorched I killed to get it had been to the dev room recently. 
---
it is still happening because you continue to confirm it in a clearly communicated dialogue window.
---
Highlights enemies in red
---
As far as I have tried it does nothing

Yup. And all I know is The Cranberry Bog got nuked ,I went there and she was there with like 15 other players. I'm level 70 but I think I saw a few around 40ish. Hell maybe even lower. Killing her and everything else there took about 5 minutes. Maybe a little more. The game has never been partial to level when I play. I see noobs all the way up past 100+. The only thing it does adjust is the level of enemies around my own level when I get into the tougher parts of the map. 
---
Can people please stop with spamming "is it worth buying" posts. Use the search function instead.
---
Works for me most of the time. But it is not 100%
---
Do you have any extra?
---
I don’t see a point in bulking anything unless you plan to sell it, it doesn’t weigh any less and it wastes plastic
---
This is marvelous work!
---
You .....and 98% of other players 
---
Awesome work!
---
Jesus you’re still going? 😂
---
If you like it, then yes. If you don't like it then no. /hth
---
I kept a hold of mine too, but it's in my Stash box. 2lbs isn't all that much. Especially .2lbs with Bear Arms.
---
Been saying this for a while now. Imagine what the world would be like if these cards weren't around.
---
 ​Really in need of help here guys, can't find anything about it on Google or any forum. 
---
Oh, that's a tough one. You have a stock of serums, though, yeah?
---
That mutation isn't really useable without a stock and, at minimum, some players to play with. :)
---
Not always. I got a spamvite last night from someone. I ignored it but checked the map a minute later. Guy was wanted, at one of the workshops, and had a low level friend hanging around by him who wasn’t wanted.
---
Some ridiculous shit was going on and it seems I dodged it.
---
Bye bye, Nancy.
---
i have a mic psn pappadodo 
---
Im heavily mutated already. Most of the friends I run with have them but no one is online.
---
You know for a fact that bethesda imposed stash limits to prevent hoarding and improve server performance? Do you have a link that says so?
---
Bethesda increasing the stash limits from 400 to 600 and last word said was they planned on continued increase doesn’t seem to align.
---
Personally I'm more concerned about the people that think it's funny to repeatedly trash someone's base.
---
Makes sense, is that something you can trade? If so it may just be easier finding someone to give it to you.
---
It might as well be. This whole game might as well be based on how many Bounties you get or how often you trick someone into PvP.
---
As a thought, this just means you can't have nice things. :-(  I had a great two story camp with turrets, artwork, a big stand up pipboy in the corner and ran out of space when I wanted to start adding some food and large water purifiers.  Now I have no art, no pipboy etc.   They did expand the stash so perhaps they expand this as well. 
---
I meant specifically Empath serums. Worst case scenario, you wipe your mutations and add it back later....
---
But the best thing to do with that mutation is to constantly chug serums - you get 1 hour with no negative effects.
---
Unless you modded the hell out of it.  On FO4 I have 65-70 mods, and aside from CBBE/character mods, probably 30 or so are quality of life stuff.
---
For FO3 I was able to sprint on my most recent playthrough.  But only after installing A Tale of Two Wastelands and a few other mods. (TTW wraps up the FO3 game files and treats it as a mod to FO:NV so it plays well on Win10...one helluva great mod, for those on PC!)
---
You know a pitchfork cant get the explosive legendary effect right?
---
Then why are the servers factually worse even after they fixed duping? Riddle me that genius.
---
I scrap LOTS of steel. An obscene amount. I think that’s why my PA mods haven’t been impacted yet lolz
---
Xbox, here. Totally down to help you guys out if you need me to. :)
---
Did they finally fix the pocketed armour glitch.?
---
I am too lazy to wipe my mutations
---
Did you read what I wrote? Does Fallout know a pitchfork can't have exploding bullets before it crashes?
---
The answer is no.
---
Animation glitch -- the right animation plays on the wrong mob. Can be hilarious; wasteland needs more popcorn.
---
I am not finding you
---
Not sure why people dont want to have fun with the extra ammo.  16 mini nukes is a fun time, same for the missiles in a lower level zone.  Take the prison, stand on the wall and bring the PAIN....
---
What a load of bullshit. I personally told them about various shit way back in the **pre-beta** that I'd still live today.
---
Your excuses amaze me.
---
Duper
---
If you say so
---
Hysteria meets Hysteria. You you and your girl basically got griefed once. Doesn't mean you can't play with lower levels (◔_◔)
---
Lol no, I just think that getting on reddit to tell people is as effective as going to Afghanistan and yelling "can't we all just get along, there are kids around!"  - it does not work, I've tried :P lol.   I doubt you're so naive to think it would actually change anything, so I imagine you're just here to pick a fight and feel virtuous about it.  Virtue signaling I believe it's called?   Just go play falloutttttttttttttttttttt - stop postingggggggg lol    (I'm going to take my own advice now and play the game xD)
---
What's insulting is that it's more than 2 months after release and we're still playing a beta. 
---
I said so. Twice for clarity. ;)
---
I have screenshots of every single one of the bases I've built, and every single one of them have been destroyed. Out of over a dozen bases, only ONE of them haven't been damaged by AI, and that was when I built in the Mire and Scorchbeasts kept coming after it.
---
I like putting a lot of time and effort into my bases too. But it's still a helpful tool to spend 40 Caps and put everything back down, rather than 2000 Caps worth of materials.
---
Best to go in with a team.  My son and I play and he is 100+ lvl s above me, but we get loot of everything as long as a member of the team tags a miner.  Even able to get loot when they degrade to a meat pile, but very often the loot we get from the same miner is leveled differently for each of us.
---
I wanted fallout 76. I got fallout76. I enjoy fallout76.  Not a mistake.
---
They put a stash limit because of server performance issues.  I will never see a mule character as an exploit.  I don’t understand why they designed the weight system like they did.  They could’ve designed everything to work much more efficiently but that probably would of required changing their engine or modifying it.  
---
I will never buy another Bethesda game if they continue to use their shitty engine.
---
There's a mod on pc to make meat piles glow, makes them much easier to find. 
---
Sadly there don't seem to be any at the moment, hopefully they'll be added in the future.
---
Lolz
---
I’ve done the same thing. Always at night abd without wearing PA!
---
My main has stealth but it’s getting respecd to specifically tank melee 
---
That sucks! I'm sorry to hear that had to be her first experience..! Hopefully she enjoyed building the base at least \^\^ Hope you two have more positive experiences in the future!
---
console is worse. 
---
Did they fix the damage with these, or do they still do less than the .308 rifles?
---
Locker plan has the same name, but the metal one is from Phoenix in Watoga, while the white one is bought in Whitespring
---
Used rated or you tuber rated? Big difference there mate 
---
(As a side note, repairing crops through "Repair all" takes four of the crop in question instead of one for some reason, so fix crops manually before hitting up your CAMP box.)
---
What's your Bethesda ID? I can help open the door for you.
---
You can also do this with plants
---
If I gotta pay, so do you bud.
---
I used Instigating Handmade (2x damage on full health enemy), which honestly worked better than bolt action hunting at that level.
---
No, the item just needs more than 1 bonus.
---
Killing a duper does absolutely nothing. They are going to have backups materials or a mule character with even more junk.
---
What’s sad is how frustrated I got when I couldn’t loot this. 
---
Ok :|
---
Level 140 with explosive minigun.  TBH it sounds like he is a duper/exploiter.  
---
Guarantee he probably duped his equipment a couple times and traded with people who also duped.  
---
I’m pretty glad I gave up on this game, it has been a nightmare since launch.  Hopefully they fix everything and make the game fun
---
It's a lovely event, except 8 out of 10 times there's some asshat with TSE that drops them before anyone else can tap.
---
Hi, was just creating a text for help. It's florianbieler
---
I go online now. Just add me
---
Give me a fucking break, do you people actually believe this nonsense?
---
As a heavy weapons main, be prepared to invest some time in making ammo. 1k rounds is nothing for the big guns. 
---
I found a nice area that I can show you where I have minimal issues. I have 0 turrets. I'll be on tho in about 3 hours. 1240 est
---
someone in a previous thread mentioned killing all the scorched on the ground and it will land more often.
---
How much?
---
Pretty sure that’s not what I said at all but kudos to you for reading it!
---
I'll shoot you a  PM
---
Nobody else has mentioned... If you're not playing in full screen, that's your problem. Windowed, borderless etc all cause issues. 
---
If it has 2 or 3 stars it has more legendary effects. You can see them all listed when you inspect it, that you can't otherwise see. So there may be some hidden effect that is pretty good.
---
1000 Caps gt themisterphenix 
---
Once you get some mutations and decent enough weapons you can run silos in about 10-15 minutes solo. Also getting troubleshooters leather armor makes silo runs insanely simple since robots do almost nothing to you and leather armor has high energy resistance so turrets don't do shit either.
---
Console is sillier and slightly more obvious. Everyone on console walks around Whitesprings like cookie cutter toons in X01, X01 jetpacks, TSE handmade, Marsupial, birdbones. It's like they buy a starter pack or something.
---
PC players are less obvious with more unique toons. Most of the costumes and weapons are at least different...
---
Awesome!
---
I'm glad shit like this stupid comment is starting to get downvoted by this sub.
---
Dude, it's only like 400-500 miles from Boston to West Virginia. That's like a 6 hour drive. Walking even in the jacked-up apocalypse would take less than a month. Easy. 
---
Completely true.  Just have to get lucky and hope a asshat doesn't decide he wants some level 40 legendaries I guess. 
---
I bought the Tool Chest plan from the raider vendor at the Pleasant Valley Ski Resort
---
Ok. I'll probably get on in a couple hours. My gt is: hermbiddy

You are a incredible person thank you so much! Have an upvote.
---
Is there a way to determine whether items are duped or legitimate obtained through a quest or drop?
---
IRL sandbox stuff at work is always in a protected space, logical and physical access is pretty tight there’s a CCB process before it’s
---
Approved and deployed in production
---
Just curious as to how folks are getting access to controlled resources and why isn’t anyone managing?
---
Not throwing hate just genuinely curious.
---
I currently have 14 in it haha I liked having enough space to carry everything I wanted
---
I got jump-scared by another player today (accidentally). Collecting lead and leather from the Treetops, another person pops up behind me, AKJFHSDFLKJ and I'm a splattered corpse six storeys below. Elite hardcore gamer I am not.
---
your engrish is very gud
---
People on this sub just *have* to make themselves feel holier than thou
---
There is supposedly atom store stuff in there, so, bethesda's bottom line i guess ? Which would maybe harm the continued running of the game...assuming anyone has ever actually spent money in the atom store and not just used in game earned ones at least. 
---
I went to fight a scorched queen last night. About 6 of us went along from the start. 1 player killed it and 3 other scorched beasts so quickly I didn't do enough damage to even get any loot (&lt;20 seconds). Even after firing my (self-found) explosive shotgun into it as fast as I could. I was the second or 3rd highest level player there (130+). They probably did that using 30 duped bobbleheads too.
---
Yeah, those 'weapons' everybody is buying cheaply aren't the great thing that you're saying. They have already ruined any balance in the game. They even made sure to ruin hundreds of players game experience by giving them out for free over Christmas. Great.
---
This is forgetting all the server crashes and lost workshops/nuke zones that happened because that's a necessary part of the exploit.
---
Do you have Cafe Tables? If so, where did you find it? Been looking for ages.
---
Server wipe needs to happen, or at least another fresh start server. I really only enjoy the PVP aspect of the game, but ever since the dupe glitch was made public on youtube months ago, everyone seems to have an explosive 2shot or instigating weapon that simply one shots you.
---
Will never forget trying to kill the moth man,and a scorchbeast at level 29,and a glowing Yao gui creeps in the mix,to say the least I was dead 3 times before hitting the ground.
---
i spent caps and/or walked there they can do the same....
---
Who / Where was the vendor? 
---
Actually reading OPs post might be a good start.
---
Sensor array adds 2 perception
---
wait the Faschnacht mask is from the devroom? I found one rando somewhere a few days ago and I was like "this is a fucking ugly thing, but i dont have one so ill keep a copy" 
---
I need to check my inventory now, because im SURE i didnt get into that devroom. 
---
Hm. What others are there?
---
That's a great question!  The only places I have been, glowing ghouls turned up in response. 
---
I had wondered if areas known for super mutants would spawn super mutants, or if there might be irradiated versions of mirelurk queens, mothmen, and so on. 
---
I think Braxton would be an interesting target. 
---
I did lol. She got attacked in a game where you can get attacked 
---
Does anyone here know what C.A.M.P stands for?
---
In IT the difference between white hat and black hat, is the color of money, Whois paying.
---
If it’s the company after you’ve made them aware,  it’s white hat.
---
If it’s the company’s competitors...
---
It’s why NDAs exist
---
Or get hacker perk cards and you only need to kill a couple in the mainframe core room.
---
Very nice tips.
---
It looks nice
---
 Targeting Hud - Visor highlights living targets.
---
Sensor Array - +2 Perception
---
VATS Matrix Overlay - Increases Vats hit by 10%
---
Internal Database - +2 Intelligence
---
Recon Sensors - Sighted aiming marks enemies with a compass pip.
---
Being a Fallout game, it might actually matter which order you equip the perk and the armor. I'd experiment with that.
---
Do you have any extra targeting huds?

welch station confirmed  100 %

Selling in game currency or items isnt a new thing its been around since some of the earliest mmos when i was in high school i made some ok money selling in game credits in swg tho that was the result of a couple good merchant alts and grinding for rare matts on a combat alts tho that only realy works when you have loads of time on your hands as it was all done legit if you dont count the eula breaking of selling currency

Ok

---
Jesus Christ, if this didn't come out of an XBox Live Transcript.
---
Would it help to have a random level 144 come build you one of those glowing fish tank lamps? They’re pretty cool!
---
Assuming the game lets you build atomic shop items for others..
---
That would also be a plausible workaround.
---
If I had never come to this sub I would be blissfully ignorant of duping problems. Just would occasionally scratch my head saying ' that level 50 seems to have an extremely powerful weapon'
---
Thank you
---
Thank you so much you absolute god! Now i must take my time amd scan through this. Awesome work. 
---
I wrote a post about this a few weeks back, I really hope that this is something they fix up, you could get atom for participating up to 3x a day-- bet caps on  battles, participate in regulated or unregulated PVP; and it would be lore friendly. 
---
DAMMIT BETHESDA GIMME THUNDERDOME
---
I did Charleston to see what it was like, it's ok, got several buildings that spawn a lot of mobs, not great for flux. Similar with harpers ferry as well.
---
I don't have a specific link but they absolutely said they limited the stash because of server performance concerns and would slowly increase it to judge the effect.  So yes THEY think it effects server performance but the reason why its limited doesn't matter.  The fact that it is limited and that a mule is used to bypass that limit is what makes mules an exploit.  It may be socially acceptable to use mules, it may be widespread but it is still a cheat.
---

You‘ll find everything you need in there ;)

Shhhhhhhhhhhhh, odds are Bethesda will patch small bugs like this before patching some real big boiz.
---
I solo ran my first nuke solo like a week after launch and everyone in my group has done it countless times and none of us have used a single bobblehead let alone glitching them. Not even using a two shot OR explosive weapon you can easily run it once you know what you are doing. Haven't played in a bit but I believe the last time I ran it I used a single stimpack. 
---
Maybe get good at the game before accusing people who are of cheating?
---
My encounters with the Mothman have been quiet.  Are you camped somewhere around Charleston?  The church bells can be heard while in the area.
---
In your Pip-Boy go along to the Data tab and you can find your quests in there.
---
Caps available for p i l l a g e d  L o o t. P i l l a g e d  L o o t available for

Targeting HUD also gets my vote, being able to spot enemies easily i very useful. 
---
And on the subject of mole rats, why the hell can they burrow from the ground up through roofs?
---
I've given up on fast travel.  They don't even make encumbered fast travel available as a perk, so sod it.  Good news is that I always have what I need to repair turrets at firebases, etc., and can create new weapons for lowbies on the fly, and frankly, that feels kinda nice.
---
I have bought hundreds of games from CD keys and other places like that, never had a key revoked

＊Press X on an item

Just message on Xbox when u get on themisterphenix 
---
Pacifist non-pacifist mode isn't a pvp flag, it's a non-accidental damage option.
---
Seriously, people need to learn that stashing is equivalent to quicksaving in this iteration of fallout.
---
Will do
---
Some people are just dicks. People like that are the first people I will execute in our group during the zombie apocalypse.
---
Try near flatwoods at least the enemies will be very low level 
---
Your probably near a building with wind chimes.
---
I'm absolutely getting the glitched, weirded-out loading screen of my spawn location now. It's like it's going to load me, but the graphics haven't loaded, then it quickly goes to a second load screen and pretty pic I took at some point and THEN loads me in.
---
So weird.  
---
yeah but youtubers really get the voice out, imagine if the people who discovered item duping never told anyone and just continued to dupe items and sell them.
---
I believe Bethesda when they say that the stash limits exist to prevent server stress, but mules are not exploits.  You still found the loot in the first place and being able to pass it off to another character down the road is something the player should decide.  Especially older loot that becomes outdated by level - it would still be useful for a new character if you ever started one.
---
It's pretty easy. Make sure you load your stash before going into the silo because you have to repair cores at one point that costs steel and circuitry so if your stash isn't loaded you have to farm it from the robots or do the longer egg hunt process. 
---
Since you are not experienced with it being plenty of stims and play it slow until you learn the silos after plenty of runs. I'd suggest having all three hacker cards so you don't have to manually kill every turret and please make sure to have a nuke keycard as well so you don't waste your time lol.
---
The first time you do it it's probably gonna take awhile since you have to figure things out but it becomes so easy later on you will prefer it solo since other people make enemies scale. 
---
There is a treehouse a bit up the mountain behind the cabins with a terminal to summon ghouls and play the sounds, it does automatically but you can turn it off as well.
---
Already did more than once. I just get the generic emails saying how saddened they are that I'm not enjoying the game and how they'll improve in the future. Good luck.
---
I dont know, i was out in the open wilderness as my camp wont place down in smaller areas
---
What about the other online games when they started? Sure there was hype and all but those like WoW have been around for a long time. 76 can only grow but if people do not stick with it despite the start and it is getting better....then it will die.    
---
IMO, new content not necessarily with human NPCs should happen and should be added somewhat frequently. Not expansions of course. WoW has many fun holiday themed, temporary questlines. I won't get into what I think could be added but considering it's the first in the timeline.
---
Something needs to be done.
---
This seems too convoluted though, raise the equipment cap, scale the new max level gear to where current level 50 gear is and adjust the other leveled gear down
---
200 hours got a few TS weps drop and put alot of work into base build, and i would not even mind getting a wipe honest its just getting sick now,way to many TSE dupes ppl selling dupe serums items everything. 
---
Not that i know of, might have just been random chimes in the area
---
Anyone able to tell me where I can get all the different posters? I've been looking butter no luck so far.
---
Or their modern bed.
---
No. Report them for witch hunting plus harassing players that are actually playing the game. 
---
How would you feel if you're a low level player always being harassed by higher level characters because they think you're a duper?
---
People like you are the reason other people can't enjoy the game. 
---
Saw one yesterday in Whitesprings, it was creepy.  Level 2, no clothes parked in the workshop area.
---
And that's all you'll get. No company would give you information on what has happened to a specific persons account
---
Nice thanks for the heads up 👍🏼
---
I‘m kinda scared as I don‘t know whats awaiting me :D 
---
You can't sell plans
---
You'll need a good build and a good weapon for nuke launches with guns. You'll be fighting off 5+ high level and high damage enemies consistently and you need to be able to kill them fast.
---
I dont know of another way 2 get it 
---
Heads up, as much as i love that you named/shamed you need to remove that youtuber's name from the OP. Against reddit rules as could be seen as inciting a witch hunt
---
Might be cause the player who starts the quest disconnects and doesnt complete it themself
---
Why so rude? I took a workshop the other day and received no bounty. I'm not one to really take workshops, so it was a first. May you please explain how one would receive a bounty rather than being a complete jerk? Thanks. 
---
test pappododo
---
Ive seen it happen 1/10 fights with her. Very annoying. She goes out of bounds 
---
If you have a TSE lever action everything but asaultrons should be easy. I'd use a good melee weapon for that since shooting a close range enemy with explosives is kinds bad for your health.
---
Are you talking about the mask looking item? I bought one from a vendor 
---
It did get worse after the patch right?
---
I’m trying to confirm if it spawns in watoga because I’ve seen reports of it spawning there. Nothing yet tho
---
The helmet for the armor is not available, the undergarment is, which is the part of the marine wetsuit which you can get by server hoping 417152516171 times at Harper's ferry
---
I just found out how people actually got hold of the complete PA plan... they accessed the developer room...
---
I don't expect a personal scribed email detailing what the intend on doing. What I sort of expected was those players being banned as precautionary measures after this new patch. Especially being they're on the top of the search results for glitches/duplicating/exploits Fallout 76.
---
It’s a helm mask combo, 
---
Yeah, insane amount of time out in and seeing only motion assist servo plan in the dozens, just not possible right? 
---
Because that's likely not how duping actually functioned to duplicate. Otherwise I'd have a ridiculous amount of random duplicate items from the disconnects right after crafting or selling to vendors
---
Good builds can solo the queen and solo nuke silos and solo hordes of glowing ones at whitesprings. Once you hit endgame you basically become an endgame boss as unlike most games like this there is no challenging "raid" to keep grinding that actually requires you to use both hands on your controller to beat. 
---
Yeah, I had picked up a couple charging sniper laser rifles from supers. Didn't have any melee on me.
---
Do you’re defending duping and crashing servers? You’re reply amazes me...
---
Had a encounter where she would not take anymore dmg after healing and going back down to 75%. Timer ran out and event failed.
---
With all the automatic doors in the vault and no one knows how use to old fashioned doors anymore. 
---
The old saying “ you were born in a barn” is now “you were born in a vault” 
---
Oh, I was referring to the plans of the base armor, including the mods. I am seeing calibrated shocks plan for the excavator PA too. 
---
I would say close to a railway station. 
---
I had a rough day yesterday.  Lost 2 calibrated shocks for my T60 to ammo crafting. Forgot the patch was out for PS4 and scrapped a dozen hardened masses. And fell prey to the "SBQ turns into a meat pile 2 seconds after death." 
---
This game is like dating a hot crazy person. I know better, but I just can't help myself. 
---
Well, check your bats because I think you unlocked the red one. ;)
---
Yeah sorry I have the wetsuit mask
---
I was scrapping 4 or 5 charging sniper laser rifles. Don't think I was going crazy but I was double hitting the space bar pretty quick.
---
ummm did he use the targeting system to pick where to nuke? and then confirm it?
---
All good, lots of people are getting it co fused with other things 
---
I actually got a trophy for taking photos. Then I had to delete. It bummed me out. 
---
Mods of this subbreddit deleted their posts multiple times and refused their inclusion into the sidebar because the mods own almost every fallout themed subbreddit
---
What's a duper?
---
I’m more wondering if we’re missing out on some other hidden maybe mini bosses etc at this point maybe the nuke could trigger something else on specific areas?
---
I will do that. Weird, I don't use melee so I never pick them up unless I'm close to a station and haven't sold yet.
---
He said he did pick white springs. And then the achievement popped.
---
It's almost like doing that much damage is grossly overpowered and wouldn't be happening if this game was half way balanced.
---
For me, yes. Also, just tried to play. First attempt,l infinite loading screen (gave up at the 6 minute mark). Next, CTD as my CAMP was rendering. About to see if 3rd time's the charm.
---
they knew a week a head about dupe being fixed if it fixed\* i honest could see 10000s and on 10000s of TSE and everything else being duped on ps4/xbox every single min.
---
I think vats matrix array gives higher vats chance than the one that give +2 perception 
---
The highlighting enemies visor I dislike because it take me out of the game immersion with everyone highlighted red 
---
Idk, but it's so bad I wish I could wall paper my camp in Motion Assist servos..
---
I'll be down for that! User name same as on here, and I have loads of instruments at my Camp too
---
Welcome!  What platform are you on?  If I see you on PC, I'll give you some stuff.  I have Travel Agent and if you're on a team with someone fast traveling to your teammates is free, so if you want a tour we can bop around Appalachia and get you some quick XP.  Level 56 so I'm not some monster badass, but I've got some places to go on the map.  Enjoy!
---
Protect and serve.
---
We all agree that duping is the worst but at the same time its fallout. Post apocalypse and people are not always nice.
---
I have a few hundred hours and two charcacters level 100+ and have launched tons of nukes and spent entire days farming whitesprings nuke zone and have never gotten a TSE.

Yeah, that's crappy, but at least they get flagged and you can respond to it. But at the end of the day, it's costing the same thing as this is - junk.
---
Last I checked on an esm dump (data mine) there's .50, hasty .50, refined .50 and that's it.
---
It's probably not a thing. There was that whole misnamed plan thing with Advanced Connectors and Dense Combat Armor, but there's probably no .50 hardened.
---
Automatic 10 mil, non legendary.
---
Automatic Furious combat rifle.
---
And A shit ton of ammo~
---
Not a lie though. There were people doing the server crash method in the first week of launch. People even posted on here about being able to crash the server.
---
I think regardless of camp location, the game spawns enemies near your camp periodically 
---
Only thing you can do is move away from a spot that is guarantee down every time and maybe go to a lower level area so the random camp spawn is lower level enemies
---
See, this is the issue right here. You have a channel that profits from ruining the very game we paid for and yet we have to be silent? It's not like I'm doxxing him or giving out his personal info. I'm simply everyone aware that this very channel promotes game breaking exploits just to fill his and many other channels owner's pockets while us non-cheaters are forced to throw in the towel. Not being able to name the YouTuber, who CLEARLY has no respect for the community, is just silly.
---
I was level 10 in white springs last night, while it was a nuke zone....
---
its almost like when you get bored you know how to let Into high level areas eaiser.....cause you played the game instead of witch hunting 
---
No, it's a PVP flag. It's used in Nuke zones, etc. as a non-accidental damage option but its core function is whether or not you want to engage in PVP. If I don't, I shouldn't have to suffer from other Players looting my stuff.
---
Should I take over the munitions factory for that? Or would it be better to just go for the resources out in the world and make them myself?
---
One bug has had massive repercussions on the games trade economy one was slightly annoying yeah I don't see your point ?  
---
I suspect they'll always do less damage unless they change ammo production, since you can make a ton of .50 compared to .308. Does it make sense? No, not really.
---
Absolutely amazing alliteration
---
If a low level was there first they spawn at lower levels.
---
Yeah, I have 50 refind on my characters and honestly, the difference is minute and I'd rather be able to craft 100 ammo at a time over scavenging it or feeling like I have to craft a ton out of it, it just feels like such a powerful gun now.

You can extract them from the game folder if your on PC

Looks like i need to repec a bit, thanks
---
That was fixed two patches ago
---
It just works
---
You're right, they don't know - the bag should be named. Or they could just have our body there like every other game does.
---
And yes, it is hostile - every online game I've ever played treats it as hostile. It's no different to coming in and wrecking your base, or engaging in PVP, killing you and looting you. 
---
Yes, the death system is forgiving in this game, but it's also broken in this aspect.

Gt is asian meme lord. I can help with whatever u need
---
The hunting rifle can't one shot things. That's the point of this post. It under performs. A hardened hunting rifle has half the base damage of the gauss rifle. And the downtime between shots is about the same to cycle the bolt or charge the rifle. 
---
I would like to see where you can take out 3 enemies in the same time frame where a gauss rifle can someone only kill 1. Maybe if they're level 5 scorched. But you can just use an uncharted gauss rifle shot which does 50% the listed damage, so around the same as a hardened hunting rifle. Which shoots much faster than a hunting rifle if you do that. 
---
If the Hunting rifle and it's 50 cal receiver didn't underpreform as a sniper weapon, this post wouldn't have been made. 
---
Well the bigger issue with new engines is that Bethesda knows this "old" engine like their pockets. For them it is a lot easier to change something with it to actually get something done with it.  
---
For surely it is a age old engine by now, but you would be surprised how manyy "new" engines actually are just "fresh" new setups codes of old ones.   
---
The time they would need for a complete new engine to get used to would take probably around 5-6 years. And if they take that much time to lets say develope Elder Scrolls 6 they would probably get yelled at too for taking too long.   
---
Do not get me wrong please. I am with you, that they would finally need to get used to a new engine, but it isn't as easy as people think it is. And just because the newest engine has the best graphics and may allow for more complex tasks, doesn't mean it is bug free too.   
---
Just look what a mess some Unreal Engine games are today, how some devs mess up the most basic things in it, just because they are absolutely not used to the engine.   
---
The best solution would be that they learn a new engine on by, while they still can use their old one for a couple of games before switching completely. 
---
I bet most of them just make an excuses to grief, on purposely grieving low level character without the moral hit. Just say they are dupers and fire away. Similar things happen when China having the communist “revolutions to kill old traditions”. 
---
(PS4)(Lvl 70) For me personally I grab my .50 machine gun and my bunker buster.

Since the patch I've lost 15 +\- FPS (no new drivers etc installed) and where I could play on the same server for 5 hours if I was lucky now I'm luck if I don't CTD every 30 minutes...
---
Weird thing is I have friends who basically have the reverse now, super stable where they had tons of problems before..
---
Anti armor explosive might be more damage. I have just an explosive gauss rifle and it'll show 800 damage without any adrenaline stacks or adrenal reaction. 
---
At max adrenaline and like 10% health it's doing some 1800 damage. 
---
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but a new method was fpunf on PC the same day the patch hit. They already say it will be easy to implement on consoles once thiers hits. It's a sad thing, but w.e

Sometimes quests dissapear from my pipboy too. Close the game and reopen it, it usually fixes this. Maybe server change too. But closing the game definitely works! 
---
This so much this. There has been a lot of misinformation spread, both for and against this game. There was never anything official about bethesda about duping affecting server stability. They haven't said much about server stability except that they were looking at it, and in the most recent patch notes said they made improvements to it. Why would they? Some people on Reddit make the assumption it's dupers causing it, everyone runs with it, and Bethesda can sit quietly back and not have to say anything about it.
---
If what people on PC are saying post this most recent patch, DC are just as bad if not worse. If it was really the dupers causing it, wouldn't stability have gotten better?
---
No bc it was never causing instability, it's just that Beth's servers are trash. I'm not defending duper, Beth should do something about them for balance and economy, but the misinformation around these parts is just as bad as people making stuff up to hate on the game. 
---
i killed them both

There was a post a few days back apparently scrapping normal combat helmets unlock the marine combat helmet.

 here is the post:

---
really really good. I also cite silent hill as one of the formative dark games about death explicitly that this game absolutely recalls and descends from, as its a place where no one else is really alive, just like in those games. the fabric of consciousness is called to task in order to do survival in such a setting
---
also im having a lot of dreams in Appalachia now.

Missile turrets help, at a cost,
---
I saw that. Thanks for the heads up. 
---
Love it, that ramp leading up to the station is pretty slick.
---
Dresser plans. I can't say for certain there aren't actually multiple plans named "dresser" that unlock different things, though, since I have seen two stacks of them on a single vendor - "Dresser (2)" and then below that "Dresser."
---
A 2 shot quad explosive pump huh 
---
Sure, the limit is there for performance concerns, but that is based around a fixed maximum of players on a server. Having an additional character does nothing to increase the load on a server that is still operating within its original constraints..?

---
Well I certainly don’t plan on building a ‘Reaponders’ themed Camp. 
---
I would like to use mods, but since I have not said anything, I'm afraid of having to reinstall the game at some point 
---
Some people search the map for a higher lvl and a lower lvl in the same area and instantly think duping is going on. If there is no world container in the area I look for a bag. 9/10 times it's not duping but most hunters just want to find one so they attack without making sure it's going on in the first time. Brush it off and keep grinding. I'm on xbox too, if you need any help or anything let me know.
---
That is it, thank you. 
---
Of course there's other things that work, and melee does a lot of damage.
---
But what's the difference when someone who has a TSE rifle and like a thousand active Bobbleheads hits you from a mile away?
---
Yeah....I don't believe you. But let's pretend I do (and again, I don't) 99.99999999% of TSE weapons would still be duped. Enough to make your argument invalid.
---
I always lock mine but after moving my camp to a new area I decided to leave it unlocked so others could access it. I was in my camp when some low-level tool comes inside, checks things out then leaves and left the door open. I locked it after that. And since the blueprint feature no longer copies the whole camp, I have to break down the camp and store each piece.
---
Haha yeah I‘ve made some bad experiences with that. That‘s why I don‘t like using it 
---
from what i know the order that stashes use steel is first normal steel, then mods then bulk steel. don't bulk 
---
I actually found a critical .50 cal last time. Surely not as good as a hardened, but maybe a start?
---
How were they even able to destroy it? I mini nuked a new guy's house because he asked me to and it did jack shit
---
Uhm idk you about your vault. But my vault closed it's own door, but then I couldn't get back in.
---
I took more than 5 hours to reach level 5 as I began learning what to do or how to do it in this game on the last day of BETA official, being completely new to Bethesda style games more or less. Now still taking my time and approaching 200 hours, I have a few level 20s, a 13, and my original up to 47 getting ready to fill out the build idea I have decided on to reach at approximate 63. slow gaming is a zen, I am astonished they captured this, it is essential to the classic concept of adventure gaming before action began overtaking all with the call of duty / next gen contexts.
---
Or for the plan go to dropsite c2 in cranberry bog (half submerged so be prepared for rads) and it spawns on a shelf on the left after you go through the second door.  I got it there on my second server hop at lvl 16 (not sure if it's levle dependent like the handmade plans at the vendors?).  Also watch out for the lvl 40ish mobs... 
---
So you *intentionally* followed a random group you somehow *suspected* was duping and recorded video.  They didn't notice you but you were close enough to get some absolute proof of duping...and then you "did something".
---
Seems legit.  I mean, if this is actually true, it doesn't sound as if you are any "better" than the dickheads who wiped out this base. In fact, it kinda sounds like you're the same kind of dickhead.
---
You see a 140 helping out a low level, there you are sitting in the bushes "recording", you see the 140 start building, and dropping some loot into the cache (which you can't actually see btw).  You see the low level go to the cache.  AHA! DUPERS!!!  Now's my chance!!! Let me pull out my minigun!!!!!!
---
This is the part where you tell me you knew for certain they were duping and it's not at all like this situation...or you backtrack and say they let you know they were duping and you played along or something.
---
&gt;Sorry that group you encountered didn't even stay long enough to see you were just playing casually and jumped to their own conclusions.
---
Really?  They didn't stay long enough to police their game play? I guess it's good to know we have responsible monitors in the woods making sure everyone is playing nice nice in their opinion before they do anything.
---
You know why this is going to happen to your GF? Because people like you are doing it to other people GF's.
---
I say leave it up
---
Problem is when I have just a Scorchbeast attacking me, it just flies around forever spamming that annoying screech attack crap. I'm patient enough usually to wait for it to finally land, but not nearly patient enough when my camp is on the line.
---
I have a hand made plan I'll take 1k for.
---
Really just trying to grind whitesprings for a while.   Want to level up so I can spend time questing rather than running around trying to find ammo for a shotgun that usually gets me just enough to break even..it's been a shit cycle for a while now. 
---
Running into Mothman is the one encounter that always startles me.    I'm usually just moving along, doing my thing, and then boom Mothman shows up.    He gets me all the time like that but in the end he pays for making my pants brown... they didn't start out that color prior to the encounter.
---
Anyone else find the Flatwoods Monster to be super rare?   I have far to much play time in this game and have ran into it maybe four times all told.
---
Someone leveled my camp yesterday while I was in bed by myself (in game). I think they were just an asshole.
---
Craft a new set of power armor and grind for new weapons.
---
Honestly, I think they should either give a massive buff to the 50 BMG in a rifle, or they should do a big overhaul. 
---
Side note: I’d bet good money that the 50 cal in game is intended to be the 50 BMG, or at least it’s Russian variant. Looking at a cartridge in the crafting screen, there’s no way it’s one of the smaller 50 cartridges. Both of the smaller cartridges I’ve found have straight casings, while the 50 in game is built more like a conventional rifle casing with curves inward.
---
That's not really the point OP was getting at though.
---
As of Jan 10 2019 patch.
---
Still not fixed, so I'm presuming this Perk is working as intended and Bethesda class these cures as being in a different category.
---
I do this to people after im forced to pay caps to travel across the map and they decline my team request
---
&gt; xbox profile (will be for any game and you'll never run across them again). 
---
Unfortunately, it doesn't work like that on Xbox One. I don't know why they changed it from 360, but on X1 you can absolutely get matched with people you blocked. A message will pop up asking you if want to stay in a lobby\server with someone you previously blocked.
---
Source: Games with really narrow matchmaking, like any kind of score based matchmaking will do this. Playing COD Advanced Warfare, I would constantly get into lobbies with people in Russia and South America. I started blocking people as a way to not connect to their lobbies but it still happened just about every time. 
---
I like how your shot of the Baseball Player Statue is from Diamond City. I mean, it's the same asset, so why not?
---
Are you a hot goddess?
---
Did you collect the codes the normal way? I've heard people post nuclear codes online every week.
---
Are you some dumb casual? Every true RPG fan knows that there must be a pressing time on the main quest like in glorious Fallout 1. /s
---
How very kind and generous of you! Curious, however: can we play together regardless of where we live irl? 😊
---
The only other online game I have played recently is minecraft and when you die in that game all your possession just fall on the floor where you died. Anyone can come pick them up and after 5 mins they despawn. Compaired to that I like the 76 style.
---
It is definitely not a cheat or an exploit. It’s a workaround for the shitty weight mechanics this game has. Maybe if (almost) every gun in the game didn’t weigh 10-20+lbs this wouldn’t be necessary, but I’d like to set up shop somewhere eventually and I can’t do that if I don’t have wares to sell. There is no reason a 10mm pistol should weigh 10lbs and definitely no reason a bobby-pin should weigh 1/10th of a pound. (I’m aware they’re reducing the weight of bobby-pins in the next update, but that’s not even the tip of the iceberg)
---
Yeah anti-armor is possibly the way of the future, but I am pretty interested to see how high I can get my tse's damage once I get adrenal reaction and demo expert maxed.
---
Ill repair it and give u some shells, we can farm whitespring for a good bit
---
whats your gamertag ill invite you and we can trade
---
Absolute legend. 
---
I would take some just to learn the plan. (If one is enough only one)  
---
But i am kind of afraid on how you got your hands on it if it is only meant to be for devs so far?  
---
The last i want is somethign that was cheated in or hacked or something. 
---
Serve and protect
---
That is an awesome tool.  I plan to use it to help guide my spec ops sniper build.  Thank you for taking the time to put it together.
---
Bring lots of stims, water and food. Wear armor that is good against energy dmg. Have all your weapons repaired, and stocked with ammo.
---
Not sure what you mean.
---
If I hunt someone with a bounty (meaning they take full dmg as soon as I hit them) I 1 shot them with a TSE weapon. I DON'T have bobbleheads. 
---
Also, if duel is initiated, it's the same. without bobbles. So what is it you mean?
---
You can't completely eliminate spawns, because the game has a mechanic where your camp is periodically attacked by an area mob.
---
However, you have two options which can impact this:
---
1. Build along the edges of the map.
---
While I couldn't cite the code on this, there seems to be a certain point toward the edge of the map where nothing "happens" anymore. No random events trigger, no mobs have pre-generated spawn points, there are no buildings, nothing. Building there means you basically remove any event/spawn trigger that isn't specific to your base.
---
2. Build in the lower level areas.
---
If you build along the north/west edge of the map, your "attack mobs" will be lower level than along the east/south.
---
If you are unable to access both stashes at once how is it an exploit? You’re not supposed to have multiple characters or share loot you collected with... yourself? 
---
I plan on it. Fuck it. I paid $60 for this game and invested a lot of hours. I'm not going to be courteous to a bunch of douchebags who majorly contribute to servers constantly crashing, the economy ruined and griefers all running around with unlimited weight and explosive everything. If they want to ban me for it then so be it. 
---
80% of the players I meet on PC are using some type of TSE with excavator or xo1 with jetpacks and a litany of mutations
---
I bet the Bethesda Fun Police are already on the case. Just a matter of time. :(
---
So your plan was to advertise for the exploit youtubers, so more people would watch and exploit?
---
you are part of a cult and i do enjoy fo76 so once again eat shit
---
Haha, hes scared the shit out of me before, I love it. 
---
Last night I was in my freaking camp indoors crafting and he attacked me. Youre not safe anywhere!
---
There will be assholes but they are not in the game much. Most are cool. Welcome to the wasteland brudda. Grill me some grilled ragstag with those squirrel bits. 20+ carry weight ya cant beat it. ;)
---
Not only is it 1 second, you can blast out all the rounds in the magazine as fast as you can pull the trigger in a pinch. 
---
Strange, i seem to have the bonfire unlocked but not the other pieces from that plan. Maybe i missed them, will have to double check. 
---
On the other hand, you're signal boosting him. Even by talking about him in a negative light you're giving him exposure
---
Aye - making flux a pound a pop means it is very impractical to store on a main character.  Add in "good" legendaries that you're not actively using and stash gets used up FAST.
---
Ive only seen flatwoods twice, first time I shot him and he disappeared, the second time I killed him in a nuked fissure prime, that was pretty cool.
---
In contrast, ive seen mothman about 4 times, not counting the event
---
I get it I do, but how else are you going to know if someone was there? Some of us were raised in a barn and that is the only way to say "I was here" lol.   I never actually visit other camps, but I do recognize what common courtesy is.  Is there a way to tell other than an door left open?
---
Yeah I think there is actually 3 'Dresser' plans, wondering if anyone could help me out. I've already bought copies of other plans I would like to avoid doing the same with dressers lol 
---
This guy is promoting his own youtube channel but we will never know that!!

Wow, do they not teach reading comprehension in schools nowadays? Amazing how you got that from my comment.
---
AFAIK, that would only affect latency. 
---
Same issues. Weird loading screen. Had a few crashes to desktop. Didn't have those issues before the patch.
---
I have mods for inventory, the map, and perk loadouts running. I haven't tried turning them off to see if they could be the culprit.
---
For those crashing, are you running vanilla or do you have any mods installed? 
---
Author of the mentioned post here, and nope, you need to scrap the actual Marine Armor Helmet to get it, which was only obtainable from the dev room and was spread in limited number by people that cheated their way in. Now these people are banned but the cosmetic items still remain. After the latest update the Fasnacht Masks (which also were from the dev room) got removed from the player inventories but the rest was skipped, as if the devs goofed up at one point and thought these were obtainable during regular gameplay, but never fixed it. That pretty much seems to be the case, no other reason for the Marine Armor Helmet and Wood Helmet to not to be obtainable.
---
Yea, I guess the wold dogs blowing up my generator is a great indicator of people enjoying my camp.
---
I tend to hold onto munitions factory and grafton steel. You would probably be fine with one or the other as you won't be huckin hate full time out of your gun. You're just going until it lands.

Yup, it's in the game, here's me wearing it to confirm:

I was playing last week, solo, as I always do and two guys came up to me and demanded I give them stuff to "pass" all the while in really terrible fake accents. They also said this is a "no sledgehammer area" I guess, trying to be funny?  The inevitable happened with this shitshow of PVP and those who think they are gods and forget the opponents first hit is always free, soon I was somehow an unfair toxic and cheating hacker who sleeps with his mother and other tidbits.

I don't know if OP is playing with friends, he's being facetious with the environment or he is harassing other players for entertainment, but making your own fun should never include attempting to remove fun (or not considering it) from others in the process. 
---
I do not mind PVP, I do not mind getting bushwhacked, outnumbered or outplayed, it happens and it's generally fun regardless of outcome, what I cannot stand however is a guy or group of guys play acting and then getting upset (and oddly entitled and defiant) when things do not go their way or I do not simply play along.  I can't do an accent and I am no one's bitch. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I just lost 2 legendary items because of this stupid bug, one of which was an explosive shotgun. It didn't help that the servers were having trouble responding because of dupers. Bethesda can eat a fat dink if they think this is acceptable.
---
Yes, it's from the dev room and also no, you probably won't get banned, read my reply here for more details, in short if the devs at Austin decide they don't want the item in the hands of the players they will simply remove them as they did previously:

---
You ended up buying something
---
Gatling gun+martial artist
---
And a tesla rifle
---
&gt;  It messes up the in game economy, 
---
HOW ?!?!? There is no 'in game' economy. If anything, this messes with the "out of game" economy of reselling in-game items. But it cant mess with an 'in game' economy simply because there is no such thing, to begin with. 
---
Everything you just described is part of the game though.  They are doing nothing technically wrong.  Yes they are being a bunch of dicks but that's what the game is built for.
---
Bethesda has to change how it works if you don't want to get ganked.
---
Had something similar happen near whitesprings with a friend that doesn't know about Ghoul farming or anything like that. Firstly, he didn't have any turrets in his base. But i assume the reason some dickhead levelled his base with a TSE assault rifle (oh the irony) is because people encourage obliterating bases around whitesprings. Not everyone is some super try hard trying to exploit. I killed the cunt 4 times before he gave up trying to kill me. 
---
Nice doing business with you.
---
WTH are you talking about? Who said anything about pay to win in Anthem? You are projecting. 
---
same :)
---
I have the plans (PS4) come say hi stephenbone18 and I’ll make you one if you like. 
---
I would like to take a second and thank all of you for the suggestions. I have a way better idea of what to look for now when it comes to weapons. Soon, as soon as I actually obtain the stuff, my Grand Scorchbeast Hunt will really get going. I hope I happen to clear the skies a little for you, fellow Vault Dwellers.
---
Send the info to Bethesda, or support team. Nobody else needs to know. It'll only hurt the servers and honestly, our youtube channel would likely fair better by not showcasing TOS breaking content.
---
I have it as well. A lot of people are saying it’s a dev item and I haven’t seen anyone confirm it on console

I've had this happen twice now where my armor just vanishes. It doesnt break (I keep up with that to make sure nothing is broken every time I return to my C.A.M.P. which is often) it just vanishes. Oddly though it's only normal armor, like when a normal enemy drop a leather left arm or a metal right leg. My legendary armor stays but anything not legendary vanishes with no warning and the only way I know it's gone is when I go into my inventory to compare new armor and all I'm wearing is a legendary chest piece with the rest of my modded, deep pocketed armor gone into the void. Like I said this has happened twice now so it's gotten rather inconvenient to have lost all my armor.
---
Theres a second one
---
I see why you play solo...was all in good fun, i didnt Force anyone to do Anything they played along or i left in peace.
---
Ahhhh.  Cant track them all now can we.  
---
Thank you for going through the painstaking process of doing this.
---
And unfortunately after the patch that 450xp will be less. Thanks Bethes'duh. Because people going to nuke zones to level up faster is frowned upon now. Amazing how a game is really cool to play then the devs patch the hell out of it and it is no longer fun to play.
---
Harmless 10mm auto to tag everything with without killing it + All Rise.
---
&gt; You are cheating.
---
How exactly? The rules of the game are the game's code. If the code of the game allows it, then how is it cheating?  If you didn't intend for the game's code to allow it, the issue is with your error. Not my creative use of the rules you wrote. 
---
Where did you learn this?
---
Thank you! Thank you a thousand times!
---
Fuck that. I'm really sorry that happened. What platform are you on? I'd be down to help you try another one.
---
Aye.  The Auto Gernade still hasn't gotten its weight fixed.  Yes it's explosive, but it also is OBVIOUSLY a Heavy Weapon.
---
I’m glad I saw this post.  I’m level 100 and wife is 27.  She plays League of Legends most of the time while I was running to White springs every chance I got after I figured out what going to a nuked White springs actually did, good lord the glowing blobs it would spawn.  
---
But she always like to primarily focus on building her camp and I have dropped so man plans, materials and lower items for her between runs.  Didn’t realize the duper’s were now actively hunting other duper’s, the OPs description were definitely duper’s or at the very least bought that mini gun off eBay.  
---
Maybe I’ll go back to League of Legends for a while until that settles down because she only plays with me and one or two of our friends.  I don’t see why people go out of their way to ruin the game for other people, if you play it like we do it’s more rare than not to actually come across other players.  You have to adamantly try to go to them.
---
I totally get what you're saying...for me it just doesn't matter because the character population is so low.  If you want to, you can treat it as a solo experience most of the time.
---
But yeah, I get it.
---
Obligatory 
---
It’s because you’re a duper!!!!
---
That's still 100% too expensive.
---
The destroyed crops thing is super handy though. Why supermutants feel the need to shoot my mutfruit is beyond me.
---
vanilla here. I doubt it's something related with mods.
---
Xbox here brother, I can give you a nice vault tech lamp XD
---
I picked up another game today in the Wendigo Cave, next to a body by a food cooler.  "Wastelad" or something like that.
---
Legendary Hunting Rifles added.
---
BOUT FUCKING TIME. I'm stoaked
---
Omg no I dont have the time, or friends to be duping 😂 plus I genuinely want to enjoy the game. I mean this isnt a super huge deal when I can craft temporary armor again it's just so weird I was wondering if anyone else had come across it. I've looked through the subreddit and havent seen mention if this yet.
---
yeah that's the weird thing. I've been constantly reading about people being really happy the new patch as they had a better experience with stability and just thought that the problem was on my end.
---
It's just that it coincides with patch release.
---
I sent in a bug report about it but nothing was changed so I'm thinking it's a design choice.  A pretty strange one in my opinion.
---
You're clearly more of a Reddit veteran than I am. 
---
For the most part, the players I have encountered on Fallout have been great. 
---
I have occasionally Googled and found answers to things that were on reddit, but this was my first actual experience here. You're welcome to think what you want of me. 
---
I will admit that I'm probably like the old guy who is pissed that there are folks driving 50 through the neighborhood because there are kids around. I've been that guy too. 
---
It's not because they aren't thinking, people like this are really only looking for any flimsy reason to grief. I bet if they learned the truth they wouldn't give a flying fuck. Sadly, too many of these people exist. 
---
Oh my frames are great.  It's more.....    walking along and go check surroundings to suddenly: full stop and fling my characters POV a quarter of a second later.
---
I just got protective lining from Census Violence for Marine. If that helps anyone...
---
Bought this expecting a flute lol, this thread's contained more plot twists than 76's main story
---
Only a percentage of what you pay ends up in his available funds.  I bought something for 240 caps and he only ended up with about 60 or so.  I think Bob is skimming.
---
Definitely more CTDs
---
If you mean purified water you can sell that, I have been for quite a while not sure about boiled water though
---
What are we really talking about here? You don’t have an argument if we are discussing the quality of Fallout 76. It’s bad. It is very unstable and it has an extremely limited end-game. Anthem may not have an end-game, nobody knows yet, but there is no reason to believe it will be unstable. Besides that, why do you guys give a shit if I want to play Anthem? I’m not here to defend it because we know very little about it but I am looking forward to playing a brand new IP that looks pretty unique.
---
Marine Protective is from Census Violence. Just got it as a drop after 15+ Census Violences.
---
&gt;  fix up the economy
---
WHAT ECONOMY ?! ?! 
---
This line keeps being parroted around yet no one has been able to answer that simple question. 
---
There is no in game economy to be broken. It's not as if the dupers are selling their items in the atom store. It's not as if BGS has nerfed anything or buffed any mobs because of it. 
---
Depends on what you consider a dev item, like a debug weapon would be clearly a dev item for testing purposes.
---
I have my doubts about certain headgear and cosmetic items not being available to the players via legitimate ways, like the mentioned Marine Armor Helmet, the Wood Helmet, or Fireman Uniform, there isn't really a reason why these items were left out, especially since they're part of certain armor sets that are obtainable, probably an oversight on Bethesda's part. But yeah, the helmet is originally from the dev room.
---
I've been playing since Beta and had very few crashes. Maybe once every few hours back when it was first released. 
---
This morning I played for just over 2 hours and have had 3 CTD in that time. I came to Reddit to see if anyone else was experiencing this. Sucks. 
---
Yeah. Cause a tenners not that much for a game you think you might like.. even if you end up not liking it. 
---
I paid £50 and I've had my money's worth already as far as I'm concerned. 
---
If you buy stuff from vendors, they only get a small percentage of those caps back in their inventory.  You probably bought too much. 
---
No I'm good pay your own way just like I do
---
For an interim solution, [you can use camp fires](https://imgur.com/a/U25nuek).
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a4t9he/want_a_rooftop_garden_safe_from_mole_rats_and/
---
Yeah that’s what I meant, from the dev room. Sorry should of been more specific 
---
There not real to begin with
---
No, we just choose to not give him more exposure than he already has.
---
Stop being a drama queen
---
You just saved me so many headaches...Bethesda should pay you some Atoms for doing their job.
---
Were you the one with your turrets killing ghouls my friend and I were trying to farm? 
---
Or at least just the decorative bits 
---
I just built a full blown camp for the first time since the beta. 
---
I had thought that might help me limit the weight i'm carrying. 
---
After all that, I still have 600 lbs in my stash exactly, and am carrying 800+ lbs. 
---
I have a new perk that is related to finding more ammo. Despite not actually seeing more fusion cores, i've gone from having run out on the way from some long slog to now having more than I can count at a glance. 
---
I also simultaneously enabled the perk that slows the fusion core drain. 
---
At any rate, to get my weight down further is going to require a concerted effort. 
---
By design.  You can sell healing salve tho 
---
This worked for me, got them powered doors finally.
---
How are plans easy for farm? I always struggle with not having enough caps
---
Possibly you accidentally sold/scrapped it?
---
You fucked up.
---
This is awesome. Don't suppose you remember where you found the 'Dressers' plan (for the asylum looking ones). It's one of the last plans I need! :( 
---
If you want rifleman build, then perception and agility is the way to go. 15 in both of them. That's where the majority of the rifle perk cards are.
---
One of my 8 super sledges and my 2 shot minigun.
---
Wow this is cool. Ty this does help, now I know it's called 'Dressers' and not 'Dresser'. Now to find it lol
---
I would give you gold if I wasn’t so damn broke right now! Thank you!
---
That would suck...
---
If you do launch on prime, do a search on here. There's a spot, I think it's slightly to the right of prime, where if you hit there, the queen will spawn but you won't take on radiation. 
---
I thought so the first time but the 2nd time definitely not. I dropped a nuke at the fissure site and while I was waiting for it to drop I went back to my camp to make sure all my armor and power armor was repaired, then I went and fought the queen, once I killed the queen I went back to my camp cuz I had gotten a whole bunch of new armor so I went to compare and all my armor was gone.
---
ITT: OP makes a tit of himself, attacks anyone who calls him out
---
Here's an image of the Marine Armor Helmet I've submitted to the wiki: https://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Marine_armor_(Fallout_76)?file=MarineArmor.png
---
Don't have a screenshot of the Winterized T-51b / T-60 though, would need to repait one of my PAs but they're as you'd imagine them to be, all white.
---
all the  carry weight exploits have been fixed for a few months at this point. 
---
I like your crosshairs.  That would be a nice tool.
---
I can’t believe someone downvoted your comment.  Da fuq?
---
yea, I finally got the black officer to go under some weightless BoS combat armor and I then noticed the issue.  I would think its an easy fix.  
---
How dare I be an honest player!
---
&gt;GTX 950 **2GB**
---
The official requirements are 3GB VRAM, which corresponds to my findings trying to stay above 40fps on a card with just as much memory as yours (but 34% faster).
---
I had to go to LOW, cripple shadows to pixels, disable TAA and drop down to 720p to stay above 40fps at all cost.
---
I would love to see a recording from you with those settings, 1080p and a frame counter walking through watoga.
---
Personally, I'm not really seeing a problem. I'm still leveling up pretty easily, just got to 95. 
---
I don't think anything they've patched or nerfed has given me pause. 
---
I wish those seem fun 
---
No can do,  tried to make a costume for a friend but it just dissappears if you try to drop it. Not sure about trading though
---
Multiple TSE? 🤔🤔🤔
---
That sounds like an absolutely terrible way of handling it, unless PVP is constantly active, I've never played that game.
---
On PVP servers I wouldn't have a problem with how it's handled, everything is open game there, if someone interacts with your character in a negative manner that's just part of the parcel with PVP. But if I'm able to opt out of PVP or if I'm on a PVE server or some equivalent (which "Passive Mode" is), then other characters shouldn't be able to harm me in any form. Including looting my "body." Especially if I can't get revenge for it.
---
Ideally servers would just be open warfare and you could kill anyone and everyone, but they're not, so I shouldn't be punished with just flat out losing my stuff with no option to get it back.
---
No it doesnt, ive tried with my friends camps
---
Why? I was playing on a gtx 770.
---
Excellent work.  Aside from the stash plans I am only missing 5 or 6 so will help me find those and stop me buying more double of things I have already.
---
At this point, I only put doors on entrances I want to **lock**. If everyone is allowed to come and go, just leave the door off.
---
Very nice! I was just getting to Reddit to track down the correct name for the Powered Door Plans so I can start my hunt. 
---
Have a couple different ones 
---
&gt;Vendors inventory are server based.
---
That is not completely true. I found grahm, sent out a post here and in the world to let a bunch of people know, while there were a bunch of people waiting in line, I left the world, and then rejoined the same world (xbox, found a player and joined their game).
---
When I relogged, I ran back to grahm again and he had different stuff in his inventory (namely the powered doors plan I was hunting for)
---
Just because you don't like it bro, doesn't make it a cheat. You're just telling people how they can and can't enjoy their game. 
---
Ty man, this helps a lot! 
---
Actually it took some effort to get them ported, as all the assets had to be retextured since Fo76 is now using PBR.
---
I will have to look.  I got a legendary harpoon yesterday but not sure if i sold or kept.  
---
Super Good Advice! I didn’t realize you could collect from the resource if the extractor was on top of it. 
---
If you use the Butchers Bounty perk you can use the fertilizer brahmin for meat - you just have to s'earch' the body.
---
But I’m Le Tired 
---
Alrighty. If that's the stance you and others take I'll respect it despite not liking it. I'll no longer post about this very topic or about any other cheating YouTubers wrecking this game. I wish you and your strategy of silence the best of luck. 
---
My entire base is surrounded by defensive walls, so it's not quite as easy to level without going inside.
---
Logged on this morning and I had lost an X-01 stealth boy mod I was waiting to craft an alternate torso for.
---
Either my quad minigun (MORE DAKKA!) or my TSE auto handmade with a drum mag (*Mother Russia Intensifies*)
---
Happens fairly routinely if you're farming the queen.
---
Ok thanks so much
---
Unless it's a daily :(
---
From being an agressive dick to a passive agressive bitch. Bet you're a master of making friends and influencing people
---
A glitch like this is seen as fine and no one cares despite it being an exploit but anything else is a NO
---
How can we have a community that hates exploits whilst promoting others? 
---
I wish the community would make its mind up, exploits in any form are bad or are some okay?
---
Once you get through the BoS missions it will be useful. It (IIRC) is in the MISC tab, after completion of the BoS.
---
I sell water all the time. My water farm is a sizable chunk of income.
---
Unless it's changed with the recent patch....
---
Dude. You have serious problems.
---
I think my perception is total crap right now... my agility is ok... I've been really discouraged at the amount of damage rifles seem to do general so I got into the strength tree just using my ski sword 
---
Same here, severe as well.
---
Most certainly and oversight on Bethesda's part, I was bothering the support about it for a while :P
---
I haven’t tested it yet, but I believe that any armor penetration value would indeed work against your own armor/damage reduction
---
Really strange.
---
I'm running a computer that doesn't meet minimum specs but am having less stability problems than most others I've met.
---
I've only crashed out once, pre patch. Everything else was DCs in silos, nuka zones, or power plants.
---
Extra upvote for clever use of pharmacists. 
---
If you learn the serum recipe you will be able to craft the serum.
---
What does pacifist mean?
---
Amazing work dude. Bethesda, shame on your company that your customers have to do this kind of thing in the first place. 
---
xD
---
Cool? 
---
Oh. I had the same issues on /r/pumparum and /r/wheelanddeal but the mods eventually figured out I managed it well and people used it. 
---
I had this happen last night in a queen fight, I got put down into critical state, called for help, some player was just standing in front of my body waiting for me to die, then that piece of shit just looted my bag when I died.
---
Alot of stuff can be built on camp fires actually. 
---
Some people use pip boy cut outs to invite players to use their camp, trying to be helpful.
---
For me, it's a giant flaming staircase of corn. You can see it easily a ways off.
---
I asked a guy to look up the values in the esm and  high speed weapons have a lower chance. 
---
I want to farm distant thunder events but I’m not sure where they trigger.
---
I've build mine under the red railway bridge west of The Sludge Hole (near the wendigo cave) and I usually have very few spawns.  
---
A few exceptions are a group of 3 level 5-15 mutants that spawns down the road, but  usually spawn walking away from my camp, not even noticing me. And a single lost level 40 radtoad that  comes up from the raider camp, but that only happened twice.   
---
I only have a single turret on the bottom level, more used as an alarm system than a defense system. 
---
Not sure what that means, but I think I've just been called weird by someone who turned a british claymation dog into barf...
---
"Not here, these are leather seats!"
---
Kinda pissed because the “barn building set” actually  didn’t unlock any of the walls for me and upon trying to buy it again just didn’t proc so now I don’t think I’ll ever be able to build with those nice red walls, at least I’ve got brick
---
This is why I lock my doors. I don't like coming home to mobs in my living room.
---
I reccomend batteries included.
---
Busts those FC down to just .3lbs each instead of a pound.
---
If you use a serum recipe, you'll learn how to make that mutation serum. Mutation serums are pretty easy to make and usually sell for about 300 -500 each or you could sell the recipe for about 5k more or less
---
Serums give you specific mutations. 
---
So for example. You have the speed demon recipe. You learn it. You can now make a chemistry bench a speed demon serum using a pure flux and some other ingredients. Using the speed demon serum will give you the speed demon mutation (increased speed and reload, increased hunger and thirst.)
---
Yes. Which is why this has been known by some for quite a while....
---
And why they patched it instead of say heavy weapons not doing g damage or healing enemies....
---
Oh wait.
---
Fool! You Forgot to Feed us this Friday!
---
This is Murica friend, here he’s known as the law, the cops, the fuzz or the heat
---
Nope I always drive the speed limit.  Again, you're just trying to feel virtuous.  Which I would ignore by now but I'm taking a poop break so nothing better to do.
---
If your camp were destroyed by a scorchbeast, then it’s fine? You are in a terrible world! Raiders everywhere! It’s unrealistic to build a home if you can’t defend yourself. When you have a TSE minigun, you can have a home.
---
Then take a nap 
---
Best part of it is that considering how horrible RNG is in this game i'm pretty sure his minigun was duped by someone at some point. Love them or hate them but at the end of the day dupers have flooded the market with tons of dirt cheap TSE weapons and made it actually possible for your average Joe to have them within reasonable amount of time. All it takes to get a TSE weapon of your dream right now is 2 weeks of selling vendor trash.
---
Did you kill the 6 different types of creature with it?
---
I mean, it's not much of an exploit. It really doesn't give much benefit. 
---
Being able to place water purifiers in some non dirt areas is slightly helpful I guess?
---
There are some random creatures you’re supposed to kill with the swing analyzer installed. If the list doesn’t show on your screen, check the quest log on your pipboy (under data I believe).
---
And I bet this is the type of rebuttal you have, by yourself on the shameful car ride home after being made a fool.
---
You on now?
---
My buddy is using a lvl 50 smg!! I'd take it! You're a good boaaah
---
She got attacked due assumptions that weren't supported by any evidence and more of an reenactment of angry emotions against dupers.
---
Also, picking on a low-level player as a high-level player is just scummy.
---
I loose those mutation if i use a radaway ?
---
I didn’t accuse anyone. If he wants to finish the quest within 30 minutes, without OP weapons, it won’t happen. Killing the SBQ itself is completely doable solo, but not within the time limit. 
---
You don't. I don't have power user or batteries and have 0 issues with power cores. The other two are mutation related and nothing to do with jetpack.
---
It's a bad post imo
---
Where can I find the brick building set?
---
It's the game. . .
---
I run a Per/Luck VATS Rifleman.  I do pretty damn well solo, but the rest of my build is built for a team.  I am kind of the field medic.  
---
Per - Rifleman/Expert Rifleman/Master Rifleman/Tank Killer/Concentrated Fire all rank 3
---
Luck - Bloody Mess/Four Leaf Clover/Better Crits/Grim Reapers Sprint all rank 3
---
Yes, unless you have level 2 starched genes perk
---
I'm your huckleberry!
---
I'm sure it was lol
---
QA? We ARE QA. That Bethesda either does not have, or does not listen to, a QA team is well established. 
---
I never drmo houses but I do seek out dupers on PS4. I'll usually initiate trades to view inventory and scope out what they're doing (i.e. looking for one character working in a weapons workbench for WAY too long). I have multiple videos of duped inventories I need to report to bethesda, but I'm lazy. 
---
What is that about? Was fighting the queen a few days ago and realised I couldn't hear anything firing except my own weapons... Stopped to observe and the other 7 or 8 players were just running around not even killing adds. To make matters worse they'd pulled the queen away to the west of Glassed Cavern so I couldn't use its roof to stay out of melee range. I ended up just leaving even though it was my nuke.
---
No problem, good luck.
---
You have a creative definition of the word Cheat.
---
Let's have a look at the dictionary:
---
act dishonestly or unfairly in order to gain an advantage, especially in a game or examination.
---
Let's have a look at the ToS you likely hadn't bothered to read before clicking agree:
---
Section 8, 8th bullet point [you agree not to use any service to] Promote, upload, transmit, encourage or take part in any activity involving hacking, cracking, phishing, taking advantage of exploits or cheats and/or distribution of counterfeit software and/or Virtual Currency or virtual items. In an effort to continuously improve the Services, You and other players discovering exploits, cheats, cracks or other inconsistencies are required to report them to ZeniMax
---
So let's pick this apart. I have to run around to the hotspots to pick up ballistic fiber. You dupe yourself 1k of ballistic fiber. Are you acting honestly? Are you gathering ballistic fiber in the way the game intends? Are you exploiting the code to gain an unfair advantage on players that are acting honestly?
---
Honestly, I hope Bethesda hardware bans all the dupers. 
---
It's time for dedicated PVE Servers. This shit is ridiculous. 
---
Has it been confirmed how long respawning takes while not in area??
---
somewhat depends on how many people show up. More people, harder fight. watched 3 queens go down in moments yesterday. 1 guy was taking out big chunks of health bar like me fighting a molerat.
---
"duping is bad, players should  earn things validly"/ "game randomly deletes top end game gear if you ever make ammo"
---
2 hours without getting disconnected is certainly an accomplishment!
---
that's what most people miss, and it doesn't tell you
---
get the power gates plan, turn the wall so the security code pad faces out, write the code with letters and numbers plan just above the keypad, now everyone can get in and the door will auto close after 5 seconds, and still keeps the enemies out, you can't even lock pick them :)
---
I will probably check in about an hour.  I have 3 cats sleeping on me right now so i am kinda immobile.  
---
Good look 
---
Thats it, vent your impotent rage. You'll feel better for it later. Maybe a little nap will help too
---
I'm not gonna read past the title in case there's spoilers but I'm really happy for you! 
---
I hope to do the whole thing by myself as well when the day comes, especially when decrypting the codes, I really wanna do it without that website that everyone uses or reddit posts that give you the whole codes.
---
You are supposed to place a camp near water to gain access to a better purifier. Putting it on fires and plants to give you more water is kind of still an exploit. You have an advantage of more water. I don’t care you do it, I just wish I knew what was okay to do and what isn’t 
---
Bad grammar checks out: he's a cop.
---
Explosive is gonna get nerfed/removed, just wait. 
---
It's coffee and fallout time! Anyone on 
---
It’s fine I’ll probably be on in an hour too
---
Maybe if Bethesda got off their asses and did something we wouldn’t be having problems like this 
---
I swear this community.
---
If there are protectrons at the clubhouse they are glitched.
---
If you see it happening you can log out to stop them from destroying the whole thing.
---
That what shot guns are for. 
---
Working on it.
---
Fantastic facts friend! Are you a fan of Letterkenny?
---
Walk from vault 76 to flatwoods, the red rocket and finally the agriculture research center. All enemies you encounter in those areas should count for all the different types you need.
---
Are you on pc?
---
I just purchased a BOS Combat Armour Chest Plan from the Grafton Vendor (not the one in the station, the other one). I clicked to learn it. It doesn't appear when I tried to craft it at my armour work-bench. It's now gone from my inventory when it was learned. Am I missing something? I'm level 32 on PS4 Pro.
---
Explosive minigun does insane dps.
---
Never been a fallout or elder scrolls game before you can't dupe. Maybe it was a bad idea to make this game online and leave a known glitch like that open for months. 
---
THEN FIRE ZE MISSILES
---
Lol hey grammar police this is my jurisdiction :)
---
Not true at all
---
It's safe to say they already took the hit, and they are taking steps to improve the quality of their product. The lingering negativity in the subs and online at this point makes it harder for those who enjoy the game to find positive community content
---
People shouldnt downvote you for wanting more in universe interactions. Its still one of my major grips still . With like the 2 charaters I do like you cant really have a conversation.
---
Oh my God I have the same problem! I come back after three hours of adventuring and the door to my two story colonial is wide the fuck open! Heathens! 
---
Hahahah
---
Would like to know.  Server hopping tends to be a caps saver when compared to fast traveling around, but if I don't have to wait long, might be worth it.
---
I might just be imagining this but it seems like if I do this then the extractor won't pull anything for a while. Same thing with wood extractor. I think it might prevent it from working until the junk/wood respawns.
---
I was with 3 ppl.  And emptied all we had into it...hardly even dented it. We had every weapon except TSEs. 
---
Aha thanks, felt good gaining a full level and a lot of legendaries. Too bad most legendaries was low level armors which you can't even scrap :/
---
Cranberry Bog, usually around the camp sites
---
I went to use it to repair some plants and it was gonna cost me 3 of each plant to repair 1. Did it manually and it only cost 1 to repair
---
If that is your route be sure to check about 100m south of Dabney homestead. A legendary supermutant tends to spawn there.
---
Players aren't ruining the game, they're finishing it. Bathesda ruined it, players are giving it a quicker end.
---
Just people looking to justify their griefing. Once the dupping issue has passed people will come up with some other reason to try and legitimize their griefing. 
---
No it was 3 for each plant it’s telling you the total cost. 
---
This is 100% true. Tested it out myself. You have a broken berry bush and that is all. You can repair it by walking up to the bush and clicking repair. It will cost you one berry. If you go to the box and hit repair all with that same one berry bush broken, it will cost you 2 berries and a fertilizer. Repairing from theCAMP  box option costs more. 
---
crafting is trash. As soon as you start getting legendaries, crafting is done. it is nice up to lvl 50, crafting a new set every 5-10 lvls helps the under 50 grind. 
---
rifle melee is the only real great combo, everything else is giving something up for playstyle. my 15 luck stealth vats pistol build is fun to play, but it is a compromise.
---
Alright, alright. Let's smoke a peace pipe over this. I honestly didn't come here to argue we fellow non-cheaters and fans of the game. My frustration comes from my server frequently and parties of dupers decimating areas before I even have a chance to tag enemies. I'm just trying to enjoy the game. For that I apologize. 
---
Try that. It's what beth suggests on their ps4 forums. Cut crashes from 5-10 a day to 1 or 2.
---
Yeah those guys are jerks, but this in a really roundabout way could be a really immersive roll play experience. The dupe hunters are in this case a group of bandits who think they are the good guys but really they’re just jerks.
---
This game needs some player made factions.
---
But sorry if this ruined the game for your girl. I’ve been playing the game forever and have barely ever run into anyone I didn’t want to, so hopefully she knows encounters like that are a rarity. See you guys out in Appalachia! 
---
Well perception is where all the dmg perk cards for rifles is tho..
---
Look if you’re trying to use V.A.T.S with shotguns your doing something wrong, the only time you want to use V.A.T.S with a shotgun is for targeting rad rats or giant ants and that’s only so your aiming in the right direction. 
---
I've yet to find a two shot or explosive
---
weapon, this one would exactly fit my build :) 
---
Are you sure there wasn’t another broken berry bush else where you weren’t aware about? Never had this problem happen and my base gets broken a lot 
---
*Psycho 
---
It would be the damn boards 
---
Considering Minecraft is one of the most popular online games around it seems the majority aren't that bothered by it. Dyeing has consequences. Think of it like this, when you die and drop stuff, it's no longer yours, that's the price you pay for dieing. 90% of the time you can get it back, and that's generous, but until you do its just loot, it belongs to anyone who finds it. If a passive player dies, you can loot what they drop just the same, so it's not like they have an advantage.  
---
Not sure how open warfair would be ideal, considering you can one shot high level, heavily armored players with minimal effort. This game has enough problems without adding a toxic griefing community on top of it, because anyone who has spent any time with online games know that's exactly what would happen. 
---
Thanks! I've always felt the dialogs was interesting to listen to, also pretty funny
---
That was fixed in the last patch
---
Why the downvotes? You are right. It costs more fixing things with "repair all" than it does walking up to the broken item and fixing it individually. -9 even like wft ? 
---
Why do people have these mods and not the armor? Buy the mods and put them on when you have the stuff. 
---
I'm not trying to defend bethesda,  but if you shoot your self in the foot, do you blame the gun?
---
Aside from making separate pvp/pve servers they could just hide other players from the map. Making hunting much more unpredictable.
---
And tagging bounty on the whole team, even if one of them attacked, is a must as well.
---
I love pvp, I want to role play assassin or raider.
---
I don’t want to spoil the game for others, but current system freaks me out.
---
The easiest way to get into combat is to annihilate someone’s CAMP and get huge bounty on yourself. 
---
This is bad gamedesign in my opinion.
---
This next patch is supposed to fix it. 
---
Did you dupe them?
---
In my experience I’ve pulled junk from the extractor and then from the pile every time I visit my camp - typical scenario for me when I’m selling loot is watoga, camp, harpers ferry, camp, whitespring and bunker, camp, responder station, raider station, camp. And I pull junk from the extractor every time, and from the pile maybe every two or three visits.
---
Responders? BoS? Howabout the "man in a dress who is very attracted to your male character" faction?
---
This is cool, I like seeing other types of player organization and convening than my marsupials herd aesthetic. good job
---
Make sure he isn't in a team already.
---
When I was using defensive walls, I noticed that it does charge you more for the repair all feature. I only noticed because I had so little in that CAMP using concrete 
---
My CAMP seems to attract them.    Mothman stops by once a week to visit, sitting on the ledge above my CAMP, silently laughing at my pathetic turrets.   I'm pretty sure he enjoys the tickles they provided.  
---
I spotted Flatwoods spying on me the other day, just north of my CAMP.   (He's the ...floaty alien guy?)
---
The people on this sub can't handle criticism or a opinion that is against their and suppress it.
---
Hm weird seeing more people have this happen to it could be a glitch then 
---
I ran it with a Warhammer with power attack damage and a shitty build many times. I also ran it with a basic deathclaw gauntlet and an unarmed build many times. My friend ran it with a shitty handmade and a shotgun a few times. Sure op weapons help but it's easily doable once you learn the silo.
---
The queen is different obviously since you need a good legendary weapon to solo but you don't need an overpowered one. My unarmed build I use to solo her had swing speed and armor penetration which is great but not anywhere near other ones I've seen. A Zealots with attack speed and power attack damage  or armor penetration is something I'd consider op as she would get absolutely melted by that.
---
All rise &amp; TSE handmade 
---
They would have to rewrite the fucking netcode then because it's plain text.
---
Yea I saved that post for when I want to make a list of what plans I do and don’t have
---
It definitely got rid of my worries about the pvp of this game. I was worried you would be getting griefed constantly. But I've only ever ran I to somebody being a dick once. So now I try to continue the help I had a bounty last night from accidentally shooting a turret at someones camp while trying to fight of ghouls for them. So I went to Flatwoods figuring there would be a low level there and messaged the guy "kill me" so he did and responded with "why did I do that?" So I explained the bounty system to him and gave him a spare power armor frame I had.
---
K thanks might try it
---
You guys should all uninstall this trash game. 
---
This plan doesn't drop this way. Not all plans do. Someone datamined it.
---
Tesla rifle so I can (try to) tag things before they get 1shot by TSE assholes.
---
You could have waited for gameplay videos to get an idea of how buggy it is. If you were patient enough to wait out the Beta, you could have waited a few more days for gameplay videos to decide. You are out of your mind if you think that 76 is by far the most buggy. I had my saves corrupted on both NV and 4(3 was the only one I played post 6 months release and never had a corrupted save). I didn't say "they always suck", I said they were always buggy. How buggy a game is, is measured differently from person to person, and how annoying bugs are affects each person differently. You should know how you measure a games level of bugs, and how those levels affect you. If you know you have a low tolerance for bugs in games, then from previous experiences you should know to wait 6 months post release for a Bethesda Game. You'll enjoy it more, and it'll be cheaper.
---
This is great! 
---
Ya, I suspect it is a glitch as well
---
100% sure. It does the same thing with the razorgrain, tatos, mutfruit, and corn. The gourds, carrots, and melons don't get destroyed but I'm wager they do the same thing. 
---
TSE Lever Gun, TSE Handmade, Instigating Swing Speed Super Sledge. 
---
Ya the game is stale with these. 
---
All the robots are whitesprings are neutral.  They won’t attack you unless you hit them first.  They also aren’t supposed to drop items or xp cause they continually respawn
---
Well thats rude :)
---
Character 1 / Limb damage shotgun for tagging, two shot for killing
---
Character 2 / 10mm tse (tags and takes things down) ... bonus long gun for hitting SBQ in air
---
Camouflage deathclaws  are literally everywhere.  You just cant see them ;)
---
1- Make sure you bring extra nuke key cards. If you type the code wrong it eats your card, so you would need another to try again. 
---
2 - Equip 3 ranks of Hacker so you can hack the terminals and turn off the turrets. This makes things much more pleasant.
---
3- When you get to the point you can launch the nuke, run back to the crafting stations a few rooms back and scrap your junk, repair weapons, make ammo, so that when you do launch you can get to the nuke zone and be ready to rock.
---
4- Go for Fissure Prime. People will show up. And even if you don't take down SBQ it is still a fun fight with all the mobs that spawn. 
---
5- Try to harvest as much Violet Flux as you can (pitcher plants and mutated ferns) and the materials to stabilize it (Glowing Mass, Hardened Mass, High Radiation Fluids) One thing The Whitespring doesn't have is Violet Flux, so stock up while you can.
---
Check out riflegaming on YouTube hes starting to do a series of different places to nuke, very entertaining 
---
Durability I think is better. I'm not 100% sure 
---
I'll be honest I usually escort with x01 and a furious .50.  I treat all my escorts like a sbq.  And if I a high level shows I ping a shot off them.  I'm only 90 but I'm your huckleberry
---
I’ll have to check it out
---
This game really needs a server option for “leveled enemies”. Opt to join servers where enemies throughout the whole world are leveled to you to provide challenge. Unlocks at 50+. That way a level 100 can still enjoy exploring the forest and not just be faced with level 6 scorched. 
---
New Elder Scrolls title\*
---
Yeah but what are you gonna do. Not tryna be a dick or anything but if the game didn’t want you to go around destroying bases they wouldn’t let you. Regardless of whether it was justified or not, those two guys were having fun their way. That’s what you get with an online sandbox. OP, if your truly upset that your gf had to have her base ripped down, then never let her play rust, Ark, or even a public Minecraft server cus I can tell you right now, from what I remember there isn’t a little box that lets you rebuild shit for 1/100th of what you used to build it. You don’t sound like a 12 year old OP so I’ll tell you this, games that hold your hand the whole way through, are not fun. So get building or stop playing cus there’s a lot more people like your lvl 140 friend. 
---
I had one broken tato plant and repair all said 80 tatos and 1 fertilizer to repair. Hard pass my dude. 
---
I wouldn't object to Beth "paying" you in Atoms, tbh.
---
Sounds like they were just roleplaying and you weren't into it. You know this is an RPG, right?
---
I’d love to advertise groups and be able to tag things like that ... “mutants” ... “bloodied” ... joining a group w/ my rad cleansing healer spec and nerfing a guy who wants to be at 20% health would be ... inefficient. 
---
Good job, and thanks.
---
(Too bad Beth doesn't have anyone on staff who can do this work.)
---
Great news! The game actually saves and I was able to continue where I left off! 
---
We bought the game, we voiced our opinions, frustrations,etc. Bethesda may have been a bit slow to communicate and respond at first, but from the BETA till now, the game plays much better. More stability and many bugs have been addressed and will eventually lead to QoL improvements, etc.
---
The "don't reward bad practices" argument is just ridiculous, if that was the case, 90% of businesses would be screwed because nobody would buy anything. by purchasing the game, you showed them you wanted the product. By continuing to play the game, you show them you have a continued interest, and any purchasing of MTX shows you are supporting their efforts to bring more content. Sure, staying away from it will have the game crash and fail for all of those who enjoy the game. It doesn't necessarily mean that's going to make future games any better. Learning from our mistakes is clearly something people have been shown to be good at lol history proves that otherwise. 
---
So, no. People will continue to play it and support it if they like it, and whether Bethesda has the morality and ethics to respect that and improve the product, we will ultimately see. In my book, they've done a good job at beginning to address the problems. The hate does nothing to solve the problems, it just makes them worse.
---
Maybe we will get an outstanding TES VI\*, maybe we will get an amazing Starfield. Or maybe, the hate train will cause Bethesda to play it so close to the safe side that we end up with these bland experiences because they are too worried about people raging for everything they believe the game should or shouldn't be. That mentality is what's hurting alot of games. The Blizzard debacle with Diablo Immortal is a perfect example of a game getting hate for no reason for the simple fact that it's not for them...because it isnt! That's the whole point and they are so disillusioned that the game wasn't catering to them. Diablo for non pc players, how dare they? why is it so bad for a new audience to experience the amazing world of Diablo? Why is it wrong for online gamers to experience the world and lore of Fallout? 
---
I believe you get what you give, and they gave us a product that we all admit, needed more work. We spoke, and theyve listened and are doing their best to right those wrongs. Constructive criticism goes a long way, much moreso than negativity
---
If picking your nose in someone else’s camp didn’t end up giving you a Wanted tag, I’d close the door.  The last door I left open was because someone built in the same spot as my camp when I spawned in.  I...wanted him to know I had been there.
---
Actually, I wanted to break the door down, spray paint the walls, blow out the windows, but, you know, scruples and all...
---
wait thats a thing u can get a recipe for how dose one get this recipe
---
no I thought all duping glitches were patched 
---
I didn't consistently freeze and crash before data. No sarcasm here. Revert me back. Sick of it. 
---
I don't recall ever picking up a plan for it, I just assumed I got it from scrapping
---
You armor is unequiped when you wear PA.
---
Just got the mutations set earlier this week. The game feels entirely different now that I can basically fly.
---
Can't recommend all of these perks/mutations enough.
---
It was probably me
---
Fucking A+ comment. Sever connection lost just rocked my world well done. 
---
Yeah, I was getting the historic sword from Whtiesprings a couple weeks ago and I guess someone had came through and made all the enemies like level 65-70 (I was only 22 at the time) and I was STRUGGLING to kill even one and was hiding on top of a table. When in comes my knight in shining power armor and killed them all with one mellow swing each. 
---
There are a lot of assholes in online game, but there are also just as many decent people. I make sure to tell a low level player to at least shoot something once before I kill it now so they get the loot too. 
---
My thoughts are you really need to be built to do high damage, and even have ultracite ammo on weapons for extra damage I think. A weapon that does 100 damage or whatever isn't going to cut it and the more people present the more damage you need. You need to get all the damage multipliers on from perks, gear, chems, bobbleheads, etc. Some people can get their damage really high with unyielding armor and all the perks and bloodied weapons. It's not meant to be easy or casual. Everyone needs to be prepared and have good gear and good builds.
---
First time I did nuke I used non legendary Lever action and Hunting rifle. Took me few hundred bullets and 40+ minutes. First time I wasn't aware that I can hack turrets and turn them against robots. Hunting rifle is garbage. It has no place in meta. You want 1 hit kill, use gauss rifle. Want burst damage, use lever.  Almost whole nuke I ran without PA, but repairing phase needs PA, because hazma suit takes away your armor and robots prolly will just kill you. 
---
I mean does it matter 😂
---
It used to, now the only atomic shop item u can build at friends camps is the big ass red rocket truck stop sign 
---
Thanks for the opportunity!
---
I noticed there were some "human-looking" robots and a big sentry robot near the fence who were neutral and defended against bears and ghouls but every protectron near the club house were an enemy. Around 100xp per kill and 200-300xp for legendary ones. Of the 15 I killed 5-6 were legendary
---
So you're saying that one can farm them over and over again for xp and loot without them almost not being able to kill you? (Only melee attacks lowered my health very very little)
---
This is why we should downvote all those, "I kill dupers, I'm a hero" posts because they're freakin' obnoxious and they encourage delusional idiots to think they're helping the game.
---
Idk I have rifleman and expert rifleman maxed idk what else to do
---
If you die to a mob or the environment , someone can still loot your stuff... 
---
Nah it about the same. I have 2 50+ one pistols one rifels. The black power does more damage I'm on pistols
---
Yeah, the content of the bug was different. But them getting popular had a part to play in them getting patched.
---
Sorry mate, I have found schematics for raider armor mods but not raider armor itself.  I checked my characters and none of them have the ability to craft so much as a single raider piece.  I checked with some other folks I play with over 300 hours in game as well (most of them on a single character instead of across multiple ones like me) and while between them all they have most of the schematics in the game none of them have raider armor schematics.  So at this point I am not sure if the armor schems are in the game and if they are where I can get them.  I am adding this to my list to check back on every once in a while and if anything changes I will do a video and send you a message with an update.  If anyone else has any info to add please let me know and have a great day!
---
The game has been out for “a few months” the infinite carry bug has been fixed for a few weeks at most. 
---
The jetpacks don't use power cores! They use AP only.
---
You get one guaranteed for taking a workshop and another every time you defend a workshop.  So if you want to farm just go around and take all the open workshops.
---
If you’re close to them when they die u can drop items they have, if u damaged them!
---
Dunno if that still works but 1 week ago it did
---
I mean you can try.  I’m referring to the robots at whitesprings resort, not the golf club.  All of those robots are passive 
---
Queen drop and Modus occasionally sells it for 20k.
---
I have no idea what duping is. 
---
Yeah it's taken me an unbelievably long time to level up idk
---
Revenge is an amazing thing, are you on PS4? And do you remember their names?  I could potentially find these guys and level their bases, I’m a little higher then them, 
---
Guys like that who tend to pick on low levels usually can’t hold their own,  with someone equal to their level
---
I was In white springs and have a party of level 100+s engage my lowbie friend I was helping level, their weapons were  so strong it bypassed my friends pre engagement defense, they all went “wanted” I leveled the place, robots, mobs and their entire party, they kept coming back and engaging me and I repeated the devastation enough times  they finally jumped servers, to get away from me, I even followed one of them into white springs after he shot at me again, he thought the robots would help him, I destroyed everything inside as well as robots turrets and him
---
My point is, level don’t mean anything, 
---
Assholes who usually like to pick on people can never really  hold their own with someone equal to their level, 
---
There are higher levels out there who are good folks, usually age has a lot to do with me
---
Tell your woman not to give up or be upset it’s happened to the best of us all we do is grow up to fight back, 
---
And to the folks hunting duper’s, your idiots, Bethesda is slowing banning people, they just banned a few hundred people yesterday 
---
TSE Gatling without Adrenal Mutations have damage upward of 800. 900 if Prime.
---
The five-o
---
Xbox here can build brick walls, barn walls, all the power plants and water filters, conduit, switches, etc. I have a spare brick building set plans that I bought having forgot I can already build them. Also have spare garage door plans and a ton of cosmetic plans I don’t need if any of that tickles your fancy
---
I've found them at Phoenix in Watoga a couple times but there 9600 caps.
---
What exactly should I do for armor then? I'm sick of coming up with the materials to repair so I thought crafting was a good solution... I'm at my wits end
---
Pre patch I crashed two times. Post patch I have dc everyday no matter what I’m doing but it happens. Iv never been in a area where a nuke went off but have been online when a nuke went of and got a dc. I can’t narrow it down anymore. The other issue I am seeing is after dc I log back in and notice containers are empty for a period of time. Like its taking time for things to refresh. More frustrating is lock safes or boxes are empty too. I break two or three Bobby pins to open something with nothing. I was content with how things were prior and won’t stop playing but who on their side is testing this out to say this is ok to release.....
---
Oh, yea, I’m steaming
---
choo choo
---
 Wow you are THE BEST.  Doing Bethesda’s work for them!  This is unbelievably helpful and I am so thankful!  I love this game and have not agreed with all the flack people want to throw at it, but If there is one thing I feel I’ve been missing, it’s at least a little guidance as to what damn plan I’m buying!  You just solved my problem, seriously thank you thank you so so much.
---
I always help low level players and I'm not a duper.
---
You should post that guy's name so we can grief him.  Seriously.
---
If you have done the " heart of the swamp " quest they will always be there for you :)
---
equip greenthumb then chemist / superduper and you have enough to do the queen 30 times, lol
---
Prime weapons are pointless. Just more time spent grinding the ammo. Stay with what you have
---
Whatever you say bud. :-)
---
Make sure you are picking up and scrapping all rifles for mods and updating your weapon every 10ish levels.  Mods make the weapons considerably better.
---
&gt; If you do this wannbe vigilantism, you are just as bad as a duper. 
---
Except one is exploiting the game, cheating and abusing software vulnerabilities and the other is literally just playing the game the way it was intended.
---
It is getting better, but the damage to the community has already been done. The hate for the game is dying down and its gotten enough patches to be mostly playable.
---
The problem is, 76 just isn't a very good game. You can't commuicate with other players other than emotes. There is no end game so once you're max level, there isn't much to do. There is no in game economy in a game designed for all players to be vendors. Pvp is broken. Weapon balance is broken. The list goes on and on. 
---
For some people the exploring or the survival or the grind is enough to keep playing, but for most that's not enough. We are basically in an unofficial beta atm while they work out the kinks and finish the rest of the content, once the game is finished people will probably come back to it, maybe. Sea of Thieves had the same problem, it released basically unfinished with little content or reasons to keep playing. They have done a lot to fix that, but most people have already moved on, 76 might suffer the same problem if they take too long. 
---
Says who? They’re literally everywhere.
---
I'm gonna go back tomorrow and see what happens. I gained a level without wasting any health in like 15 minutes, felt good. Every protectron dropped stuff after I killed them
---
Is Robotics Expert what I need?
---
Yeah I have a lot of those I'm just having a bad time taking too much damage when I get caught in the open or enemies get close
---
We have good gear, and perks are there. I get 300 dmg from many of my weapons.  Just dont have TSEs.
---
I am shying away from any kind of trade/market.
---
Far to many duped weapons, armors and items.
---
It just sucks since I have to vendor all my 1,2 and 3 star items. I will probably never get the drops i need and will miss out on buying from others.
---
I just refuse to engage in a market that is saturated with duped items.
---
I only take 1 weapon from my stash which is a Super Sledge but I put in my Deathclaw Gauntlet since I can't use it while in PA
---
Dunno. I'm only 74 and have been playing since beta. I would be salty if that was all wiped, my time is valuable.
---
Ok what does it take to make the ultrasite ammo?
---
Also will the heavy gunner perks to increase damage on non explosive guns work if it’s just an explosive legendary prefix?
---
You don’t, you just need PA to do it.
---
My fireteam brought her down twice last night. None of us have TSE. We do however have min/maxed perk card builds, we use; drugs, bobbleheads, magazines, and food perks to increase damage as much as possible. 
---
The first time we were in a group of 10 all 100+, just got a really lucky server, only took 8 minutes to kill.
---
It took us about 27 minutes when we killed her the second time. We had several players under level 30 come out. My team and I were the highest leveled and best geared this time around.
---
It is completely doable to kill her. Take off the crafting, hacking, lockpicking and home defense perks. Get a heavy weapon user on your fire team. (That's me on my team, pm for build if you need it). Use limb damage to your advantage. 
---
That's part of the kink.
---
Vigilante justice.  Who says this ain’t like RDR2. 😳
---
To the OP. Sorry for appearing flip.  But it shows just how frustrating it can be with constant disconnects etc.   Yes those guys were being dickheads but, after all ; aren’t we all the NPCs?  😔
---
ok well here i go to kill the queen a million times with the 1 frame per second and low levels hiding in the shack this will be fun *facepams* y am i so unlucky sorry just frustrated about the low levels hiding in the shack and not helping
---
&gt;"I'm not stupid, I know it was a stash"
---
I think he meant to say, "I am stupid and I don't know how a stash works."
---
I mean, it's not the fucking van made of weed from *Up in Smoke*! Destroying your camp is only going to set you back a meager about of junk not thwart your nefarious duping operation.
---
Yes indeed
---
Even after you finished the quest? I swear at least 2 times I tried getting them only to see some other guy clearing the quest and nothing being there for me.
---
You don't leave barn doors open. That's how the animals get out.
---
That's what happens when you build a sub on a foundation of circlejerking. Can't say this wasn't expected lmao
---
"*Waaaaaaatoga* is a no-man's-land. L i t e r a l l y"
---
Everything the robots say is absolute gold, whoever does their writing needs an award
---
I like seeing the doors open because it means somebody has been through and found my CAMP useful. I even have a small guest shack.
---
Not sure why you got downvited, but pacifist mode is a blessing. 
---
Never been able to sell boiled water, but if its purified and you're not able to sell it - that spunds buggy
---
Well TSE with demolition expert etc. and all the weapon perks is going to be much higher damage. It could just be there were too many people there not pulling their weight. Not built good enough. Not good enough weapons. etc.
---
They need to make the map big enough so that if you want to, you could go somewhere and not see anyone.
---
Think about when IRL somebody gets lost in a giant State/Federal forrest - unless somebody knows they're there, it's a good chance they never see another person ever again, until somebody randomly comes across their remains years later.  
---
In a game like this "post apocalyptic" with drastically reduced population and whatnot, hiding should not even be hard, it's FINDING people that should be hard.
---
Good info thanks!
---
Get all three hacker perk cards in the intelligence slot and there's terminals in the silo to hack the turrets. The mainframe core room terminal is before the room behind a door you need to pick so I don't bother with it and instead kill a few turrets.
---
Open gates and doors are really the only way I know that people have been through my camp. It allarms me a bit, but I think it's awesome whenever I find that I've managed to help someone at a distance!
---
You can bend something till it breaks and that is what Bethesda does here. They just smacked the code into the engine without any proper testing and only god knows how long this will go good. You can already see the issues that have arised. There is no denial for it, when you have an actual proof. People, including myself, experienced a lot of network issues. You are not affected? Good for you, but others suffer right now.

Server I was on took her down twice tonight, probably 10+ players over level 100 both times. Still took a good amount of time, no one-shotting. 
---
I probably won't win but at least it's not raining 
---
I read that the Ultracite version of the laser pistol does slightly lower damage but fires faster.
---
I probably got downvoted because the OP is most likely the owner of the shack whose door I left wide open this morning.  
---
And it’s a damn good spot too.  ;)
---
I *never* bulk my steel, and I *never* get close to running low, and I've had mods scrapped from my inventory to craft things.
---
Can't make it happen with any consistency though, so I'm not sure why/how.
---
There needs to be a good group finder for FO76
---
have no ider if there is a "cool down" or something on them, but i tend yo end up with 20-35 readymade radshields, so i go there very seldom :/
---
But when i do i can always find them...
---
Positive I dumped or sold one of these last night! So sad right now 
---
You shouldn’t be downvoted because you are 110% right. I’ve tested this out myself and was confused as to why it’s like this. 
---
I don't log out of fo76, fo76 tells me when I'm done playing.
---
Man this game is like politics. Either it's one side loves it and hates you if you disagree or the other side hates it and hates you if you disagree. Meanwhile the sane voices in the middle get drowned out. Fuck man I want to game not relive politics in a video game. 
---
The engine has been virtually the same, just upgraded. Those games have easily been GOTY titles, sold very well and are extremely popular. So I doubt the engine will change AND will not be the reason they do bad.
---
And yes it does matter cause you obviously don't know the franchise. 
---
I swear duping is literally tearing the community apart, with the “anti-dupers”, actual dupers, and innocents caught in the crosshairs
---
Never seen that. I don't have many crops planted because they seem to take up a ton of budget space. 
---
Have gotten the stored CAMP bug many times where it gives you 40 toms when all I had planted is 2.

Cringe
---
If your legendary has more than 1 star, inspect it to see what are the other effects it has. When you're looking at the item, you'll see options listed below the item, one of them being inspect, that's the only way to fully see what are the extra effects of items who have more than 1 star.
---
Meanwhile between when you posted this and the last guy posted it I got downvoted 4 more times lol. This sub is an echochamber man
---
How did you message them? I'm confused

Farfegnugen!

Sunshine Oil is an easy to find recipe (Delbert's trailer) that is fairly easy to make (Sugar Bombs, Glowing Blood, 3 Blight) that restores 400 AP.
---
There is also Company Tea, which gives you a base 10 AP per sec regen.
---
I walked by a camp a week ago and saw the front door was wide open. So I closed it and moved on
---
I get you. If it makes you feel better, we’ve killed over 150 queens as a group now and only received Empath, Carnivore, Electrically Grounded and Scaly skin. It’s a real low drop, the lag is unbelievable and most the time it’s just two of us or myself doing the damage - evidenced by how much of the bar I can see being removed per clip. 
---
Game has a ways to go
---
I have a quad-capacity double barrel shotgun and a TSE lever action rifle. 
---
Truth be told, I very rarely one-shot anything over level 50. 
---
I have rifleman, expert rifleman and master rifleman all at rank 1, but no other perks that increase damage - all my perks are in DR. 
---
I find one-shotting everything somewhat boring, and while I do like to feel like *Doom Guy,* I usually play with a furious handmade rifle because enemies then still present a challenge.
---
I only whip out my explosive weapons during SBQ fights and nuked zones, really. Even then, it still takes two or three shots from my shotgun to kill glowing ghouls, and it barely takes a blip from the SBQ. 
---
You REALLY have to be min/maxing with TSEs to be slaughtering her with a TSE or melee weapon. 
---
...and that’s a lot of micromanaging perks and chems before a fight that I can’t be bothered to do lol. 
---
Oh my bad then there engine is perfect excuse me 😂
---
I made a previous reply to another guy where I stated op dont use the repair all function. It will cost you more to repair all than it would to just go up to each piece and repair. Just a warning to save you some junk. Hope you see it before this gets downvoted into oblivion as well.
---
Even if so, it takes far less effort if they already have the concept done and all they have to do is copy over a finished product vs creating an original idea from scratch
---
Last night 3 level 140+ were looking at the player list and seeking out all the low level players and wrecking their base. I was on my alt (only level 10) and they were talking with open mics on. It didn't take them long to find my name and start looking for my base. As soon as they said "Heeeey, OP is only level 10" I jumped servers, fuck that. 
---
This post is an important educational tool for the tools. Good job OP, make those fuckers get a warrant.
---
I wonder if people who act that self righteously realize that they are so hypocritical. Ruining Innocents experience just for the "chance" of screwing over a "bad guy".
---
Reminds me of Maxsons BoS...
---
I haven't seen it it quite a while, but you may be right. Ppl may look like they are trying, but really only 2-3, but again last night...prime nuke and 10 high lvl ppl there on a roof, presumably to avoid other creatures, could not do it.
---
I think you're just unlucky and someone beat you to the location. To me it doesn't seem like that aspect has changed. 
---
Middle Mountain Cabins is one of my hop destinations. The only perishable Roly Jelly is in an open basket near a grave and 3 badass enemies always spawn there. Last two times I went there I had legendary bears and radscorps. 
---
Thanks! 
---
I learned the perk pickpocket after leaving the dev test room. Sorry man, didn't think you would notice. 
---
That's true.
---
Watoga is a no man's land literally... Watch out for all non-brotherhood robots.
---
I am a dedicated heavy weapons and explosives user. I have 2 shot legendary weapons and I have explosive legendary weapons But I don't have any 2 shot and explosive weapons. I would like to fix that.
---
The hero we need, but don't deserve ...
---
It takes flux, which at this point I just drop. The damage benefit isn’t worth the time to craft the ammo and the materials, should you reach a point where you have to farm it. I have an ass load in my stash from Queen farming and I still don’t bother. 
---
Heavy gunner applies to your heavy weapons. If your gun explodes, get 5x demo expert as well. The explosive dam is an additional modifier.
---
People are just becoming more aware of the high density zones as they are shared, it's why a lot of the hard core farmers are moving away from one spot server hopes and going into circuits of locations that have loot or exp you are looking for.
---
I love you
---
Holy shit you can't read. I said exploiting not duping but continue to berate me with a narrative you haven't the slightest clue of. 
---
A level 12 was with a 150+ off to the side of the map not near anything. I go over to see what's so special over there as it's not a location I've discovered and I'm just wandering around. They know I'm there and waved at me. But their exploit had something to do with exp farm as I couldbt figure it out but in 10 minutes the level 55 (whom was also in the group) went up to 87. Nobody can level legitimately go up 30 levels in 10 minutes. So I walk over to the fissure site where they were farming and one shot everything I could so they could get exp. I didn't destroy their base like ops story was I was just playing the game being a bother to them as they were a bother for everyone else in the game. 
---
So wow thanks for making up shit that you think I did? I'm not a dick to players like you might assume. 
---
Vendors have a pretty large cap sink. When you spend money at a vendor, they only get back a small percentage of the caps. It's not equal, you can't spend 100 caps to give them 100 caps. 
---
What did he mean, that it was a stash? Was he suggesting that the whole building was full of loot? 
---
Griefers like this guy suck. They're pathetic. This happened to me once. I had to re-build the lot. I never knew why someone did this. Now it appears that, if someone attacks you or is wanted and you fight them and get killed, you are fined in caps - like 56 caps when a guy killed me twice. Why would Bethesda reward and encourage Griefers like this?   
---
Your account would be flagged which means your name and credit card would be unable to be processed. If you tried to make an account with the same information that would be flagged too. If it gets to be a scamming issue, the address might get banned too but that's for obvious scamming.
---
nah mate, adventures callin
---
They're not, though. Didn't sound like there was any dialogue, just destroying their base and only explaining why after being confronted. They're just looking for an excuse to mess with people in the end. Pretty much just as bad.
---
Let me know if you get another 
---
But what’s the point of making that bathtub, though, if I can’t fill it up with per-war money?
---
This is extremely helpful. Bookmarked!  Thank you. 
---
Considering there is bug right (on console at least) that recharges power cores to full when logging, it’s not mystery why you or anyone else hasn’t had a problem with power core management. Hell I’ve been using the same power core for weeks now.
---
With the new perch coming in this post has relevance. Worst case I don’t like it and respec a few level again
---
You need stable flux and ultracite to make ultracite ammo. This isn't much of an issue with non-automatic but in something like a Minigun that blows through it. I don't recommend it.

In int I swap out for whatever I need atm. Same for Perception, either drop longshot completly and choose something else, or just run the lockpicking, or just swap as you need to.
---
Never said it was perfect, I'm just saying that same engine has been responsible for critically acclaimed titles, so it's clearly not the engine that's the issue. If you're going to crap on a game, at least know what you are saying and have a thought of your own and not some predetermined, regurgitated YouTube crap

Tse handmade and ts pipe rifle

It’s an online game ffs. Find a server with friends on it, put gear in box, relog as mule, collect stuff from box. Takes 2 minutes, no one will stumble upon it in two minutes.
---
Doesn't appear in the menu when you try.
---
I think the asaultron should not have that sensual voice, it's a combat robot 
---
I've only played a few hours or so of the Destiny 2 beta, but I'll always think fondly of how cool that player hub was, pretending to sit on lounge chairs and attempting to kick that soccer ball around. 
---
Op should have explained that this is part of the game.  It’s not farming simulator 2077.
---
Look the big problem with removing duped items is that there really isn’t a good way of knowing if something is duped or not. It’s easy for a developer to write a little bit of script to auto delete forbidden items. But unless you want to advocate removal of all existing bobble heads, magazines and TSE weapons then there isn’t a good fix. 
---
Oh man it takes Ultracite too well that scared me off I thought it was just flux
---
A lot of camp items cost one of each material. There's no discount when something costs 1 as there's no floats (eg - .50). Yeah, if you don't have the materials you have to find them. It's still low to do this. Should be banned for it. 
---
It’s the people. All the known places to farm are just always looted. Youtubers and Reddit posts stating “this is the best place to farm X” means those locations are always hit first by the community.
---
I would recommend as you play the game just note mentally, or as I do with a sticky note pad, places you were able to pick up a large amount of that material. And if you are not a saint you don’t share it to keep it from being ransacked on every server. 
---
It has worked out so far for me at least.
---
It would be nice. 
---
An easy workaround for what you are suggesting is to hotkey or favorite your preferred grenades. When in doubt, open your favorites; if you’re out or grenades, but found more, they’ll be selectable again and you can equip them in the press of two buttons, instead of having to go through your Pip Boy. 
---
That’s a resource someone should post or PM me about ;)
---
Dude I hope it drains fusion cores. I have way to many. I've dumped cores twice and still have way to many.

*saved for later*
---
This, of course, is the reason I play Ark on a private server.  The public player base will make you lose faith in humanity.
---
I find this happens if you quit the game holding more than 1 Technical Data.  The game doesn't like that it seems since is it a Pseudo-Mission item
---
This game already catching more and more shit every day. If BGS deleted *everyone's* legendary weapons because they were too incompetent to design a system that wasn't soo unbelievably easy to exploit then that would be another colossal PR disaster in a game already in an bad state. It would also probably be the final straw for a lot of players tired of putting up with a mostly broken game.
---
i have killed around 20 but the fps drops to 1 and it becomes impossible to kill or save ammo and still dont have the trophy for killing it even tho a lunched the dam nuke 20 times not to mention i lost 100 carry weight after the second patch so i can only carry 1 gun at a time and i have all the parks to increase carry weight still to this day idk why i randomly lost 100 carry weight i have put a ticket in about it a few times nothing
---
I feel so bad now, I think I did this earlier today by mistake.
---
Was roaming about in the southern most part of the country. Came by a hut with a power armor stashed on top of a small stone hill south of the Lucky Hole Mine, and was excited to find someone's two story camp very close to it. Went it and scrapped some stuff, went out another way. And it's only now that I realize, that I didn't remember to close the first door...
---
Slightly better condition degradation, and does additional damage to Scorched enemies. Otherwise, the damage to everything else is comparable to a normal energy weapon. However, you’ll spend much, *much* more time finding it crafting ammo for it. 
---
Would be cool have to tame one then “mod it” it or something but it could not be that much maybe 100? 
---
Honestly who thinks of that when they see a high level playing with a low level? Majority of the time it's helping a friend who just got the game. What dickheads.
---
Everyone (-molerats)
---
What kind of advantages lol, instead of having it out the door you have them in the balcony
---
Hard pass from me dog. If you die, you drop a bag. This bag is up for grabs for anyone to loot. Don’t die. 
---
lol :D
---
While I'm on the contrary and I think it's a great game because it compliments my playstyles of just slowly exploring and moving at my own pace. I think people who burned through the game quickly are disappointed at the lack of endgame, and I get it. Some features are very barebones at the moment, and I hope they flesh them out more and revitalize the game in a sense. I preordered and I still think I got my moneys worth, still playing and will keep playing because I can play how I want, play with others and yet I'm not really forced to compete with other players just to get enjoyment out of my experience. But it's not for everyone and I get it
---
A workaround for a mechanic which you don't like is very much an exploit, your cheating the game because you don't like the developers design decisions.
---
It's not the game that wants people destroying bases. They have bounties and 'wanted' signs to  stop people acting like stupid thugs. People should take their psychological problems to their Doctor.  At least they're not torturing cats IRL, I suppose.  
---
Just a heads up, make sure you don’t get too many people who can’t get a decent damage output, the more people attacking the queen, the harder she will be to kill
---
It doesn't matter whether I like it, or do it or not.  Your bypassing a game mechanic, you are cheating.
---
“MMmmmnnnn It’s comin’ right for us!”
---
I have a level 30 Mirelurk King that will chase level 68 enemies around. I guess they're coded to run from scary swamp monsters. Also, what is the highest tame level you have came across? 30 is my highest. 
---
Muling is 100% an exploit.  Your using a game mechanic in an unintended way (essentially trading to yourself) to workaround having to deal with the intended mechanic of carry weight/storage.  The end result is infinite storage.  That's pretty much black and white an exploit.  Someone want to tell me having double, triple, or infinite more storage space than everyone else isn't a gameplay advantage?
---
It's funny seeing all these people who have been circlejerking how bad duping and exploiting are all of a sudden change their tune when it's benefiting them.  "It's not an exploit because I don't like carry weight!  Bethesda should never have designed the game this way, it's their fault!  I should be able to store every Legendary I find because it makes me feel sad not to!"
---
Ultracite isn't that hard to farm. (to me at least) It'd just putting it into a Minigun where you blow through batches in seconds isn't worth it. 
---
Players attacked another players base. This is how the game was designed. To allow players to attack other players and their bases. This is not a glitch or a bug. Bethesda put this in the game intentionally. How are you comparing that to duping. That doesn't even make sense.
---
One is, again, an intentional aspect of the game. The other is a game-breaking and literal server-breaking exploit.  
---
Without a server hop, respawn seem to take about 30 minutes.  I have a CAMP near Twin Lakes and the Behemoth re-spawns about that often.
---
Look at all the salty Bethesda employed downvoters suppressing honest problems. Sigh what has happened to this community 
---
The characters in this game are clearly meant to be independent of each other, there is no shared stash, there is no mechanic which easily allows you to pass items back and forth.  Using a character as a second stash is exploiting the game to increase your limited storage.
---
The cool thing is if your base gets destroyed, you just go to your camp module and fix everything in one click!
---
Ya I get it getting normal ammo is hard enough 
---
Yeah dude critically acclaimed titles back in the Xbox 360 days it's 2019. if you're saying the engines not the issue I guess we just disagree and maybe didn't play the same fallout 76
---
I know this is an old thread, but for anyone who is still looking Groves Family Cabin north of Tyler County Fairgrounds has quite a few planted as well:)
---
How do people get their second character on the same server at the same time? Wouldn't you have to have two PS4s or XBoxs? How are people doing that? 
---
I tamed a radtoad. 
---
On ps4 they save to your drive so even if you delete from fo76, pics are  still safe on ps4.

So, I was playing Falloot 76 the other dayyyyyyyy
---
I had a guy come investigate my shop. Came in and then wandered off. 20 seconds later he comes back and closes the door! Saint.
---
I did not know that. But I still don't receive any of the benefits like strength increase or carry weight increase when equipped. 
---
Guy. This is a game that allows PVP. Until they release PVE servers, this is going to happen regardless. It sucks, but at least it's not hard to rebuild, unlike Ark or Conan.
---
Maybe, maybe not, having a character with a ridiculously overloaded inventory may or may not affect server performance.  Im not a network engineer or a coder.

You are a gift 
---
Check the Agility tree for the White Knight perks. They reduce how fast armor breaks up to 90% and make it cheaper to repair. There is an intelligence perk (Armorer?) that increases durability armor gets repaired to.
---
That combo will greatly reduce the amount that you need to repair.
---
Pardon my ignorance but didn’t the last patch fix duping?  Emphasis on the ignorance part.   I’ve never duped. 
---
Geez dude chill nobody insulted your code of honor.
---
Honestly? There isn’t *much* you can do. However, I can promise you that most high-level players would reward you somewhat handsomely if they get downed and you stimpack them. Worst-case? You’ll get a friendly emote. Otherwise, we’re just happy to help you level up and keep you alive. It really isn’t a hassle. 
---
The biggest thing you can do to help is not get yourself killed by acting headstrong. 
---
If you decide to follow us around for XP; we simply ask that you don’t pick up world items we’re searching for in order to scrap them. May also be worth sending us a team invite. But, unless a higher level decides to specifically help you in *your* questing, remember that it’s the higher level’s rodeo. 
---
Thank you!!!!
---
Doesn't change the fact that it's the same engine, upgraded.
---
I'm surprised you called it fallout 76 and not Future Skyrim 2. 
---
They spawn for each player afaik. Me and a buddy as well gather from the same blooms. When I get home later I will try completing Heart of the swarm to see if its there otherwise try the dam again. Kind of hard to get a server with the season active to test that. 
---
Why should anyone else give a shit if someone else is storing stuff on another character, anyway? We're all running our own races. There's no eventual winner of Fallout 76. Bizarre. 
---
I don't understand how people come to the conclusion that artificially extending their limited stash by placing extra junk on a character isn't cheating the game.  You are completely bypassing a game mechanic by doing this, this is what an exploit is. 
---
Interesting! I would think more is better? Example:  10 lvl 50s doing minimal damage is better than 2 lvl 100s?
---
I had an experience relatable to this, took my gf to the giant excavator (Mt.Blair). She claimed it, and we were setting up missile turrets. Two level 52 players show up, and despite the fact I built four missile turrets around the claim spot as I saw them, claim it just to start pvp. I message them and there response was “should have said something sooner.” Smh, I’m level 178 and she’s 35, did you not see the amount of missile turrets? Did you ask or say anything about starting pvp? Nope, just saw a high level that needed to be attacked X.x
---
For me, it's the initial load screen and workshops. IF I can get into the game I'm fine unless I get close to a workshop, then I get stuck with 30 minute freezes.
---
My explosive .50 MG and my two shot gatling gun. That´s about it. I also stash my regular farming armor so i can grab more shit.
---
Yea I agree stash weight should be reduced. Just think it would be a cool feature to add that. Have that feeling when your walking down a lonesome road and you look on the horizon to see a caravan with just the good you need!
---
It’s a shame honestly. Sorry for the downvotes. You literally are spreading knowledge on how to help and you get downvoted. That’s just not right. 
---
They literally said it was about server stability.  
---
&gt;Stash Limit Increased: We know many of you have been asking for an adjustment to the Stash storage limit, and we’re happy to share that we’re increasing it from 400 to 600. While this is somewhat conservative, we plan to increase the storage cap further once we verify that this change will not negatively impact the stability of the game.  
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a0veqq/communication_moving_forward/  
---
So, yes, for a fact. Not that I believe them or think mules should be fair game. Mules are basically a fact of life for games that let you have multiple characters and have stash limits. Even for games that *don't* let you have multiple characters and specifically say not to create multiple accounts it happens.
---
Use the prime barrel and Just get duped ammo to go along with the gun.

Easiest way is to rebuy the serums which players are selling at around 100 caps at the moment, other than that, there is no way to remove just one serum. I'm having to do the same with herbivore :(

This would be nice. It would also be nice to be able to separate the grenade and power bash key bindings. Sometimes I'd try and throw a grenade while sneaking  only to yell out "HRAAAHHHH" followed by a haymaker to be swarmed a second or two afterwards.

I too launched a nuke by myself. Glad to know I wasn't the only one that had a difficult time with it heh. I did site Alpha. Took what seemed like an hour and a half (didn't actually think to keep track) moving through it slowly, as well as 1000+ 5.56 shots for my handmade. And a bunch of .308 from my hunting rifle and a level 45 fire axe I keep in my inventory as a sorta desperate measure. Congrats to you, that deff felt like a good challenge. And I myself made a promise to me, that I'd never do it again entirely solo haha.
---
Its funny because i have about a dozen or so tse weapons and people will claim i duped, but in reality i just have 450 hours played 😂
---
I’m pretty sure I encountered the same people last night. My boyfriend and his friend are very high level and we were on a team, but, I’m only level 47 and they were on the other side of the map while I was building my camp. Had it all set up the way I wanted it, I’m inside with the doors locked putting on the finishing touches, and BOOM. This asshole comes and destroys my ENTIRE camp with a one shot mini-gun. I was pissed! Boyfriend and his friend come and help me rebuild, assuming it’s just some asshole trying to up his wanted level, as soon as they leave he reappears and attempts to destroy it again. They come back, kill him, we take his shit. I moved my camp and stored everything, they left, he came right back. I fast travelled to my teammates because I was tired of him one-shotting me. My weapons were just no match for some dude who is literally floating around in the air. 
---
We saw the same guy at White Springs not long after with three other characters not long after, that he was obviously teammates with. I say obviously because they all seemed to have the same one shot explosive mini gun, they were all floating in mid-air, and they were all attacking anyone who dared to fast travel to White Springs or anywhere near the area. 
---
We spent the next few hours just getting in their way as much as possible. We also reported them because they were obviously using some kind of exploit and they were obviously duping themselves (we saw them doing it in White Spring) and they were griefing every other player they possible could. 
---

Do sales report and overall reception of the game mean nothing to you? You think bethesda will base their business decisions on a sub reddit? 
---
I too bought fallout 76, played until level 79 but that doesnt that this model is what the majority of gamers want.
---
I think there is a pacifist mode you can enable to stop them from hurting you.
---
Then why is it getting fixed again this patch
---
I love this game and community lol 
---
Then stop telling people they're wrong, when you have no idea.
---
Stims aren't needed when you regen your health like Frank Horrigan. 
---
As a duper I volunteer my services to help you and your love rebuild. 
---
Trying the dam now. 
---
Okay well I didn't see any upgrades that you mentioned when I played the game. I hope you know I do love the "elder scrolls" and fallout series. New Vegas is one of my favorite games of all time. I don't want them to suck, But that doesn't mean I'm blind to facts as it seems you are. Agree to disagree brother
---
Like the trailers that turn into little glass homes?  Agreed. 
---
I’m confused. I thought damage (to you as well as your armor) was drastically reduced until you shot back at aggressive players? 
---
Psn: Goblintactics
---
I'll try to be on around then.  Lvl 196 heavy build.
---
My highest has only been 26, which was my Mirelurk Hunter. Both my Sloth and Deathclaw were only Level 21! Also that's pretty funny and convenient. Don't even need a Turret in that case
---
I'll add it to the list! Thanks
---
We need beaded curtains.
---
I still play almost every day. I have 2 characters not in their 60s. My first time through I explored everything, hungry for every bit of lore, every environmental story, the teddy bears, ect. None of my friends play so I do everything solo. Now I have been everywhere and done everything, twice. I can't launch nukes on my own and I lag like crazy in nuke zones so what little end game there is I can't do. I mostly log on, do a bunch of events hoping for decent loot, never get any, do a bit of grinding and call it a day. I've gotten lots of stuff I'm sure others would like, but having to go outside the game to sell it is just asking too much for me. And with all the duping that's gone on since the start the economy is ruined anyway. I like this game, I really want to see it do well, but they have dug themselves a pretty deep hole and idk if they can get out of it in time. The next online game that can deliver on half of what 76 promised with suck up the player base and people will drift away.
---
To have both level 3 Animal Friend and Wasteland Whisperer, yes. However, if you had just one or the other, I am not sure. Let me know if you find out!
---
Cheese it boys!
---
I think we might have been fighting the same scorched queen
---
This has already been helpful a couple of times this morning. Thank you for all your hard work!
---
West Tek has a guaranteed legendary I think
---
Yeah but thats you and me who bought the game as soon as it came bc we're fans.
---
Op is clearly indecisive so it would be much to redirect him to reviews and streams first so he decides if its worth is money or not.
---
God damn. Its like the Rwandan Genocide but instead of accusing people of being Tutsis its accusations of being dupers.
---
If you want to give a gift to a high level maybe some Whisky, X-Cell, Stealthboy, maybe some Military Ammo Pouch or Ballistic Fiber would be a nice gift.
---
There are 4 power armor spawns in watoga. Fusions cores shouldn't be an issue. 1 on the roof of the civic center, next to a vertibird (use the fire escape on the side of the building, then hang a left to cross to another roof). 1 inside the civic center, in the main room, to the right in a corner. 1 at the municipal building behind a level 3 lock pick door. And 1 next to another vertibird in the street, near the center of watoga. Takes about 5 minutes to check them all. Easy to farm all max level power armors too.
---
I have been known to burn fools, yes
---
Easily the best thing you can do, is not send seven team invites and three messages when clearly being ignored, i am level 270 so people come out of the wood work to ask me for free shit or to try and help them, when in reality im just trying to grind exp or legendaries
---
If its the ps4 your on give me names. i hate players like this wether someones a duper or not doesnt give them a right to be an asshole, let bethdesda deal with dupers.
---
I'll get the gang an we'll hunt them down give em a taste of their own medicine. Wanted or not ill lose a couple of hundred caps no problem in destroying their entire base. Lmao 
---
Nah seriously i hope this hasn't put you or your gf off playing the game. Most people are actually kind inside FO76.
---
We ran into these same people last night! 
---
I'll be honest I can and have solod the queen... It's not awfully hard with the right build and weaponry. It's not hard to make money in this game, but yes if you don't have legendary weapons I can see why you don't stand a chance in hell.
---
doesnt everyone solo it since its super easy? takes less than 20 to 30 mins get through the launch
---
I’d rather it just be me and my friends, I wouldn’t want the queens health bar going any higher than it has to. 
---
Have you been into the military bunker at white springs yet? That's where I thought you got that quest. If it's not youtube the quest name and find a walkthrough i suppose
---
So i thought as well - however this level 150 guy was hitting me and it was taking 15+ hp every hit... and I'm on Pacifist Mode. 
---
I didn't really have a specific target in mind. I just wanted to launch a nuke so I could say I did it. The Whitesprings Resort was already nuked by a group earlier and I wasn't nuking Fissure Site Prime because I'm not THAT stupid, so I just launched it at a random person on the map. The location was near the Mire/Cranberry Bog border (mostly in the Mire)
---
I have that turned on. 
---
as if someone that just wanted extra stash space for duped items would be going through the trouble of building a nice camp.
---
Sounds like a fun build around so I'll throw my name into the ring 
---
that works ? did you just wire it to that none working on / off switch ? and another wire from the on / off directly to a power conductor ?
---
Could not get that to work :/
---
Just got and get another key. Search reddit for the codes before u go down or Solve them urself.. 
---
Just use a blackwater rad arch. You have most mutations already right?  Math is on your side now.  Hop in for just a second to remove one.  If it’s a good one, hop outside and mutate it back. Rinse and repeat until you’ve sniped the ones you don’t want. Push comes to shove and you are missing a good one but have sniped all the bad ones away, just buy the straggler on the market.  I’ve got Bird Bones if you’re on PS4. 
---
pacifist mode only prevents you from hurting others last time i played
---
Are you on console?
---
We had three nukes land on us because they thought we were dupers, i lost well over 500 screws. We all know it takes hours getting to that level of screws.
---
Very nice
---
I didn't realize it did this! this makes the guys who grind out the 100 keys or so to a new level...
---
Vigilantism is a shitty excuse for leveling bases because you think you're "helping." Essentially, they are griefing. Their saying they did it due to suspected duping is probably just saving face because they simply enjoy griefing. I've had Raiders level my base and they were full-on roleplaying Raiders. At least be creative if you want to be a shit. Either way, this is obviously a conflict of playstyles that would be resolved ultimately by Bethesda releasing private servers or separation between instances for those that want PvE vs PvP.
---
since more than one of the same plan technically has no value to you (unless you intend to resell or trade it) can we default the quantity of plans to 1, no matter how many the vendor has on them?
---
signed, guy who bought three bearskin rug plans accidentally. 
---
Exactly those! Theyd be so much easier to place and put stuff inside, tents are borderline impossible because the geometry doesnt play well, the large tent is the only usable one, it's frustrating to put stuff inside the small one or put anything on the ceiling because of how the collision of it basically doesnt let it mesh to the ceiling
---
I don't PvP much. I get killed more often than not. I've had my camp shot up by bounty hunters after my friend paired up with PvPers who had bounties. But you're dead wrong here.
---
If the mechanics of the game allow it, and they're not using exploits to achieve it, they are indeed playing the game as intended.
---
You may not like what they're doing, but PvP is part of the game and the current iteration of it allows for this.
---
It's not very sporting, but it's also not against the rules.
---
Corpse-camping her would have been, but there's an easy escape for that: server-hop.
---
Honestly, I do not understand why some folks expect the post-apocalyptic landscape to be populated entirely by butterflies and unicorns...  That's never been what Fallout is, and it never will be. The PvP system is a nice balance between letting players be as evil as a raider and not allowing those players to run most newbies out of the game forever.
---
They just wanted to destroy a camp. They lied.
---
THANK YOU! I knew I wasn’t crazy and the only one having this issue
---
The bit here you said is absolutly true.  Other mmos have emergency downtimes, emergency patching if anything remotely like this popped up.  I've been playing since release of Anarchy Online and Dark Ages of Camelot and even they, twenty years ago, would take servers down instantly if there was such a game breaking action that threatened to entirely ruin the economy and playing experience of every server.
---
You can't nuke those, they're in the protected area
---
Here is my particular solution. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/UEYkVAV.png
---
Right. This is my understanding as well. But I thought people attacking me are supposed to do very very minor damage... They guys that would hit me were taking quite a bit of health - guys that I haven't even seen before - and it felt as though - I had to of hit them for them to do this kind of damage, unless there's a bug or something happening... 
---
Like I said tho - I have Pacifist turned on. 
---
&gt; you risk being banned yourself if they ever figure out a way to identify these individuals and duped items. You will likely be identified as a mule account.
---
If that's possible it'll explain why they're having so many issues in the first place, because that'd mean they create unique IDs for every item and store way too much info for each.
---
Yeah you need Calibrated Shocks to increase your total weight. If your Armor has pocket mods and you are STR capped, you will have less total carry weight in standard modded X-01.
---
It sounds to me like there’s not a whole lot you can do other than just avoid the areas that level 100+ characters typically populate. 
---
oof
---
You can buy key as well if you ask for them
---
signed, guy who bought three bearskin rug plans accidentally.
---
Oooppss :)
---
Once after claiming a workshop I picked up the deposit first, and then I couldn't place the extractor until it respawned
---
Dammit where do I get calibrated shocks?
---
Your pocketed armor doesn’t count when you get in your power armor so you lose the extra carry weight 
---
(Shrug)
---
Suit yourself. I really appreciate your virtue here of not falling into the trap f pretending to be virtuous. You are a great example for us all. 
---
Yeah - figured this was the case. 
---
LOL
---
First Cargobot was empty, second was out of bounds, third got me crash before killing it. Fourth time the charm, I guess...
---
I stumbled upon someone’s camp the other day just in time to see a pack of mongrels destroy the front door to get inside to attack the turret that was pointed the wrong way to protect itself. I killed the pack, but was sad that I couldn’t repair the door while I was there.
---
Yeah I’m hoboing out of a tent too and it’s painful man.  I also love finding places where there’s an unnamed structure but I can still place camp.  There’s a mini farm like that in the mountains and I been living off some dead guys corn. 
---
This is why witch hunts are supposed to be forbidden on reddit, and why the moderators of this sub have failed.
---
Sounds like a interesting idea. Except ya know the typical online players it would probably be dead more then it's alive cause that's how things go. 
---
No. Very high chance, but i had some runs without 1.
---
But there could be also up to 4 inside. Definetly a good place to go. 
---
&gt;How do people get their second character on the same server at the same time? Wouldn't you have to have two PS4s or XBoxs? How are people doing that? 
---
Create a team with at least 1 other person. Stash your stuff in a suitcase or give it to them. Log off. Log in with your mule. Collect stuff. Profit?
---
Before I realised it didn't just use AP, I had burned through over 20 cores in less than an hour, so if you want to use them, without power user, this'll do it :-)
---
Yeah i sold it.
---
&gt; Vigilantism is a shitty excuse for leveling bases because you think you're "helping." 
---
I'm not arguing that. I'm just saying that shit is nowhere close to duping.
---
its been tested and documented non PA vs PA doesnt much stand a chance even with full leveled perks
---
They don't. You give the stuff to a friend, log in with your alt, get stuff from friend, log back into your main and continue playing
---
Enclave Military Wing Vendor, it's a rare mod, like Jetpack too.
---
Idk I disagree, I think the player base will stay. The way it's set up, it's not a demanding online title. It doesn't command alot of my time and that's what I love. I feel like most of the core fallout player base was a bit skeptical at first because of the online notion, but realized that playing with others isn't crammed down your gullet like other games. Destiny1 and 2 on the other hand, felt like a damn part time job. Let's not forget you had to go outside of the game to set up raids and anything of substance. I'm confident that future updates will bring QoL fixes that really make the game shine. 
---
There’s a place in Watoga that’s basically a 50 guaranteed Power Armor mod spawn. I’ve never seen X-01 stuff there, though, but might be worth checking out f you’re higher level (even though it’s world space)
---
What's your build, please? I'm working on an agility/luck pistol build but I'm still level 10 with that character. 
---
excellenté
---
Not long all. Fuck the TLDR
---
I'm having the same issue as OP after spam-digging about 20 treasure maps in cranberry bog. I had a shitload of maps at level 126 since I would farm whitespring nonstop and never used any maps. Never duped a thing. 
---
It seems to have been patched, but for a long time the glowing wendigo that spawned in the whitespring golf club during nuke zones would drop a HUGE list of random stuff, which was probably a bug since I haven't seen it happen it a while, but I used to pick up 4-7 copies of the same map off that wendigo, and sometimes for 2-3 different maps too. 
---
Weird thing is I had like 30+ of a toxic valley map that I also spam-digged and nothing happened. I disconnected from the server during the 20ish cranberry maps, and when I logged back in I had this bug. That was 3 weeks ago, I've since been playing on my other characters but he was my only character over level 50.
---
Yeah the ones that spawn in town east? of the airport are nice. In my mind if love to place a nuke so the airport is clear but those spawns keep spamming ghouls. 
---
Watoga station for handmade and Welch station for lever action. About 600 caps each
---
Silly kid, I'm not wrong.  The reason why they limited stash space is irrelevant.  All that matters is, they limited it and people who are using mules are bypassing that limit.  That is an exploit, there is no argument you can make against that.  I honestly don't care if you cheat, play however you want but don't say you aren't cheating just because your form of exploiting is more socially acceptable than other forms may be.
---
Yeah I just went back and spoke to modus by the quest didn’t complete. I’ll just watch a YouTube video. :-)
---
Class freak 3 and hard mentality has no downside while solo. If you are a mutant you NEED class freak or you are majorly weakening yourself, the more mutations you have the stronger class freak is
---
But launching a nuke, that's not the hard part. It's ~~letting go~~ not crashing afterwards.
---
That’s true for ballistic ammo but energy weapons seem to mostly use normal ammo (ultracite Gatling uses fusion cores for example). You can check on the weapon info.
---
Ultracite weapons also seem to have higher damage vs. everything as well as extra damage on top of that vs. scorched. But don’t quote me on that. 
---
I think good legendary versions of ultracite energy weapons will be very valuable once energy weapons are balanced. 
---
Have your power armor or hazmat suit. Put yourself in pacifist mode. Make sure everyone gets a shot in on legendaries before you kill them, as all it takes is one shot to get in on the legendary loot. Basically dont be a dick.
---
Your vernacular does not validate the vile vestiges of vermin who vaporise the valiant ventures of virtuous vault dwellers. V
---
As if molerats would be stopped by doors. Those fuckers *teleport*.
---
Darn have a TSE Gatling gun?
---
Since the very first announcement of the game?
---
Enlighten me. What does the sales report say?
---
I use that. I just wanted to make it perfect without herbivore, empath, egg head, and herd mentality.
---
Don't worry son, I know who they are, and where they are from.  I will use my particular set of skills to find them and kill them.
---
Love Dad
---
Everyone has a Two Shot Explosive gun, they will instantly kill you when you enter PVP with them.
---
What do you play on? I'll take those cores off your hands if you're on PS4?
---
You're welcome!
---
I wish we knew more about BSG's dev process, but yeah, I keep imagining this imaginary designer slamming their head against their desk because they've been denied the time and/or resources to finish the plan system before it ships.
---
I am seeing the same thing. I am really enjoying the game but, I'm so sick is getting kicked out. Only another month until Metro Exodus and I can leave this steaming pile of shit. Hopefully they'll get it all fixed and I can come back to it.
---
Yeah, good place for exp farming, steel and gunpowder 
---
that's alright, thanks though
---
Yeah sadly it’s a drastic reduction but they can still kill you after repeated attacks. Unfortunately a lot of these guys are bored cause they fast played and maxed out and now have nothing to do but torment others. Just shows what kind of people they are in RL...sad.
---
LoL
---
r/Fallout is that way friendo 
---
This might be useful after all the duped items are gone.
---
Which is why they are probably trying to bait me. 
---
I have a 2 shot lever action rifle, but I'm just tired of healing / repairing my junk - but maybe that's just the nature of the game :P I just thought if I didn't attack them - it would be much lower in damage... Didn't know they could do that much damage to me or my gear. 
---
Traveling to the party member or friend is free.
---
Concerning scrappable legendaries, it will lead to a series of unintentional scrapping. I sometimes scrap my power armor parts: there definetly should be “do not scrap” setting for certain selected items.
---
I got tired of asking people if they were raised in a barn so I just made my camp a barn. Now it doesn't matter if they close the doors. It's all good either way. 
---
This is true. 
---
But *prime* Ultracite laser weapons use different ammo. In this case Ultracite Fusion Cores.
---
Same here.  Every door in the house open?  I had guests!
---
This entire post is complete bullshit.  
---
If herbivore is the only one you dont like you can just keep removing and adding 1 mutation back in hopes of carnivore.
---
uhh you are wrong
---
combat friend
---
You could also go the other direction.  Jeckel and Hyde.  Just stock up and take mutation serums for the one you hate every hour to suppress it. Lol 
---
Lol got it from a line in the sand, was just going through defiance for straight jackets to sell
---
Hey if you pick up and place your camp back down in the same spot the placed down blueprints are all repaired. It costs some caps but no junk at all.
---
But there is some cross over. As the videos I have seen require a forced DC and then the items are duplicated. 
---
So yes, there is some form of 'rollback' otherwise the servers would not give the player their duped items back. 
---
My mules are the vendors i sell it to.
---
Somebody said they did it with only one of the cards at 3. And I guess 3 Charisma. Maybe someone could test that.
---
If you use class freak there is 0 downside to herd mentality, so it doesnt make sense to get rid of it.
---
In a group? +2 specials. Solo? You dont lose any because of class freak 3. All good no bad. Why wouldnt you want that?
---
Yup - which is how I feel. It happens mostly at the Golf Course. They are 150+ level and they just want to feel big and make a 'noob' go away, because I didn't waste tons of hours right away leveling to the top. Just annoying! Ha!
---
Nope, PC. 
---
Roger that! Thx!
---
whist i could give you several up votes, lol
---
This will be very useful, the terminal solution i use is nice, but not fast, so will test this when i get online tonight, thanks :)
---
Maybe being expose to the air and fire there. Thanks will try it
---
I open up all windows, all doors, and turn off every light I find.
---
I’m an agent of chaos.
---
Bring lots of Radaway 
---
Thanks! Request sent :)
---
Good. Sounds like they didn't nerf it that bad then.
---
I have all Xbox functions in windows turned off and didn't have OBS running.
---
I need to pay them a visit!
---
In the stats I notice that empath and herd mentality dont have the downside effects lowered
---
If you are on PC I will come in and help you guys. Hell I will even get some plans so she has more options when building. 
---
Wow didn't know the health bar increased based on how many people participated. Thanks for the tip!
---
Containers are fine as the contents respawn just for you.
---
If someone has already hoovered up the placed items in the cell respawn period (anyone know what that is ?)  you gotta server hop to find them. Lead in gyms is the first to go. 
---
As much as this is a dick thing to do, they shouldn't be banned. Destroying player camps is part of the game, theres even a special perk dedicated to doing more building damage.
---
In the video o watched the quest just completes after the 10th commendation you don’t need to go back 
---
95% hit chance is actually 50% hitchance.
---
It's worked this way since the original Fallout.
---
That's not how natural selection works. Briefly: Natural selection is the process by which those organisms which are best adapted to their ecological niche pass on their traits to the next generation at a more favorable rate than those organisms who are less well adapted.
---
You cannot "kill" natural selection any more than you can kill gravity. It's true that a lot of people exist today who wouldn't have survived 200 years ago thanks to advances in medicine, infrastructure, and policy, but that does not mean our species isn't still subject to natural selection.
---
Natural selection isn't dead, we just changed our ecological niche so drastically that the factors which are being selected for have shifted from "who is most fit to survive against the elements" to "who can get the most followers, likes, and subscribers."
---
This sort of thing was common before the duping witchhunt.
---
It was just plain old griefing then. Now it's even more toxic, its self righteous griefing.
---
Server hop.. it will update your count and continue forward 
---
Thank you so much. Bookmarking this and is kinda disappointed there is no mothman poster that I can get. :(
---
I think peeps are taking advantage of this fact alone and just being mean. Using excuse that oh their duping but wow Christmas still was only two weeks ago alot family had to wait a min cuz of a tight year. Start this year different don't be a Soggy Nugget, BbQ doesn't cover up your shmit
---
Ah.. 10% budget. That must be why the tame option doesn’t show back anymore
---
My little church I built never gets any visitors to even leave the doors open.
---
K but look at your SPECIAL totals in the pipboy, they arent reduced solo.
---
EMPATH on the other hand is terrible and doesnt work with class freak so you always take more damage. 
---
I hope I win
---
Ahh ok, that answers some questions actually 
---
There are scorched versions of every available pet, level 50 scorched mirelurk king, level 76 yao guai. Level 91 scorched deathclaw etc
---
However when you relog they drop down to their "normal" levels (level 21 death law etc)
---
What about cats, wolves, or foxes? I've seen a random spawn of two black cats near Beckham farms or whatever that farm is north of vault 76. Do they HAVE to be alone? Has anyone seen any of these animals spawn alone?
---
100% agree! Class freak negates the downsides so much you don’t notice it. Herd mentality has such a misunderstood position among the serums. Only one if stay away from personally is empath. 
---
I only have one character so I'm new to using alts as mules in this game. How is the stuff transferred? I may do this now if it's not too difficult. Only level 20 something, but I need more room for all the cosmetic outfits I will never wear. 
---
ok got it, I wasnt sure if that was just a visual bug, so now I just gotta get rid of egghead
---
I am a level 88 and i remember i was at whitesprings, killing ghouls and suddenly another player that was level 68 or something   shot me.  First i thought he did by accident but he did it again and again. So i decided to shoot back and killed him. And before i knew i was killed by something.  I respawned and returned to the place i died and i saw the same person. Shooting again at me so i fired back and suddenly another person showed up level 114 and killed me instantly. I respawned and went there again the lower level dude started shooting me but i refused to shoot back, because i realised that the lower level  person is trying to provoke me and if i shoot back   the higher level player  can kill me and take my caps. Since then i run in pacifist mode. 
---
Exasperated, not insulted. Idgaf about the downvotes as I’m used to having my outbursts misinterpreted. No offense intended or taken. 
---
Put 100 barriers surrounding the workshop bench lol they have to destroy them all to claim it from you and snipe them chameleon style
---
Thanks 🙏 
---
My under armour stays on for some reason... didn't used to, but they no longer unequip when I jump in (don't get the bonus stats but at least it doesn't add to my carry weight).
---
Delete what?
---
Incoming!
---
This is true but i would gladly make that trade for my own Moo-Moo
---
I'm not blind to anything, and you gave opinion, not facts. If you think the game sucks that's your opinion. I'd say the majority of people in this sub are enjoying the game and the experience, playing with others or solo, etc.
---
76 sold less than Red Dead 2, BLOPS 4 and BF V in November, but was still in the top 5. So not performing as well as we all hoped? Yes. But I'd hardly say that it's failing. That's some serious competition to go against as well, pretty much anything will get outshadowed by those. They've put out a few patches since release, and the game is much more stable than it was at release. I don't think it sucks, I think it just needs some polish. Then again, I'm somewhat of an optimist and I'm pretty hopeful that they can right the wrongs.
---
... Also I liked 3 more than NV, so I guess we were just destined to be mortal enemies until the end of time. 
---
You may have hit the zone at the end of it's "nuked" state. Bring a Hazmat Suit with you to be safe! :)
---
If you think that's bad, try to figure out how the Valley Galleria interior layout could possibly exist, considering the exterior layout.
---
I need to pay more attention to CAMP perks, my intelligence is mostly armor and gun cards, so I didn't even notice the contractor card. 
---
have an up for that ;)
---
I probably had around that amount of time, and I found only one explosive weapon. It did fit my build, though. Never saw a two-shot gun.
---
Instigating Grognak Axe (double damage to targets with full health)
---
Materials to repair Instigating Grognak Axe
---
Remove perk cards that buff melee damage so I don't one hit kill everything
---
If Cranberry Bog, also bring my 2 shot missile launcher with targeting computer for when SBQ is in the air.
---
Except people have figured out how to steal from you using the trade interface. 
---
I noticed something also, though I could be wrong and maybe it was just a delay, but when the corpse of the person was inside the circle it prevented the the timer thingy from progressing. And when they respawned then it started again. But maybe that was just a normal delay.
---
Oh I'd probably enjoy owning one as well. Not sure I'd like having to revive the thing all the time though as I all to well know how alot of online gamers are. Granted this game hasn't seemed to be too bad for the most part. 
---
Perhaps not. But to new players trying to find their way, it's just as bad to them to mask your intentions under false pretenses.
---
Spoiled fruit.
---
Right but at their level of scientific development, they would know it’s bad. there was a point in time when we didn’t know, but now we do. I love that I get lead for ammo from children’s wooden blocks from the paint. Lol
---
My friends and I have tamed loads of pets
---
1) you dont need WW and you cant use only WW. Only animal friend is relevant
---
2)most pets stay red health barred and will be hostile to anything, wasnt just your sloth
---
3) not only do red bar pets attack people and non hostile npc. They are tied to your turrets so when your pet sees something it wants to attack, your turrets start shooting it also.
---
4) their level is deceptive and does not seem (accurate). The level 21 deathclaw can solo multiple level 60 enemies and the level 16 yao guai gets bodied by mole rats
---
Damn you online services and vile "always green" update policies.
---
Yeah, its almost as if i'm asking for there to be consequences for people trying to cheat and hack the system in a multiplayer game. This wasn't simple shit, people went out of their way to be nefarious.
---
I played fallout 3 on ps3, so no mods. I enjoyed the mods i could do on ps4 for fo4 though.
---
I’m still stumbling my way through this game. I hardly ever see other people on it (Xbox one). 
---
It’s still fun. Just once I get mobbed by ghouls or scorched I usually have a bad time. 
---
I shared this on Twitter on Friday, was wanting to contact you! Glad to find you here on Reddit. Been trying to find the Locker, Metal Picnic Table, and Dresser plans! And maybe a few more.

I've done some work with Fallout 76's database here: [http://www.FalloutSearch.com/items/](http://www.FalloutSearch.com/items/)
---
If you need any help pulling data from the game, just let me know.
---
A user named KriHavok has been posting the Atomic Shop items on the official forums. I wish I'd been keeping better track of them from the beginning myself, although I do have many of them. He doesn't understand that when the timer says 1 Day, it is really 2 Days, so always add 1 Day to whatever he's written. [https://bethesda.net/community/topic/312777/atomic-shop-updates-12th-january-2019](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/312777/atomic-shop-updates-12th-january-2019)
---
I have had the radiation stop when I was down to 20% health left and it stay there 
---
95%is maximum chance but still no guarantee.. try timing your shots better if you keep missing lol
---
They're lame. Personally, I hope "fixing legendary effects" Beth mentioned on Inside the Vault is alluding to removing the affix entirely. 
---
Don't try to fight hordes of ghouls by yourself if you're wearing a hazmat or you'll die very quickly
---
After I did that trick I loaded a different number of ammo to shoot. Started with 1. Then up to 5. It will shoot as many as you load. I didn't go above 5 though. Then put it away and pulled out my Grognak.. Lol
---
This does for me as well. Thanks guys!
---
Ahh that may have been it. It may have been registering as autopistol, and i dont have any Guerilla yet to check.
---
Pump action shotgun and my sledgehammer!
---
That wold help with power armor frames too. 
---
To some degree they do. Not because they are there but simply because they deal just an insane amount of damage for little to no effort once you have it.   
---
Getting it is of course a complete different story. At least if you try to get it fair and square. Either through buying it after grinding your ass off or having the luck to get one.  
---
I do want one myself. But merely because i too want to be able to finally kill bosses properly, once they scale out of the norm when lvl 20s or so join the SBQ event.   
---
But aside from that? It is annoying. Especially if you get griefed. You have next to no chance if you are new in the game, even if you have proper armor. (There are ways to deal with TSE weapon users.)
---
I completely agree with you.  I have a bunch of tse weapons I've bought, but they make regular gameplay way to easy.  I only really bring them out if I'm doing a queen fight or fighting off an annoying scorchbeast that I didnt mean to fight.
---
This problem is often reported and stated. The mechanics seem off. I don't take over workshops myself so haven't experienced this myself.
---
I didn’t know bird bones can be used in combination with PA
---
Really? You're gonna tell these tales and NOT also tell us where your CAMP is set up? C'mon dude!
---
Can confirm. Speed demon user here and no perks or armour mods make me run any faster. I have emergency protocol and dead man sprinting but neither seem to do anything in all of my testing
---
Powerarmor,  lots of stinpacks,  and loads of ammo, beware you will face a shitload of robots and  Watch out for the assaultrons.  I launched my first nuke on my own when  i was lvl 75. 
---
First and foremost, im NOT hating on the game. I bought it day one. 70€. Im level 79.
---
Bethesda will base their business decisions not on a sub reddit, but on actual sales reports, mtx income and overall reception throughout the internet and retailers.
---
You think fallout 76 look good from this perspective? Of course not. The fact that the game is on sale for less than half the price 3 months upon release shows how unsucessful it was.
---
Why is it ridiculous? Its basic consumer/company behavior. They release a bad product, you dont support it. Simple and effective.
---
By supportings lootboxes, mtx and whatnot see how companies got greedy. What makes you think bethesda, fallout 76 turned out sucessful, wouldnt adopt the same business model.
---
I think you're aware of all the fuck ups since the beta until now. From beta being reserved to very specific time periods, to the canvas bag, the 500 atoms, the bugs, patches that are solving issues that shouldnt be there to begin with, data leaks, the rum... should I continue?
---
Learning from our mistakes... cmon you're talking about one of the top game producers in the world! The producers of probably the most important game ever, Skyrim. Its not a start up, its millionaire corporation. The level of mistakes revolving fallout 76 is unacceptable. 
---
A company known for releasing buggy games, upon releasing such a divise title they should have been much more competent.
---
Im sorry but im not supporting the release of unfinished work in progress games that cost full price. And far as I can see, no one should. 
---
I have given suggestions and help other players countless times. Im actually doing my share of bringing this game to a decent experience. Speaking of which, my character is dying of thirst and radiation,  apparently some dumb ghoul wants to ask directions to the golf course.
---
Cheers
---
I'm level 121 and yet to find a proper LMG for my heavy weapons build. Only explosive weapons I have is a revolver that I basically use as my sniper and my 40mm auto grenade launcher that ignores 50% armor. My current 50 cal only does more damage per hit but that doesn't even seem to do much of a difference lol.
---
Getting this gun would be very nice. If not oh well haha
---
Yup. Bait. - that's why I run it also. 
---
She's had enough shit with players and their 1-shot legendary weapons 
---
she basically like 'fuck this shit im outties'
---
Dumbass analogies... I can't trade with anyone for anything because of the bullshit duping.  Everything has been duped to hell and back.
---
Now I can't sell or buy from any player as everything has a dupe risk or the price of every item is undermined by duping.  This leaves me with zero interest at any player interaction save a very small group of friends.
---
I can't bother to try and kill the SBQ anymore.  Why?  I drop the damn nuke and she is dead by the time I get my first magazine into her.  Guess what?  I didn't do enough damage because some assclown can dupe 15000 magazones and bobbleheads and one shot the game.
---
Every place I can farm legendaries, I can't.  Some douchenugget with a TSE Quad Doublebarrel is oneshotting the entirety of the clubhouse or saturating the game with fps eating shotshell at uranium fever or watoga.  I get no loot.  By the time I spray a single blast of my tesla or lob a molotov, everything is dead and I get nothing.
---
I swap servers and find this everywhere... Level 15's with TSE shotuns nearly crashing the game with pellet spam at the golf course ffs.
---
'Doesn't affect you' is ignorant bullshit.
---
Nah, that sounds like some dickheads for sure. That’s why you have to stay chameleon with binoculars to observe. If you see a paper bag or a storage container, you only do enough to get in and out. No need to level the base as it’s too risky to have them wreck you, get their items back, AND get caps from you in the process.
---
i've stopped bothering with locations that are constantly farmed, made my own route
---
Coming
---
On a handful of occasions I've gotten zero rads while in PA (and having very few rads). While I didn't play around with exiting the PA, I did start getting rads again two times after I died vs the queen and respawned. So at least in my case it was a glitch. 
---
I prefer big butt plugs myself. 
---
I can say no to that because once it happened I stuck by the edge to find out if it would end after radx wore off. Then I went around testing the limits by attacking glowing ones. Almost died had to use a steathboy to escape then i snipped from a Bush lol. After what felt like 20 mins the sky cleared up and the ring went away. Plus I watched the nuke drop from the train station
---
Thanks for the point about the perk, that's really useful!
---
The magazine Backwoodsman 9 also gives "-50% Workshop Repair Cost" but I haven't had occasion to test whether/how it stacks with the Contractor perk. I have a couple that I keep in my stash just in case.
---
Batting 1000 so far, I made a newb and tried to live as a civvy in harpers ferry starting at level 7. My base has been wrecked a few times but I stay supplied with ammo and better armor than I can scrounge using my main to source materials and craft then dropping them either by the still near 76 or harpers itself.
---
It probably helps I’m not dropping hundreds of thousands of pounds of gear like a duper, just some steel, wood, screws, and a gun or 3.
---
Yeah maybe make them have like crazy amount of health or fast health regen so it can't be killed so easily? And it could act the same as a regular stash box that way others could store there stuff too if passing by.
---
I noticed this weekend that griefing is now a thing since the bobblehead exploit became public. It doesn't take too many griefers to just ruin the whole game. 
---
I'm kind of done with the game for now since my camp got leveled - it's like they target the people who spend a lot of time putting together a nice camp. And while it's easy to fix, it's discouraging. I was able to kill them all, but given that a friend of mine in our team was killed with slap damage somehow before we engaged in PVP, I think they may have thought they were invincible.
---
Anyway, I'm hoping Bethesda fixes this quickly. They need to do a couple of things -- get rid of the bobblehead/magazine stacking, and get some online-support to whom people can report dupers to and have it taken care of immediately.
---
The plus side is, I've met amazing people playing this game. There is an awesome community here. I think the game still can be great, but Bethesda really needs to get some outside consultation on how to run an on-line game because they're doing a poor job at the moment.
---
Gun-fu + Crit Savvy + 4 Leaf Clover + my Mutations and other Perks = Me rp'ing as a female Chow Yun-Fat through the Golf Course :D. 
---
That would appeal to 0.00001% of players (Griefers).  I can see why Bethesda would prioritise this over increasing stash limits. They want the rest of us to leave willingly so they only have to run one server for their failed game. I'm onto their tactic. LOL.
---
You mean because the new Fireproof makes the explosive part useless? Yeah.. I'd probably want to trade for something else too.
---
This is helpful, thanks.
---
Number one rule to PVP.  Don't die.  If you follow the number one rule everything else is easy :-)  PVP is rough but I would say try and find a group of fellow like minded folks and dive deep into it together.
---
What the fuck do they do in combat? I've fought 2 so far and all they do is run away and hide in their own farts.
---
Yeah i swear when i get like lvl 150 i am gonna start a faction and hunt those shitheads. 
---
I personally never use them, I like two shot weapons though, just like fallout 4. I think the explosive legendary effect should be a main effect, rather than a major. That way you either have a two shot or an explosive. Not quite sure why they didnt make it that way.
---
I'd settle for a lockable foot-locker with a separate small stash for stuff like this. 
---
I have to agree. The more I play the game the more I am coming to believe that the game would just be better if all legendary effects were removed. Obviously the damage to the Scorch Queen would need to be re scaled, However I think this would probably take care of most of the duping issues, the trolling issues, as well as make crafting guns and armor actually viable. 
---
At this point there is no reason to have anything less than 2 Shot explosive plus sentinel armor. These legendary effects have in essence killed any use or value any other items had. 
---
Oh I agree, I'm sure in 3 to 6 months with constant work this could be a really good game. I don't think being an online game was ever too much of an issue, gameplay wise the issue was mostly that they didn't learn from fallout 4. 76, being a fallout game, looks like an online RPG at first, but its not. Role playing requires the ability to make choices and you don't have any to make in 76, which hurts its replay ability. The only real choice you have is how you want to kill stuff. This is really just a looter shooter with some survival mechanics tacked on. The lack of NPCs also gives the game an empty feeling, and since you can't even talk to other players they might as well be ghosts. I occasionally see other players when I do events and will wave or give them a thumbs up, most of the time they don't respond and half the time they don't let me tag the legendary before they kill it. I'm interested in seeing what the vaults will be like and if I can even do them. 
---
Yeah hopefully this is how factions work and are intended for. I'd join!
---
Yeah, I havent found an unattended one yet
---
Correct :)
---
Open warfare would be ideal because if someone takes my shit it gives me a chance to get it back.
---
I know I have the same issues with water. I have unyeilding armor plus certian perks. When I carry to much I go into water which raises my strength into the 20s. But I have to move around the water because standing still the rads will stop after awhile
---
unless your of a build that wants the rads.
---
Let's team up! Psn: heymichaelray
---
There isn't a point, but every time I see these posts I make sure OP knows about this bug, and bulk not saving weight. Since the first days of the beta people think bulking junk saves weight, which it seems like it should. 
---
I see. Thanks. 
---
I don’t think you should have to pay to repair camp items destroyed by players.  It’s just griefing.
---
Where abouts did you build this ?
---
Yea, that wasnt what i was saying. Missing out on limited skins is one thing, but lets say an Elevator, which was a DLC asset in the past, gets added to the atom shop for one day. To me, thats not the type of item that should be that exclusive. 
---
Having something like an elevator adds functionality, having Hot Rodder paint on your PA just looks cool. 
---
That's life in the wasteland. Asshole raiders gonna fuck shit up.
---
Yeah, I always turn on pacifist mode. Sorry to here others dont
---
Im on xbox1 and meet people all the time, but I seek them out when close and leave gifts
---
An easier to find then grahm 
---
It means you've opted out of PVP, so players shouldn't be able to negatively effect you.
---
I’m a heavy weapons user, this sounds amazing
---
Funny how all high level players I've seen in nuked Whitesrping always have a TSE weapon of some sort while they rush around killing everything before anyone else land a hit
---
Advantage of being level 150 rather than 50:
---
At level 150 you have enough perk cards unlocked to set up your character 137 different ways. Shotgun cards, rifle cards, quality of life cards, crafting cards, etc. So a level 150 account may theoretically be able to do all the things that a handful of separate level 50 accounts can. Not all at once, but it can be set up that way.  
---
I like to repair turrets, extractors and food if I pass a camp. they're always being eaten by critters it seems.
---
Yeah that's annoying as hell when people don't...
---
Umm yeah the game is glitchy. I need rad away. Once i get more I will try again. I hope it isnt a glitch
---
Maybe people are just misinterpreting statistics. 95% means that there is a 1/20 chance you'll miss a shot. Most likely, you'll hit, but that doesn't mean it's inevitable. 
---
I’m pretty sure the “half your level thing” isn’t true because I tamed a level 91 scorched deathclaw when I was level 98 (however it did seem a bit glitches)
---
No it doesn't. Try again. This time look up a dictionary.
---
I haven't, but I think I have all the recipes. I don't bother picking them up any more.
---
Well, we're not all like that. I'm lvl 108 and I won't use explosive rounds around places I know folks are farming. 
---
The .50 does sound pretty good though
---
Level up? lol
---
Using this perk with a swing speed fist weapon+martial artist is really fun
---
To my knowledge, the unequipping of grenades was fixed in this latest patch.
---
Throttle it lightly like im playing pharah, got it
---
Those two concepts really have nothing to do with each other. What the guy said doesn't even make sense, a stash? WTF is a stash? That's not a thing. That was just an asshole who wanted to blow up your shit for no reason.
---
Yep. Never run low on steel or black titanium.
---
Have a good melee weapon. Bring a few sweet tato stew which offers .25 health regeneration. Hotkey radx and stims before you begin. 
---
ok i seen the word TSE a lot since lunch what does it mean i been playing since day 1 and been on this reddit for 3 months and only now asking
---
It’s been broken for me
---
Should be banned for doing what this game explicitly allows you to do.
---
Swaggotry at its finest.
---
Yeah, you should be able to click a flag on the item in your pip boy to stop it being scrapped accidentally - including stuff in your junk that you had to go into a blast zone to find. Damn!
---
And open doors just by passing them.
---
Yeah so this was my main reaction at first. A lot of higher players would drop extra plans / legendaries and stuff and then the past few weeks it's just gotten ridiculous with them being annoying and shooting at me haha!
---
Oh really? That's awesome, unfortunately I'm a console peasant so I still have to wait for the update
---
So you hunted them down and killed them repeatedly afterwards right?
---
Two shot explosive. Learn this yesterday lol no shame
---
Two Shot Explosive 
---
That's a complete load of crap for their level to drop. That's unfair and game breaking. 
---
The point is to do quests and explore the story. Your level doesn't matter to the story. 
---
People dont know how games like these work. Ark, Conan, etc 
---
And my axe!
---
I find mini guns on super mutant corpses all the time and found one in the back of a truck. Are they supposed to be rare?
---
I dont believe this post.
---
PA blocks all Rads disease and fall damage 
---
Yea I am... I didn't notice 
---
Hopefully. That wasnt what my concern was. Im just hopping they dont start adding all the assets we had in Fo4 through the Atom Store. 
---
Ill be pretty upset if things like Elevators, armor/weapon rack, concrete walls end up on the Atom Store rather than part of the DLC were suppose to get. Ill be even more upset if items like this end up being limited time releases.
---
Missing out on Blackbird paint because of lack of points, or not being able to log on is one thing, missing out on items like i listed would be a completely different story.
---
This game is not a competitive type game.  It’s set up to play it how you want.  
---
I'm just saying that according to lore, Fallout 76 takes place many many years before Fallout 4 and theres nothing in Fallout 76 right now that indicates that the Atom Cats even existed yet. Its possible they didn't exist until many years Fallout 4 took place. So if its just a hot rod paint it'd make sense but if the power armor says 'Atom Cats Industries' then they would have to explain or put something in Fallout 76 (which currently has ZERO lore about it)
---
Its mad annoying when you have that one that kid with a TSE Minigun 
---
&gt; should be banned for it
---
Devs purposely included this feature. To say it should be bannable is laughable
---
Oh I get ya. 
---
I was just saying it's one of those more harmless exploits
---
Lol i haven't duped once and i have everything you speak of.
---
Meta is meta
---
Damn. Honestly if you see people duping just report them and move on, no need to be a cunt. "I know what you were doing" ouch lol, I hope your girlfriend is still enjoying the game.
---
As good an idea as any. 👍🏻
---
You found it at the dam? Or the deathclaw area? Trying to find this dress late in the game. 🐢
---
I don't do PvP. I have fireproof, but have too many other perks enabled to use it. 
---
I want to trade it because I got the entire army of robits chasing me at whitesprings when I shot some ghouls and I have blown myself up a couple of times. 
---
I have nerve damage in my hands, and can't always swith weapons quickly enough or aim precisely enough. 
---
oh ok that makes sense and yeah i agree
---
Everytime i spot those vertibirds and cargobots i start shooting it, i mostly encounter them around top of the world. I have 5 nuclear keycards now.  You dont rly need the silo codes though. Just check the internet for this week solved code 
---
Your welcome. I know how frustrating it is to have what little budget we are allotted disappear. I was pretty salty that’s for sure. Hope it helps! Happy Wandering Fellow Wastelander. 
---
Here’s (IMO) how you should build a character so far...
---
Melee -weapon helps amplify the perks
---
Ranged - perks help amplify the weapon
---
Meaning.. your rifle is more important for actual DPS than your perks. That being said, it also comes down to play style. (Without a really good weapon) If you use vats and don’t have any vats perks your going to struggle. (Without a really good weapon) If you are sneaking without any bonus to sneak attack you’re going to struggle. 
---
Never mind I missed the explosive part in the atory
---
Yeah, not everyone behaves and plays well with others. I am a melee build and due to the nature of having to get close and one shotting or being close to one shotting, I try to stay on my own when I go into the zone. 
---
TSE .50 cal and my Hamma!
---
I like the whisky as a fun gift, but even at level 100 I would rather die than give up any ballistic fiber. 
---
I don't ever expect anything, and have found many run away after because some high level jerk probably turned on them in the past.  
---
Capitalize that 'W' in West Virginia or I'll have your badge!
---
Block the users and relog. Only way to ensure you'll never see them again.
---
https://m.imgur.com/ZZdHSPR
---
You make good points until you say you're playing the game.
---
So you think the game should sink.. You condone investing in games that aren't finished and loathe those business practices and are upset about the messups they made.. But you are still playing it, therefore you are supporting it. I don't see the logic in that...
---
But you are right, they shouldn't have made those mistakes, but, for whatever reason they did. I think it's more of a disconnect from the devs and the management, but idk we aren't privy to that kind of information. All I can do is speculate, and hope they turn it around. 
---
Dude, google it. 3 months after release the game is on sale for less than half the original price. Does that sound like a sucessful game to you?
---
Look for other comments I made in this thread if you're that interested. Dont take it personally, im just a bit tired of repeating the same arguments. 
---
But be aware that im not hating on the game. I do want Fallout to be good. 
---
Lol what is this shit. Being a raider and smashing player camps is a mechanic. Theres nothing bad, nasty, or mean about it. Its a fun part of the game.
---
Coulda been me and my buddies. We werent hunting dupers. We were hunting powderpuff fallout fanboys who cry when we smash their camp. 
---
Boo hoo. 50 wood to to rebuild her camp. Gimme a break. Im logging on to smash more camps. Lookin for your girl this time.
---
i also do nice things like find low levels to give my duplicate plans to. I workshop alot so ive given away hundreds. Coulda been you, last night i gave a guy who was near GAD with his lvl 8 girlfriend a ton of plans. Offered to buy his sledge, talked for a bit then left.... To smash more camps!
---
Everyday with these "some meany smashed my camp" sad sack posts. Give it a break. its part of the game. 
---
Pvp is part of the game . 
---
The game will never really be fun. For me its just a distraction, like netflix or drinking. As someone else put it "What you are doing when you leave the vault is the same thing you will be doing in Fallout 76 forever".
---
Thank you for this. I crashed twice during this part and was terrified that the save file had been corrupted
---
Same, was googling the issue and landed here.
---
Not sure why I read this as bearded curtains lol
---
TSE has nothing to do with it, you had to have pacifist off or you were wanted. Or the other guy was using dupped bobbleheads, TSE does not do enough damage to go through slap damage and kill someone, no matter how many idiots on reddit say it does.
---
I want the gun Arkansas is always shooting at u in the mine field in fo3
---
I mean, many of the best perk cards that have multiple ranks arent unlocked until high 40s/50. I'm over level 200 and I play because there are various different ways to set myself up, and in always chasing that next holy grail piece. 
---
I don't. But now I want to know where to get them lol.
---
&gt;TSE
---
Truley Shitty Experience
---
Even better when there are a few dozen of those bots all saying at once. 
---
Same for me, black screen with odd lighting around some things and then it loads.
---
Then 15 - 30 minutes later the game will just freeze and crash.
---
Nuke zone still gives you rads, PA reduces it drastically but doesn't block all disease or rads. I still get diseases from glowing ones after a few swats and about 2 rads/sec. 
---
Entropy in a suit of armor.
---
I'm really just baffled that I seem to have no option besides hitting a guy with a stick bc my bullets take five times as long to down anyone
---
Easy fix is not having a FUCKING RADAR that tells you the exact location of every player in the game. That is just bizarre to me. Never seen that in any MMO and for a game with PVP its basically a map hack.
---
But what he is saying is simply not true.  I have actually tried the exploit he is talking about.  I didn't get one two- shot weapon nor did anyone on my team. 
---
Now, I have actually gotten two- shot weapons before- but not a single one of them has been from white springs or any nuke zone.  I'm not the only one to experience this either. 
---
How do you get the jetpack? I'm level 40 and have the excavator armor
---
I've had every glitch you've mentioned atleast like 10 times tonight. 
---
Also carry weight items are bugged as fuck. I have 2 pieces of armor each gives 20% reduced wep weights but sometimes when I load into a server they dont work even taking everything off and putting it back on etc. But some servers it works fine.
---
Then the Fallout 76 devs are laughable.  I don't think I'd get too much argument from 90% of players on this.  
---
Religion is dead, much like all the people.
---
No one ever held you as a child huh?
---
That's a good theory. I am totally unsure but we can test this all out. Both my Mirelurk Hunter and my Deathclaw are friendly to alll. Sloth was hostile.
---
Squirrels and Foxes taste like chicken.
---
Yeah... Didnt like it in fallout 4 and not a big fan still. To bulky. Its more practical dont get me wrong. Just not me. I have them for emergencies.  But nothing like going toe to toe with death itself
---
I RARELY comment on Reddit.  It's sort of the wife's thing but I've come to find the FO76 sub interesting.
---
That said, I hope your gf continues to play.  The wife and I play and it makes the game just a bit more enjoyable; always having a co-player.  We have had similar experiences and we either end up jumping servers, going in to pacifist mode (doesn't help with the camps tho), or  (when we're first) following them back to their camp and dropping an orbital strike.  The damage works both ways since most higher level players have more expensive items in their camps.  Be safe out there.
---
OK, what next...
---
Life is brutal
---
My friend never forget.
---
Lol, did you just imply coal is a rare material? This game must be difficult for you. Do you run around starving and thirsty very often?
---
i usually have this happen to me if i kill the legendary too quick so now i carry around a level 10 knife to start fights with legendaries
---
What a bunch of morons, that group.  Everyone knows the way you get at dupers is by finding where they're duping items, sneaking up, then stealing the lot of it and dropping it in Fissure Site Prime by throwing your nude body into the chasm with all that junk.

Thing is a TSE shotgun would make no difference removing the two shot as it's only 1 extra pellet. The explosive damage with all the perk buffs is the issue. And then the majority of the people who own the gun, get bored of being in god mode one shotting everything, so decide to grief on other players who are simply trying to enjoy the game. It needs a major nerf and harder to craft ammo.
---
I joined someone's "Defend Workshop" event last night hoping for some quick XP, caps and plans. Owned by a level 100+ with a level 80 tagging along. I spawn in, they're just standing around in PA, the "attack" is bugged out as the last enemy is clearly stuck under the ground. So, I decided to have some fun, messing around emoting and trying to hide from them. At one point I did a fun little trick where I got the level 100 following me round so I went into a small dark room with only one door and immediately closed it behind me. Then re-opened it, waved, then closed it again. I then stood off to the side and opened it, quickly backing into a corner so it looked like I "disappeared". A pretty fun trick I thought, but level 100 just shuts the door again. And locks it. I shot it a couple of times, ask him to open it over the mic. He lets me out and I then start looking for a way out. Turns out all the doors have been covered up with concrete barriers. I ask if he can let me out. He does the "Thumbs Down" emote and I'm like "Wow, you're kind've a dick, huh? Fine, I'll fast travel away cos this is getting dull, standing around in your bugged out ammo bunker of boring.".
---
He sends me a message that is just 2 'crying laughing' emotes. Couldn't tell if he was laughing with me or at me and didn't care to ask. 
---
I check the map about an hour later and they are both still there, holed up in their little ammo box. Weirdos. 
---
Check out astutegraphics.com
---
Muffled is a scrap mod. Just have to keep scrapping those level 10 metal arms.
---
hmm ok. That does sound attractive. 
---
It worked, thanks again. :)
---
You can literally rebulid the entire base by clicking E like 3 times.
---
Why is everyone who plays this game such a frog. 
---
I find a junk extractor + just playing the game has given me an over abundance of the most sought after junk. 
---
You know sometimes people afk in weird ways. I have absolutely left my character crafting at my base because I wanted a snack or the cat's decided right then was a good time to riot about dinner
---
Amen! I especially love him yelling at the dead guy for not following his own device.
---
I don't expect anything either. I give away any low level legendaries to the first low level I see usually. If they hang around and give me time to check what I have. I dropped a bunch of ammo and weapons and armor in a supply drop box and the person dropped some chems and what I liked from everything they put in the box was X-Cell and Stealthboy. The things I mentioned are things I wouldn't mind getting if they did want to give a little something as thank you, but I already have loads of stuff, and whisky and ammo bags is the only think I really need to hunt for. Whisky is great with Party Girl/Boy for double or triple effects. 2 strength becomes 4 or 6. That's 10% melee damage turned into 30%. Not bad.
---
The entire purpose of Pacifist in Fallout 76 is to disable damage to other players, and as you cannot damage other players, you cannot activate PVP. The only way players can directly negatively effect you in Fallout 76 is via PVP. Therefore, it's a defacto opt out of PVP. There is literally no other purpose for it in this game.
---
Yesterday I was showered with downvotes when I pointed out how overzealous that post was. It's nice to see a post like this make it to the top. It's good to see the perspective of those who are possibly getting screwed cause they "look like a duper". I know they're out there.
---
Sadly, that latency tends to be horrible. I have American friends I just can't play with.
---
Does that make it a good thing, or does that make it something that's enjoyable to angry little boys?  I think the latter. If Bethesda are encouraging Griefers, then Bethesda are morons. 
---
ah if you're on ps4 i may have found one of your suitcases at grafton station while i was hoping for bos plans. It had a camp plan i hadn't unlocked so i added some spare bos plans to it :)
---
My base is on top of a freaking sattelite dish, and those molerats still spawn up there.
---
Same happened to me. Same place and there was a scorchbeast there that destroyed me. Why do the fissure sites show a different color on the map than other locations?
---
Okay so ive never encountered anyone who has ever talked about a duper. Literally the only place ive seen it is on this subreddit. Also, I dont really understand why it is such a negative thing. I never do PVP because its broken and shitty; So I really dont get why other people are so upset about it. Are you getting killed contstantly?
---
Two shot quad doesnt exist. Sounds like someone is looking for a handout.
---
Sell it, get a shotgun Max out perks you're doing 1.2k of damage per shot 
---
Sent a request. Join up whenever
---
It's a mechanic used in every online game ever. Get over yourself. 
---
I totally agree with the perk thing. But then, with what you said, what is your answer to: Is there a point to being lower than level 50, and what IS the holy grail after level 50?
---
Normal miniguns are not. Author mentioned "explosive" minigun and i since it's second prefix and can only be seen on at least 2-star legendary weapon i assumed first legendary prefix was two-shot. Or maybe bloodied.
---
&gt; PA blocks all Rads disease and fall damage
---
it only eliminates fall damage. The hazmat suit is better for rad protection. 
---
Nope xbox lol
---
I'm just saying, none of us have access to Bethesda's budget. 
---
We also don't have access to total, worldwide sales. 
---
We also don't have access to total MTX sales. 
---
We don't know what the R&amp;D of this game was. This may have been an internal test that some people thought was fun. In which case, the game may have been a side project of one dev in free time that got greenlighted. 
---
We don't know what the true margin is for total sales needed to break even. 
---
Most people are speculating based off of partial information. Without the actual business plan and full budget, we are clueless.
---
Stop talking like you are apart of the CFO's financial team. That's all I am saying.
---
&gt;Vladtepesx3
---
Interesting! I will add this information and tag the authors as we go. This can be a big collaboration to try and figure this all out. If you want to add pics, please do! 
---
That's nice dear. 
---
These guys are real douches and besides what good would come out of destroying the camp even if you guys were duping
---
Miguel used to be laid back, but these days hes just... intense... it never gets old! Unlike Miguel's decomposing remains.
---
An average volunteer takes 132 minutes to set up a camp for the first time. Responder Miguel set up this very camp in only 9999 minutes! Bravo.
---
Camping wasnt always for everyone, but now that everything is destroyed, it's quite literally now for everyone! Living the dream, right Miguel?
---
Alt-tab, load a second instance of the game in a virtual machine. Oh right, you can't do that on *console*. Lol.
---
"I've purposefully stayed away from nuke guides, but could you give me a nuke guide?"
---
o_0 
---
Nice. A player-made arena was bound to happen.
---
That video was freaking great, too! I am on PS4, but good luck with your fine battles.
---
I stupid but what's the sad truth
---
Ok I guess it's just a coincidence that the patch being released in a few days makes explosive pvp damage irrelevant. 
---
The duping has been patched fyi. Cant dupe anymore, thankfully. Unless there is already a new one.
---
Is this still open for maybe one more order? 🤞🏻
---
Haha. I love it. 
---
It's like reverse level griefing. It's not a hostile action. It's more like scavaging corpses... 
---
I hope it happens to you more. 
---
oh well guess someone's doing it on PS4 as well then lol
---
Is a two shot gatling gun a TSE weapon? 
---
thank you so much! your character looks so badass 
---
Sure is!
---
Mine was surrounded with the giant concrete defensive walls. He shot right through them. 
---
This is correct.
---
Ive only ever had 3 SBs spawn when im done taking that nuclear workshop at the very bottom of the map or the one by Abandoned Bog Town.
---
Now i set up missile launchers as soon as i take a workshop just in case.
---
I have had cats spawn alone that could be pacified but not tamed. As of right now, experience points to YES they must be alone. Have not seen cats, wolves, or foxes tameable. I did have a pack of wolves spawn in the Fallen Vertibird location but could not tame.
---
Anyone have any other insights on this?
---
I do the same (pc) 
---
The po-po
---
I feel your pain, I did the exact same thing with my calibrated shocks. I have taken to scrapping my junk piece by piece just to avoid this. It's stupid 
---
This is an excellent idea!
---
Exactly, I was disapointed this wasn't possible, but my wife and I put two beds next to eachother in both our camps so it seems like we combined camps I guess. 
---
No. It's to prevent accidentally flagging yourself fore full pvp damage. You can still be killed with pacifist on. Pacifist means you don't want to damage others. It doesn't mean others can't damage you.
---
Good to know. Thanks.
---
I just dont like to throw stuff away. So i prefer dropping those in containers where ppl pass by often.  
---
TSE honestly sucks the fun out of the game... Once they get them they realise there's no challenge in-game so they get bored and attack players instead.
---
They should pull a Rockstar and stick habitual PvP'ers in lobbies with each other.
---
I've seen this before. A guy fell off a cliff and another guy went and grabbed his shit 
---
Opportunity.
---
Cool! I will add this and cite you on it. Thanks for the info.
---
You have a few options...
---
1.Stick with it... when you find or buy the “perfect” weapon you’ll really enjoy rifles. Shooting  from range has always been fun (for me at least). It will take time and the grind won’t be the most enjoyable experience at times.
---
2.start a melee... you will be at end game events faster and able to solo more things for more legendary drops. The threat of death won’t be there as often and you will kill faster, sooner. You can then use your melee character to farm for items for your rifle build
---
These options will essentially take the same amount of time. Option 2 might take a little longer now, after the nuked Whitesprings XP nerf. 
---
I really recommend option 1... you picked a rifleman because that’s what you wanted to play as. Stick with it, it gets better.  
---
You can get 4K without OLED, in fact, outside budget TVs it's hard to not get a 4K one, unless you're specifically looking for a lower resolution one. 
---
I want this to be a thing so bad.
---
LOL I wasn’t being rude; don’t get your tendies in a knot. And no, since you ovary acted I guess you’ll have to figure it out for yourself now. 
---
TSE is like upgrading legendary Daedra swords in Skyrim... Everything becomes one shot but in FO76 you don't get bored and stop playing, you attack players instead.
---
I personally think the Atomic Store is taking steps towards the right direction, but they're still making some questionable choices here and there.
---
"Slicked Paint" and "Old Possum Sign" are definitely the highlight of the update, "Chrome Paint" and "Air Guitar" follow right after, and "Red Rocket Door" falls in the very bottom for me.
---
* Slicked Paint is wicked cool and unique, as long as you don't mind sticking out. I personally love the bright look but I know a few might not welcome bright DLC to the dark wasteland.
---
* Old Possum Sign is a brand new unique light,  and its in mint condition.  It's a shame that only 1 sign comes with the purchase. I personally believe you should get a set for that price.
---
* Chrome Paint is wicked cool,  but **only applies to the Mini Gun**. Again, I believe that this should apply to all weapons for the price they're asking.
---
* Red Rocket Door has to be the laziest item I've seen on the store, and its wicked expensive. Its almost the exact same as the current garage doors, but with the Red Rocket logo slapped onto it. Definitely no way to justify the 700 Atom price even if you're looking to make your own station. **The images are also not accurate to what you recieve in game. **
---
At least those people go away, I sometimes keep getting harrassed by a lvl 80 scorchbeast which just wrecks my camp even if I'm not there. And I only have melee!
---
I'll start doing the same, we could make this a thing. 
---
This game has the least toxic community that I've found in a long time.
---
Yes. Not everyone in the wasteland is going to be helpful. 
---
Kudos to the guy who looted you. Very thematically accurate.
---
Great guide! 
---
I have the same issue with jetpack
---
PTSD
---
OMG !! :D
---
If this works you are my new hero, i have had at least 4 turrets just vanishing from my camp, and also wall paintings, spot lights and other stuff.
---
Just gone, with no repair button available on the camp builder, and they still use up the budget, so was going to rear down my camp today..
---
This will probably save me a lot of time, thanks a million :)
---
That's because you can only get them by buying them from the vendor...
---
I'm a "collector"...but for ONE OR TWO things. So, on this last playthrough, I literally JUST did the quests to get the Ultracite Armor, the Excavator Armor, and the Prototype Hazmat suit. And those are my 3 items I care to collect. So, I guess in a general sense I really am not a collector. I like to find ONE thing I like, and I roll with that. I guess that's why it's not really attractive to me to "keep finding new exciting things". I do want to find a bunch of plans that I haven't yet,....but since they're not really specific to ONE way of finding them, it seems kinda pointless to take the hardest route (killing the Queen Scorchbeast) to find those plans. 
---
I'm really not trying to be cynical about it. I'm honestly trying to find the answer to "what else is there after level 50?" BECAUSE I like the game and I want to keep playing it. 
---
Noooo don't do it! Human NPCs!!!! Whenever I see lack of NPCs I twitch a little. Granted, the ones we do interact with are few and far in between, and we have no influence on them whatsoever. They are there, they just aren't alive humans. 
---
I personally like the empty feeling. It goes with the shitstorm the plague has caused and it just makes sense. If a bunch of people were alive, then clearly this plague isn't as dangerous as they are making it out to be. Something happens from 76 to 4 where there is no mention of Scorched so we will have to wait and see what we, the vault dwellers, do to make the wasteland livable. Thats what I'm excited for.
---
I spent like 2 hours hoping from server to server hoping there is a, jetpack but nope
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Nobody seems to share your sentiment. I’m not here to change your mind though, so good luck with that 
---
I've got a TSE weapon anyone attacking my base will be killed immediately.
---
&gt; You have a creative definition of the word Cheat.
---
Not at all. We are simply disagreeing as to what "the game" is. I believe "the game" is the code written by the developers. You believe "the game" is the intention of developers. 
---
so that why i keep randomly dieing while walking around and not in pvp and nothing is around me
---
Would recommend either the Carnivore or Herbivore mutations to help with the food requirements for speed freak
---
You might be able to? They may have changed it, but I've definitely been able to repair a strangers camp before.
---
I get a lot of animals walking around in my house. It's good. The mole-rats are the only annoying ones.
---
I found the nuke launch way easier than I feared it would be.
---
It's the nuke zone that's crazy.
---
Lol despacito!
---
I do the same thing but blast white cristmas and make my entrance dressed as santa breaking through the roof. 
---
Yeah I know, I've been server hopping to that terminal for ages.
---
I really wish we had welcome mats as well, closest thing we can come to choosing a spawn-point is to move the "C.A.M.P"-thingy around while in build-mode, fast-travel to your camp to see if you've gotten a near-desirable spawn-point, then move it around again. Rinse and repeat until you're satisfied, atleast this is the only way I know of.
---
I use pacifist mode entirely to ensure I don't accidentally hurt randoms in helping with quests/events.....
---
After one or two times of accidental damage spiraling into a case of kill each other repeatedly it's worked perfectly. 
---
If I want to PvP, I turn it off.
---
Also i went that marsupilian mutation or w.e its called. So i been sitting in toxic water like a moron for almost one hour and nothing 
---
And while you are at it please close the small door on the  Nuka machine on my front porch!
---
That's the attitude of a lot of gamers.  It's only the Griefer grubs who come in an wreck your house. Bethesda seem to be encouraging this lately.
---
Thanks!  Feel free to use my work in the wiki--maybe the inconsistent quality of my screenshots will inspire someone more fastidious to make better ones ;D
---
Thank you for sharing this clever post. I enjoyed it!
---
I've found a few players that are above level 150, and to a man, every single one has been a great person to meet. 
---
&gt;Carlfiii
---
Thanks for the info, I'll add it.
---
Which doesn't necessarily equate to the player being a duper. 
---
Well, it depends on what you mean by open war. Like everyone is flagged for pvp all the time? People would leave the game in droves. Do you get flagged when you loot a bag? Now every bag I see is a gamble of did they drop trash they didn't want or will looting this get me killed. The fact of the matter is once you drop it, be it willingly or on death, its not your shit anymore.
---
Besides you already have a chance to get it back, that's why its in a bag and not deleted, and there are so many area markers that you can respawn within eye shot of where you died most times. The only time its hard is in nuke zones and if you plan to be in one don't take valuable stuff with you or you might loose it, pretty easy really. Punishing another player because you died isn't the answer. 
---
Annoyingly I've found the Jetpack like 3 times and the Stealth Mod twice :/
---
No, we have a disagreement on ethics and morality. 
---
Like up to 4 legendary enemies?
---
Damn, that’s almost as Watoga high pre patch. 
---
When most of the time it's just some high lvl who convinced there friend to get the game 
---
Oooh. I'll have to keep my eyes peeled for one of those
---
80% would have a significant effect on how quickly the burn in sets in, since it means those pixels won't be lit at full brightness constantly.
---
Just lowering brightness would also help a ton with reducing burn in.
---
Umm, I think I'm missing the point. What's wrong with having a second account solely for storage? Is it against the rules or something?
---
Life isnt fair lol
---
Yeah, gangs of guys in my house fighting is a bit much - leaping around in their undies. 
---
Sounds fun haha
---
Its PvP. Personally these happenings make me feel more alive out there. The Wastes are visceral. Go play Fallout 4 if you want a single player experience where nothing will ever go wrong. 
---
You can, there are welcome mats in the game, look through your  holding options, you may have to learn it but it’s definitely a part of the game. You place it where you want to spawn when you die or fast travel to your camp.
---
I know right? It'd be so fun. I got the idea when we were playing that monster mash pvp event in watoga. Someone puts on the mask and runs around as an "enemy" for the others to hunt. Then I thought about how some MMO's let you play as the bad guys, and wondered how hard it would be for that to happen in 76.
---
Indeed
---
Did you fully modify your PA sets? Probably not, so to me you just got started. You get them from vendors, TREASURE MAPS, event rewards. Queen isnt the only place to get stuff ya know. 
---
You are being cynical, I have given plenty of reasons to be past 50. If you don't like them then endgame is not for you.
---
Oh yay! I’ve tried to hop for a few hours now and I’m like...I just want a dress. Just a damn dress. How much are you selling them for? I’m kinda low on caps til the vendor refresh tonight so it’ll have to be later today if it’s over 150? Just let me know. I’m at your mercy haha. 
---
You don't even need a vm.
---
I love it...maybe it depends on your display/settings? It looks fine for me.
---
Either way, feels bad. I know how annoying it is to find resources to repair a base.
---
Will do captain!
---
I hear they aren't a feature in the game anymore though; the 'mats' and anything mat like I've tried, but still do not create a SET spawn point
---
You sound like my kind vault dweller. My supposed "friends" always leave my door open when using my base so much so that i sometimes wish there was a way to prevent squad mates getting inside! Like damn, do you want a giant ant infestation? Because thats how you get a giant ant infestation. 
---
Could have been an event reward too.
---
Yeah, I'm grasping at straws. Just want to eliminate them as a possible contributor. Sounds like they aren't the culprit. 
---
I wish there were treehouse camp pieces, it would be so fun.
---
Where is your camp? Sounds like you're in or very close to a place thats too high for you.
---
And that's why my cross is upside down on the roof and theirs hanging body part decorations from the ceiling. Oh and an electric chair.
---
First put the extractor on it, then loot step 4: profit
---
Just change servers? Quit whining and telling others how to play the game THEY paid for!!!! /s
---
Any tips on picking which one to go with?
---
Had this happen to me when I “took too long” at a work bench.  Didn’t have a lot of junk, so I just stayed there until I died and he/she went wanted.  Came back at full health and re-scrounged all the junk I lost in 30 minutes.  When I did respawn I saw that there were 3 wanted players so it must have been a member of a team.  In any case it was no longer an issue so I just blocked them and changed servers and went on with MY game.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
The first one I did got glitched into a tree and was disappearing  and reappearing simultaneously so we didn’t get it. I still need to finish the become death quest...
---
TBH I have enough problems running one instance of this buggy game. I'm not about to run a second
---
Does anyone know where to get a note called "Hey Man"? I found someone's abandoned CAMP the other day so I left a paperbag full of goodies on their table, the final item being that note left on top of the list of items for style points. But now I need to get more of them so I can make it my thing. Pretty sure it's found somewhere around Flatwoods but not too sure... 
---
As in removing Explosive or both? Because there's absolutely nothing wrong with just 'Two Shot'.
---
Moving your camp module thing changes the spawn within the camp, just gotta move it a lot to find the spot
---
Sure it's not against the rules. Neither was duping, really. Without any kind of conflict the game would be boring as hell. But like I said above, vigilantism as an excuse to raze without talking is lame as hell.
---
You’re doing God’s work here, son. 
---
Oh, I’ll have to try it but that seems crazy that they would take that away after having it in the game since launch... it was the only way I was able to defend people from taking my munitions factory
---
Interesting, maybe some testing would be in order to see what, exactly, is going on... do workshop resources behave the same way as resources in the wild, for example.
---
What level is the hunting rifle? That's about what mine does and I'm only level 32. 
---
Which you don’t if it’s a player that kills you outside of pvp. 
---
 Thanks. It is turning into a collaboration and will definitely get better and more definitive with time! And hopefully with some updates to the taming system TBH
---
Would like to confirm this as accurate.
---
No reactive plates yet :( 
---
&gt;Tired of server hopping for legendarys?
---
&gt; change server and try again till you find a server with a good amount of legendaries.
---
ಠ_ಠ
---
And others were here crying about revoked keys
---
i disagree, i have a TSE gattling plasma and  a gauss rifle. both of them are my go to weapons especialy the plasma as it makes killing the queen in solo possible and the gauss is great for high level schorched and robots in the silos. killing enemies in 3 shoots is way  more fun than having to spend tens of rounds for a single kill, i still use a shotgun for most low level enemies though. but i may be biased as i have a xo1 jetpack which makes tse weapons usable at closer distances.
---
You dont leave vault doors open either, thats how the animals get out
---
It’s only a level 20
---
Really hope they will start being a bit more generous with the way they package the skins. The Atom cost is too high like you said. For just on weapon, that alienates a lot of potential people, which means they lose a lot of potential purchases of atoms to be able to make that purchase.
---
I would love a chromed out Gauss Rifle, or Aviator paint schema on my Combat Rifle. Even a Tricentennial paint job on the Fire Axe or Multipurpose Axe, Pickaxe, etc. They will make more money in the long run if they made them appeal to a broader audience, possibly getting someone who wouldn't normally buy atoms to shell out some cash to subsidize the lacking atoms someone needs, or to get the collector who wants to get spiffy weapons and armor and doesn't necessarily care about sparing the expense.
---
Yeah, I think it would be so cool as an unlockable thing. Like maybe once you play to level 50 you can start a new character as a super mutant kind of thing. If you hit different markers you can unlock different things you can play as. It would give us something else to do because the end game is so boring.
---
Ok guy.
---
He obviously meant a few months in game, not in the real world. My character has been on the grind for a year now
---
Thats pretty much all you can do. Once a high level sets the enemies for the area you have to shadow them for xp or change servers. As for stash dont horde all the high level stuff unless its something incredible or a handmade rifle. Everything else will be plentiful when you level up. Also bulk your supplies at a tinkers bench. And make sure you read any plans or recipes you get. Those can add up and take up precious weight, ammo as well. If you dont use missles or fat man dump the ammo for them.
---
I think it mightve been a workshop only feature! I remember using it for a workshop, but the ones in c.a.m.p dont do it which suuuuucks
---
Thank god we all paid with our own money for the game so we can use exactly what weapons we want to. And play exactly how we want! 
---
I didnt know that! I gotta try this!
---
Be able to 1 shot. 
---
Everyone pvping can one shot.  
---
The team with more players wins. If you can keep a sniper hidden, your team wins more. 
---
Thats pvp right now. You need a group  
---
What's the recommendation for Fluorescent flux?
---
Have a great day thanks for the downvote! 
---
Last I looked Excavator jet pack isn't in the game yet, if ever. Only option is to switch to one of the standard power armor bodies to use one.
---
That number should be the charge not the clip
---
It's just meant to show your "charge" when you hold down the trigger. I don't think it's showed the ammo since FO3/NV
---
Because many of the fixes don't actually fix things universally. Example: 90% of the claimed bug fixes in the patch we just got
---
Thats not an ammo readout, its the powerlevel of the shot.  The longer you hold down the fire button, the more powerful of a shot you get 
---
Same, except I leave one of those propaganda flyers from the liberators with it. 
---
U heard of pacifist?
---
Get a tinker workbench and make bulk stuff
---
Also i make sure my bulk stuff is not more than 10 and other scrap not more than 50 for example
---
Bulk adhesive (10)
---
Waste acid (50)
---
Some stuff like deathclaw hand, salvaged assaultron head  or halucen can cannister dont turn into scrap if u do 'scrap all junk' and those take alot of space,
---
Also stimpacks, super stinpacks fusion cores, missiles,  mininukes, plasma cores take alot of space aswell
---
Unless you know how to cheese them with physics/pathfinding. There is a little ledge just outside the golf shop that they will cluster around but be unable to climb up. I have taken out many hordes by myself because I know how to "tactically retreat"! 
---
The Rad Sponge perk now has a ~10 second cool down between procs, where it had none before.
---
This absolutely should have been nerfed, but I'm very unhappy it did not make it into the patch notes.
---
Play like you want with what you want idgaf that's your problem but dont kill other player that just want to do their own things. It's called not being an asshole. You should try.
---
Im lvl 186 and have killed 1 player. Never had any problems

Yeah, I had this douchebag destroy my base for fun, so I wanted revenge.  Spawned some distance away, went in to stealth mode w/my Chameleon armor, stayed quiet, had him "Blocked" so he couldn't see me on the map - but, since the mic is not PTT, and it shows a little speaker icon on the map whenever you make noise he saw that and knew right where I was coming from.  
---
That wasn't even the most upsetting bullshit about the whole scenario that day, no, the most upsetting thing was when I used a Mini Nuke on him and it did no damage.  He was twice my level and the Mini Nuke was basically my only hope at getting the deserved revenge on this asshole.
---
Ill be sure to try this! Thank you!
---
Check out the Griefer children negging my comment. You guys (or guy running multiple accounts) are/is so pathetic. I guess I must have hit a raw nerve. Get over yourself. I'm sorry I don't agree with your need to take your personal shit out on other gamers.  
---
By the way love your previous comment.
---
"We hate that players will just randomly walk up and start blasting us with their duped, 2 shot exploding shotguns while we're standing around at a train station or crafting in the overseer's camp."
---
While trading a 2 shot explosive handmade. One of the most duped weapons in the game.
---
Not really, but it's enough to level a wood building easily
---
I am mostly melee so no.  I sell most everything immediately. I just had remembered a harpoon late last night.
---
Gary....Gary!
---
God, can I please get a Rambo outfit in the atomic shop plus a sweet mullet?
---
Read what i wrote before calling me an asshole you crybaby
---
You describe your camp with no pics! 
---
And yah we need fast travel mats like workshops have
---
I killed a 3 star earlier today and got nothing.....
---
Also stick around with the high level person. Or run for your life. Its a survival game after all 😋
---
That would be awesome! Maybe some camo face paint too.
---
It’s only in the enclave vendor correct?
---
Mostly around Morgantown. There is a damn nearby that I cleared out that as soon as I captured a workshop it started spawning rad scorpions. Most of the Supermutants and Rad scorpions were around my level though. Its just when the high level humans show up the bad guys just get higher levels.
---
You say you confiscated 30 psychotats huh? It's in the evidence locker? Is that in the NW corner of the station? I'm just wondering for...science... 
---
Being able to change your blip on the radar to a caps symbol to signify actively trading would be great. Then you could stay in your "shop" (CAMP) or be a roving trader like Grahm. Moo-Moo not included. 
---
Thanks - I always have whiskey and x-cell on me that I never use so now I know what to give! Thanks 😁😁
---
Maybe u should try buying an offline game my friend?
---
this is correct
---
Everything that uses AP will drain your fusion cores at an accelerated rate, but the Jetpack perhaps does it more so than sprinting or VATS.
---
How much for the X-01 Callibrated shock mod?
---
Nope, that just means there are wind chimes somewhere nearby. Loot them for aluminium scraps. 
---
&gt; That would appeal to 0.00001% of players (Griefer morons - i.e. cranky teenage boys).  
---
What game series are you playing?
---
This is fucking fallout.
---
If someone wants to be a raider that levels your homestead and jerks off in the rhodies then this is the game to do it.
---
The point is you're not server hopping each time,  you're just hopping a few times until you find a server that seems decent, then  you start "farming" for however long...
---
lol
---
Was you raised in a barn!
---
Yup, been running to that darn terminal for a few hours each day for the past 3 days...
---
Definitely. Its common courtesy honestly, and getting everyone a chance to share the loot/xp. Thats why my loadout at Whitesprings is either a tesla for tagging, or a non TSE Gatling for kills.
---
Queen is another story. You go full Rambo on her; even with TSE she can be a handful
---
My two shot dragon used to break every three shots.  I got the perk that repairs weapons to 150% and it hasn’t broke going on 20 shots now
---
:S Is there usually an event when the big bois turn up?
---
I play on PC, I used over 20 cores in an hour with the jetpack without power user, so yes, if you dedicate gameplay time to farming cores you don't need it, I prefer to not have to think about it for a good chunk of time and now I don't need to.
---
Good advice. I should have thought of that.
---
It's a bug that occasionally happens when you spawn inside a nuke zone.
---
What system you on? I already have a jet pack and shocks so if I find it I can give it to you 
---
The repair all function is the star fact in this treasure trove!
---
Was a fair few hours ago. Was fucking ridiculous. Love a good battle, and it just ended in such disappointment.  
---
I have the tinker bench i guess I didn't understand what the bulk meant. Thank you. I bet when I bulk it all I'll be fine :)
---
There's a difference between smashing camps while acting as a Raider, and doing it as a white knight against dupers when the people you're targeting aren't dupers.
---
3k for both
---
[TLDR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBne6gbJeHk)
---
nope.
---
FYI, if you scrap the broken plant, it refunds you the fertilizer AND the fruit/vegetable, thus giving you all the ingredients to plant t again
---
You deserve a medal friend!
---
Modern problems require modern solutions.
---
I mean there is an entire perk that increases damage to player buildings. 
---
Destroying someone's camp "because you feel like it" is perfectly viable. He didn't need an excuse.
---
Wait, you can make your camp private or open?!
---
Not my best shot but I took this yesterday after meeting someone pretty two-faced

You'd be doing me a great favour, I'm on Xbox.

An executioners double barrel and a furious combat shotgun. I run a cripple build.
---
Guess it's time to make the *SMART* choice... and move to West Tek
---
If they dont remove TSE as an effect, they should increase the difficulty level instead. People complain about Scorchbeasts, but for a while they were challenging, if not outright difficult.
---
And I like that!
---
The Wasteland is supposed to be brutal. Deaths here and there to glitches and stupid shit is annoying as hell and should be fixed, but an honest challenge with unique mechanics is worth it.
---
I'm looking at you, Flying Mirelurk Queens! 
---
Ok cool I’ll keep a lookout 
---
So? Its both an intended mechanic, and could also apply to other situations, e.g. people willingly fighting in each other’s bases for fun. Some people totally accept any losses because they enjoy the pvp.
---
You hit X to open the inventory and X to take all
---
You should really relay this info to @Bethesda, it is a very frustrating bug for a lot of us...
---
Right this goes double for teammates,I have all the workbenches and plenty of water purifiers, so teammates will often use my camp only to leave every single door open. Which sucks cuz enemies get in and break shit, once they're inside my turrets can't hit them.
---
That makes sense. That stupid parade where that big monster and tons of Supermutants is one example I can think of. I killed that mf but barely...
---
Ah I always took it that high levels would do the invite if they want to help, so I just try and get a hit in from a distance and stay out the way 👍 if we are in whitesprings - wouldn't high level else want the unstable flux's? As they are spawn for everybody don't they? 
---
Thanks for the tips!  Just hit 50 and now its time to get some legendary gear.  I hate server hopping so this suits me just fine.
---
That's what I do...
---
Jealous, I am at work :(
---
I mean click "repair all" 2 seconds, very little cost... I don't see the issue here 
---
I have the same issues with my stash.  And i collect alot of junk. You just need to make sure you dont have too much of the same junk. Also some items you need more often than other items. So its useless if u have like 100 times acid if u barely need it 
---
I agree. It's vile behaviour and Bethesda wants to encourage it, apparently. It appeals to a very small minority of people who get off on destroying other people's gaming experience. How is that going to encourage more people to play the game? Bethesda has no clue what they are doing with this game. 
---
Agreed. First example is normal video game playing. Second is a sign of depresion, distorted reality and a lack of purpose. 
---
OOOh so that was you!! Thank you sir!!! I was very low on caps and materials you saved me :D
---
Thanks :)
---
That's why I am in areas where things get sticky! 😂😂
---
Well, have you found any plans for power armor mods?
---
Over on r/fallout
---
There me and my buddies were, strolling along and choking back a few Oak Holler Lagers, when out of nowhere this hot babe starts waving at me. I shit you not, she was a 10, fresh out the vault, I mean she looked like she'd never even tried dirty water before, if you know what I mean.
---
My buddy Bunghole\_8long is like "she's waving at me", but that dude only has a 4 Charisma, even with the lagers. I start strolling up to her, and whip out my mini gun. She's just floored. It's obvious she's never seen a heavy weapon before. Then, right when I'm about to make a move, some scavver pops up saying "she's mine!" and "honey get back inside, I got a bad feeling".
---
Now I know this skag is keeping her prisoner, and I gotta do something about it! I spin my mini gun and she starts squealing in delight as I let the TSE loose. Shells are flying everywhere and soon there's nothing left of that prison camp.
---
The girl is screaming, she's like "You're Wanted!!!". I'm like "You don't have to tell me that, baby." Afterwards we all went back to my camp and had a huge orgy. I don't remember a whole lot after the Psychobuff kicked in, but when I woke up, she was gone. I think she logged out from exhaustion.
---
When its finished I'll take pics!
---
Still sorting out lighting!
---
Nope, still tons of spawns whether nuked or not. 
---
TIL there's a sinister cabal of scavenger hunters in Appalachia. 
---
In all fairness tho props to you guys for doing this! I leave spare recipes in the cash registers in Flatwoods :p
---
I really like TSE.   Like, a lot.
---
You need to learn the mods from a plan or use a mod that you've found/bought. As far as I'm aware you can learn mods for all models except X-01.
---
Fellow color blind player, and yes to this. Trick I use is I open the map in PhotoShop, select the magic wand, deselect "contiguous," zoom in and select the resource I want. Keep your sensitivity around 3 or 4 and it'll highlight every node of that type on the map.
---
If you don't have PhotoShop, you might be able to use a similar method with GIMP. 
---
I could be wrong, but I also think flat moving your camp to another location will repair all broken CAMP items when they’re stored. Swear it’s happened twice when I’ve moved my CAMP, but can’t say for sure.
---
Download Elder Scrolls Legends and you can manage your blocked list from there.
---
I found the silo to be one of the instances where stealth build really, really shines.  
---
I could basically walk past the robots most of the time.
---
What device?
---
You don't leave vault doors open because that's how animals get in......
---
The Grafton Protest event is bugged, but then Bethesda have known that for a long time, haven't they.  It doesn't spawn enemies, if you kill a bunch of mutants beforehand, so the event times out without you being able to complete it.  
---
Yeah i love the game. It is just annoying getting disconnected then it doesn't save the quest progression i just did....
---
I crash if I use the stash box at Watoga station.
---
If you are friends you can go into the social menu in the game and unblock him
---
Thank you!
---
when you see a nuke zone, especialy at whitesprings go to it and just shoot at bloated ones and let the other people kill them for you.
---
Only talking about when nuked... goes for other areal as well...
---
Awww 😍 love the puke emoji idea tho 😂
---
Ooo, thanks for the fashion tip!
---
She says, looking down at her ratty jeans and dog-hair covered t-shirt in real life.
---
Awesome, thank you
---
Nice idea
---
Dude even at level 120+ soloing a nuke silo is still a challenge because some parts get glitches out and you can't even finish it, or you get towards the end and get disconnected.
---
I know I can solo a silo but haven't really wanted to because of all the issues we've run into, even as a team of 100+. Hats off to those that can.
---
Fastest, least reputable way is to get a hazmat suit (roof of Poseidon plant) and a bunch of molotovs then server hopping until you find a nuked whitesprings.
---
Find someone high level and follow them around, shooting single ghouls and molotoving groups.
---
thanks, i’ll try it out. But does my friend need it to?
---
Log out of the game, then close it down, relaunch it and log back in. That's what it took for me.
---
Honestly the only memorable npc I met in game was Rose. By the time I finished her quest line I felt like I knew her. Every other robot just has a few fines, maybe an accent, but they might at well be a terminal. Honestly the fact that everyone is dead is more unrealistic. I mean there are bunkers everywhere, some people would have survived. But everyone is dead, and most of the time they just look like they died for no reason. As for records of the scorched, well 76 did a number on the lore of this universe. Basically nothing we see in this game can leave the area or most of the worlds lore will break.  They changed the brotherhood, super mutants, the Chinese, and added tons of robots that would have been common everywhere. 
---
As for what happens in the future well we already know that. Everything dies, including us. We have never heard of apolatcha before so we don't succeed in rebuilding, the scortched don't spread so we know they must die off. The brotherhood, apparently, already knew about this place. So since they don't know about it in the future it must not exsist anymore. That's the problem with taking a game with a ton of rich and detailed lore and setting a sequel in the past, if we don't know about it then whatever happens in this game can't be significant, otherwise it invalidates all the previous lore.
---
You obviously havent met the community, theyre animals
---
I do that a lot, but farming springs that way is very slow.
---
So, you won't be joining us?
---
Hello fellow Wastelander. Ok let’s tackle these two questions individually as they both require an answer!  
---
First the stash space budget. There’s no easy fix for this as we all have items that we deem as important and want to save. 
---
One thing I did notice is in your post you stated that your saving higher level weapons and armor. Don’t!  You are going to find many many more higher level weapons and armor. By the time you reach the level to use them, odds are that you have already found something better!  In very rare instances you may find something that’s worth saving such as legendary items with god roll effects, in these cases you will need to decide if the item fits your build and is worth the stash space. 
---
Don’t store ammo!  Weight reduction perks don’t apply to stash space so keep this in mind.
---
Don’t store fusion cores!  Same as above weight reduction perks don’t apply and they are to readily available to use up limited and valuable stash space!
---
Don’t store Aid items!  Again same as above, weight reduction perks don’t apply and they are just to easily obtained in world. 
---
Limit your junk storage!  Much of the junk items are very common and easy to obtain. This is probably the most situational based on your play style. For instance if you are always crafting items you will probably want to keep a bit more. Personally I keep 100 of all junk items excluding stable Flux of which I keep 10 of each. 
---
Next the higher level enemies. Unfortunately this is going to be fairly common in your play through. The enemies re spawn for each  player that enters the area and are scaled to that players level. What you may want to try is tagging, or hitting each enemy at least once. This will allow you to gain the XP and loot from the higher level enemies once they are killed. 
---
That being said as a player that’s in my mid 100,s I have come to expect this from lower level players.  I don’t mind a bit as I assume most players don’t, as long as you stay in the fight. Do not shoot once and stand there letting the other player kill enemies. Stay in the fight, keep yanking that trigger or swinging that meleee.  
---
The few times I have bumped into players that are not contributing, generally I’ll lead the hordes of enemies straight over to them and then jump Out of reach and sit back whilst they struggle with the mobs. 
---
Overall your gameplay and style will determine what you keep and how you deal with higher level enemies. Hope this helped. 
---
I am talking about both nuked and not when I've had wave after wave after wave of enemies spawning all over White springs. 
---
I just finished murdering a double spawn of glowing ones at a nuked Whitesprings. they were at the golf course the maintenance building all the usual places.
---

If you are on a team have someone leave the server and rejoin.  Enemies respawn whenever new people enter the zone

I don't think it's a huge secret around these parts
---

Level 2 power user is all you need. Level 3 Is a waste if a perk point. I only ever travel and fight in my jetpack armor and I only ever GAIN fusion cores. It's insane. I hardly ever notice the meter dropping on a single core 
---
i bought a calibrated shocks blueprint for t45 PA cause i heard it adds to your carry weight but whenever i go to a PA station i cant craft it the list is just blank.
---
Your welcome. I was pretty frustrated myself. Hope this helps. Please post here if it does.  
---
I thought contractor was only for workshops? Not CAMPs? 
---
Found a decent amount of nuke mats, so I mainly need screws now. Though still would buy some nuke mats off of you if you're selling.
---
Ah, interesting.  I wondered if that was the case, but I didn't have any other duplicate hats to test with.  Good to know!
---
Pacifist mode. You'll have griefers come up to your line of fire as you are shooting to make you wanted, and then kill you for your hard earned junk. 
---
Watch out if you use TSE weapons. If you are using one, even with pacifist mode on, keep watch for people getting in your Line of Fire. You'll still take deadly splash damage. 
---
Radaways, stimpacks. 
---
Make sure you have Starched Genes on if you have mutations on.
---
Watch your rads.
---
And if you are using power armor, never EVER exit out. Make sure you dont accidentally do so either. You'll die in seconds.
---
Happy hunting!
---
Same thing happened to me. I tried to kill a 'wanted' player. He killed me and I lost 29 caps. I respawned and he killed me again. I lost another 29 caps. Is this a bug or intentional?
---
My tag is jiffygiggle
---
Are you on Xbox? If so I'd be happy to take em off your hands.

I absolutely will great suggestion thank you. I did relay it to the support through email, now I will get it to @bethesda 
---
I just don’t regularly browse this subreddit. I pop in now-and-again.
---
Thanks Bear!
---
Could someone be in your spot?
---
Right but do you really need Wrecking Ball to take out a n00b's base? Do you really accomplish anything other than causing a new player hardship by destroying their base and making off with a bunch of .38 rounds? No, you're griefing. Just because you can doesn't mean you should. And we wonder why the playerbase is shrinking rapidly.
---
At Nuke events when high levels are dealing with the Scorch/Mire queens, deal with the additional lower level mobs that are spawned during the event.
---
Why it sounds like they are having fun.  Game allows it.  
---
Did you leave plans and ammo, specifically some 40mm grenades and missiles in pleasant valley station yesterday? If so me and my matefound them.
---
Really so you and your friends farmed white springs for hours and didnt recieve a single two shot weapon? Well i guess in recording a video.
---
I'm sorry. I don't use XBONE.
---
Doubt it. I keep rejoining servers. 
---
Can get that creepy squirrel mask, it is gives one. :p
---
I do carnivore and you wind up killing enough stuff with meat you don’t have to worry about food bc you can eat raw meat. But I bet herbivore is good if you collect lots of berries. 
---
Do you have plans for the handmade?
---
I'll try next time I'm on.
---
But what did it drop? Did you get some epic legendary loot for all of your effort?
---
you on xbox?  ya, for me, someone has ALWAYS been there and picked it clean before me.   
---
I think it's because despite the big map, there is actually very few places worth anything once you get to a certain level of stuff/need.
---
Sometimes it feels like xbox is like 5 servers total and we're all picking them clean.

Server disconnects and game freezing on travel
---
I'm sure this is an issue you've heard about before, but I thought I'd throw my 2 cents in. Each time I've been disconnected (numerous) or frozen (much less frequent, but enraging nonetheless), I've spent caps and materials claiming workshops. Thursday night I had 4 workshops, and wasn't able to harvest them 3 times. I craft a lot of ammo, so a fair number of my logons are strictly material runs. So these game-ending glitches are understandably infuriating. I logged on early today (1-13) with the intention of harvesting workshops all day. I've played for 1 hr and it froze on travel from Camp to workshop. This has to be fixed?
---
Just a word of advice: many of the people playing your game are co-op people, as I am. You're running out of time. If the game isn't significantly improved very soon, a great number of your player base will move on to Anthem or the Division 2. As a longtime Fallout fan I'd hate to see that happen. 
---
Thanks for your time.
---
Yeah it is, better damage to scorched too. 
---
Two shot is fine imo, I use them and love them. But, the explosive shotguns are preposterous. 
---
I do carnivore and you wind up killing enough stuff with meat you don’t have to worry about food bc you can eat raw meat. But I bet herbivore is good if you collect lots of berries. Unless your using serums tho you cannot pick, and you can’t have both. 
---
Nice one, comrade! :\^)
---
Well,  i used to have issues with those robots aswell,  just choose a weapons type and get all the perks for that weapon. For example i use a gatling gun   a 2 shot gatling gun and have the big gunner, expert big gunner and master big gunner perk cards so each shot does more than 200 damage now. Robots have a good armor so aiming for the head is a, bad idea.  I mostly aim on the parts where theres no metal, and for assaultrons try to cripple the legs.. 
---
I get that it sucked but is it really a big deal? You say you worked on it for hours like it was lost. Repair all takes less than a second and the whole thing is back. Block the two idiots and leave the server, you will join without them and with a repaired base. All of 2 minutes to get back to where you were.
---
A level 15 leather left leg... totally worth it.
---
Doesn't help if they are on the wrong chat channel
---
That's the game though
---
No worries man
---
Yea, might be time for an upgrade. I don't remember if you need gunsmith to craft hunting rifles or not. But they aren't bad on materials. 
---
Dude this is a bethesda game which is at least 6 months underdone. Bethesda has very high expectations especially for the fallout franchise. They have made the most unstable game ive everplayed. You cant even play for an hour straight without a disconnect... 
---
You're drunk. Grahm isn't a bot.
---
You mean the mole mask?
---
No I do not. Sorry
---
That could have been me indeed 😁
---
Wow. That's just what I need. I need to go hunting for one.
---
Look on  r/Market76 people sell the made serums for like 200-300 caps 
---
No worries, worth a shot
---
I am on in the evenings usually (7-8 pm) eastern. Feel free to message me, GT: colorjames
---
How much you letting your .45’s go for buddy? 
---
And what’s the most you can sell? 
---
Lol. You'll hate my place. I've done both. I have a 1x1 stair box over a cliff.
---
I had a real house with a nice outdoor braai area but as other's have said replacing it was an issue. Even on the few really flat areas. So I 1x1'd it.
---
In FO4 I used a version of a 1x1 because it meant I could build a huge flat dorm with some amenities, no matter what the terrain was like, but I always included supports. In FO76 with the budget issues? Meh. Just pretend it is cantilevered adamantium.
---
I may redesign it cos I've found a new favorite place and have the same top floor and over cliff relaxing area but on a solid foundation. 
---
Jebus.. I can't imagine going 70 levels without being able to fast travel. You've got a ton of patience :)
---
He hasn't been fucked in his lil boy pussy in weeks. Poor OP just needs that sweet dick in his ass.
---
Thanks mate, I’ll add you now 
---
I have also noticed this crafting issue as well, with ammo.
---
Duplicaters. They duplicate items
---
Change the server 1 or 2 times to find a server to stay on for the whole session is no hopping IMO
---
But i thought the same when i read it again xD
---
They need to quit. Full stop. This isnt healthy. Not for the game. Not as people. 
---
At this point, I think Bethesda simply needs to disable PVP until the game is in a more stable, polished state.
---
Lever action plans? 
---
If you have a party get people to disconnect and reconnect. It spawns everyone again when someone new comes in. 
---
Its an a widely used exploit, not a mechanic.  There is nothing to get over.
---
I find legendary alright, I know where they are, I'm level92 now.
---
The problem is, I don't find any desirable weapon or armor. Every cool weapon or armor I own are from some random vendor. I'm glad people don't look at 2nd or 3rd stars sometimes.
---
One two shot pipe rifle and one instigating shotgun and a double ammo cap handmade are my whole treasure. Once I got an explosive revolver but I couldn't make it work, it's just a better revolver. So I just keep it at stash. That's it.
---
It doesn't matter if I farm queen, or server hop, or do the thing you describe, all I get are trash wooden or bad stat boxing gloves or some nonsense item mostly. idk how people get those awesome 3 star weapons at all.
---
How much for the x01? 
---
I do feel like I got a dupped power armor, not sure how I got a second full set Ultracite power armor.
---
So what I want to know is, if you use Reshade for graphical improvement (no funny business) is this something that is getting people banned?
---
I'm just saying hypothetically but if you saw a wide open camp door and you went in and dropped frag mines all over, and then someone else came in and triggered them destroying the camp, would you get caps taken away?
---
If you’re on PS4 hit me up and we can play Vulcanthropy I have a level 22 and a level 113.
---
Well duping is a 2 man job. So I look for high level with low level (like OP said) and then I sneak around and scope any bags if I can find them. If I'm spotted I lurk around and try to trade to check for insane amounts of items. I need evidence to send to Bethesda, can't just report everyone. Demolishing a base seems dumb to me, but maybe that's cuz I'm solo. 
---
To be fair, my base is parked on the golf course green and I leave my doors open intentionally so people can use it if they need. I know some people like to bomb all bases in/around whitespring but I try to leave mine open when I can remember.
---
Duper’s are folks that intentionally crash the server to take advantage of a glitch that caused items to be duplicated. These accounts are now actively being banned by Bethesda. 
---
Spawned in last night to 3 Muties gunning hard at something right in front of my camp (up behind billboard east of Whitesprings).
---
Once it all rendered, it was a 80 Deathclaw.
---
Level 4 turrets are...extremely pointless. Haven't found plans for any of the other ones yet.
---
It also spawned a 70ish 3* legendary mongrel that proceeded to get stuck in the ground yet still attack me. Had to use turrets to kill him cause they could still "see" it &amp; after all was said &amp; done I  could only find one bloody chunk of him (and of course a useless drop). Wish I had OBS running cause it was one of the strangest bugs I've seen yet. 
---
Reckon CAMP spawns come with the territory and are added to break monotony etc. Probably happens less/is less threatening nearer to 76.
---
Real life also affords ample opportunity to put latent sociopathic tendencies on display. Doesn't make it ok to DO so...
---
How can you lock things? I always come back to my water purifiers empty.
---
Yeah that'd be the one. Buddy incorrectly called it a squirrel one time &amp; it stuck apparently haha
---
Seems like a side effect of the new fantastic lighting. Sometimes it doesn't work. 
---
Considering everything this game is keeping track of live while being online with dynamic weather, nukes, and render distances... I can live with this trade off. It's only annoying on certain hills
---
crashed when loading the game near palace of the winding path
---
I launched a nuke and it crashed when it made impact
---
killed a queen and it crashed after I looted her
---
relogged and it crashed as I got closer to watoga
---
I'm getting that loading screen thing you described, it will briefly show my character then go back to the loading screen with some messed up contrast/gamma and the spinning cog will speed up real fast and then the game takes off fine, its doing it on load screen pretty consistently now
---
and those are the only ones since the patch for me
---
That's awesome, good job bud 
---
Dupers need to get banned.
---
400 shells - do you have perforating on that shotgun?
---
I don't think there is anything wrong with that.  I also think there should be an easier method to share items between those accounts.
---
zealot's anything explosive is OP get maxed demo expert and the gun will do double its current damage (just note this may be being patched later this month)
---
Not anymore, sorry.
---
Someone had a Pack Yak in Runescape

Update: Today, I was able to craft the prime capacitors. But I just acquired gatling laser plans, and I have all the materials to craft one--but I'm getting the same error message about not having materials. So maybe there's just a 24-hour cooling-off period before making something new.
---
In build mode, highlight the door or the container and you'll see a LOCK option.  On PS4 its L2.
---
Not anymore for be lever action plans or .45’s?
---
Yup! And all the perks. The bastard regened health when I was nearly done. 
---
They are maligned people who will make your life easier, helping you overcome poorly designed game mechanics through the power of serums and explosives.  
---
???You don't get to decide how other people play the game they paid for, nor are you the ultimate morality.  If the game allows it, its part of the game.  If you don't like the game, play something else.  
---
Wait, it's limited **on PC** because of consoles? 
---
As long as you're enjoying yourself. LOL. Most players don't play to grief other players. You're in the minority, along with the pathetic losers running multiple accounts to down-vote my comments in favour of other players being left to play how they want without being harassed.  I don't understand your need to upset people who didn't engage with you to start with. There was none of that in Fallout 4 so I don't know what you are talking about there.   
---
What level are you?
---
Used them. Didn't do all that much. Maybe cos I've not got any perks for them...
---
Go with the flow, most high levels don't need anything but are just keeping ourselves busy. 
---
* Some of mid-low level players get their pantie in a bunch at lower ranks showing up to the sbq fight, high ranks should all be able to solo it, no matter how many people, the ammo consumption is negligible. 
---
* Stash your junk before entering a nuke zone as to avoid losings it or getting overweight too fast. 
---
* Certain newbie tse users that are not used to their weapons tend to blow themselves up if you walk in front of them, depending on the player they can get very upset, avoid walking into their line of fire.
---
* If you have any requests just send a message, most of us would rather giveaway supplies than have to transfer to a mule/drop it.
---
* Avoid large explosives, since it launches the bodies everywhere, we may not need anything but it's a habit to loot the bodies.
---
* Vertibots/orbital strikes cause noticeable frame drops, please avoid using in densely populated areas.
---
Leegatos, lvl340?
---
same thing for me - I have 3 sets of alpha and beta cards that are clogging up my inventory 
---
Use it and switch. I use it with sneak attack and one shot most things.
---
Ugh that’s rough - I’ve downed them without much trouble but with the Gatling and Gauss.
---
They're all just assholes, the people who do this. They lack the courage to face shit head on in real life. So they take their misery out on others online, to alleviate their frustration at their own futility in the real world.
---
And game devs allow it, because these asshats are easy addicts. They need their daily fix of making others miserable. Hopefully it keeps them from shooting up schools at least...
---
That's what NV's AM rifle was based on if I'm right? That girl off Sword Art used one as well.
---
I'd much prefer one of those over a Barrett. 
---
We may have found something similar. I’ve found a reproducible dupe that doesn’t require crafting at all, and as far as I’m concerned, no one would notice in the lobby. Anyway I also believe the best way to get things patched is by major acknowledement. Several people knew of the artillery dupe in the beta, and incredibly enough, as little as 23 hours after a popular youtuber makes it public, bethesda has a full on patch out, up and running. 
---
It’s almost ironic how they ban the youtubers aswell, because without the youtubers, these things would *never* be fixed.
---
Its just the ak rifle from nuka world. But they dont drop often from enemies. So good to keep one if you like the looks of it.
---
Anyone who's played a Multiplayer game has at one point or another gone "I TOTALLY HIT YOU!" and the hit does nothing.
---
Good ol' latency issues, the bane of MP games for decades.
---
Don't you get like nuked all the time?? Today I walked past a camp at white springs but the turrets went off on me so I left as fast as I could :(
---
I want my Minutemen General armor from FO4.
---
42. I know its not endgame but the Behemoth was only level 50.
---
Turts
---
how about 1K?
---
why the fuck didnt you equip them the moment you got them?
---
In build mode, hover over an item (like a door or water purifier) and press "F" (on PC, not sure what the option is on console). You need lockpick perks to do anything more than a level 0 lock.
---
It doesn't really matter, though, because water purifiers have a storage limit (5 for the industrial water purifiers). I just leave my open for visitors.
---
Those high lv's should clean up the enemies before they leave, i always do :/
---
What weapon were you using?
---
The problem with ultracite laser is that it's bugged to oblivion. If you place rifle barrel, they turn into normal lasers. If you mod automatic pistol, they become plasma weapons! Wtf? 
---
We can certainly try! My nickname is the same as here 😊 
---
Wattz 2000 Laser Rifle 
---
I got attacked by a similar level player last night, killed me several times without me fighting back before I jumped worlds. I'm not convinced he/she was hunting dupers; I started a second character to build him and play differently than my first build. I don't have anything that would make me appear as a duper, I'm level 55, about 800 caps on me, and everything I own can be obtained by someone my level because it was obtained by my hard work. 
---
My guess is some people are just taking PvP as an easy way to obtain easy caps and junk. Screw those people, they are not going keep me from being kind and working with others to rebuild 'merica!
---
Get Raider PA, helps a lot and you can jump off EVERYTHING...
---
Is there a good reliable method to get this set?  i.e. are people alternating turning on/off the perk card that makes it harder to cure a mutation, or what is a good way to isolate mutations and keep the ones you want?
---
Aw, that sucks. I live in Sweden so playing with our american friends might be tricky then. 
---
Also Watoga Emergency Center, at least going by the two times I've been there.
---
Wow, a second round of copy + paste. I'm so floored by your intelligence and perseverance.
---
BTW, I thought you didn't give a shit? Or are you so pathetic you can't just give up?
---
Was it at the cranberry bog? Near that pillar that leads you to a monorail in the sky.  I had a legendary behemot lvl 65 there , i wasted a shitload of ammo on it but didnt drop good stuff. 
---
Either PVE only server option, or only allow people on servers with similarly leveled players. It's easy but Bethesda cant be bothered, for some reason. 
---
Sent! Cheers. 
---
That would be nice! I personally dig Maxons battlecoat, but to each their own!
---
And what is a pack yak? How did it work for runescape?
---
Dude, you just initiated the total radstag extinction! I'm on the hunt! 👌 
---
Not quite, the under armour in the atomic shop can be upgraded like causal under armours. 
---
I'm set up in the mire, right on the edge of a cliff. More often than not I'm welcomed by amphibians or cryptids but the way I'm set up is perfect... Right on the edge of a cliff and the only way into my camp is a narrow crevasse covered by turrets. Not much room for farming but the location is perfect for travelling the mire, bog and southern savage.
---
I don't understand why people care so much about dupers. This game barely has PvP. How is them duping shit even affecting you?? I've only come across a person with duped items ONE TIME and the only problem was he gave me a bunch of useless items that took up space in my inventory, so I just dropped them all. What impact are they having on you guys? I guess people at higher levels are taking PvP very seriously..
---
For all of those not into the lingo A "suicide run" means going to ebay to buy duped items. It's called suicide run because of the high probability of getting banned.
---
Mutated Turtles that hide near junk and surprise attack you maybe?
---
It's probably multiplicative, not additive. 
---
I like it's design but when you're decked out in camo combat armour and a sentry helmet it looks off, like you spent all your caps on protection but forgot about a gun. 
---
Any love for Euclid's C Finder?
---
Are you PC or console? I’m on xBox and it isn’t very good at all. I was sneaking through the more the other night and everything was pitch black, but the spaces between the trees’ canopy was super bright, almost blinding. Anything on the ground and the trees’ trunks were just black though. Didn’t help at all.
---
Nope. You're just as bad. They're being selfish. You're being selfish AND a nosy asshole.
---
In fact, the vigilante group is WORSE.
---
No problem
---
Even if you are getting downvoted, happy cake day
---
Nah, the game is just bugged as fuck.
---
I havent done the scorchbeast queen thing jet
---
Not anymore for the lever action. I don't have any .45 plans but, I do have some ammo
---
Of course 
---
You are my favourite person on Reddit right now... been trying to use a pressure plate upstairs for ages, good 'ol rugs!
---
That's cool of you. I've been killed twice by players, because of bounty. I don't really understand supply drops I think haha 
---
Yeah sounds good, will message you my tag in a few minutes when ive logged on  
---
If your story is true (which I treat everything here with skepticism), then it definitely sucks.  I would say collect on the bounty the guy had, but due to team mechanics, that would allow his friends to kill you (STUPID, BETHESDA, FIX THIS TEAM PVP FLAGGING BULLSHIT)
---
Upvote for alliteration.
---
For your first tse buy a shotgun. They use regular ammo
---
Unless they have prime in the name, then you need Ultracite ammo (you can’t make until you learn the plan for the prime receiver)
---
Yes that is definitely worth it . I played full price 80 CAD and it looks like 10 euros is abput 15 dollars canadian so yea that's a super deal 
---
It's worse than duping.
---
Duping might be selfish.
---
Hunting supers is selfish, nosy asshattery.
---
I'm not talking about willing PvP between willing participants. I'm talking about attacking people's property and going around killing people when there is no PvP. It's pathetic and a sign of psychological issues (repressed child-hood anger and cowardice. They can't do it in person, because they lack the balls, so they do it in a game to strangers. Griefers are pathetic.  
---
According to a lot of people a lack of NPC's was one of the biggest problems. But I think Bethesda wanted the community to create it's own world with made up 'NPC's(real players). So now people are just being mindless raiders as in Fallout 4(or in real life) and it's still not good enough. 
---
It sounds like you don't, like, enjoy playing the game.
---
Ok I will bite it I guess
---
Oh yeah, that's probably why. I'm on PC.
---
Shove your cake. 
---
M1 Garand

All that fun stuff.

Genius. You're doing the lord's work, friend.
---
Loyalty? To a faceless corporation?
---
Are you a paid shill?
---
dont listen to this chode.
---
That just happened to me, as well.
---
Logged in, saw the quest notification for "grab the supply drop".  Found it, took something from the box, got the "wanted" status.
---
Pacifist on, didn't even see any other players, hadn't attacked at all since logging in (so therefore couldn't have attacked a C.A.M.P. structure, and besides, the drop was inside the outer walls of Fort Defiance so couldn't have *been* within another player's C.A.M.P. radius ...)
---
Yeah, I think so too. Only had good experiences so far. I can understand the 'hate' for the game because of all the fuck-ups Bethesda had done, but the players are cool and the game is actually fun! 
---
My Prime Two-shot explosive gatling gun all the way
---
It would still be something like 95%
---
Do you need help killing the enemies?
---
Combat shotgun. My go-to for hoards and big melee enemies thst need their legs broke
---
Haha, yea just joshin
---
See my reply to OP for confirmation ... just happened to me in the last hour. :/
---
For fucks sake
---
The people doing it should stop watching Marvel movies and Rent The Watchmen. Then fucking watch it until it finally sinks in:
---
 sane, reasonable people dont go out behind a mask of anonymity and hunt down other people for perceived transgressions. This isnt the behavior of a healthy individual any modern social group would welcome. 
---
Yeah 
---
No it was at the shooting range where you need to collect bottles. 
---
I will keep that in mind. Because dupers seem to be a main topic these days. Also people shouldnt buy stuff from dupers they just ruin their own game experience. Rare items should stay rare
---
People like you are why I rarely play anymore. CAMP building is my favorite part of the game, however lame that might seem to you, and losers with nothing better to do than fuck up someone else’s day have to ruin it for everyone. 
---
I can help you out I can be on in a bit 
---
i know what it does i just don't know how to apply it, whenever i go to the workbench and look at the legs the list is blank.
---
Bro! Go get laid! Goddamn man. You are a serious fawking loser. It's a fucking game.
---
Oh what fun. 
---
yes
---
Thanks mate.
---
Read that this next patch is supposed to reduce xp on those guys. Did I read that right?  Or does it mean there won't be any that hand out 600+?  
---
Ok thanks 
---
Near fissures there are often high level mob corpses that have springs. You may need to fend of the beast that killed them though.
---
Yup shotgun, wouldn't even need to be two shot
---
BUT just so you are aware the game does have some bugs and issues right now. Hopefully Bethesda fixes most of these issues in the coming week's 
---
In regards to the Flux, yeah, they do! 
---
And I guess it really depends on the invite bit. If they’re looking to help you out, I suppose they’d send an invite. I personally don’t, however, I typically won’t reject your invite so long as you don’t mind tagging along with me on my journey. 
---
Yes Bethesda is nerfing the glowing ones xp drops
---
20 hours for cell respawns 
---
The auto scrap logic goes: raw material -&gt; junk -&gt; mods. Since material in your stash counts when crafting/repairing maybe you appear to have plenty of it but the auto scrap logic notices you may only have 7 or whatever steel scrap in your actual inventory so then goes looking for a mod to make up for the rest 2 scrap instead of searching for stash box material first which is what would be the sensible thing (or like not scrapping mods automatically in the first place just for repairing/crafting).
---
The BoS and SM part don't impact lore at all. Or at least not in a major way. Fev originated from West Tek, so it's plausible to think they would test it in the region that the company has a facility located in. There is more than one strain of FEV which lore has confirmed. 
---
Holotapes tell you that the BoS was recruited locally and they were in contact with the West via satellite until the comms failed. Holotapes of troops complaining about the ridiculous sounding nature of paladins and knight's show that they weren't the same BoS we know of, but started off as a means to help the people. 
---
And those games are old, so they didn't have the vision at the time, doesn't necessarily mean that 76 breaks lore. I interpret it as they are adding lore and just filling out a region on a map.
---
Also, it could be that the region does survive, but maybe whatever occurs here becomes an isolated society of sorts, or some other threat prevents people from leaving the region. There's too many unknowns right now to speculate. People did survive the blast. It wasn't the blast that killed us though, it was everything else going on in the wasteland that killed them. The scorch was the major influence. I actually like the fact that, possibly, whatever we do, might not be significant! We left the vault too late, we couldn't save the BoS, we couldn't save the Enclave, we couldn't save the Free States, Raiders, Responders, or Fire breathers. We simply were too late. And humanity was so close to figuring it out.. They just ran out of time. Personally, I like the way it played out. Too often we swoop in and save the day, but I feel like this is just more realistic. More often than not, we are going to fail, but human ingenuity and perseverance still prevails. Having that as my core ethos when I play, it all makes sense to me. Maybe I over think it lol idk
---
Yes, it's harder to write from the beginning when you already have the end points (so far). It makes it harder and they have to be careful to not make things effed up.
---
81%
---
Maybe if stash would be 10x the size.
---
We will all get there eventually. Unless they do something radical soon, players will continue to haemorrhage.
---
This stuff will be the death of this game in short order. It already has a foul rep. Now haters can talk about the half baked, bug riddled GRIEFER PARADISE built by developers using ancient tech who cant manage to make the game work for anyone except people who like making others miserable. 
---
Dont give this game a year, unless major changes are made. Some of them to Bethesda management. 
---
That´s the reason i try to find a way getting good loot without server-hop and do the same location over and over again. It´s more fun to travel around and defeat enemies at different places. 
---
Then you'd be *really* crippled in your ability to store things. 600 across all your characters? That would be balls. If the stash was considerably larger tgis may be a viable option.
---
Honestly the bugs I can over look they took a 1 player game and made it into an online game.  That can't be easy and there working hard on fixing those issues.
---
Only need 1 Callibrated shocks. Are you willing to split?
---
Farm Whitesprings.   I will routinely recevive 3-8 one star legendaries per load-in.    When the consoles update Monday you will finally be able to get legendary hunting rifles. 
---
They are needed to make orange mentats
---
What platform do you play on?
---
Dupers are strange on 1 hand some help players by giving away items for free or really cheap, but on the other hand ruin the value of items and feeling of reward
---
The game is a complete failure and the community who is in denial tries to blame the playerbase instead of Bethesda, who ripped everyone off, so they go apeshit on people who dupe or carry a lot of stuff
---
Freedom isn't free.
---
I had a sneaking suspicion it was true. Hmm. Thank you! 
---
It only gives 1 dr tho
---
Good idea on aiming at the weaker points. And I know about the perks, but what I wanted to know is whether ballistic or energy damage is better against robots
---
&gt; no reason to bulk anything but lead and aluminum 
---
There's actually no reason to bulk those either: they're not actually lighter in bulk form despite appearing so. I stashed away a 100 or so lead and aluminum scrap and then added the equivalent number in bulk and my weight was exactly the same as before.
---
Use the fo76bazaar and market76 subreddits. You can post what you’re looking to buy or sell. 
---
I never had stuff dissapearing.  I am on xbox though.  And in every game there will be cheaters.  So far i ignore those cheaters. And i still having fun with the game. 
---
Dude quit crying over griefers. You could have server hopped at any point you let it happen and now you’re crying. 
---
Try r/fo76bazaar 
---
It’s a dedicated trading subreddit.
---
Regarding the ncr ranger set there was a pre war riot set you could get in the divide that looked just like ncr ranger so maybe we could see a riot gear set come to fallout 76?
---
Never gonna happen
---
It saves weight in all that plastic it's using up!
---
Plus it looks stupid without a helmet or a hat. 
---
Alert, possible source of compostables available.
---
I'm in game, add me when you log in ign: kbaum
---
In mine and ops experience, this is false.  
---
Cool thanks! 
---
Make 76 great again
---
I'm in the same boat man
---
Too bad some people like to break my stuff that I keep unlocked too :(
---
I just hope that they have not been thrown all in the development of the fallout 76 to the trash and the forgotten sea, I love the game but I also have a limit of patience  
---
Made my day 
---
I get what he's saying.  If you have a bunch of high-level players running around the server the "sweet spots" for farming are sometimes pretty hit.  Sometimes you need to cycle to find one that's not been drained of its resources.
---
A group of players sometimes attacking other players in a multiplayer game is worse than people destroying the balance of the game, cheating, lagging servers, wrecking the economy by exploiting a glitch that many people believe is ruining the game.
---
You can't be serious. Duping has become so normalized that people like you are legitimately saying it's not that bad. Just a little 'selfish'. This is crazy. 
---
I too launched my first nuke a few days ago. I started solo, but halfway through, a team tagged along with me, and then we launched it on Fissure Site Prime and killed the Queen
---
Got some two shot rifles and shotguns I’ll be on later Torquemada 
---
Just loading in, my laptop at works a piece of trash
---
And now people who just want to play in peace get attacked on reddit by Griefers defending their behaviour.  They're attacking other players because they are bored with the original game. They're making their own fund by trolling other players. It sucks. Last nail in the coffin, IMO.  
---
I can't do 1080p, only 1440x900
---
Oh I get what they're saying too, just thought it was funny to read was all.
---
I’ve no idea but did you know over armour outfits work with Power Armor? You can get an extra 1000 rad resistance by wearing a hazmat suit while in Power Armor. 
---
Was it this one?
---

---
If he had a bounty its more likely he killed a duper and took that stuff, making you a dumbass
---
I love wrecking peoples places if they are home, with my deathclaw gauntlet. I usually drop some gifts after my attack so there are no hard feelings, but killing people is so satisfying
---
I’ve never dropped mats when being killed by a player outside of pvp or outside of a pvp zone when capturing a workshop
---
Once you've done the quest for dropping the nuke.. that is pretty much it. Even as a casual player this is easily obtainable to do in less than a couple of weeks. I think the general span of life for the game right now is about a month.. maybe 2 tops and then its just a bore.  
---
I really hope in the next patch something massive is done to combat this and bring back everyone who is leaving.  
---
I frequent this sub to see about any changes or updates.
---
I use a tesla rifle but it doesnt makes much difference. I only use the rifle when i am out of ammo  from my main weapon,  when assaultrons come close a just bash it with 'all rise'. So just shoot or bash it like crazy 
---
Or r/FO76market 
---
Replying to your own comment insulting (non-constructively) the very game that the sub is focused on, woeing the fact that people are disagreeing and downvoting, and then insulting those people as well.
---
Get over yourself. 
---
Chemistry requires pure components. 
---
If you’re on PC make sure you Block them so you won’t ever see them again in the future.
---
Bosses should be hard and scary like Deathclaws, slightly bullet spongey but not 40 headshots bad. 
---
Dont even have to move it. Just drop it again in the same spot
---
The only way it would work is if there was a small separate stash that was shared among your characters. to have the 600 shared across all of them would just create more problems. Some idiot will have their 3rd alt use up the aluminum and springs they were saving for their main..blah blah blah you get the picture.
---
I'm all for having something accessible between all characters, but 600 between multiple would just be problematic.
---
I have plenty of people added who I will join up on, dump items in an easily reachable spot like a suitcase, then log onto my alt and join on that persons world, and retrieve the items. Inefficient, but I can do it without partying up with someone.
---
Yes, you still have to add someone to your friends so i guess thats a con if you are going for a full lonewolf thing
---
Not too mention even if you have no want for that X01 jetpack you still should buy it because you can sell it to another player for ~10x the price because the economy is fucked like that.
---
I really miss the world series bat from Fo4
---
I noticed that the other day.  Purified and Boiled really ought to interchangeable as far as crafting goes.
---
Oh god. What is wrong with you?
---
There is often confusion between Ultracite weapons and weapons that use Ultracite Ammo.
---
Ultracite weapons use normal ammo, have a green beam, and a faster ROF and lower base damage. That's it.
---
PRIME weapons (both energy and ballistic) use Ultracite ammo which has a bonus to scorched.
---
I wish it was only 40
---
OK.  That makes sense.  Now I just have to figure which button does it on the Perks screen (using a PC).  None of the options shown at the bottom of the screen do that.  I'll look around some more.  
---
What a boy scout. 
---
oo I didn't know that's how this worked!
---
Why was this a problem for you? I don't understand. 
---
This used to happen to me all the time till I turned pacifist mode on, it'll keep you from damaging C.A.M.P.S. and players.
---
I remember the equivalent was pretty bad in FO4.
---
If anyone is going to be on this evening I'm around. GT PINK P0IS0N (O's are 0's) :) Level 53. 
---
I'd like to see the acid shooting watergun from Fallout tactics 
---
I hope they will add new quests soon and that they add a feature where u can set up a shop at your camp or make a trading post with your group. The game has alot of potential though 
---
Works fine for PC. Makes wandering around out in the Mire at night actually doable without turning on the light.
---
This seriously shouldn't even be needed, we shouldn't take damage from our own weapons, it's stupid. Died so many times to other players jumping in my line of sight while firing at SBQ, it's just infuriating. 
---
That's not possible. The behemoth only spawns at level 50 or at 95 if you nuke it. It will never drop anything below level 45
---
This doesn't sounds like a anti duping case; it sounds more like a group of high levels getting together to mess with and grief people because they are bored. They may use the excuse that you are stashing but the fact that you were building a base and they attacked then even though there were no items or anything around proves that they had no reason to attack. This is just my opinion though and I obviously could be wrong but I feel like it was just trolls; especially with it being a large group of high level players. Always seems like the only people who really grief maliciously are above level 70 due to them being bored of content and having nothing better to waste their time on. Best of luck with repairing the base and avoiding issues like this on console in the future; you two definitely ddn't deserve to get griefed by this group.
---
Dunno what to tell you. It happened. 
---
I can confirm this for you, tested it out quite a bit with a low HP/High Rad bloodied rifle build and it just doesn't seem to proc.
---
Umm, sure.
---
Yup - once you join other servers you won’t be placed on the same server.  It’s still inconvenient but those serial harassers won’t appear anymore.
---
And lockers.  I cleaned out my stash today and left a lot of ammo, food and plans in a locker in Sutton.
---
I've noticed more crashes and disconnects too on PC. Happens at the worst times. 
---
That's awesome. Thanks for the tip!
---
Well that would be a truly interesting revelation. I'll have to try it later.
---
Not mine, OP’s :)
---
pc
---
Thanks all! Now I've just gotta sit back and wait for one of you to hit White Springs 
---
That power attack and grenade throw are still tied to the same button is mind numbingly frustrating. They need to be separated.
---
Juzt playing devils advocate here but the game also allows for bug/exploits but it doesnt make it right to exploit them.  Ultimatly there should be a way like way back in diablo 2 to flag yourself for pvp if you choose or to opt out entirely.  This is the best way to meet both sides in the middle
---
and here I am i cant even build a door...
---
Yeah, I tried to give someone a ton of good stuff and they ran away. One tip would be to back far away from the bag so they don't think that you're going to try to kill them while they're distracted. Because that seems like a tactic.
---
Normally, I just leave all my junk in the Flatwoods Church Filing Cabinet. It seems the safest place to do so that is also frequently visited, so hopefully people are actually get the tons of stuff I leave there.

Your body has systems to filter out impurities and unwanted chemicals.  Adhesive creation doesn’t, and impurities will make it weaker and less effective.
---
Me too. So nice to see another person on the true path like myself. Not like oil and water, they are like water too simply, they are the ice right now. Taking the path you have it is not easy but it is truly righteous. Forgiveness and sympathy for the aggressor(s); It's the only way online.
---
Ah how much do you have dude. I’ll take the lot. 
---
1k for one we can do
---
Awesome. Ill add you.
---
Hi everyone,
---
The dev team is aware of issues with disconnects and actively investigating a fix. As soon as I get more details I'll reply here to give an update. Thank you!
---
Not sure about you guys, but every time I join a new session I have to re-equip my secondary weapon and grenades. 
---
Which sucks because more often than not I spawn next to a big baddie while loading in. I can actually hear the baddie before my character even loads. “Better swap to my Instigating Dragon,” I think, only to see a set of puny human fists appear and begin shaking at that legendary snallygaster.
---
&gt;Tonight I finally got my girlfriend to try 76
---
"Ewwww this is terrible! Here, YOU taste it."
---
Missed the other 0. For some reason Bethesda equates difficulty with bullet spongyness. 
---
I don't play this game, but I've followed the news on it since its announcement (I was gonna get it but had to choose between it or RDR2, sorry). Can someone explain to me the negative stigma of duping in this game?
---
I've played games such as Borderlands 2 that had duping and that was a godsend and a lovely tool in that game. 
---
I guess I can see that. Then some other way then. Wasteland Mailing company?
---
What happens to players like me who have spent hours grinding for them?? 
---
We have over 1,400 rounds of .45 for 1 cap a piece

Thanks you guys :)
---
A follower that acted as an extra inventory while you’re out and about. Quite useful as you’d imagine 
---
Do you mean the army camp south-east-ish of there? X01 stuff isn't found anywhere but but the bunker and that's only in the MODUS store right next to the nuke room where there are mods but no plans available.
---
I would have stopped after like ten shells.  You gambled 400 shells on an enemy that drops the same loot as an enemy you can kill with 5.  Bad bet!
---
I  been dubbing these type of players as "Pidgeottos". They all look the same and act the same, the first way you can tell is by the hair cut, that Urban Ranger one. Either they spend all day blowing up camps, or go around killing you with their TSE weapons.
---
If you read back, you'll find that most of the comments are 'insulting the game'.  It's an issues and feedback thread, mate. My comments are always constructive - unlike Griefers defending their idiocy. Enlighten me as to how celebrating trolling other players, and running multiple accounts to build up your fake rep is constructive. 
---
I’m sorry to hear that man, hope she isn’t too discouraged. It’d be nice if pacifist mode actually kept things like this from happening (like you’d expect it to), but at this point it seems the pvp aspect of the game is just causing more player disappointment and dissatisfaction as time goes on. 
---
Ol' Johnny Law
---
Adding you now. I’ll take a 1000
---
Yeah I didnt think of the stash limit for all characters. A mailing system or something would be best I think.
---
Reduced weight.
---
Quit whining. Griefing will exist on any online game. You ever played Ark?  Griefing is real on there, it’s not a quick repair all function.  You have to completely start over. He’ll grieving even exists on sports games. People will take every timeout, pause the game, and take multiple delay of games to make the games last way too long and cause the other person to quit. Griefing will always exist on online games. 
---
It seems you understand how life works buddy
---
Shotguns are less effective at this than a nice rifle with rifle perks.
---
I have a Junkies Explosive Combat Shotgun.  It's ok. It has pretty good accuracy and tight spread compared to some other shotguns that have a very wide spread.
---
I heard,  key word heard lol, that something with the welcome mat can mess with the collision for ground textures so players would spawn in and fall through the map
---
That would be nice, but no way will the game be able to handle that unfortunatly...
---
That’s why I builders electric doors with pressure-plates. No polite people out there...
---
On a side note...
---
Phoenix is the greatest character in this game. If anyone can stop the Scorch plague, it's him. He's just too busy purging Watoga of their civil roboservants
---
Refined .50 does 1 less dmg than the hardened .308. I swap depending on how much ammo I’ve got. It’s _far_ from ideal, that’s for sure. 
---
thats pretty much it. flavor and style.
---
What rig are you running? I'm running an old i5 2400k with an 870 graphics card and 24gb of RAM and I've only had constant CTDs when entering Watoga for a mission and dropping my settings to low fixed that and in a NUKED Whitesprings with 10+ players and the mobs spawning in the parking lot. I admit I rage quit that session so don't have a solution. 
---
Other than that it has been remarkably stable. 
---
Nice, what kind of DMG?
---
I’m sure I’ll be downvoted, but here it goes...
---
No, I don’t nor have I felt my experience ruined. I’ve put an additional 50 hours in AFTER getting a TSE weapon and have loved every minute of it. I was beginning to actually become more frustrated before receiving my TSE, as I felt it was becoming ridiculous that at level 100, with all 3 max rank commando, bloody mess, tank killer, and tenderizer perks, that I still did barely any damage with a fully moded, un-legendary handmade or assault rifle. 
---
I’m fine with challenges, and difficult content. Hell, I have the platinum trophies for all three Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Nioh, but one thing I find hugely irritating is thinking that enemies with absurdly huge hit points to be difficult. Add to that bullets have to be crafted to get a decent stock and without the right perks you can do one, maybe two, encounters before having to repair everything, and it all becomes more tidious and annoying then immersive.
---
Look, I get it, some folks want to pretend they are legitimately surviving in hell when they play games, hence why almost humorous hard modes exist to annihilate players. However, as shocking as it may be, some people don’t play games for the constant barrage of challenge and prefer these games for the exploration and story. Also, some actually enjoy the idea of going through steamrolling enemies.
---
I think the best idea, which may or may not have been suggested, is to partition the servers up to give people options on how they want to play. Want to play with enemies who require 1000 rounds of 5.56 to take away a quarter of their health while getting the shit blown out of you by some guy who wants to fantasize about being a jerk off raider (possibly needing therapy in real-life)? Join the hardcore, PVP server. Want to explore the world, socialize, and pretend to be gods with your friends? Join the easy, PVE server.
---
I’m not against folks playing how they want, but can we please stop degrading others for how they enjoy playing? I respect everyone who finds enjoyment from a game in their own personal way, even if I don’t play it similarly myself. I loathe those, though, that choose to degrade individuals for having fun in they’re own way. 
---
To be clear, I agree with the anti-duping scenarios though, as it is clearly cheating.
---
Sorry folks, long rant, but something I needed to get off my chest as it continues to make my eyes roll. 
---
Understand that is a feature in the game. You are the one who is wrong. 
---
Your not playing the game as it was designed and expecting others to follow suit. That is arrogant and absurd. 
---
The ones taking it personally are folks like you.  The rest of us are out here having fun. 
---
*Smashes C.A.M.P*
---
Exactly. It's so stupid that you have to cook with Boiled Water but you cannot cook with Purified Water. Especially since Water Purifiers deliver Purified Water. Half of the things in this game, it's as if no one at Bethesda played this game for 5 minutes and thought about these things at all.
---
Which is why I just don't bother cooking anymore and use Sunshine Meadows for Salisbury Steak.
---
Call me what you will I get zero enjoyment from cheating.
---
A gun like that doesn’t have to suit your build. As long as you have the ammo for it, it’ll outdamage just about anything you have.
---
I fully agree but the more I play the less I think there is enough players per server to make any dedicated hub area anymore useable than the places we currently have. I mean white springs isn't a bad place for a hub at all.
---
There is ways they could make a hub work but I have doubts Bethesda has the know how or ambition to make it happen. For one they need text chat, without that shit is dead  in the water but that is nothing new. But they for example make the inside of white springs it's own shared instance so when you load into the building there is always player shops and players to be found. As it is now you would be lucky to find one other person at a hub I mean this isn't exactly the type of game you log on just to hang out and chat, once again no text chat. You are either doing something or you aren't and you close it down, other players have very little impact on your gameplay most of the time.
---
Yep, you can move it just like any other object in your camp and it will move your spawn point. Takes a bit of trial and error. 
---
Energy pistol from NV
---
thanks for all the work, now I finally know what the heck a "high-tech table" is. I got that plan forever ago and it was driving me crazy since nothing actually fits with that name.
---
Wut
---
Wtf is TSE?
---
yeah game was designed with consoles in mind, limited storage on consoles thus the restriction on the photo's
---
A mere moments ago i had "Disconnected from server"
---
I was doing the missile silo quest first time and solo. Almost made it to the end in the maze and robots. This is the sole reason i have postponed the damn Nuke mission. Waiting for the Bethesda fix its shit. 
---
Another frustrating server disconnection TODAY was, when someone just had nuked Whitespring and  I was in the middle of collecting flux and stuff for my new Cal Shocks and ammo.
---
May I ask where your base is located? I've been wanting to find a structure to build on to
---
That's not whats being discussed.  We are talking about people attacking other peoples CAMPs.  
---
Must chop wood...for ever
---
ahh damn, would be interesting if it spawned a nuked mothman
---
This, ladies and gentlemen, is exactly what this game is about!
---
By far my personal best answer this week. Thanks! 
---
Same boat, tried listening to all of the tapes again and quest is stuck. Wondering if it has to do with picking up some of the early ones during beta. 
---
No, users should need to take painstaking care to review every action they're doing to make sure they don't get fucked over by stupid design decisions that only serve to fuck them over. 
---
Heaven forbid we have the developers fix something in their software which they say they plan to support for years to come! Who's ever heard of that!
---
Fuck the police, racist white redneck bastards.
---
CBBE IS a quality of life mod!
---
Fight me
---
You can craft these two items .......
---
It's not as bad as it sounds.  You end up discovering all sorts of interesting things all over the map.  I'm at 72 now and haven't fast traveled in the last 40 or 50 levels.  The only real disadvantage is it makes it impossible to keep a workshop unless you just want to sit there the whole time.  
---
Cheap to make I been selling to vendors for easy cash
---
Possibly, I can see that working. Even if it cost caps to send. The more you send, the more caps it cost, just so there's some sort of "limit" in a sense, so we cant just break the game by sending 289534563 of crap to an alt character. 
---
We do know that *eventually* a mailing system of sorts become used, since...you know...the Courier. A badass mailman, that is.
---
If it were me I would be using  explosive harpoon with flechettes as a explosive Shotgun, then two shot sub machine gun with drum mag as a switch, 10mm smg can be good close up too. Basic commando build. 
---
1000% agree. 
---
Just happened to me. The way I deal with this is I first get out of any PA (this seems to increase likelyhood of glitch occuring) and fast travelling. If I do get black screen of nothingness I just exit to desktop (main menu does seem to fix it) and relog. If this dont work for you I guess just walk there form a near spawn point then...
---
Awesome work! I noticed that the tool chest was listed as unconfirmed. I own that asset and can conform that the plan shares the same name. It’s basically the standing version (with casters) of the large tool box.
---
And r/fo76market
---
It may be grayed out but you should still be able "Craft" it onto the respective part as long as you have the correct perks needed for it (if any)
---
Yeah they do and it's not good. This is a company that has done so much right with game mechanics... what on earth are they thinking?
---
whats the point of having alts if you are just going to have everything "account wide"? why not just ask for an easier way to respec rather than 1 point per level?
---
Yeah, I am in the same boat. Love the event and do it every time I am in the area, but then realized the other day I now have 10 of each card. I also have like 15 RobCo keycards for some reason.
---
I never said you were wrong, I said you have no idea, which you admitted in your previous post. It's also a bit presumptuous of you to call me a kid, you again, have no idea.
---
Outside of power armour helmets are mostly cosmetic (gas masks and things like the spacesuit helmet excepted). We know that the marine combat helmet is a thing because people have purloined it from the developer room. Presumably it is something coming with a content update. I’m expecting a raft of new tier gear to arrive - let the grind continue!
---
What is flechettes? I literally picked this up an hour ago from a robot in Watoga.
---
I am on Xbox as well and the most frustrating thing about the game are the constant server disconnects or quests that disappear after you log out, it’s a fun game but it gets annoying having to deal with this. 
---
You got me
---
I don't enjoy duping either but your just acting all holier-than-thou 
---
I ran into a Scorched Beast the other day and finally decided to try and take it down. I kept taking a lot of damage from somewhere and couldn't figure out how the beast was doing it from so far away. Turns out I encountered a beast AND a mothman at the same time. I managed to find cover to take out the mothman, but then by the time I finished him off the beast had flown away.
---
I have a picture somewhere of me getting my ass handed to me by the scorched horde with the beast in the background and the mothman zipping around in a puff of smoke.
---
instigating is a good choice for snipers
---
wtf thats fucked up
---
Id say give out some names.. let the raider community have some fun. But witch hunting is banned on here. We had some guys in one server on ps4 ganging up on low levels and demanding caps or theyd kill em... so we ganged up on them and rained artillery on them till they died. Then hunted them till they left the server. 
---
A scorchbeast that lands.
---
last time i tried, i couldnt stack the stair structures
---
This sounds like a straight ripoff of the PSO player hub haha.
---
Just started an alt for heavy weapons build, this would make my day.
---
The problem with the brotherhood is that they knew about this place, and it was serious enough to warrant Maxum's attention, then coms go dark and, what they forgot about a possible world ending plague? They never sent anyone to check it out? If they had they would know the status of WV, which means we would know it. Really though their lore isn't all that bad. The super mutants are a little harder to swallow. Apparently the Grafton monster is a kind of super mutant according to west tek terminals, and windigoes are a kind of ghoul, but these are legends, meaning they exsisted before ghouls and super mutants, and exsist now because of FEV and radiation. Also behemoths exist, which are supposed to be extremely old super mutants, but there hasn't been enough time for that. They are also all meant to have come from a single small town, and they can't reproduce since the FEV was neutralized, so how are there so many still?
---
They didn't break the lore really, but they did punch a lot of holes in it. Still, I like your positive outlook. I would have liked it more if they had just gone with all new stuff instead of forcing old stuff in, but they had to maintain that fallout skin. That's what it feels like to me at least, kinda like ESO. It felt like a standard mmorpg with an elder scrolls skin on top, not the rpg its based on. 76 feels like an open world looter shooter with a fallout skin. Both games are fine on their own but don't fit in well with their predecessor. 
---
Had to upvote this based on the quality of that video alone; props for the excellent voice actor!
---
r/Engrish
---
"If you dont like the game, play something else."
---
Nice attitude, asshole. Keep telling people that, and when enough of them listen to you, the servers will go dark and you will have to get your "Daily Socipath" fix somewhere else. Meanwhile, not a shit given about the experience of OTHER people whose day you affect. 
---
Gaming doesnt need people like you. And a lot us dont WANT them, either.
---
Fabulous Fallout Fact Fellow Friend
---
And the homerun sound effect and rag doll animation!  Was my favorite!
---
I had a guy come up to my camp with explosive shot weapons and destroyed all of it. Luckily i had enough materials to repair almost all of it. I still need to repair my second power armor station and fusion generator. God damn screws and aluminium...
---
Yeah that's what we need in fallout with a pack Brahmin.
---
Gaaaaaarrryy
---
Assuming they can afford thr repairs...
---
You pretty much nailed it. Watch for your reticle to turn red so you can shoot them through the smoke. 
---
Harpoon gun is a heavy weapon
---
I think i might've been in your server 
---
Wow your a full heavy weapons build 39 perks tho? I would like to try different weapons too tho too bad its only 50 and some perks just cost way to many points for no reason.
---
Definitely try moving it.  My camp is right on a river and every time I fast traveled to it I ended up in the river!  I'd have to swim a bit to get back on shore, and usually ending up with a waterborne disease . . . 
---
I moved the C.A.M.P. to the frthest point away from the river. Now I pop in along side the river, but on solid ground. 
---
Hello can you remake this in Spanish as my English isn’t good.
---
I’ll take a hard pass
---
Seriously:  Has anyone been banned from this game?  I haven't seen a single report like some devs do.  
---
its a mod for multiple projectiles
---
Only matters what you think.  For me yes.
---
I mean, hes just playing the game
---
This is what you signed up for
---
After serverhopping for 3 days, I finally found my jetpack for X-01.. As pleased as I was, I ran outside to try the combo (marsupial+bird bones+Jetpack) but marsupial wasn't working for me.. So I removed the Jetpack.. 
---
I'm sorry if I have to keep defending my right to have the same opinion that other people are also expressing. It's not surprising that trolls extend their gaming cyber-bullying onto Reddit. I've been observing pubescent boys doing this in gaming since the mid 80's. Now they've started doing it in FO76. It's hardly an original activity. 
---
Another great tip to add here if it has not already been mentioned below...
---
Optimized Servos as a leg mod reduces the AP cost of sprinting while in power armor. You know what else is counted as sprinting? Jetpacks! :)
---
These mods seem to give me a little more bang for my buck... if you can give up the extra weight capacity providing that is available.
---
I just wave and shoot the bag. Crouch a few times. Works like a charm. 
---
Problem is when it’s a youngster that spends the next hour following you around sending you chat invites. Lol. 
---
I just want to give some stuff to help out, level 5 serrated machete, maybe a pipe pistol with 100 rounds and some food and water, not looking for friends :)
---
Oh! I cant wait to get on later and track these down! Thanks for the info!
---
So far I've just got my one toon at lvl 65 and for me Its just a matter of not having done nearly enough in the game. I power-gamed lvl 20-35 cause they're a chug but I've started going slower and exploring more and the game is just as fun as it was fresh out of the Vault. It helps that I'm obsessed with my C.A.M.P. and I keep hunting plans. Ultimately you make your fun, I'm just letting ya know that past lvl 50 can still be fun as heck. 
---
Careful how you interact.  I keep hearing about how great this sub is, guess they forgot to mention people like you who have no argument worth anything and resort to petty insults immediately.  
---
*facepalm* 
---
unfortunately i carry around my steel scraps in my inventory - the logic doesn't even work that well.
---
It will literally scrap your stash before using your inventory - I've noticed when repairing workshops or AA-guns it will scrap mods even if you have the inventory on you. At this point I don't even grab the mods anymore, just a waste of caps.
---
If the game had player-hostable servers, it would make things so much easier.
---
This would be my guess as well. I mean as frustrated as I might be at dupers i wouldn't go around just shooting some one assuming they are one cause I wouldn't want to mess up some one who is honestly playing the game. Some one who is fine with doing that probably already enjoys pissing people off in the first place.
---
Oh your back
---
Play at school man, shit. They don't have internet there or something?
---
Cool, I’ll take it. I’ll add you in about 15 mins.
---
White springs, events, workshops.  
---
Really, what's he like? What are his goals? what's he like or hate? Is he concerned about anything, like where all the brotherhood went?
---
Haha exactly, it was my favorite weapon for cola cars especially. 
---
It works for whenever you're building/repairing shit.
---
Excellent, thank you.  Pity I've been wasting those 3 points for so long!
---
no problem it will be worth it trust me :)
---
I had a level 170 guy show up while I was giving away low level guns to out of the vault characters. He came and killed me and took my shit then was like 'what the fuck dude, where is all your shit, I thought you were a duper'. He kills me to be a hero and expected me to have stuff, which i didn't cause I give it away, then was mad I wasn't muling or duping. Tards.
---
The game is more bugged now after the patch.
---
Something changed after the patch this week.  I play a pistol vats crit build and noticed immediately.  I can be face-to-face with a mob and still be very low % to shoot them in the head. And even after shooting 3 times with concentrated fire to get it up to 95% - still miss.  I've actually died because of this which is very unusual - because I'm having to unload multiple clips on one mob and his buddies are beating me down.  I've completely switched to shooting the legs on tougher mobs because of this. (BTW shooting the legs out on robots and mutants works great) I'm gonna run some more tests on this today.  I play with no TSE because they OP IMO.  I normally run with a single loader pistol gunslinger style.  I'll test some other guns today.
---
I just jumped on, I can help if you need
---
Yeah thats true.
---
Not in this case but it is true
---
I was lucky enough to acquire a lvl45 3* Double Barrelled Shotgun (explosive/+15% reload/quadruple ammo capacity).  I'm not a min/max build but this thing will put out over 1100 damage for me at times.  I've killed myself more times than I care to admit but I'm loving this explosive 8 shot double barrel.
---
They did end up fixing the 2nd pocket glitch by just not letting us go into negative carry weight. However, there is a very similar glitch that allows you use other armor perks to increase your stats. 
---
So instead of going into a negative carry weight, you can glitch the armor and just give yourself several hundred strength and have a carry weight into the thousands.
---
I have this as well, one time tho, the event splash screen WOULD NOT stop popping up, even after I finished the quest. The voice message got stuck on repeat too, the irony is that the message ends with "this will be your only warning" ... I friggin wish.
---
Uh... sure sure hours...
---
Well. I’ve been doing this shit wrong . Thanks !
---
Cool story bro. Get a life.
---
 Same youre not alone. 
---
That’s a pass for me battle royale games just aren’t for me.  I’m sure there are some who would love this but not me.
---
Easier, and with modifications, better.
---
Yeah.. even most of the ps4 raiders are laid back. 
---
I'm kinda ok for using Purified in pharmacy, that's pretty reasonable, but *cooking* starch with it, and then breaking into adhesive using any crafting station... that's not a high chemistry, jeez. Any clean water should do.
---
Playerbases shrink after the honeymoon on every game that exists.
---
I wouldn't correlate it to this behavior. 
---
Does it suck that it might turn off a potential long term player? Yes.
---
However, you and I knew coming into the game that this type of behavior would exist and was intentionally facilitated. Casuals likely don't know that, but I had an enlightening experience yesterday:
---
My sister finally started playing Waframe. However, as we played together and I began to explain the systems, i realized that she would never "care" enough to truly learn them and properly progress and enjoy the game, meaning the game INHERENTLY wasn't made for a player like her, and that is something I needed to accept.
---
So many of you act like any PVP action must be honorably justified as opposed to players PVPing for the sake of PVP.
---
It fucks up the servers to have people running around with millions of items in their inventories, and the servers are already shaky as it is.
---
I have never had my base coat more than a few easy to get scrap. Less than 10 wood, steel and maybe a few others. 
---
People arguing in favor of making others miserable for no reason, dont deserve logic and reason in return. Dont want to be treated like an asshole? Try not being one.
---
*Right in the feels*
---
Every train station I visit i put all my unwanted ammo, plans and recipes in the suitcases.  Can't sell them and seems like a waste to drop them on the ground. I feel better thinking that someone might find them and be able  to use them. 
---
And the 150 other fixes they just made.
---
Yes but it could be as simple as removing yourself entirly from pvp also protects your camp, with the added bonus of protecting others from accidental  bounties from stray bullets, workshops would still function as normal
---
Mine usually costs around 400 concrete and some steel scraps. 
---
Or put in private servers already. Some of us would rather not do PvP anyways and I'm not sure why Bethesda insists we have to deal with it. I know how I enjoy games and I know I could enjoy this game without PvP... why do they insist I must play it with it? 
---
(Rockstar I know why they force it, griefers sell shark cards/gold bars. Not that it really makes it much better, in fact to be fair it pisses me off more. But I'm not sure what foot Bethesda has in the game to try to force me to play PvP).
---
Team based faction pvp yes please. Battle royale noty. 
---
Really? Doh. Thanks for info. 
---
My thoughts exactly.... Oh no... We have to walk over to the camp and hit repair... 
---
What are you trying to achieve here exactly? Telling others how to spend their money? 
---
*facepalm*
---
Just needs a player bank like in eso. The one in eso allows 60 items and can be upgraded with either in game currency or the equivalent of atoms. A 60lbs bank would be reasonable.
---
I think you can only deploy 3 mines at one time. Its a good question who gets flagged, the person who dropped the mine, but is away or the person who triggered them (if not the owner). Maybe no one gets flagged.
---
So you want them to give less really easy atom points out?
---
yeah that's fair. it wouldn't be for everyone.
---
I like to put it in the cash register so that it is easy to find and in the same location at all train stations
---
thats the thing, everything dies quick exept the queen.
---
Just make a new character specifically for that challenge and level it up once every time the challenge comes up, eventually you will have a good leveled alt
---
Why? What's lost by leaving it in so some people can get atoms?
---
I launched solo, it was one of my main objectives. The issues that I ran into launching solo was more about when the game crashed or kicked you out - you would have to start over. It was frustrating beyond compare. I felt like throwing my controller at the TV several times. It's very doable and it would be much easier if the game crashed/locked up less or if you respawned in the same world. Perhaps with the upcoming patches this will be the case and it will be easier. For the most part, very doable - just prepare for having to go through it dozens of times until you get lucky.  
---
Haha that was the idea lol, you probably couldnt even get to the workshop or munitions producer without getting kill because of the amount of punji boards we put down
---
You can lock doors or you can leave them unlocked. That's about it.
---
You only drop junk when you die, and a few caps when someone else kills you. Always store your junk when you go adventuring around so you don't drop the precious screws and adhesives.
---
No worries brother, it doesn't say it shouldn't work with it so I totally get the confusion.  Nerd rage was glitched at one time and only provided part of its bonus in PA but since this latest patch it appears to be working correctly in PA now.
---
They do, but the console isn't mine to take, y'know? 
---
from my experience the game was a lot more fun at a lower level. The world is amazing to explore! Once you make it further you will see the quest are kind of lacking (mainly go to an area, find holotape/note, it tells you to go to another area type quest). Also once you get higher levels you have the fun of starting to deal with stash limits. YOu will spend half of your playtime trying to sell items to vendors. This is all just so you can keep some stuff in your base stash. 
---
TLDR the game is more fun when you are brand new and just exploring
---
Well my guy looks okay with it but i wanna wear the whole enclave outfit. I think it would look awesome. 
---
Ecept the economy is setup so poorly that you should just buy any of the really rare mods from vendors because you can sell them to players for many, many times the price.
---
bummer
---
I call that the "old person hit", due to the aches and pains of aging.
---
THAT MISSLE IS HEADED TO THE GIANT’S CURRENT POSITION. WHERE’S THE GIANT MANSLEY?!
---
Fantastic 
---
Sooooo this post didn’t age particularly well...
---
If you were duping like this... How would their actions hurt you in the slightest? 
---
10/10 for logic
---
There is one good reason and that is splitting the player base.
---
either pvp or pve will become a low pop wasteland. Even WoW had that problem which is why they just combined the servers and gave people the option to flat out turn pvp off/on. Difference is there is a larger pop on their server that you dont really see any difference from it while fo76 only have 24 people a shard....
---
Yeah i kmow . Im saying thay got the flag right  It matches the lore . In fallout 4 they had the wrong us flag 
---
Wut?
---
Yes it does stack
---
we can not climb or climb walls, and you say a batteroyale xd 
---
So far my crash rate for queen is 100% since new patch. Before it was like one in ten or twenty and it was almost always server disconnects, this is crash to desktop.
---
Not to mention Ive been CTD randomly as well. Three times yesterday when trying to eat/drink I crashed right when I hit the button.
---
If it has no name it is most likely the Excavator PA and since this scraps to BT it is.
---
Upvote for the GT, made me giggle lol
---
I have my door locked so i can close it if there are annoying players about, but I generally leave it open so others can use the camp while I am away.
---
If someone were to close the door while inside, they would be locked in, if they close it while outside, then its shut for everyone else. So I actually hope that people leave it open.
---
Ah shoot, i woulda offered to give you a hand when starting but i play on xbox :(.
---
You can get that I feel really stupid right now, right? 😂
---
I like it! If they ever add followers, it could be like you choose whether to have a robot follower that will fight for you or a pack brahmin follower that lets you access your stash. 
---
It happens with other thing in crafting as well 
---
I launched my first one a while back and also died more than once, went through about 750 rounds of 5.56, killed about 30 assaultrons, and took over an hour because I had no idea what I was doing. Picked the target and watched the missile take off and immediately got disconnected.  Great first experience, really eager to do that again.  
---
Anyone mind sharing where to find the plans for these?
---
Now that’s just silly. Alts have to be levelled and special points allocated, and gear is level gated. There is no merit in stopping the transfer of items between alts - it would not make them pointless at all.
---
Did you play during the BETA? I'm not sure if this is what you're referring to, but since they had challenges/achievements turned off during the BETA anything you did then will not count on your character. Super annoying, I agree, but it doesn't seem like they consider this to be a bug/don't plan on fixing it. [Source](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/304027/fallout-76-common-issues-and-solutions?language%5B%5D=en)
---
I'm not against TSE weapons in general, if they were used in a somewhat 'responsible' way (high level enemies, solo runs, etc.). What really REALLY bothers me is the oversaturation with those kind of weapons in the game and a lot of players using them to get everyone except themselves raging. 
---
At any event where more than one player is present, just let that shit ton of damage in your pants and play so that everyone can have a piece of the cake.
---
You're up for some PVP? Fine, just leave that overly and insane powerful piece at home and fight like a wo/man, using weapons that don't one shot every living thing in a radius of twenty meters. 
---
Honestly  i havent had a disconnect for some time. It does freezer or the game crashes sometimes  because it makes my xbox overheat.  I had the same issues when a quest is missing but if you hop server its back on the list. Maybe its your internet connection that makes u disconnect? 
---
Yeah. Some of these trolls use the anonymity of the game to take out their personal crap on people. It's the same as on social media platforms and on here with a guy using multiple accounts to attack me right now. Same behaviour. It's not fatal but it's not healthy. Bethesda need to stop encouraging it. Destroying each others property and murdering other players was not promoted as being an integral part of the game when we bought it. 
---
and that's how i met your mother.
---
Ah that is too bad. Time to get a laptop/build a pc. I mean you really need one for school don't yah?
---
Put both Aluminium and Plastic into your inventory and try again. There seems to be a bug where if resources are both in your inventory and stash, the crafting/repairing doesn't work.
---
We totally didn't this coming... 🤔
---
How about swap it for more "Scrap 5 toys"? There are actually easier things to do than level up...
---
Same lol
---
Me and my friends attempted it 6 or 7 times 0 success from silo to sbq.
---
Once someone else nuked it and sbq was taken down i grabbed my loot and w I s disconnected 3 mins later. Log back all the loot was gone. 
---
I think about 430 when addicted to mentats. Don't know if it stacks with other addictions. I should test it. I have demolition expert 4, 1 shotgun damage perk at rank 2 and 2 at rank 1.
---
They're both in my stash. I'll try pulling them both out. Thanks.

My camp is just a basic fight ring for fist fights, this seems more exciting
---
I really enjoy the new additions of rabbits, frogs, foxes, and opossoms. I think they help fill out the world a bit and make it more real.  Mutated birds and fish would be nifty.
---
Though they're already present, I think an ant colony dungeon would be cool.
---
We have cows and deer, how about goats, sheep, and horses?
---
Well, my laptop certainly wouldn't run 76, just indie games and New Vegas for me!
---
Hahaha nah man 
---
It's like if the pizza sailsman(?) wrote down what the customer didn't want and then decided to take it personally and laugh about it with his food blog friends. Going so far as to fund a huge press event where some of the feedback was mischaracterized and mocked on a giant television screen.
---
Bethesda just went silent and has been the internets bitch since the outrage. Their most infamous reply wasn't even from them. They've been pretty good for all the hate they got, They weren't funding press events with YouTubers to mock early criticism of the game... They were simply promoting hype for a spin off game.
---
Battlefield deserves it as much as bugthesda deserved *the original criticisms*. Battlefield imo even more because battlefield has been doing battlefield longer and harder and better than Bethesda has done fallout. Unarguably. 
---
Bf1 was a battlefront battlefield that made me lose interest in bfv. Bfv dug it's own game being so full of itself while being so many titles post-something like battlefield 3/4. It sucks. 
---
Tho I do enjoy it because it made me like battlefield 1 even more and now that it's actually feature complete it was nice to go back to!
---
Yes I like the robot idea I'm hoping they add something like the mechanist dlc for fallout 4 with fully customizable bots.
---
My recommendation is to release it so that they fix it before the new content. Otherwise duping is going to exist forever and market will never recover from it.
---
Maybe players that kill it would receive a sizable bounty? That would deter griefing somewhat. 
---
Hey /u/LoneVaultWanderer \- great patch! Just to make sure your team is aware, the compass icons on the HUD while in Power Armor are still slightly shifted to the right of where they should be. There's [a mod to fix this](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/129) but it would be nice if you could look into getting this resolved for the next patch. :)
---
This is really good information and advice, but I don't think most of it is needed and would rather use other perk points.
---
I have never used any of those mutations or perks and use jetpack all the time. It drains the fusion core so slowly already that I discard fusion cores when they are below 50% or else I have too many to carry. Now that the production rate on the fusion core generators is fixed at power plant workshops, you can get new cores at 100% quickly and easily.
---
Ohhhhhhhh yeah. Optimism isn't always a good thing
---
Actually doing a Sprint before you jump is bad. It will continue draining AP like you are also sprinting. Just jump and tap the button lightly every second or so to fly for a long time. Gonna upload a video later of me flying from the railway elevator that was on Reddit all the way to Defiance. AP regen helps too, you wanna regen fast enough that you get back to full between button presses.
---
I'm looking forward to when they add this, hopefully with balanced weaponry 
---
I have a two shot blackpowder rifle that does 576ish damage with all of the rifleman perks. It can do something like 1400 damage when I use it with the sneak attack perk (damage x 2.5 when undetected) and has a vats bonus as well. If I am still in ranged combat, I switch over to the handmade (no legendary effects but still great damage with the rifle perks). If I am in short range combat I have a two shot pump using the shotgunner perks. Or I simply use an instigating grognaks axe (double damage to full health targets).
---
My strategy mostly consists of doubling a shotgunner and rifleman build, dishing out very high damage with surprise and range attacks and doing a good amount of damage with crowd control/close range combat by shotguns.
---
These are people who have no power in their personal lives so they take it out on people in fictional universes. Probably incels I don't know 
---
My AP doent drain down as if sprinting, only the brief moment I sprint it does.. 
---
I have a laptop with 1060 6gb and I get nearly 60 all the time at 1080p with High settings. Something else must be bottleneckimg your performance. Possibly there is too much heating or your processor isn't keeping up.
---
That seems a little racist lol
---
I've played plenty of games where I'm very social but I stopped using a mic quite a while ago and I don't feel like hooking one up again.
---
I still play multiplayer games where I socialize over chat but there is no text chat in this game.
---
I one shot the Mothman after I came across it on a cliff in the savage divide;
---
It just popped up when I was wandering around.
---
I don’t understand you’re apparent agitation.  My facts significantly reduce the time spent repairing and collecting junk for destroyed CAMPS.  
---
I periodically stuff the register in Flat Woods with stuff I don't need or want.
---
It's part of trade. In no way is it ever discouraged or forbidden by Bethesda, or any company with an online game. Find me where it says in any EULA that you can't trade items to your self. 
---
But apparently not against the rules to promote yourself by dropping all of his ill gotten gains. 
---
It's literally how the game can be played, learn to interact with people better.  Behave yourself.  Don't contact me again, you're toxic.  
---
I agree. Mods aren't scrapped if you have enough steel. I have tried it many many times on purpose to see if I could get them to scrap and it doesn't happen. I tried variations of mods on my inventory and steel scrap in stash and it always chose junk items first and only the mods once there was not any other options left.
---
Thats how legendaries works once they go under 50% hps for first time, they will regen. Behemonds are not so hard. Still better than bugged flying bitches, that never register damage they should get. Fuck scorchbeast, praise behemonds!!
---
Yes that's good if you still have them both. I will message you when I log in today
---
OK but that's not whats being discussed.  
---
Yeah but I don't care about bobby pin weight etc. I care about stuff that makes the game less fun for the people playing it.
---
Because sometimes you havent found all the pieces yet, but you see shocks on a vendor and buy it immediately because you know its rare. Also, some people are stockpiling them for when player vending is added.
---
What platform are you on???
---
Mods PLEASE can we start requiring a flair for platform. It would really help with sorting stuff like this out for feedback purposes...
---
I wonder how many people will voice these kinds of opinion on the one hand and then keep a duper’s dropped stash on the other?
---
Yea thats true. I think most of the people are gonna be dropping the full 600lbs of stash to put on an alt due to necessity from end game loot
---
I've noticed your AP won't regen while in the air if you Sprint into the jump. I could be wrong though, I'll test it again next time it get on.
---
Yea that would be good too since even picking someones lock gives you a bounty. Would make sense to do the same with followers/companions.
---
(Copied from previous reply)
---
Yes It’s Frustrating that our Fraternity is Filled with Fiends Finding Frivolous Fun in inFuriating our Fellow Farmhands and Pharmacists trying to Find a Foothold in these Formerly Flourishing Forests.
---
This would be perfect. They could also do the mailig just like ESO. 
---
They should. But balancing is an issue.
---
Gg. Im stuck permanently overweight from picking up everything I find. Weapons, armor, chems. You name it, I probably have it. I sell at discount prices compared to vendors. Or if you don't want to buy stuff.. I kill you and add to my collection. Level 140 btw. Gotta stay fresh ya know. 
---
One way in, one way out.  You either fast travel to get out or blow up a wall.  all doors close behind you 
---
10 bucks?
---
A bit of a silly question don’t you think?
---
Yeah I've just quit any time a scorchbeast sees me. Bethesda seriously needs to do a rework of those pointless, lootless, screechy flycunts
---
Well if the server crashes too often, i wont do that event yet
---
I was in my house crafting the other day when I heard someone walking around outside. They opened the front door and dropped a loot bag, waved then ran off. Nicest person I've met yet.
---
Does for me, I regen inbetween taps of thrust just fine...
---
I think you my point got lost because I was also applying the people that want learned plans to be account wide as well. if everything is shared an alt becomes pointless if there was a faster was to respec special points rather than one per level.
---
While you are just saying items in stash should be shared acrossed account, but the stash is not nor will be infinite. Maybe an "automated" mail service if you build a mailbox at your camp would be better? then you could even send stuff to friends and such.
---
Yeah when you have this bug if you look at the food stats it says food 0% so you know the food isn’t going to help you increase your bar. You need to restart the game. 
---
OK I'll add you. Thanks. 
---
An Equally Elegant Example
---
Tell your gf that we're all sorry for her experience and if she was on PC I'd come guard her camp while she builds. We all would I wager. 
---
I have behemoth spawn under my camp, sometimes he is legendary. I have just normal melee build more about sneak than massive damage. My machete have 170 writen damage and with sneak attacks it takes like 10hits? Not that hard. With bloodied/TSE it must be super easy.
---
Isnt Gauss great for sniper build?
---
How can I assist. YOU. TODAY!
---
If you’re on Xbox I can build all of that for you
---
&gt; My comments are always constructive.
---
Yeah, this isn’t going anywhere.
---
Junkies is just too bad an effect at the moment, so I'd be surprised if you could get much for it, even with the current rarity value.
---
I'm curious about the 2-shot hunting rifle. How close do the two bullets land? Does it matter much what mods you put on it? I only find two-shot heavy weapons so I can't test.
---
An Instigating lever rifle is a really good primary sniper, but if you can land double headshots with the hunting rifle then there's no advantage. The 2-shot hunting rifle may also out-dpm the +25% fire rate lever rifle considering reload time.
---
We’re all weirdly welcome in the wasteland fellow wanderer 
---
Alrighty, I might be wrong then on that.
---
Last night I took out a solid ~80% of her HP bar (combined, she regen'd a few times obv) over about 15 minutes with my furious faster firing Gatling gun in a kill. 
---
There was a short period while she landed where her house bugged out and she wasn't taking any damage. About a minute after she stopped taking damage she took off and healed, then everything was fine again. 
---
I guess sometimes she bugs out.
---
I dont like this.. Whatever meta build is popular will dictate player choice in factions if boosts are present.
---
It was fixed with the recent patch problem is if you have already been to those locations, you cant discover them again so you have to make an alt and re explore each area that is missing from the challenge.
---
Thanks for the feedback guys!
---
Personally I'm saving mine up.  The last thing I bought was the blackbird PA paint,  which was an expensive  time limited item that I liked the look of.  
---
If you’re getting griefed more than once by the same person you’re not playing it right.
---
Greifers parsdise would be if you couldn’t block/change servers and your base persisted when you log out. 
---
Junk is so easy to come by repairing is a small inconvenience
---
Theres a lake under the mono elevator. Can place two camps at either end. Not what you posted for, but comes pretty close. 
---
It's called PvP, not griefing.
---
Obviously I am suggesting they replace it with an easier challenge or add some variety, not suggesting they remove 1/5 of the daily challenges altogether.
---
I can't find an answer to Challenge bug from the link.
---
Only thing was Achievements/Trophies.
---
Still kind of new to 76, as i’m lvl 16, but why wouldn’t one just leave the world at any sign of threat like this? Enter a new world and your camp is fine and no one around you. 
---
I have my camp in a pretty hard to reach and out of the way area, but if i notice someone close by I wait to see what they’re gonna do. Some high level player looked around, gave me a thumbs up and bailed, but another time two high levels started smashing my walls with sledge hammers. I left the world, came back, and it was all good. 
---
Doesnt matter till they fix bobble head stacking
---
I lost my t60 shocks to repairing the extractors during Uranium Fever.  No messages or warnings where it was grabbing the steel from there.  Only buy mods if you are immediately installing them is my new rule. 
---
Am Canadian. I have no doors and never thought about shutting other's doors. Sorry. 
---
Damn, I'm down to do that on PC if that means it'll get those fucks to stop messing with low levels.
---
It’s solely based on what you like in the store.
---
I don't play with them at all anymore.  I grinded for one, got it and game got boring.  I literally lost interest in exploring the rest of the game.  I ran out to a empty area dropped it and hopped servers.  Now I'm having fun again. 
---
If you build a character based on one weapon, it's broken.  I have a couple lvl 60-80 toons and playing with the other more balanced legendary perks works just fine.  
---
Plus, if you don't play with TSE you don't have to play the grind whitesprings, nuke zone meta game!  
---
Imo: easy fix.  Move explosive to primary prefix slot and remove perk bonus.  Game fixed.
---
How do u get  perks like these on gun? Newbie lvl 17 question and lover of Gauss
---
Laser musket
---
Where is this Delbert's trailer?
---
Same its happening to me, maybe if we create a new lvl 1 character, then maybeeee, you with the help of a friend, tp to the locations you are missing with this new character. Ill try it tonight or tomorrow, if I found it works, I let you known
---
Hate server hopping but spending over 100 caps to fast travel around the map at level 50 seems legit? save your caps buddy.
---
well I watched couple of reviews and people talk like this game is worst shit ever. I'm not a cheapstake I buy like 5-10 AAA games every with full prices but no matter where I look I always saw extremely bad things about this game. I just bite it and bought the game anyways
---
there is only one thing I really want from the atom store. the laminated floorboards. I have saved over 3000 atoms and still havent bought it because I keep expecting something really good and really expensive to pop up.
---
and then will that happens I probably still wont buy it because I will expect something better to pop up and the cycle continues.
---
If you want something buy if not dont. dont think you have to use the points just because you have them.
---
Harpers Ferry also has a relatively high chance of Excavator shocks. I think I got three from there and three from Camden/Welch/Lewisburg,
---
Sadly without sufficiently sustainable sustenance we will surly succumb to starvation.
---
Idk it happened in FO4 and for some reason they kept it going in 76. 
---
I’m sorry dude but I’m gonna have to disagree. If they didn’t give a fuck, they wouldn’t be dropping all these patches. Did they competently and quickly handle the duping? Naw, they didn’t. But they are doin SOMETHING about it. Dupers deserve a ban. Just because an exploit is there, doesn’t mean it should be done. People gotta police themselves sometimes. If not, then they gotta just eat the consequences.
---
I caught a guy leveling my camp and one shot him with my one star legendary bloodied super sledge lol.  He dropped so much scrap so it paid for itself.  He came back but I hopped servers was fun though lol
---
Haha, sadly no, as my Spanish isn't good.
---
I am waiting for better power armor skins 
---
All PvP in a PvP game is willing PvP.
---
heavy weapon is harpoon 
---
I’m doing the same, saving up I mean.  
---
Remember that Bethesda said you won’t be able to buy anything but cosmetics in the atom shop. So no stash expansions or the like I’d wager as it gives you an unfair advantage over those who can’t buy it, or pay to win basically. Unless you’ve heard any different. There still a lot to come though, if the data mines are anything to go by.
---
J think he meant "What kind of gun is the harpoon gun? Is it heavy?" or something like that 
---
And...that's why I quit playing this game. People are so bored the only fun thing they have to do is blow up other people's shit.
---
Like the weather channel Damage on the 8s
---
CanadianToday, sorry man. You can’t win on this sub, people don’t grasp the concept that it’s just a game. It sounds like they think it is some kind of simulation which brings out our deepest darker sociopathic desires. 
---
Haha duper’s = not okay
---
People destroying what they thought were duper’s = not okay
---
Having an alternate opinion about a game = not okay
---
Going against the hive mind that is r/f76 = not okay
---
Playing a game that is online, having fun and doing what *you* want to do = not okay
---
Yea my game crashes a lot too, and Im gonna try server hopping for missing quests thanks! My connection is usually good I don’t have problems with any other games, also yesterday I hopped on with a buddy to drop the nuke, we did everything until we had to punch in the alpha codes which for some reason disappeared out of our inventory, we’ve been trying to drop it for so long that this made us stop playing the game for a while. 
---
Super sledge and a war drum for when the super sledge inevitable breaks.
---
I suppose not at least it makes for good humor.
---
Sounds Good. Do you have a nukedragon build you could link to me?
---
Idk if I'd say that, scorched are pretty spongey for not wearing armor. And Gulpers are some how more spongey than Deathclaws which makes no sense. 
---
I agree. Also on xBox here and it sucks.  I was hoping it would be like night vision in some of their other games and it’s not.  It is really lame.  I don’t even use it. 
---
Xbox here got some water(no rads), food(no rads) sorm free ammo of stuff I don't use. Anti armor hook pole I can give you.
---
I assume achievements work in the same way as the in-game challenges in that your progress was only tracked starting with the release of the game itself despite what your character did during BETA.
---
Do you have a link to your build?
---
Stop watching little boys you creep.
---
Yeah, personally, the whole battle royale thing can just die with the ship, captain.
---
I did 150+ run on a level 90 char at Grafton for BOS Chest, but I got on my 15 and 1/1 for it there. Others have said the loot pools may change weekly like the nuke codes. Food for thought
---
You’re both wrong. You should be trading directly to your friend to hold it and then switch servers. Anything else is taking a chance and only the MOST valuable items are worth doing this. Shit like resources are so insanely plentiful (lol survival) that shifting those around is totally pointless unless it’s insane amounts which again justifies not dropping it on the ground or putting it in a public container and just hoping the server doesn’t take a shit. 
---
Any of the duper witch hunting posts that show up on the front page of this subreddit are obnoxious as fuck to begin with, Beth can't trace any of them so nobody's going to get banned, with the few exceptions maybe being the ones that showed off their goods like an idiot.
---
Maybe Bethesda should fix their own shit first or voice their side of the problem before we start playing judge jury and executioner
---
By closed it means that it shouldn’t spawn Scorchbeast. 
---
I feel most play 76 for the pve. It's wouldn't be a good idea for them to force pvp on those people as much as I hate to admit. I would like shoot on sight, let us make are on laws ect, a true wasteland. But yeah not ideal for the majority of the player base. 
---
Yes, they really need to fix core burn rates so that you are forced to spec into power user to use PA.
---
Batteries included is legitimately the only "always equipped" PA perk you need to use PA, and I'm sure others would actually argue it's not even necessary either. 
---
Personally I've found that the builds that are the most fun are those with the highest maintenance. I always have something to do on my PA Heavy character to keep him going.
---
I quit playing my non PA melee character because I never had to loot or craft anything, which turns a kill, loot, craft game into a kill, kill, kill game that simply gets boring.
---
No really I one shot everything exept the queen. The other mobs in the game are not challenging at all.
---
Yes!!! This idea has great momentum if we can keep it up it'll be legendary. 
---
Something similar is attempted on sea of thieves but it works infinitely better with fallout
---
The trick for me so far has been to use a set of armor that each piece gives -8% damage from players, and -15% damage while standing still. I use the pneumatic torso mod to lower chance of being staggered.
---
I combine that with the fireproof rank 3 and adamantium skeleton perk rank 3. (Which prevents limb damage, a huge source of being staggered)
---
Even with my explosive and weapon damage perks, and lone wanderer if solo and I can still take very minimal damage from shooting an explosive shotgun at my feet. For that matter, *most* other enemy attacks do absolutely nothing to me, providing I am standing completely still. Crouching, jumping, or being pushed in combat by melee will make me briefly vulnerable. Radiation/poison/bleed also hurts.
---
That is what I was hoping for.  On xBox it is terrible though.  
---
Save his caps for what exactly.  Seriously there is no end game cap expenditure if you have the mutations you want everything else is cheap enough to buy with a single day of vendor hopping.  I cant spend my caps fast enough at this point sometimes i buy bulk materials because i dont feel like farming and still sitting at 19k caps.
---
A much needed downside of using TSE weapons. Goes from zero skill required, to having to time your shots.
---
Ahhh, I guess that makes sense.
---
I do it nearly every day... Usually the overseer's camp, Flatwoods church, or I'll find newer players and give them supplies (ammo, food, water, plans, healing salve)
---
I've came through this. Feels bad, bud.
---
Ia that rhetorical? Obviously you're going to be bummed.
---
But you grinded for it for one reason and one reason only, because it's outrageously overpowered. 
---
You knew it. I know it. 
---
My two shot plasma rifle, two shot +50% limb damage handmade and anti armor lever action 2-3 shot everything. Even that is relatively overpowered when you factor in my stealth build. If I had a TSE, I wouldn't even dump the points into intelligence to satsify a ridiculous mechanic. If they could, they should remove the explosive affix entirely and just reroll it into another affix. 
---
I have not experienced this glitch.  But I never keep uncooked crops on my person so when I go to repair all it shows I can’t.  I end up scrapping the broken crops first anyway because of it.  Hmmmm I’ll need to check that out.
---
Well Borderlands didn't have PvP. That's most of it. Also, the exploits are rumored to cause server instability and sometimes crash it completely. Bethesda also intends to add playing vending soon. Some people who have duped have thousands of top end weapons, armor, serums, pretty much everything. The economy will suffer from deflation an honestly already has. Anybody with 6k caps or less has access to extremely powerful weapons. Weapons that could take a person playing normally hundreds or thousands of hours to find organically. They're pretty much everywhere now. The people who tried to avoid these exploited weapons, armor, serums, ect. are at a disadvantage to people who see no wrong in using duped weapons. Of course, it wouldn't all be *that* bad if PvP was more balanced. A two shot explosive auto shotgun will just melt anything you point it in the general direction of. This causes some iffy gameplay; PvP and PvE alike
---
My Double Shot Auto Grenadelauncher and the shotgun Teslarifle
---
Is animal friend in charismatic
---
I have an instigating spear, and once I’ve landed a hit, if it’s tanking, I’ll quick swap to either my suppression or furious depending on if it’s hurting me or not.
---
Yeah could be. According to some reddit posts, people have made tickets about the issues. Hopefully we see them fixed in near future
---
I’m not entirely clear on all the details, but this is what I’ve gathered so far.
---
Because of the way the economy works and the way items are stored in the game. Each player has a limit as to how much they can carry craft and store at one time. When a player spawns on a server, the game also has to spawn in their items and camp. Obviously. This is typical for games like this.
---
Players spawning in with huge inventories stuffed with 1000s of dupe items is causing the server to stutter and destabilize. Players with weaker internet connections then get the unfortunate side effect of getting disconnected from the server. 
---
Many games like this attempt to prevent this by assigning ID numbers to items to orient multiples from spawning in. FO76 doesn’t do this or doesn’t do this well enough.
---
This can be a pain in the ass, because there is no easy way in the UI to quickly get back into a game. Especially frustrating when you’re playing with a group. Unless you friended the probably stranger you started playing with it’s several menu prompts and loading screens to get back in. Some people don’t have the patience for that.
---
 If there is one or two duper’s spawning in on a server, it’s not too bad, barely noticeable. Unfortunately, one of the last patches Bethesda attempted to apply has a workaround that requires two people to perform the glitch. So the problem arises when you have multiple individuals or groups on a server, many of them camping the server all day, rotating in and out. It’s gotten to 5e point where some servers are populated entirely by groups of dupers. You can usually tell pretty quickly, because everything in the world will be off and glitches will be abundant.
---
Now I’m not saying this is something that happens to everyone all the time. After all, every problem always gets amplified on the internet. But it has happened enough that everyone who plays will potentially encounter the issue at least once. But it’s usually pretty noticeable and you can just switch to a new server, but this isn’t easy to do. You have to back out to the menu and renter. 
---
It’s just one problem in a myriad of other problems that is compounding and frustrating some people. Overall I’m enjoying the game, and the issues, for me at least, seem to be getting less and less of a burden. Disconnects and glitches don’t happen for me as often as they did in the beginning. 
---
Eventually, i think the issues will be fixed and this game will grow on people again. But that all depends how Bethesda handles everything going forward, especially on the marketing and pr front. As for the game itself. It’s really not as bad as people make it out to be, at least in my personal experience.
---
Do you have more ?
---
I  do it when i sell stuff at vendors, the stuff i cant sell i just dispose in suitcases or some other containers
---
Destroying buildings is not PvP. It makes you wanted by everyone in the server not just the person who's stuff you destroyed. It is 100% considered griefing and carries the same penalty as attacking someone repeatedly without them fighting back. 
---
The Ultracite Gatling Laser actually does more damage than the regular GL, thanks in part to being a level 50 weapon instead of level 45.
---
Save it for when the hot rod flame paint or black PA paint appear in the shop again. They are listed as "limited time" for 1 day usually. Just bait to buy atoms essentially.
---
That's weak, the real Torque is about #MORE  EXPLOSIONS!
---
I would have to stop playing Fallout 76 to avoid them entirely. ;-D
---
I just keep running or duck into a large building, eventually they will leave you alone and the damage their splash attack does is minimal. May have to waste 1 stimpak before they finally give up. 
---
Glad it helped! Makes me wish this game was more popular. Other popular games release detailed instructions and help to finish challenges. It's tough to get some information for this game
---
So because recovering from someone else's inflicted misery is a small matter, that makes inflicting the misery ok?
---
Wow...
---
I was wondering if items placed in world containers was persistent for this very purpose. Good to know that they are.
---
In what way is this title not descriptive? Have you played this game?
---
Only trying to offer up options
---
same here
---
Hey there! Not sure if this would be of any help or not, but about 45-90 mins ago I had 3 CTD while exploring Wade Airport, first time I had came over from McClintock, second and third times happen right after relog and walking towards the airport. All this happen within 10 minutes. 
---
Ended up doing the unplug controller and fast travelling to my camp, plug control back in and it works.
---
But I still haven't tried to go back to the airport in fear of another crash.
---
   BTW love the game.
---
I've also been treated like shit and called a dupper simply because I said deleting all duped weapons were not a good way to fix the problem since it would affect legit players who bought dupped items with their hard earned caps!
---
The guy then said I "seeked" dupers to sell me cheap stuff. 
---
I'm toxic and should not tell people how to play the game.
---
Says the guy griefing people for playing the game the way they want to.
---
Rumor is that after patching a specific duping exploit, dupers are now making use of a more harmful duping method that crashes the entire server. 
---
Where did I say it was ok?
---
This would work, too. But at this point, it basically IS a PVE server...
---
If you have the mutations marsupial and bird bones you can try climbing a closed off mountain and no one will bother you if this becomes an excessively common problem 
---
What's the advantage or winning from having stash? I mean we should all have bigger stash sizes, but if somebody wants to pay to have 1000 more that gives no advantage or winning.
---
1) how do you message people in this game
---
2) what does "I know it was a stash" mean? and how does that relate to duping?
---
Yeah. To be PvP it has to be willing and the other person has to go along with it, otherwise it's murder and they get a bounty on their head. 
---
they didn't
---
They were a bit fast and loose with the lore.
---
\- Grafton Monster was created by FEV but I think since it fits the description of the legend, it's safe to assume that's how it got it's name, not necessarily meaning that the legend turned out to be true. Now, Mothman on the other hand, could very well be that the legend turned out to be true, it just took for the nuclear apocalypse to finally find out. Wendigos are, if i remember correctly ghoulified cannibals that originated from the Gourmand raider tribe? I might need some clarification on that one. We don't know what exactly Snallygasters are comprised of, but we know centaurs are a combination of crap plopped together, so its an assumption that they are somewhat similar.
---
\-West Coast BOS probably had their hands full, especially with the emergence of The Master, and events taking place there. They were still in their infancy so it may have not been capable of sending a force that they may not get back. With the comms down, they would have eventually lost contact with whomever they sent to check, so it would probably be a suicide mission at that point. The BIGGEST reason I can think of for why the current East/West coast BoS doesn't seem to know about it is simply the passage of time, and that the BoS dosn't seem to be very good at keeping records and maintaining their own history. There's accounts of Legion troops capturing BoS members and then making a remark saying that they don't even know who the founder, Roger Maxson is. So there is a disconnect in that originally, BoS was trained from existing military who know the ins and outs, culture, history etc. The newer ones had been recruited fresh from the population, so they probably forgo historical training and focus on combat readiness. 
---
\-The FEV strain on the east coast differed from the one at Mariposa/The Master. These supermutants continue to grow, so without being unchecked it can be assumed that they can grow that big. There is also speculation that behemoths were children, so when they hit puberty they grew super quick. Nothing specifies how long it takes them to grow, but since nothing specifically implies that, that also means nothing denies it as well. 
---
If stackable that’ll sincerely be some serious savings
---
Fucking Fallout fanboys foiling my fun.
---
Being 1shot by someone using vats and a TSE weapon grinds my gears so bad
---
True, but PVP is broken anyway. They really need to rework it so not everyone is 1-shotting each other.
---
Thats not a good reason. If so many more people prefer one mode over the other, thats very telling. If PVP is so unpopular here that those servers end up empty, then perhaps its not a good fit for this game. But thats no reason to refuse to allow an opt out.
---
I wouldnt mind if they added respect like they have in ESO. I remember someone talking about adding that machine from the beggining of New Vegas into 76 as a way to change up the special stats. For a price of course.
---
there must be something else, since I've scrapped jet pack and stealth boy while having safe amount of steel and never bulked it
---
Raiders of justice, good job dishing out what they deserved to those people extorting lower levels. I'm on PC myself so I havn't personally seen much if any toxicity like this; most people here avoid eachother except at vendors.
---
When the game was in beta, I had ghouls lag port at me a couple times and I nearly shit my pants every time
---
That's called PvP. Welcome to the wasteland.
---
they were for sale I guess
---
Putting a block on bases wouldn’t stop farming.
---
Eternally Irritating Irradiated Idiots
---
Can you drop the tape and pick it back up or no?
---
Yes! Fortunately they only require 1 of each flux to repair. 
---
I just edited to add an example. I think this is also why so many people who played BETA have like 3/76 recipes learned in the challenge tracker.
---
Yes, E-sports ready for sure.... just like pub g 
---
Bobby pin weight reduction is only 1 of the 150 fixes.
---
I hate to agree
---
Agree completely. 
---
Based on posts here, I will venture that very few Fallout fans, are PVP fans. So stop forcing it on us. 
---
And yes a mail box! So simple! Thatd be perfect.
---
Maybe you should. You've been seeking out and watching them for decades, that's a real problem.
---
The way people talk on this subreddit this doesn’t surprise me whatsoever. People here act as though dupers are the biggest scum on earth to the point where they seem to think anyone with a high level or TSE weapons is automatically a cheater. It’s pretty pathetic. 
---
The behavior of this subreddit is toxic but in the opposite direction. It’s like white knighting but at least it’s not sexist as that behavior. I feel pretty confident that’s where the antagonist in this story came from as this is the only place on the internet where I see duping and cheating in this game admonished as much as it is. The other subreddit, YouTube, and Twitch definitely don’t seem to care as much at all. 
---
Sorry this happened to you guys OP but at least they didn’t do anything more griefy. If she needs any supplies lemme know. My lowest level character is 29 and they all have full stashed mats. I’d be happy to help. We can rebuild! As long as the foundations are strong!
---
It's the "no boomstick" rules some people used to have way back when I played COD2.  
---
I actually dropped it from my inventory on accident the other day and picked it back up but I didn't check whether it registered. I will later and report back.
---
From my experience, they can be found in the workshop under "Misc. Structure" but only seem to appear when at a workshop, not at your CAMP
---
I’m the one you’ll need to chase. Creeping clown who breaks into stuff just to be a weirdo. Run around with a chain saw at all hours of the night. Catch me if you can XD
---
Would help alot.
---
I’m sorry this happened to you. This is why I don’t own the fame. This is why I want a single player game to be that. Solo. Most of the time I’d prefer to not deal with anyone else because people are assholes and your time means nothing to them, especially if you simply bought the game six months after they did. See also GTAV.
---
Your definition of pvp must be different from most of us then. PvP to me stands for Player versus Player. In this scenario, I only see Players Versus Building Materials and false accusations to achieve griefing. 
---
Except you can store more of everything. 
---
Meds, bobbleheads, magazines, legendary weapons, duplicated items etc. All of these items assist in the game. 
---
You know I had a feeling I’d have to elaborate on that, but resisted the urge to in case you found it patronising.
---
This just happened to me too. ITS REAL
---
Sorry you had to find out this way.
---
Plot twist: OP is a duper and want to leave him alone.  
---
^(PS:) ^(i am joking.)  
---
I hope your GF ins't too discouraged i hope he may find the magic of this game soon ;)
---
Excellent, thank you!  Can use your image?
---
I like to think of my guy as an ex army soldier, covered in the scars of war and a chelsea smile from his kidnappers. He was locked in a basement when the bombs went off, his kidnappers sipping whisky up above, completely annihilated. He awaited until it was safe and esacaped, making it his destiny to protect and serve Appalachia and its people once again.
---
The battle royale concept needs to die...
---
What's the advantage to having "meds, bobbleheads, magazines, weapons" in your stash where you can't use them?
---
It's already a battle royale for me. Me vs The Servers. I keep losing. 
---
I tested this on my mutated and unmutated character with squad manuevers and gun runner and they didn't stack. Rank 1 of each does stack so I think move speed is just capped. 
---
If its me, don't worry about it, just enjoy the game.  Anything I need, you need more.  
---
I bought mine at the BoS vendor at watoga. If you're on xbox and have the resources plus a small amount of caps, I could make it for you.
---
I just hit level 45 getting the keycard for my first one. I don’t know if I’ll Make it through the silo!
---
COMMUNISM DETECTED
---
But..... you... can use them.
---
I thought the same about hte junkies hunting rifle what which would you pick between the 2 lever actions to be  the  secondary rifle? 
---
The 2 shot hunting rifle seems to do insane amounts of damage from close to med range not so much from long range, may have to do with not the 2 shots landing or because im using a med scope not a long range one.
---
In all cases the huntiing rifle is the better sniper i just wanna know which lever action should i keep
---
thanks but I'm on ps4, also I want the plans for my friends
---
Hey man, you're right. Sucks people don't care what the downvote button is actually meant for.
---
Todd Howard falsely made it seem like team members could pool resources and co-build a big camp. I remember the images at the E3 event, and of course like so much of Fallout 76, the reality is a disappointment.
---
It would and should be a good and very helpful feature, but sadly it’s not.
---
We can only hope..
---
What’s he think about the Responders? Or about who the were I guess you’d say. Lol. 
---
Grow up. Reported and blocked. 
---
Monsters destroy bases too dude.  They even have the nerve to do it while we’re off questing. God help you if you ever set up camp by (or try to claim) Grafton Steel. Place is a super mutant war zone.  
---
Inflicting misery?  Tone it down a bit maybe. 
---
yes, the first time i discovered this, myf riends and i had been complaining for days how weak the tameable level 16 yao guai was, and when i found the level 76 one i was so hype.............
---
Exploits 
---
But... you... can use them.
---
....okay now glowing wendigo came at me. Screw you guys, I'm going home! 
---
I cant answer any of those. All i know is that he can kill like 20 robots to 1, and he can do it while you are trading with him. Quite the multitasker. Whatever he's made of we need more of. 
---
He does show concern though, he always says to be careful of the other robots because they arent BoS robots, implying that he is aware they will attack you. The only thing capable of like.."liking, hating, higher cognitive thinking, etc" are the AI systems, like MODUS. Even MODUS is pretty emotionless, and criticizes ZAX for not focusing on results, as ZAX will reanalyze things he finds "interesting"...foreshadowing how he eventually assimilates the personalities of all US presidents into his own personality, eventually running the Enclave from Raven Rock.
---
I am aware of no other vendors or places who stock it
---
Honestly, everything you get from it (Short of the Achievement) has been duped to Hell.
---
If I could up-vote this twice I would...Too true!
---
I found both of mine in Harper's Ferry
---
I'm continually irked by the previous iterations of the game having us hoard everything, and then suddenly Bethesda turns the game into warehouse manager with FPS, and then a bit of PVP for the people that want that sort of thing (I don't; in my experience every time a game allows PVP it leads to people being knobs and ganking lowbies, which I see nearly every time Whitespring gets nuked).
---
That's nonsensical. By that logic, PvP can't happen between two groups of players. It's Player versus Player, not Players vs Players, Player vs Players or Players vs Player. Player vs Player refers to any game mechanic through which one player can adversely impact another player. You should stick to games that limit player interaction if you're not a fan of it.
---
Yeah np, took it just for you to use
---
Griefing is not PvP. It's being a dick. And you need to learn to read apparently.
---
I was referred to you just now by a trader as to you might be someone to mod out my ultracite armor?
---
One of the beds clips with itself well enough that imo at least if it were a RL bed I'd consider having it. It's one of the metal framed ones - with the rounded/looped head and foot "boards" (not sure if there's another term for that structure when it isn't a plank of wood). The loops of the metal are rather nice and the blankets/sheets look almost like it was always one piece.
---
I've never understood that display. Yeah, I know it is an Anti Armour M2. I put it in my stash about 5 minutes ago when I got back from killing the SBQ. I've been killing SBQ with it since I was level 48 and I'm now level 108. It is my M2. I know it is AA. You tell me EVERY TIME I PICK IT UP FFS!
---
And the positioning of the messages. Oh you've been awarded a piece of armour but are potentially still in combat? Well here look at these stats anyway in the dead center of your screen. 
---
This just happened to me too! Several failed attempts to join the server... then when I'm in long enough to get the map open.. no Camp icon. 
---
I never got a prompt! This still happens it seems. 
---
OP, was your budget close to Max? My base was pretty big. 
---
This really makes me sad, I’m sorry to hear that 
---
Good points. If anything, reports like this show flaws in how both developers introduce new players to PvP. I've noticed both games have self-assigned sherpas that go around helping new players, even. That's kinda telling that something is off balance and/or devs are assuming their playerbase is diehards. I don't think it's anything Bethesda will be able to balance soon with all the other stuff they're dealing with. Like I said in some other comments, I think the real fix will be private servers and clear separation between PvP and PvE. The pacifist and slap damage is just a band-aid for broken system that was not fleshed out.
---
He thinks they were good at what they were doing and their spirit, but he believes they were not trained enough and didnt get the right education on what they were getting themselves into, my guy is a hard man, the responders wanted to save lives and keep people happy, but he wants to make sure the responders dont need anything to respond to anymore, get rid of the threats completely 
---
Thats great
---
Greg in Grafton sells BoS paint for combat armor reliably
---
Destroying buildings isn't griefing. It's part of the PvP mechanics. Welcome to the wasteland.
---
I recommend herbivore. Plant a nice bunch of razorgrain at your camp and as long as you also have an easy source of boiled water you will have free razorgrain soup for days and it both quenches thirst while alleviating hunger at the same time.
---
they were probably dupers who were griefing and fucking with you.
---
This patch is suppose to fix that 
---
My problem is that I tend to get dropped back in the same server or one that already has bats circling.
---
Is Harper's Ferry a hard area for younger level players?
---
Flatwoods
---
My two babies. A two shot explosive pump. And a two shot Gatling gun. 
---
Oh 
---
The guys GT was GHOSTRAPTOR GER 
---
Got a screenshot of it?
---
And this is why I dont touch online Fallout.
---
It's no where on the map and according to all info on the game since back to beta, the Forrest was supposed to be beginning level area. I've been playing since the first beta and have never seen scorchbeasts in the Forrest before, or unmarked fissures. 
---
If i remember right u can get the regular combat armor plans when u finish the freestates mission. I got the Heavy Combat armor Arms plans from the Monster Mash Event at Watoga Highschool. Others posted that they got Heavy combat armor  plans from some BOS events. The Plans for the BoS Combat armor mod can u buy at the Graffton Vendor. Hope this helps.
---
"Murder"
---
Ok you're in the middle of a fight. You run out of ammo, and those chems that are so important that you can basically one shot everything except SBQ without them. How is having 10,000 ammo and 10,000 chems in your stash going to help you?
---
Simple modern bed plan. Should be able to find it at the whitesprings vendor
---
By Aaronholt farm. There's nothing to farm out of it tho. 
---
Yeah let me get it 
---
You realise the game is more than just an isolated pvp encounter right?
---
Damn roasted
---
this sounds a lot more fun than watoga/golf club farming.
---
thanks for the tip 
---
So far it only seems to come from the Vendor.  Trust issues are overblown, the trade window is pretty safe.   
---
You can score one for a few thousand caps or you can farm the bot.  It’s easier and far more likely to succeed with a friend.  Just don’t keep his inventory open while you wait for your friend to load in, he seems to die quicker.   
---
Grey means you haven't gotten close enough to it for it to mark on your map. Dark yellow I guess just to distinguish it. This one is not on the map anywhere
---
Mind enlightening me as to which site you found it on? Want to pick it up for a friend.
---
Any office or medical facility will generally have a ton of battered clipboards which if I'm not mistaken have springs.
---
Who said anything about PvP?
---
I think the problem is how do they scale for solo and team. 
---
Thank you. Now I can redo my list so I don’t buy the same plans again. 
---
I believe the furnature merchant in the whitespring sells it. I dont know the exact title, I know it's not the fancy or hospital bed
---
Thats the only place to get it. They only go for like 2k from people now though
---
I would add to this two outcomes with the better outcome being when you used purified water. 
---
Remove all Legendary items, balance the SQ damage to base weapons, Game fixed!  No more duping, 
---
No more wasted  perk points in crafting abilities, 
---
No more broken PvP, 
---
No more Spamming nukes on whitesprings, 
---
No more broken market, 
---
No no more laughably easy quest 
---
Game Fixed!
---
Yes, unlocked at level 30
---
Okay.... you realise the game is more than just an isolated combat encounter right? 
---
Stand in front of them
---
I'm up to 2600 or so. I finally got my T-60 set, so I may start checking the paint jobs. I bought a cowboy hat early on and found one in-game later that day. \*sigh\*
---
Charleston vendor bot is only way. Keep at it. Run to bridge, turn around, hit VATS—if no vendor bot or eye bot guard pop up... then leave world and try again. It’s an ass pain. I watched a movie while doing it over and over. 
---
u wot, I'm overencumbered ALL the time but I ain't duping
---
Yeah, I play with a very low level friend, I am 101. When we stop by  my base, if people start coming our way, we just log out. I looked one time and 6 lvl 100+ were coming directly towards us. I am intentionally near nothing, there was no reason for them to be coming our way other than to troll or accuse us of duping. Way to, runing the game for everyone now. 
---
Ummm, how do I post pictures lol, I'm a big reddit noob 
---
Cheers for the help, I'll give these all a try 
---
NOPE! All your fault u/thegryphonator! You must have clicked the wrong button. /end_sarcasm
---
My camp was close to budget, but not right at the limit. I honestly think this has something to do with server connections, and the game is not even notifying us that our bases are in jeopardy of vanishing if we continue (because I definitely did not get a notice of any kind). OR, because of the server disconnects, our bases are somehow lost in cyberland and no longer communicating with the server.
---
I did notice when I opened my Pip-Boy after the disappearance, my Z-button was "Move C.A.M.P.", even though my base was vanished. So I'm wondering if it is simply always "Move C.A.M.P." (even when you don't already have a base), or if it was "Move" for me because somewhere out there in cyberspace my camp was still showing as existing, but simply not loading in to the server?
---
I just put in a ticket for the missing motors. Just hit this issue last night with 3/5 but today they are all gone. Sorry for bumping this. I guess the main quest is still broken. Thank god nobody does the \*main\* quest. /s
---
Sentinel/cavalier armor
---
ur welcome!
---
Duper logic. Nice!  Glad to see all cheaters think a like.
---
Torquemada75. Sorry on now 
---
My character is an ex doctor who was one of the “best and brightest” and made it into vault 76 who then realized what needed to be done to help with the whole scorch problem, one by making themselves immune to it and also becoming a general in the enclave so they can launch nukes to eradicate the scorched and stop what many others tried to but failed 
---
I found a White clean outfit in the same room the Brown one spawns. On the other side in the other bunkroom I found a Green one.
---
Getting CTD every few hours on ps4 now as well.  Granted by that point I really needed a break anyway.
---
So I should be punished? 
---
Such a cool questline
---
Can't WAIT for lighter bobby pins on console /s
---
I actually found it after 30 or so server hops!
---
The only reason I've been saving mine is .. well look at what's in the shop. No offense I'm sure some artist spent some time on making all these 'fine' items on the store but not my style in the slightest.
---
I did buy the face paints, well the cool ones, but yeah .. We need more raider/waste lander stuff, like broken gun skins and a dope tattered flag to wear on a stick on our back like that guy from mad max .. he had doll heads hanging from it which was dope or sunglasses that beep the closer you are to females, maybe sprays them with chloroform when they get close or a CAMP laser light show projector thing, you know cool stuff.
---
Also keep in mind they do temp. sales/discounts from time to time so save enough to make an impulse buy.
---
No just helps with repairs
---
it'll use your mods before it uses your bulk. bulking steel is the issue 
---
&gt; If there is no world container in the area I look for a bag
---
so if i run up to a level 2-10 dude and start dropping plans and items you are gonna attack? i do it all the time
---
I have too, and I’ve found them. There’s a lot

Actually yes. I recently had some dude just give me some TSE shotgun. I know it was duped - people are nice, and people  can be lucky but nobody is nice and lucky enough to have multiple TSE weapons to hand out to strangers (gave my partner a TSE handmade, gave another player something else which was likely another TSE something judging by the pattern established and the emotes, lol).
---
Anyway, I played around with it and I don't really like it. It's neat, but it just feels... Idk. Boring. And when it was the both of us using them at the same time, after a brief period of being amused at mowing down some supermutants, it was just like... Well okay. There's that.
---
I think even if it didn't have duper cooties I'd still not really enjoy using it. I'm not sure if I'm going to dump it in the middle of nowhere or if I'll keep it around in stash in case I ever really need to kick some griefer ass (assuming they aren't then specced to be able to shrug it off). Definitely not toting it around though.
---
yes it does weigh less
---
I've been leaving my bags on the counter in front of the vendor bot so it's VERY easy for new players to see. Only when there is an actual player nearby, otherwise I'll hold onto it until then.
---
I'm with you. I love this game, but the disconnects happen very frequently since the last patch and it's getting really frustrating.
---
I finally found the Deep Pocketed Combat Armor Chest plan on a vendor this morning. I learned the plan... and about 30 seconds later I was disconnected. When I reconnected? Nope... the game says I've never learned it. And it wasn't in my inventory either.
---
Always worth the bounty to level a turret farm base behind the golf club
---
I said 'murder' because it's the term Bethesda used when they described the bounty system. Deal with it. 
---
I think returning the favour to new players or low levels is a good way of keeping the good train rolling. Chooo Choo all aboard 
---
No, I dont attack anyone. I will run to the bag and see what's inside. Tons of stuff, I take all and dashboard. 
---
Xxplayinsuckyxx I'll be on tonight got a good group of guys we play. Together all the time we will help. Got a Mic?
---
Same goes for some crafting .. tried making a few items earlier but with exact ingredients it wouldn't let me, I had to have more than required to make them.
---
Nah that new perk fixed that. They can shoot you point blank now with no damage to them.
---
How are you going to amass thousands of ammo and chems? Do you have to do more work to get them? More farming? How is that an advantage? It's just a different use of time. Somebody wants to prepare and have stuff available. And Atoms are free in game, as if anyone couldn't get them if they wanted to. But I would personally pay $20 for 1000 stash.
---
no, sorry. just the excavator Cali shocks
---
This being said in the game has me hopeful that later on in the games life that we will get actual gangs comming back into the area. Yes, even if they said no human npcs originally, things can change. Get boring fighting the same stuff over and over again. 
---
I agree and think the server issue is to blame as well. Normally the "move camp" button has a cap cost.. I think depending on where or how far away from the previous camp it is. After my base disappeared, there was no cost to move the camp. 
---
I put my new camp down, and my previous camp was chunked up in the Stored tab.  No way in hell ill be able to attach it all back. It was very specific to the wall it was hugging. 
---
I'll certainly be taking more frequent photos from now on.  
---
Thank you! It's one of my favorite parts too!
---
Super mutant behemoths are in this game?
---
Plenty of people do like pvp though, some even like the "griefing" aspect as part of the game. (not as griefers but as something that happens)
---
So if by chance they split the player base with pvp and pve server and pve servers had so little players they shut them down (a long shot? sure, but certainly possible) and we are back to square one, what then? Splitting the player base on a game like this is no good, and would actually kill the game more than having it as is. Does pvp need work? always. even if people didnt claim pvp is broken and will doom the game it would still need work. It always needs tweaking as players learn new tactics or exploits are found or just to keep things from going stale.
---
Personally I get more annoyance out of the pve mobs that spawn and attack your camp since the budget is so low you can either build defenses or build a camp. I have yet to have players attack my camp.
---
that's not true. it does weigh less to bulk. 
---
&gt;eye bot guard
---
So that eye bot (white) that i have seen several times means he is close ? not the one with the rats after it,, but the one that just flies around ?
---
If you're on PS4 I can sell you one. I have a spare but sadly don't have 2 
---
I was gonna but I thought I'd let someone else. Thanks for stopping by!
---
All Rise for Black Diamond!
---
I've been looking to,closest thing I found were ultracite knuckles from the queen,lol
---
&gt; Dont give this game a year, unless major changes are made. Some of them to Bethesda management.
---
long as they put out some updates people can play it liek single player, i think most do anyways. i play like single player and team with a few friends. we never interact with anyone else because there is no text chat, the emotes suck basically and voice chat is on team.
---
If you are gonna cheat, then accept the consequences for getting caught.  If your dumb enough to say hey Bethesda look at me flagrantly breaking your rules on a public forum, then you get what you got. If you find glitches like this by accident, then send it to Bethesda directly so the can fix it, not the to the world so they can cheat the game.
---
This would be nice.  When players replaced NPC I figured we’d be able to build communities with our camps.  I want to be able to at least build next to my friends so we create a small down.  
---
You can add me I might be on later as well my gt is blehblah
---
The max is fine, it’s not as if you want to be carrying a shit ton of purified water at one time (I usually carry up to 100 at a time, but that’s besides the point). And you only need 4 waters to fill up your characters thirst bar, anyway.
---
I mean you do have your camp in whitesprings... 
---
Ive got a mic but i just a nervous talker,but that would be amazing, ill add you now
---
There is a responder eye bot, responder protection, and the pied piper eye bot that spawn — as soon as you see any of those, re-load because it’s not the vendor bot. 
---
Does anyone know if you move your camp after taming if it will stay? Like would it disappear into the stash or walk to the next location?
---
Ok. I'll be on in about an hour if your still there. 
---
I've gotten around 5k atoms since I've been playing, but I would suggest waiting until you see something that either is gonna be a sick piece you're gonna use all the time (Blackbird/Daredevil), a bundle that feels like you're getting value (Santa/elf bundle) or something that seems like it's going to be a continuing theme you can pick up over time (Red Rocket Sign/Garage Door)
---
this was a great quest line i hope they do more like this in the future
---
If you are on rn I'll be on in about an hour
---
Cheers! Quite a few people have been in touch already looking for carnage. Should be having a good number of Hunter/hunted games over the coming weeks. Bring it!
---
I like the effort you put into this and it does work well for those starting out, especially before we realize that any food is fine!  Very nice job mate, thank you for taking the time and effort to contribute to the community!
---
There's a bunch of them 
---
Wait till you find a vengeful one
---
1. No idea what could be causing this.
---
2. You can have as many as the game will allow, although I’m pretty sure production doesn’t go slower the more you have.
---
3. While building your CAMP, go into edit mode and press your left trigger on console, which should bring up an option to fit a Level 0, 1, 2, or 3 lock on your purifiers, extractors, and even doors.
---
It does, but only on melee. I think 200% condition is 20% more dmg. 
---
Well that’s good. It doesn’t really affect me if you don’t understand how stash size affects the balance of the game, but to pull it back on topic: don’t expect stash size enhancements in the atom shop any time soon.
---
Probably my favorite so far. Close second might be the Freddie Wood storyline. 
---
First thing, turn pacifist on. Regardless for what was going on they can only do that if you have it turned off and shot them back or shot first.
---
Second, the game places you at the nearest location to where you logged off last. To avoid dying like that either log off in PA or a hazmat suit or log off somewhere other than whitesprings. Pretty easy to avoid those issue man. 
---
Ah jeez, I'm overencumbered often enough. Is that how people are trying to identify dupers? 
---
Eye bot GUARD means the vendor bot is in the area.
---
Pretty sure I saw the large toolbox plan in watoga train station or the train station near top of the world. I forget which.
---
Added you,im from the uk so our times are different 
---
Yeah but this stalking, can't you even kill it? 
---
I have a furious explosive gauss rifle (I think furious is right, more damage on the same target) 3 star with perception +1 
---
Been my main weapon for a good while and it’s really useful vs the pesky scorch beasts that seem to have resistance to explosives. 
---
With the proper perks it sits at around 950 damage but I have stacked it to 1110 before :D 
---
I don't expect it. I don't expect anything logical or any business sense from the atom shop.
---
And this is exactly why I was disappointed that this game was another online multi-player game. I don't want to play as a character in a world where the people with no life that have played for months can kill and destroy me and my camp on a whim. It's why I stopped roaming around in GTA online, it's why I've stopped paying this game and why I'll never try Elder Scrolls online, even though I loved the other games in the series.
---
On top of that, I know I'm susceptible to addiction when it comes to microtransactions. Is it too hard to get a game that doesn't constantly tempt me to act on my worst impulses? It's either grinding for days to get to fun parts of the game (knowing it's designed to make you eventually want to spend money instead), or spending money without getting the satisfaction of actually buying something. It's more gambling than anything. 
---
Yes, I’ve noticed this as well.  Killed a 3-star legendary and it dropped a 1-star item.  
---
According to [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/174gcko5FeO-RLLwvAXB55v-3up_hXCrjCp5EGqOefzM/htmlview#), you get light combat armor plans from the main storyline free states quests “Reassembly Required” and “Early Warnings”.  The other plans and quest set that work this way are three toxic valley quests that give the three light metal armor plans.
---
It claims sturdy and heavy combat plans come from free states vendor (i.e. vendor bot Wallace in Harper’s Ferry) and random drops in ash heap, the mire, and cranberry bog.  As an endgame kind of thing, you won’t need to craft sturdy or heavy armor, because you’ll be using legendary armor pieces that you bought or found rather than crafted.  The light combat armor plans will still be useful as something to craft and then scrap in order to learn more mods for modifying whatever legendary armor pieces you end up using that end up being combat armor.
---
Sounds like you have put in an incorrect code, and it ate the keycard.
---
Then I recommend you blow all your atoms now as you’ll probably abandon the game before anything "logical" drops.
---
Ah sorry, I had the wrong location. I checked my map there I was just south of whitesprings. 
---
Cool nice we range from ages 10-40 there about six of us we enjoy helpi g people 
---
Ah that's a shame! A lot of PS4 players seem to appreciate the concept. Cross-platform would have been unreal for this game! 
---
I see empath, grounded and herd mentality still haven't been fixed.  This game should have started as early access, won't be ready for a real release until next summer
---
I was able to find the metal picnic table if you'd like a picture. 
---
Unfortunately I don't remember where I got the plan. But it definitely exists on xbox. 
---
Post saved. I will go on this run tonight. Thanks for this! :)
---
Sweet I’ll have to get it
---
 I agree that the mutations are just great with the Jet Pack. However just a Jet Pack is really all you need. A serious AP buff is golden as well. I had a guy demo one for me with Bird Bones and Marsupial and that was amazing.
---
 The point of the Jet Pack though, is that you can just jump up on the roof or whatever when swarmed. Ghouls lose a lot of their power and many things are just baffled by your sudden vertical escape. It changes the game a lot. 
---
 I used one in Fallout 4 a great deal and am pretty good with getting it to the limits of what it can do.
---
You're welcome! Even at level 97 I still make this loop every couple days, mainly because I can harvest 300+ wood with the woodchucker perk in a matter of minutes. I don't go out of my way to harvest the other stuff, but I'll craft anything I can when I get back to town and leave the excess in the overseer's box in the church.
---
I don't do it. I didn't know what it was until I read this thread. Stop trolling. I just question why someone else is carrying on about something which has no effect on them personally. 
---
Doubly annoying quest, I got stuck in the reward room at the end cause I was in there so long and the doors auto locked with no way to open.
---
would be good if they changed it so its either you have a two shot weapon or a explosive weapon not both.
---
I don't really bother with my CAMP much anymore; I pop up what I need when I need to, and I don't bother leaving it up when I leave.  
---
They will go with you. Not entirely sure how they go about getting there, but they will stay with you unless glitched away. 
---
This is technically viable, but I wouldn’t trust this technique for anything you don’t mind losing
---
I leave legendaries I don’t/can’t sell.
---
It sounds like a work-around of a difficult issue. 
---
Theres a Name, then  preffix, and  suffix modifiers 
---
You can only have one of each, sole reason you cant get instigating explosive twoshot weapons
---
Search on google for all modifiers
---
Would you mind if I turned this into a video guide to throw on Youtube?  I would of course give you full credit for doing the actual hard part of putting it all together of course and link directly to this post.
---
When I was like level 10 some high level guy in power armor ran across my camp while I was in it, killed me and proceeded to level my camp and all I could do was stand there giving thumbs down emotes.
---
Everyone else I've ran into has been either been really cool or kept to themselves though. 
---
That'd work if you could buy these mods on demand.
---
low key bethesda released the first duping method to the public
---
Hmu if you need folks to play with =) I'm on xb1. My gt is SierraBravoSix. 
---
The port of potty is where you exit the silo once you launch a nuke.  You come from below.  You have to enter the silo from either alpha, bravo or Charlie 
---
Yeah that makes perfect logical sense. Not.
---
It's still weird.  Someone in another thread mentioned they need a place to land or they just hover and spam. 
---
The annoying truth us your better off not arming your base in those locations (so they don't aggro) and just server hopping away.
---
Furious .50.  And replace second gun with more ammo. Need at least 5k when in that zone
---
Its honestly so kind this community, ive never met a nicer one
---
As they teased this for an upcoming content addition, I am going to assume they already have a plan.
---
I do like your idea however
---
I would be interested in how many people with TSE got theirs in game.  I have over 400 hours and have never gotten one. I have one two shot handmade and one explosive assault rifle I got from doing events.  Most of the TSE weapons I have heard about people bought from others which makes them suspect. 
---
Awh Damn.. this usually works
---
yeah i realized after i made my comment that they had said explosive.
---
 rolling toolbox is not the large toolbox plan, it's actually the "tool chest plan" you want ...
---
pretty messed up, had the exact same problem :)
---
You can confirm this by looking at the name on the rolling one when you see it in the wasteland :)
---
Yes. One place I know that always spawns one is Solomon's pond just east of whitesprings
---
Actually heres the link
---
Yep if you put in a wrong code it eats your card 
---
Why does your name have a little enclave symbol by it?
---
Yes, clearly they were. Anonymity breeds that kind of behaviour. If you want to see who someone really is, give him a mask. 
---
Or get cannibal and leadbelly till you got your game set up (1 sentence guide?) free food/healing and all water is perfect for drinking.
---
Once your go pro you can always switch skills.
---
This is a tangent, but I'm happy you got to play FO76 with an SO.
---
They letting the cold air out? The hot air? They stealing their own items from your stash? No?...they eating your food from your fridge?  A squatter come in and won’t leave? Animals come in and get into your trash? People track all over your carpet? No?  To all this? Then why don’t you CALM down. 
---
Ha, that's exactly what we're using and it's exactly as you described. 
---
I can't play just now but I need to remember this. Thanks dude. My legendaries game has been woeful 
---
Great pic. And a good ending, just completed it last night.
---
Spoilers tag though maybe?
---
Come Lady Luck and sit on my lap!
---
Go for it. 
---
Yeah... Ver disapointed it's not like that. 
---
That's a first for me brother, only time I blew through all mine was when I first used the assaultron head and hadn't heard it used all the ammo in the first shot lol.
---
Assaultron heads use up all yo ammo.
---
I haven't duped either but I have about 7 mutations and a one shot explosive gun. I dont know how someone using marsupial and an explosive gun means they duped.
---
The misses make fun stories like how i have beautiful  hardwood floors minis the half tiles.that meed a waxing
---
Do you have the Tomahawk plan in stock?
---
You are right! All Bethy need to do is remove the messed up OP weapons and more people would enjoy pvp for sure. The letters are unlocked by a plan called "neon lights". I bought the plans from Watoga shopping center (brotherhood vendor). They are the most valuable item in the game that I've ever seen so far. They cost me over 9000 caps, and that's with high charisma and the price reduction using grape mentals. Hope you have the caps!
---
Those lamps and the stuffed chair are the best interior camp items. 
---
*Fire Breathers* are the elite of the *Responders*, taking out the *Scorched* one. At. A time.
---
Hell yeah brotha
---
Fuck. All my other weapons were broken so I thought I would use my assultron head. this explains it
---
Another really easy way to fill up on food fast is the silva homestead, 2 fields full of corn/razorgrain .. load up then directly west of the fields along the river is a cooking station within spitting distance of the water, both corn soup/razorgrain soup fill up food and water plus some benefits and some healing.
---
That works, but it's less than ideal. Lead Belly unlocks at level 2, but there are more useful perks to pick at that stage, and by the time cannibal unlocks at level 15 you're probably past the "oh shit I'm out of food and stims" stage.
---
&gt;TSE weapons
---
two shot explosive?
---
Was that energy weapon an assaultron head? If so, it is a known bug that it will use all of the fusion cells. There is no real “fix” to get your fusion cells back unfortunately. 
---
Just have a friend hold it then give it to a second character you create
---
Ok I will not be back on to 4:30 or 5pm EST.
---
That's exactly what I needed thanks:)
---
That is sick. I have had ZERO legendary Gauss drops. Kudos to you!
---
I wouldn’t suggest using a tse, especially at your level it takes the fun out of the game. You basically 1 shot anything. Nothing is really challenging anymore it takes away from the difficulty of the game. I gave away my tse handmade cause the game got boring to me. That’s my personal opinion.
---
No one seems to have mentioned it,.the reason enforcer is recommended is that it's 30% per pellet, 8 per shot.  Less killy then heavy in exchange for fraction of the weight and less annoyance (I treat shotguns as consumable since they are so common).
---
My god. This. This is everything I’ve ever dreamed. Thank you. 
---
How much for one if this?
---
Now worries, will give it out next time I see a low level
---
nah bruh
---
Cool thanks for the info.  Wanna finish it up Level 1 is tricky enough 
---
No problem man
---
I agree I mostly won't be wearing them myself but I'm kind of trying to collect the various armor plans just for collections sake or if real factions become a thing to equip people in my faction
---
and probably the "feed the people" quest ;)
---
Can sorta confirm the first point. My previous camp spot was along the water on the far left of the map in the Forrest area. In 2 months of being there I had maybe 5 enemy spawns when I went to camp. Nothing ever showed up. 
---
Vault dweller that didn't have any good connections with most of the other dwellers in vault 76. After vault 76 opened she turned into a ruthless raider that preys on the remaining pre war factories (workshops) and robs them of their valuables (junk). 
---
Actually, yeah, walking is a drag but you do discover more places in between. 
---
I squealed when I got it xD it was my first decent 3 star drop and on my favourite weapon :D
---
Yes and...scorchbeast flying mounts. 
---
Or cars / motorcycles ala the classic fallouts
---
Have you recently done feed the people event? Part of the event where you have to deposit items in to a machine tends to eat up your items, if you click to fast.
---
Ahh that's rough brother, sorry it happened to you as well.  At least now you have an explanation though.  Stay safe in the wastelands!
---
I know and i think the same way, it's just that i want to try one, but i know i will not use it forever. I'm just curious
---
One side effect to watch out for is your camp may not place when you go to move it unless you did this outside the main structure. If you do it on your roof for example you can get the item is floating message when you go to place it. 
---
Imo: if you have enjoyed the game so far - do not grind or buy one.  From my experience and if you read others on this forum, the game becomes boring once you get godmode.  This game has no end game other than grinding for TSE and killing the queen.  I dropped my TSE hopped servers never looked back.  No more need to grind whitesprings, can explore and have fun.  I just started a toon who is playing no legendary.  Should be fun.
---
Wait so people kill for mule characters? Shit...I'm not a duper but even I need a mule character. I collect board games/teddy bears and give them to my mule...also give my mule other things but mainly toys.
---
The stash limit is still too low for me. I'm constantly having to reorganize my stash to fit all my crap in.
---
Yeah she's great! She's actually a 50's / vintage enthusiast and she loves Fallout! So she was a perfect fit. 
---
Don’t you get free repairs if your base is destroyed by players and you served hop?
---
&gt;firebreathers helm
---
veil of secrets prevents airborn disease without the perception drop  
---
Looks like a tan/black bandana over your moth  
---
But other than that, I'm working on your same build....but with a sniper build.  
---
I like to shoot from a distance rather than bash things.  
---
Fallout 76 upgrade, cobalt is so hard to find, i'm about to nuke my own base so I can get the 40 flowers from corn or mutfruit  
---
I hope that works
---
wait what's the limit? i have close to 200 of not more and i haven't hit a limit
---
I picked up the term from another player. It's called "double dipping" and it's beautiful.
---
Griefers don't care about anyone else's gaming experience. That's the trouble. It's just a form of trolling. 
---
You’re right on that last part; rather than play with assholes like you, I’m not playing 76. I played 4 for the first month or so, and now I’m restarting NV.
---
Bethesda made a pvp game set in a wasteland, not a Fallout game. It’s a shame that the series is going out like this, but we probably should’ve known after EOS Online. 
---
I hear you. In FO4 I used the Last Minute almost exclusively.
---
I have to disagree. This is not DayZ where finding a weapon is like "F#ck yeah!!!!!", here it is "Ohh, the weapon that I have found already thousands of times". Yea it a fun at the start, but after few days of playing and having 95% of mods unlocked on your favorite weapons, it becomes boring as hell. The fact that there is no real challenging endgame, removing legendary effects is like removing even that little that is keeping players playing. And by little, I mean very very little, because when you are done with quests you are already confused, what now...You hit the queen and now you are again confused:"That is it?...This is what I am supposed to start doing?....". and then the time you spend on f76, 80% of it you spend browsing outside the game trading forums and time to time doing 3 minute queens when some one pings he is about to do one. Some say, "oo boy, when you are done quests, you have so many places to go and explore". This is pure bs endgame. If I wanted to explore, I would buy ticket to Japan or Germany, not a F#cking video game. 
---
Oh noes!
---
Good job reporting them. 
---
So I actually have one as well i my stash, but forgot to put it on the list.  I’ll dig it out and see how it does. Thanks for the reminder!
---
What does that have to do with duping? I have a mule alt on my wife’s account, and she has one on mine. And we don’t dupe. 
---
How is a mule alt in any way related to duping? 
---
Do you play pc? I have alot I will probably never use.
---
I have my favorite jumpscare caught on video, let me grab it with an edit.
---
The green thumb perk helps double your healing salve output, and, once you’re a higher level the chemist perk will allow you to double that again! (Chemist isn’t unlocked until level 40-ish)
---
but why would you take a shitload of ammo, chems, weapons, random plans etc etc. wouldnt a duper just be their dupe items?
---
Agreed. It's not PvP. It's cowardly trolling. They want it thought of that way so they can delude themselves they're hard men and fighters.
---
I have an addiction to this damn game lol.
---
No, I'm on Xbox sadly
---
Gatling and super sledge
---
Does healing factor make stimpacks and RadAways less effective?
---
I think some areas may be instanced now as well.  I've noticed that it's far more common to see placed stuff if I don't loot it.  Some BP's seem to work this way as well.
---
Maybe, but when I dump the stuff I got in a fissure it takes some away from their total.
---
Coming from games with actual PvP like classic wow, its amusing to see how big of pussies nearly everyone in this community is. Have fun playing an old game for the 50th time you little winner, nothing ever gonna keep you down. 
---
I'd be happy with purified water in normal cooking recipes tbh.
---
Like I have thirty purified water on me, why can't I make a damn soup with it? I gotta go down to the river to get dirty water instead of using perfectly healthy water I already have? Wtf
---
Nope, maybe next time
---
damn. I cant bring myself to just dump it XD.
---
I think a pack Brahmin should be able to hold more than a player 
---
Thanks anyway ;)
---
The games content already punishes it self with such a mechanic. Be realistic for a second.  
---
If you take a balance rework out of necessity personally, fine. Ok. It doesn't matter.  
---
&gt; There were two ruptured hallucigen canisters at the spot when I got there, anyone know if that’s linked?
---
Listen to the holotape at the scene. The Phantom Device is a Hallucigen canister mashed together with a Stealth Boy, and Shannon and Olivia basically used everything they had against each other in the fight.
---
I launched my own nuke at level 42 solo, are you near the end of the main story quest?
---
Have you tried replenishing AP mid air? I know will require some practice, but IIRC you can press jet pack button, and while holding it - open favorite items wheel and repeatedly use AP replenishments without turning of the engines.
---
I am still looking for reliable means to jet pack to the top of the AMC HQ in Watoga
---
This is one of the first incidents I've heard of people just going full asshole like it's rust, one of the reasons I've been enjoying this game is because most players I've been running into have all been very nice and wholesome. I really hope people like these guys don't become common as they ruin the game for newcomers and low level players who don't get much time to play like myself. 
---
Like other players duping weapons for each other! Nice!  It's an online game if you cheat it does effect other players.
---
Yeah I never see why people are low on caps beyond max level. Do a few days of exhausting your vendors and you’re good. Farm flux in nuke zones/grab mothman eggs whatever. I’ve been sitting around 18-19k caps and haven’t really worked at it for about a month now.
---
Thanks so much for posting the updates and fixes.  Saved me a lot of time trying to figure it out.
---
I use that and the med kit right outside. 
---
Why not put it in the cash register? More likely to check that
---
I want to say the excavator is the only one that increases your carry weight 
---
Every character in the game has the capability of infinite carry weight, should they choose, that is not an exploit that is a game mechanic as there is no carry limit on your character. It is also not an exploit to put that weight on a single (or multiple should you wish) extra character so you can continue to play without the constraints of said weight on your main character. Everybody has the ability to do this, it’s not something that’s gives anyone an, “advantage,” other than people that are smart enough to use it. If you don’t want to hold onto extra things you find, great. But that doesn’t mean everyone has to play the way you do. Some people want to rolepay as a trader and without shit to sell they won’t be able to do that. The only way I can see that being exploited is carrying around hundreds of thousands of pounds that make the entire server suffer when you play, like the dupers do. Using a mule to carry a maximum of 10,000lbs doesn’t do anything to anyone except the person it belongs to. (Strolling slowly through the wasteland) 
---
I know that for a fact because I’ve seen firsthand the effects on servers that a duper joins. One guy had like 3mil bobble heads, that’s 3million+ lbs because he had other stuff too, and the server was fucked. Got the “server not responding” notification immeditately when he joined and inventories of containers and bodies would get stuck in an infinite load. The whole 1500lbs of stuff on my mule could easily be divided amongst another mule should I choose but there is no point in that. The weight would still be there, just spread out more. 
---
Mules can be abused. But that is not the intended use of anyone arguing that they are not exploitative when not abused (I would hope) because it effects no one but the owner of that mule. My main character, stash included, can hold up to 1100lbs of stuff under the right conditions (sufficient rads, strong back, excavator armor w/shocks, assorted foods that raise carry capacity, etc.) but I don’t want to tote all that weight around everywhere I go. That is not an exploit that is spec-ing your character to be able to carry shit around, which my mule is also spec’d to do.
---
You need calibrated shocks mods to increase carry weight, excavator armour has a bonus +100 to carry weight without any mods.
---
If you are on PC, message me we can play together and see if we can fix the house. 
---
Good to hear. It's nice to just stop, and smell the Radroses. 8v) I'm still just a level 16, but have been in Appalachia for a while. It took me 3 days to complete an overseer quest due to just the exploration encouraging landscape and atmosphere. I don't even bother with power armor yet. What's the rush? This game isn't near close to completion, so I just take my time. Glad I have, because I've found some really cool costumes, items and locations. 
---
&gt;Meanwhile, not a shit given about the experience of OTHER people whose day you affect.
---
this was a pretty strong argument, but obviously someone void of basic moral and social discipline would easily gloss over this. i went out of my way to quote his point to you, so even if you are derelict of decency, you can still enjoy this conversation.
---
It's slightly stronger and faster iirc. 
---
Plus it's green. While every other lower level jerk off is using a plain old red laser gun you're using a totes awesome high quality green one. 
---
So Speed Demon and Squad Manoeuvres don’t work together? Me and my teammates must be on some strong placebo stuff. They even ask me to share my card when we play together 🤯
---
They were in the beta but then removed.
---
I comply agree with you.  I think they should remove all legendary and balance the current weapon mods so they all work and matter.  Then you could build weapons / armor depending in play style. 
---
I started a playing one of my toons with no legendary and no PA.  guess what?  It's fun. 
---
I'm John Wick. Assassin and Bounty hunter. If only pencils were a weapon.
---
Rad-x as well and rad shield.
---
Still crash at random, for example, just jumping.
---
Check the window event gives 'cross thread' error
---
Well, shit.
---
Purely from my feeling it does weaken them. But i have no evidence or data to prove it.
---
dont remember, but it must have been one of the two vendors in watoga or harrpers ferry, pretty sure about that, but it's rear :/
---
TSE prime handmade for SBQ, TS handmade when not fighting SBQ.  Yes i use 2 AK´s.
---
Sounds real.

3* Explosive combat rifle + 3* fire axe.....and I'm hackin and whackin and smackin away!
---
this isn't really related to the sub at all.
---
&gt;people don’t grasp the concept that it’s just a game. 
---
just like everyone else here, you are here posting: it's just a game. it's not like anyone is killing anyone in real life. i find it odd how you can argue so freely that people should be allowed to do what they want (because it's just a game) but you still simultaneously say people shouldn't complain? i thought you were for absolute freedom, so why are you here responding to complaints?
---
that's a fallacy of inconsistency you know.

I had my camp up north and everytime I'd fast travel I'd spawn right into a bunch of RADs. Moved my camp to another location so I'd not have rads.
---
No. Levelling people's CAMPs is not PvP. It's trolling. If upsetting other people by wrecking their property makes you 'feel more alive' I suggest you get some help. PvP is another thing entirely. It involves two consenting parties, as per Bethesda's statements on PvP.
---
Put Spoiler Tag ass hat
---
Thanks for the replies!  So in seeing my screenshot in my initial post, does it look like my Industrial Water Purifiers are bugged?  It seems to only show max of 3 slots rather than 5.
---
Also, currently I have 2 purifiers out and 1 of them barely even makes any water while the other makes them normally so I imagined there was some sort of weird diminishing returns thing going on..
---
You'll live. There's so many ways to completely eliminate pvp while you're playing, but instead of figure that out, you make threads and comment extremely over-dramatic posts, ignoring any advice you're given and lashing out at those who tried.
---
Do challenges
---
I can confirm seeing it on 2 seperate occasions on Grahm
---
Grind the dailies and weeklies while working on your challenges
---
Honestly  ... there will probably always be a method to do it... it's when the method becomes a slow low return waste of time as the 'best' method that people will no longer take advantage of it .. I.e unlimited carry weight..  there is still a method for that ... but such an arduous time and resource consuming method with 0 permanance I mean you have to repeat the process every time you join a new world or servers crash or anything like that... it's easier to just run out grab a bunch of stuff and find a workbench or stash or both to deposit that foray's loot ... it's easier and faster to just play the game normally in other words.. they killed the exploit not by removing it but by making it unfeasible to take advantage of
---
Sure do.

You'll see I have a bunch of charisma cards selected. This is because I swap cards often depending the party needs. 
---
This was my first character, so I'm sure there is a lot of room for improvement. How e this helps. 
---
Please explain how someone else having a bunch of stuff effects other players. I'm open to hearing it. 
---
On xbox 1? Mine started as tiny ring next to the first major town in the game. Then I realized I needed more open and flat space. I also needed to be next to higher level players rather than lower and ideally within a grenade's throw of multiple vendors. 
---
Finally, I started building the lights and found that a collection of red bulbs requires a bucket load of power! So the club had to be next to a major power source. Power stations provide 100  power when the local power plant is repaired. All in the name of organized carnage. 
---
I read that in Cartman’s voice. Was I supposed to? 
---
Amazing.
---
I apologize if you took it that way, I just don't want to take my chances and get any item that was duped.

I don't care if it was a single piece of food I don't want to take any part in it.

I will not let others spoil my fun.

when the bombs fell, Chloe arrived in Appalachia with her brother Gregory for camping just minutes prior.

When everybody fled in terror, they both got mistaken for the children of a renown vault tek scientist and stuffed into vault 76. Twenty five years of guilt plagued both as they had to look into he pained face of their mistaken savior, knowing at the same time their parents were dead

On the day of reclamation they got separated, her brother joined the responders while Chloe joined the raiders.

On a fateful day the raiders would attack flatwoods and brother and sister met anew t-

*”server connection lost”*
---
Agreed so maybe less then stash box but more then you can carry on your person?
---
"Finale to the [  ] quest chain" is kind of obviously a spoiler. 
---
That works for me
---
A lot of my challenges don't work though for example
---
Kill animals 1/76 every time I join a new server the number resets and alot of the recipe related 1s don't work 
---
I have met some cool people so far and that have helped me tremendously. I can’t wait till I actually get the hang of this and have items I can give away to new players. Legit still haven’t even set my camp up. 😂 I’m on Xbox if anyone needs a new friend to play with! xChelitax is my name
---
AHH MOTHERLAND
---
you only need to install fo3se and a sprint mod to enable sprinting. a lot of mods include it in their overhauls/mega-packs, but it exists as a stand-alone mod that takes less than 2 min to install.
---
^(sorry for the pointless detail don't kill me)
---
I'm on PC :(
---
I dunno.. Queens (mirelurk and SB), yao guai, and lvl 91 chameleon deathclaw I will whip it out all day errrrrday
---
That would actually completely destroy most of the reason to play the game actually. For me it is tons of fun hunting for legendaries that are decent. If you take them out now... there would be not much variety no more. Everyone would run around in the same armor, because that one grants the most damage resistance.   
---
With legendaries you at least have some decent alternatives sometimes. "Have problems with your weight? Get a armor with chem weight reduction."  
---
I am with you that TSE weapons are OP as hell. But taking those away now after 2-3 months? That would be the nail in the coffin for most players. 
---
Oh man i would love for there to be mounts!! That would be so cool! Im pretty sure I've seen concept art of raiders riding giant mole rats but i think it was for a older fallout.

Let's agree I am female Cartman :'D

This thread should help you has images of the items with the plan names

Nope, don't think I have. I've only ever seen a nuke go off in whitespring like twice.
---
PS4, but thanks.  Just bought them and rebuilding my camp.
---
I do them but it's still nothing compared to the price of some items in the shop 😥
---
Key question right here. I have a fairly long route, and have not seen legendaries respawn for me too quick.
---
wow....that's a creative work around.  Thanks!
---
I endued up building a floor platform to my base entrance. It doesn't snap into place with the floor on the 3rd floor exactly, but it's hard to see where it doesn't. Took me a bit to get it to look decent enough. Haha
---
Agility course.
---
I do not consider myself a great gamer. Mediocre at best. I spook easily and become frantic. Dark Souls games haunt my nightmares, but I slowly chip away them and win by cheesing and leveling.
---
I ran through the agility test on my first attempt(s) with two characters. Then I teamed up with some other people, told them there was some easy xp there. Watched all three fail for an hour.

I'm an idiot savant. Rainman shit. I'm good at something.

If your on console it gets fixed in the upcoming patch on the 15th

I don't scroll though the list, I swipe left in right though posts.
---
Thank you for the help. I am playing on a Xbox One but I will make my way to Whitesprings it seems. 
---
You're a monster, but I'll accept it for your honesty.
---
Thank God I've been waiting so long for it to be fixed thanks for the info
---
&gt;or stop playing
---
I mean, yeah, that’s what’s happening. It’s just going to be servers full of 13 year olds mad at girls who shoot each other all day. But that’s not Fallout. That’s CoD with extra steps. I don’t WANT another Call of Duty, I want a Fallout game.
---
I’m sure the execs have the devs working on another version of Skyrim, though, so at least we have that to look forward to. 
---
Nothing directed towards you TraNSlays, but:
---
Nevertheless, Explosive needs a change either way. Even as a stand alone.
---
Got a E Lv20 10mm. It does 7.2x more damage than my Lv45 10mm equipped with mods that require end game unlocks and supposedly killing the hardest content the game has to offer  (Queen drop). So I don't see any realistic scenario where Explosive if fine. To say so or think it is, is just a buffoon's opinion. 
---
What if... the server crashes beacuse hoarders leave stuff for others in good will, but there is so much of it that even dupers would be envy?
---
Where do you even get an Ultracite Gatling laser?
---
Yes, on Xbox One. My camp is on the snake on the map, just below the Whitespring. I don't have much luck with randoms but my friends and I have a ton of fun! 
---
When you injure them, their flight stutters for a second, then they keep going. I'm not sure about the queen, but I've had them stunned on the ground for a couple seconds shaking their heads, which is an enormous amount of time to get that damage in. 
---
I'd like to know if you're able to get something more damaging like flight disabled or something. This could be epic!

Fancy bed is the one witha big headboard and a dirty matress on it

Does anyone know if this makes building the decontamination arch cheaper? It uses a few of every type of flux...

Make sure you get nakey before you hop into your power armor. Removing the under armour after you're in the suit doesn't give you the resistances back.
---
I made a character originally as your normal dweller but as time went on, I rebranded him as an ex-military Engineer turned BoS Knight, only to later get exiled as he was caught helping the Responders while under strict orders to not even engage in any sort of way with them, either friendly or enemy.
---
He managed to survive the whole second mass extinction event via the Scorched Plague by setting up camp in a bunker he made himself in an event of immediate danger. He resided in a cabin in the woods and when he learned Vault 76 opened and had the inhabitants of the Vault taking the fight to the Scorched once again, he then convinced himself to help once again, donned his armor and loaded his weapons, and fought in numerous Scorched battles alongside the dwellers.
---
To this day he can be seen traveling around Appalachia in his old suit of T-60, fighting the various creatures around the wastes, or relaxing back in his home, repairing weapons, armor, or just lounging around until he’s needed once again.
---
Christmas is a little far off to do an event now...
---
How many of those "fixes" are actually fixed? Hours after the patch people were saying mobs at the Workshops are still underground. After the last "stuck in PA" "fix" people were still getting stuck in PA, myself included. What about PA pieces being removed when entering PA or fast traveling? What about underarmor lowering PA resistances? We'll see.
---
But I believe that would also hide the picture, otherwise you see the image right up front
---
Radical centrism is neither a viable game dev strategy nor a useful political ideology.

Great idea. Also i want a Yao Guai called Tim now.

If it appears rando jerks are about to grief our camps, our standard response is to quickly leave that world.   Obviously not a realistic response if you're claimed workshops, but otherwise, it's easy

So basically Dogmeat from FO4 only with more heads and less attacking power... I love it! I shall call mine Cowmeat! 
---
agreed they are probably gonna reduce damage and reduce the area of the explosive 
---
Maybe it was just a bunch of idiot kids wanting to feel like they have power because they arent good enough to fight other players their level. Happens more often than you think. I've had to take out more than my fair share of bullies and to no surprise after killing them they kept trying to harass the lower level players and don't want anything to do with me despite taking a bunch of their caps
---
Powering up events are always so difficult 
---
I don't want every game to have a Battle Royale mode, because that mode eats the rest of the game until it is the only thing left.
---
Thx for replaying 👍🙂
---
It is an exploit.  Trading to yourself is an exploit.  You can twist it up however you want.  It's not an intended feature of the game.  You literally verbatim spitting the exact same logic dupers use to justify their form of cheating.  "The game mechanic is broken, I should be allowed to play however I want, It's a feature not an exploit, everyone can do it, It's in the game so it's not my fault, yada yada yada"
---
If only everyone was smart enough to cheat like you lmao
---
That's convenient. Maybe they want you to buy them instead.
---
Is this the recent update? The mutations work completely fine on my Xbox.
---
Haha cowmeat i love it!! Id probably name mine Jezabelle.
---
servers are still dogshit on pc even after the duping patch
---
well, if you ran up and grabbed a bag i was giving to a level 10 guy that makes you an asshole. i dont see the point other than griefing.
---
Do me a favor and go look at how much 30 steel scrap weighs and compare it to how much 1 bulk steel weighs. You are allowed to use a calculator.
---
They are nerfing glowing ones this patch. It's still ridiculously easy to level up without them within an hour. At level 170+ I normally get two levels every silo and then SBQ run I do, which is pretty much the only end game content currently. 
---
Are you having issueS leveling? I'm finding it ridiculously easy, even without glowing ones. 
---
This is the Real Value of helmets right now.
---
It isnt actually in the game at the moment
---
Yeah I know now.. I finally reached level 50+ and I think I'm pretty far into the story so I figured, what the hell, let's try an event. Last time I'm trying an event. Guess I'll go back to farming White Springs for an explosive rifle. 
---
Its east of the satelite dish in the divide(i think). At work for 7 more hours but i can be more precise then. It took some tricky jumping and placement to be able to get in the dish though

These mole rats are out of goddamned control. I'm working towards end game nukes to take out the mole rats. Scorchbeasts? No. Someone needs to handle the effing mole rat issue.

say what ? lol :)

He’s just picking up the camp machine and moving it around within the green boundaries.  You can move and manipulate it like any other piece of furniture.  What your doing is selecting a whole new spot and moving your green boundaries.   Just click on your camp machine in build mode abs you can pick it up and move it.

Waiting for hairstyles that don’t look like stacked or  toppled scorchbeast droppings :(

Oh wow, that just sucks ='(

Unfortunately that is true but having a divided nation has led to the downfall of empires much more stable and stronger than the ones today

While you're in build mode you can pick up the CAMP like any other buildable object

I have no experience with this, but Bethesda’s [Common Issues and Solutions](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/304028/fallout-76-common-issues-and-solutions) says:

&gt;	Friends who have been blocked will now remain visible in the friends list, with a simple “(Blocked)” tag next to their name. To unblock this person, select the name and then select “Unblock”. 
---
You are not understanding, wow. If you were giving him a few things I wont touch it. If there are hundreds/thousands of one item in there then I grab and dump it. 
---
I think the only way to piss off a handy griefer is to ignore them completely, which is pretty easy in F76 due to the pvp design / cheap camp repair options.  
---
Explain how you having an infinite inventory and me having a 600 lb stash limit is a disadvantage?  
---
I just want to actually have pvp power struggles rite now on PS4 its just a big one shot circlejerk I want to get wanted and see if someone can take me down not well gonna get tsed on ya feel me?

Launched a nuke with my lvl50 friend at Site Prime Friday night. No one showed up to help out. Wasted thousands of rounds for nothing.

The Real Endgame: Server Hopping
---
Im lvl 125 and currently with a bloody supersledge build can easily single handed take down a silo in about 10 min, unless i have others "trying to help" then it tends to spawn more enemies
---
yea well this community practically gave griefers a free pass to do whatever they want to anyone because they can look at someone and call them dupers without any real proof. this community sucks in alot of ways and its mainly this communities fault for letting it get out of hand like this. go to your camp and there should be a repair all button, as for what to do against future attacks your best bet would be to just try to avoid all players at all costs. sucks but everyone is so dead set on "dupers are the satans children" mindset you will never have a fair encounter especially with your level compared to hers.
---
Not coming through 
---
All of the mods that fixed things like this and many other annoying things years ago in FO4 should have been in the game at launch.
---
unpopular opinion, but i am fine with griefers as long as the game gives you methods to avoid said griefers (i.e. server hop, neutral/non-pvp zones, etc).
---
it might be frustrating at the time but my most fond memories is of discord and strife between me and other players.
---
also, i think it's in the eye of the beholder. i don't mind being destroyed by something that is higher level and makes for unfair combat: it's expected with such a level difference. for this reason, i love playing Black Desert Online (which is way, way more sinister than this game in terms of griefing/PvP mechanics): sure, every now and then some asshole kills me. it's fair in the way that they're ahead of me in terms of gear and level, but maybe unfair specifically for that fight. but on the other hand, every now and then i can kill an asshole with ease (or even be an asshole, depending on who you ask, i guess).
---
what i'm trying to say is, even the worst moments in pvp can be enjoyed to a degree if you don't get frustrated over other people killing you. accepting literal differences is part of a pvp game. sometimes, someone is just better, and sometimes it's not even their skill, and that's just the way it is.
---
I think I agree, once you get used to the layout of the place, you can redo it ..
---
Also we have to get it done if we want the fusion reactor ..
---
100% agree
---
See here is my issue with the "just jump servers" bullshit, people get all bent out of shape over dupers "causing server instability and crashing the game" lets face it the crashes existed long before duping went widespread and will continue after its patched.  Just ask the pc players who are saying the dcs are worse since last weeks update.  If its that frustrating to you to get forcefully dced, then why cant it be equally frustrating to the rest of us who should "just jump servers" every hour or so because some asshat wants to fuck with someone.
---
There are stock mods that increase the damage and bayonet mods, I believe strength does effect it since its a melee attack.
---
Loved the video!!
---
Only do it if you don't have the fusion reactor plan, else it is not worth it.
---
Just saying... But it is a common mechanic in survival games. And is not a big problem really, the repairs are trivial. I'll vent now because I need explain a idea. Bear with me. I see the technical and gameplay problems but the game is enjoyable.
---
The reason because this game feel odd are the metagamers. Fallout 76 was designed to be a big sandbox with variety of activities with the flaw of not predict the obvious meta (obviously the bugs are other problem, but it's not relevant RN). When I play a sandbox game I ignore the meta for the first hours (sometimes for all the time I play). Farm is fun to me because the journey not because the item to farm is OP. We all are entitled to our game style, but FO76 is not a game with a easy meta. That is a obvious problem with the design because most of vocal gamers like the metagaming (even though "vocal gamers" is not the same as "all gamers"). But, until recently, most gamers couldn't care less about the meta gaming. So my recommendation is play without care the meta, with the actual limitations (no "how I want play"), with no hurry, adapting yourself to the sandbox. Maybe you can found the fun. After all, the games teach us to adapt to our environment since ever. Nowdays can be used to test our ability to learn a new set of rules, or in this case, how to deal with griefers. In FO76 is easy deal with them.
---
Also FO76 give us a clear example of what is wrong with gaming right now.
---
There are a lot of vocal gamers with serious issues. Aknowladge this is needed in order to understand why we are gamers. People addicted to gaming are real, and just like alcoholics they can't see their problem. IRL there are certain anti-gamers circles because of that. We, as a gaming circle, see it as a non sense prejudice, and we are right because gaming can be a healthy hobby... But the problem exist.
---
The reason are hormones. Most games are designed to give the player a dose of happiness for solve simulated problems or give illusion of control. Some people get addicted to that. Some of the symptoms are: apathy (indifference to problems IRL), low tolerance to stress (ragequitting) and unhealthy eating, personal hygiene, and sleeping.
---
The gaming culture has other problems. Some are community based (toxicity, entitlement, no sense of reality). Other problems are industry based (limited creativity, financial fragility, limited demographic). And, of course, we have the technical problems (limiting hardware, high cost of development, complex software hard to manage). Also the heterogeneous demography (not a problem) is contributing to the uneasy gaming climate.
---
They have some cool helmets but its pointless
---
If you need springs just buy some from vendors. I am using caps only for fast travel / springs and I can't get under 20k caps. Mind you I don't even do 1200 / day runs.
---
I said: **SHE NEVER KNEW WHAT FISTED HER!** :)
---
More then likely from the dev room, one of the fallout wikis has a recipe for the helmet that seemingly came out of nowhere.
---
I’m not sure if your being serious or just forgot the /s. Your pretty much high lighting all of the reasons removing the legendary effects would be beneficial.  The only reason the majority of these quests are completed effortlessly and with minimal time is the legendary weapons and armors. 
---
It absolutely does!

Who TF is gonna have a stress filled evening over an internet badass killing them in a game?

Well... there are always crossbows and I have also found bolts

Arrows on the other hand, I have yet to find any so I will assume bows don’t exist 
---
I want a FISTO as a companion.
---
I'm not even sure, it was the first time I tried one of these events. I fixed the cooling part with all of the pipes, then I just ran around hopelessly looking for yellow things to repair because the game, for whatever reason, refuses to tell you where to go. 
---
It ranges, leave it long enough and it will likely have 5.

No need to lock it, be a good vaultie and allow people to help themselves, I leave all mine unlocked, people are welcome to take from my crops and my water if they need.

Do lock your mineral deposit if you mining stuff like lead.

You can just turn on pacifist mode, bam you can't PvP
---
If you don't have pacifist mode on know that you are open to PvP
---
It does. However with pharma farma, I have so many stimpacks that I just double hit the stimpack button and I'm good. If you take some time to build up your healing items you will barely notice. Also you save so many stimpacks when you have small battles out in the wild. If you see a few enemies and wipe them out you never have to heal up after that battle anymore because of healing factor. So the mutation kind of negates the weakened value of stimpacks anyway.

Sorry you had a bad experience. But this story is Fallout AF. Not sure if you played the earlier games, but two douche bags rolling in to the sound of Despacito and wrecking your shit fits perfectly into the dark humor established earlier in the franchise. Wish I was there to share the experience.
---
Pvp in this game is great as long as these over-powered no-weakness weapons are removed. All they need to do is get rid of them. If that guy in the OP didn't have an overly powerful minigun, it would have taken him much longer to cause as much damage.  
---
It would also mean the OP would have had the chance to defend the camp by taking that guys bounty with a great chance of winning. 
---
But because the attacker had a god-weapon, the gameplay is utterly broken.  One little change would make it all far more balanced
---
The perk was removed, however there are crossbows in game, it has a very very slow reload time.
---
Good quest, disappointing rewards.
---
Not really, there are normal weapons that can 1 shot you in the right players hands even if in full power armor. It's just how the game is right now
---
Yes store them away when not in use or prepare to go collect flux to repair them which is a pain
---
he's talking about building an item in CAMP, not trading costumes or whatever.
---
you can if you are in their party.
---
Now you are just debating because you just want to. And I am not saying your definition is wrong. You don’t have to be so defensive. I am just saying your definition is different from most of us and I simply tell you my definition. 
---
In addition, let you know most of us thinks that is griefing behavior in this case and I am not asking your opinions either. You can do similar things and giving yourself an excuse of “pvp” and do similar behavior but most of us do think that is griefing and that is your choice too. 
---
It doesn't look like Class Freak is applying to all of them. Healing Factor should is not still -55% chems with it CF III. It is only \~-13%
---
Bethesda's statement as far as I'm concerned is putting two specific perk cards in the game that support destroying an enemy's camp: wrecking ball, and contractor. If you mentally treat your ingame camp as actual property I suggest you get some fucking help. If someone destroyed your home IRL you dont literally push one button to fix it do you? So just what is the big deal? You cant be bothered so I ignore game features to make you feel better? 
---
The entitlement of the weak is the real humor here. Level up and stop me, make an indestructible house, or pack your bags and go cry on another server, it's literally that simple. 
---
You won’t get anything for that money 
---
It's on the game just failed to understand how it was done. The other guy explained it for me thanks though. 
---
Thanks.
---
What's your build? 
---
I guarantee they qont add stash size or DLC to the atomic shop. It will only ever be cosmetic so it's just a matter of personal taste
---
Thanks for all of this - useful stuff! 👍👍
---
I know about the bodies flinging - it has lost me many a corpse! 
---
Each  class of armor actually has its own strengths and weaknesses. Some have greater ballistic resistance other’s energy or rads.  Without the legendary items in game these would actually become viable options. As it stands all of these take a back seat to legendary effects. 
---
The same applies for weapons. Why have anything less than a 2 Shot explosive?  The only way we are going to actually see variations in play styles would be either in a full re balance of all weapons and armors, or removal of legendary effects. 
---
They have lived long enough to see themselves become the villains. 
---
If we drop enough nukes, we can have deadly irradiated snow every day of the year :)
---
There are a lot of 1 day only items, I would save your atoms until you see something you really really want. Else there is no way you will be able to save in time for a 1 day special.
---
Ahhh okay, thank you! 
---
Put a way to lock items in your menu. It is an absolutely necessary feature to prevent unintended loss of items. 
---
This should be an incredibly basic concept for a loot based game like this with vast menus, especially more so because the menus are laggy and often select an item you are not actually hovering on, or items will resort while clicking on them resulting in an unintended item being sold or traded. Have lost more than one equipped piece of armor this way by accidentally selling. If you notice you can buy it back, but if you, gone forever and some lucky player gets to buy your 3* gear from the vendor wondering wtf is going on. 
---
Nuclear winter wonderland
---
I mean, the mayor wanted them gone so... quest complete?
---
Granted we raid people aswell, but we dont gang someone 80 levels lower. 
---
Class freak doesn’t affect herd mentality?   
---
Yeah I found one. It's a lot of fun.

Are you on PC we have a community and often drive off these dickheads when they show up. If you want to join that is.

As I posted a week or so ago, in this sub, in a thread specifically about suicide runs you get an upvote for literally not reading. You are a true mvp.
---
She didn’t even “bat” an eye at that 
---
Yes it does but it does not seem that the current carry weight bug on the Excavator stacks for the mod. If you load in to a server in your PA you sometimes get a +200 Carry weight bug but with my 1 shock I still only get +50 on that for it and not +100 and the +200 base buff   
---
It doesn't show the picture though. 
---
I really hope we get pvp servers and it's always on. I miss that feeling of constantly having my guard up. 
---
Yeah the current building system sure can be frustrating, especially after all the freedom we were given in fallout 4. Still, these new limitations gives me a sense of progression with my building skills. I kind of enjoy having few options at first 
---
But it seems we're in the minority here, and had some bad luck. I'm keeping my head high and marching on to the next camp. It'll be even better! 
---
To add to this: The Miners Miracles (is this quest name right?) quest. I built all the excavator power armor - a few pieces at a time because I ran out of materials. I scrapped them after because I didn’t realize you needed to register the suit after. Maybe they should have it so you can’t scrap anything that’s needed for a quest or have some restrictions on scrapping that power armor until you’ve registered it. I spent like 3 days farming back the materials for that shit lmao. I had a full set of ultracite already so I didn’t want the excavator set. 
---
well, i know who did it, i am going to tell on you :D
---
Actually seen not too long ago they may be adding bow and arrow to the game....maybe by mistake they released the perk card early?
---
Make new characters grind out all the per character challenges. 
---
I hold my TSE, but I barely use it. I use it for flying scorchbeasts and cargobots mostly. I really love using my powerfist for everything else.
---
R&amp;G station seems to have a nice chance of mods for the Excavator
---
Bow OP Bungie please nerf.
---
Sorry to bring an old post back, but did we ever figure this out for f76?
---
There's no debate. You're just wrong. And stop projecting about being defensive. I'm not the one trying to argue that every player interaction that you don't start as griefing. I don't know who your "most of us" is. Most of us, meaning Fallout fans and FO76 players, accept and enjoy that this is a PvP game.
---
I never asked your opinion, but here you are, giving it anyway. Bethesda disagrees with you about it being griefing, by the way.
---
I have been doing this since beta. I dropped a bunch of stuff in the Morgantown train station and as I was going through my stash after dropping I hear a holy shit over the chat. Couldn't stop laughing. 
---
You are welcome , free of charge my friend. 👍
---
Yes you can
---
What’s the new perk? I’m tired of getting myself killed because I shoot a scorched too close 
---
Wow I never knew it was so Good! Thanks for the heads up!
---
Joke right? I mean who has more than 4 friends anyway. Do you, like, have a social life or sum thing?
---
Put on the perk that allows you to craft it...
---
Look at the posts around, somehow I think you are the one that is supporting the griefing behavior  
---
I’m Xbox as well. We started a raider gang to kind of look out for each other and Hunt griefers. Basically if you have issues with someone not letting you play, or if someone is bullying you, or if you just need help in general, we come in and make sure you are set to go. If you need/want a gang to call on sometime, let me know
---
Make a mule character? Like, the person who spends more time doing that does not get like a special prize or whatever... they just get to enjoy the game in a way they want. It's actually pretty common to have mule characters in multiplayer games like this. I feel like people who are playing 76 dont realize how games work or how none of this effects their ability to play. You literally can block a person and never run into them again.
---
Honestly, people who grief like those people in this post makes it so people never want to get into the game or have fun with friends. They are the ones ruining the game for everyone... not the person who makes another toon to stash stuff. I dont dupe or use a mule, but I'd never make a person feel like shit or ruin their experience in a game (that's supposed to be stress relief) just because they play it differently then me. I feel like this is the equivelant of complaining someone has sugar in their coffee and your stomach cant take coffee and you hate sugar, so you wanna make all coffee people suffer, especially those who put sugar in it.
---
&gt;They lack the courage to face shit head on in real life. So they take their misery out on others online, to alleviate their frustration at their own futility in the real world.
---
this... isn't necessarily true. a lot of people who are griefers have no problem with being griefed either. it's part of the pvp mind-set.
---
for example, in BDO (a korean mmo), there can end up being a minor war that started over griefing and ends up in even more griefing, with entire guilds having to eat the bullet because they lose the fight. but then, once one side gives up and cedes the area, it's all good and fine and people write shit to eachother like "noobs", "gg", "nice fight". no one is really mad because everyone is in for it.
---
it's the same thing with dota2. there are a lot of people who say things like "gg" or "well played!" but that doesn't mean they are miserable and frustrated at their own futility in the real world (true honest to god this sounds like a lot of projection going on, like what?); it's all in good fun and banter. many games, i've had a mini flame-war, saying stuff like "YOUR MOM... is a good chef", or "uninstall game pleb" and then at the end of the game saying, "gg wp guys, no win today".
---
some people just literally have no problem with this kind of stuff and they are the ones most likely to engage in pvp (but not necessarily griefing, though).
---
i never really grief, but if someone engaged me in pvp, i might stick around to grief until they leave. i have no qualms about being an asshole to someone who i perceive to be my enemy. so, i'm perfectly reasonable and nice, up to the point where you accidentally shoot me 3 times; then i'm going to accidentally kill you until i get tired or you leave. that's just how pvp works.
---
I'm also having this issue all the time when Fast Traveling to Harper's Ferry since the latest patch. I notice an audible pop on my headset when the sound cuts out. I've been wearing power armor 100% of the time since the patch dropped. 
---
The max team size is four but the max the server can hold is twenty-four. If you all are friends in game then you can still fast travel to each other and their camps. Hope this answers the question.
---
I see the picture just fine on the mobile app
---
I know, but they said nothing about implementation. I don't know how far they are along.
---
Yesterday was an absolute shit show on PS4. Over the course of 100 hours of gameplay I had every reason to suspect people whining about bugs and crashes were being overly fussy.
---
Holy shit. After yesterday, I get it. I was crashing every half hour. Every load screen was ten minutes. Game was running at a crawl.
---
I work sys admin on servers. I feel for the guys that were scrambling to sort this out at Bethesda. Someone had a resume writing event.
---
Took one out there today, unfortunately it was an uber basic camp, I only got a 50 cap bounty (and had friend take it from me).  Going to keep up the good work on this though... 
---
Just a boy and his dog here..
---
It would be punishing my gameplay 
---
Oh boy oh man, I’d be dead a thousand times over if this becomes commonplace. 
---
Yeah this, did Poseidon 3 times in a row, for large, fusion and windmill. Not going near it again. 
---
They shouldn't need to do this though. Their base would be fine if these self assured jackasses weren't just murdering players because they *know* the players are dupers.
---
Really? It seems to be limited to 50 for me. I’m on PS4 though. 
---
I didn't know that was a glitch, that's strange
---
Yes. You have to become friends with each other and then join your friend on the same server. You won't officially be on the same party, so things like perk card sharing won't happen between more than four people.
---
I have to wholeheartedly agree with both of those as first and second favorites.I got done with most of the Freddy missions before I found out that the SMG you get is amazing so I put off finishing the entire thing until I was level 40 so it would be more powerful
---
Daily events..
---
enclave man bad
---
Max party size is 4, but you can have more than that play together in one place or do the same quest together (you just need to make sure each person has the same quest active)
---
Just be sure to activate pacifist mode so you dont accidentily shoot your non-teamed up friends.
---
I don't turret farm, does this look  like it has any turrets.  Come smash it when i log on and see how a pacifict defends themselves.
---
I'm running with a TSE pump and a Quad Explosive double barrel and I honestly prefer the double barrel over the TSE. I have more accuracy and less spread without shotgun perks with the double barrel than the TSE does with perks. I can consistently hit and kill targets from 100 meters that the TSE can't hit from less than half of that. Plus the TSE only has around 200 extra damage which isn't worth the sacrifice in accuracy and can easily be made up for with things like chems or adrenal reaction. 
---
F FOR FENGEANCE 
---
I found the terminal in the burned out portion of the mansion (upstairs). Make a hard right at the end of the hallway and it's in the corner. 
---
Exactly. Breaking someone's base has the same penalty as griefing  (being wanted and everyone being removed from your map) so I don't see how people think its PvP. It doesn't only allow the person who had their stuff destroyed to attack you so the game classifies it as griefing not PvP. The hoops people jump through to justify being assholes is astonishing.
---
And 5.56.  Really anywhere with super mutants, come to think of it.
---
&gt; STR&gt;-1
---
Is that still 1 then?
---
Horizon on FO4 has this great little experimental feature where you hotkey a grenade selector, hit the hotkey and a list of your thrown explosives shows up, you can also set an option to automatically throw at the selection point or not.  It works great, would love to see something like that added to FO76...maybe a modder will read this :P
---
Don't worry, even post patch when duping is fixed, you'll still have people with explosive miniguns show up and level your CAMP... this time with no excuse other than trolling.
---
Why is that every time something bad or unfun happens it involves an explosive weapon? 🤔
---
Hey duder. Let me see what I have.  I don't use anything other than. 308.  You can have what I got.  Can't promise a lot, but I'll check later on.
---
Hit me up 
---
Drunken_Flunkee
---
You literally don't even understand the terms you are using, amazing.
---
I’m on PS4 but nonetheless, the point is more that I’d like to keep using the pictures as loading screens. 
---
I can understand if it is not feasible, but I figured I’d throw it out there just in case. 
---
There's only a handful of comments calling it griefing, all from people that should stick to games designed to prevent player interactions.
---
Powersmith and Armorer 3? Have it.  Still doesn't work
---
Thank you for your hard work. This is an amazing asset to have. 
---
Rifle and 2h build.

---
Agreed, caps are pretty worthless.  Outside of maybe serums and the occasional plan there's really nothing worth buying, ever.  And it's not like you won't be getting those caps back in items you sell after each loop.
---
They've been announced, here's hoping. Watching your back around every corner is super immersive, I feel you 100%. 
---
I'm sitting at 89% stored and my stored tab is empty.  I literally ONLY have the CAMP thing and nothing else.  I've opened a ticket and only received a canned message telling me how to use CAMP.  
---
I am enjoying my radium rifle, as it does mad damage to robots up close. Seeya Mr Gutsy and Robobrain, goodnight. 
---
I wish raiding camps was a thing with real benefits. As it is now it serves no purpose other than trolling players. I'll admit tho if I dont like where a Camp is or when I want some pvp I def attack it lol. But generally there is no point to it
---
I understand the terms I'm using, it's the terms you're using incorrectly that's a problem.
---
white knight incels that think women are the virigin mary or the prostitute mary depending on which side of bed they got out of.
---
Okay, name a term I have used incorrectly.
---
If you leave your GT you will have better luck getting people
---
Its that 301st one man, but since you stopped the timer reset, now you gotta start all over.
---
Sure but the point is more that I’d like to keep using the pictures as loading screens. 
---
I'll throw my hat in to this ring. lol
---
Griefing and PvP.
---
First time I saw him was day 1. I shot at his ass. Didn’t see him gain for like 80 levels. 
---
I've never dupped but i have a mule account.  News to the dup hunting tards out there.  You can't have both character on at the same time, unless you have 2 copies of the game and 2 xbox.
---
Mono is the easiest I think. Takes 15 minutes once you know what to do.
---
Got some I could sell ya? Cheap asfuck
---
Here's the thing, you needed to already have had something worth duplicating. TSE is overrated, keep farming events for other 2, 3, 4 star legendary weapons.
---
I don't know but I'd like to hear as well, I haven't seen one of those in action, sounds like it charges up into a grenade type projectile?  I use the shotgun barrel for it, love it!
---
i love when stuff like this happens! but in order for stuff like this to happen, you have to be ready that sometimes you are on the receiving end.
---
Hahaha are you talking about the agility course on the top of the hill or the quest for the bots? The one on the hill is fookin gnarly. Idiot savant is too OP
---
I'm not sure how you think you can go on past level 24 without a vampire outfit.
---
Vampire outfit.
---
If you dont mind the random aspect of farming for mutations, blackwater mines is great for this. In the external section, there are barrels to get irradiated from, and an array inside to cure radiation. You can also buy serums from players or the whitespring bunker.
---
If you are trying to be ignorant regarding the posts that people does not like the griefing behavior , it’s your choice too. 
---
People can always give themselves every excuses to make themselves feel better every time they make other people suffer. 
---
Its like a Gauss rifle, press the trigger, wait and deal a better damage. 
---
I did, some high levels used the excuse of dupers to blow them away, they likely just saw an undefend couple farming and thought, sweet free springs, either way, its how you play, learn from these experiences and get tricky.
---
Haha np. Sent.
---
I think they go for the cheapest stuff first. I notice they go after my lawn ornaments and pylons a lot. Could be coincidence. I dunno.
---
Seeing as a Explosive weapon is not OP to start with there is no point in nerfing them.  The OP is coming from the bobbleheads being stacked to give a +a really big number damage buff.   I have an explosive handmade and I WISH it was as OP as people say but it isn't 
---
Try using a Cryolator in your weapons mix
---
I apologized for the butt plug being small, I am working toward bigger and better "things"
---
Love to join, but don’t know who you are without GT
---
Ashes, go hooome!
---
yes, yes they do.
---
100%, I bought a TSE pump action and assault rifle when I reached cap limit (before anybody asks, I'm at least certain the assault rifle isn't duped) and I've barely used them. It's ridiculous and takes the fun out of the game. I found a TSE dragon and it feels like one of the few exceptions that's actually "balanced". Pretty sure it can one shot a scorchbeast on a sneak attack critical, but most of the time I just use it on super mutants and deathclaws and what not. 
---
Those guys were simply looking for an excuse to grief others for they obviously have no clue about the methologies of the dupers who conduct their business a.) are way off the beaten track b.) sneak to avoid showing up on map c.) typically don't muck around with level 2s at all. There is a certain mentality of lowlife scum who given a perceived justification will engage in thuggish abusive jackboot behaviour. Basically the dangerous violent element of any mob. Brainless and worthless garbage human beings. To put it mildly.
---
Not everyone with a two shot explosive uses them all the time. I have a few and get really bored of using them. Instead I use a shishkebab. I can safely say that at some point a lot of other people get bored of using them too. 
---
Oh I see.  Yeah,  you are correct in assuming that it's not feasible.
---
When and where did I use these incorrectly?
---
Fires fatman at rad roach feet and causes small nuclear explosion...dies.
---
“That’s stupid, I should be immune to nuclear explosions”.
---
It’s a balance thing for explosive weapons, if anything there shouldn’t be any explosive weapons that aren’t missile launches, grenade launchers, grenades themselves, or fatmans.
---
Armour penetration perks and two shot are enough to make other weapons insane enough.
---
Just be thankful you have passive mode so you can spam fire at mobs people are engaged with melee in.
---
"Most of us" when referring to only a few people isn't very convincing.
---
It's a PvP game. If you find PvP to be "suffering," why would you choose to play it?
---
Repairing costs next to nothing, the annoying repairs are generators and things
---
Those plants are a frickin maze!  I've done it 5 times and it gets easier each time as you learn the layouts.  It's not intuitive, if you have to go West you don't just head West, or you end up facing a giant wall with no doors etc.
---
Ive been told it drops a blue blob on the ground that acts like a mine when mobs run through it.  A normal tesla rifle shoots a bolt of lightning that arcs from target to target.  The regular charging barrel is bugged and prone to crashes, I have no idea if the charging lob barrel also causes crashes.
---
Bumblebee?
---
They should make some high power syringer serum to get these guys down.
---
Lever has higher per shot damage, but of course has the lever animation in between shots. Combat/radium are better for DPS, but radium adds radiation damage and knocks a few points off of the ballistic damage
---
I gave a full shot of level 45 legendary marine armour to a level 13 player in Grafton.
---
...I don’t like the way marine armour looks and prefer leather armour.
---
&gt; high ranks should all be able to solo it, no matter how many people, the ammo consumption is negligible.
---
??
---
Maybe if you have a duped TSE god roll weapon lol. Most people with normal weaponry are going to expend a lot of ammo taking out the queen, especially if a bunch of dead weight shows up.
---
Or if he really wants to be a white knight, put on his power armour and go seek revenge for the fair lady, mayhap she will reward him with her favor.
---
Eh, it really is the incentive I need to just quit and probably never return. Tarkov and SCUM both have lots of new content I havent checked out, and I have hardly used my 2080ti on anything but Fallout 76... which is wasted on the game.
---
So back to some VR and checking out other games for awhile. Maybe if I hear of fresh servers and an actual stable game Ill come back, but for now I feel that Ive beta tested this shit show long enough.
---
This is why at 100+ I try to avoid low levels or try to make my intentions know (like dumping plans to them)
---
I am not crazy about it on PC; perimeter is smeared and irritating.
---
I find it super useful in the swamps at night, where there is literally no light otherwise.
---
PA helmet HUD is even better, since you will see enemies even in pitch black.  Kinda zen….
---
I hate this. people passed around word that dupers tend to move in 3's and now i cant level with my best friend and husband. your angry kill the dupers vigilante is ruining the game to me and my friends more then a few people who cheated the game that had nothing to do with us.  
---
Yeah, the issues I had with my "normal" tesla is why I scrapped it. 
---
Yeah, I can do that. Any particular mods that you are looking for?
---
Hunting dupers sounds kind of stupid to me. Seems like a waste of time.
---
I do have to ask though... why would she be devastated by this situation? You can literally repair your entire base with one click of a button, and it costs next to nothing. xD   I don't really see the problem other than 'wow some people are dicks', which is kind of what real life and gaming are both about haha.
---
Anyway, have fun in the wasteland and keep playing!
---
**LETHAL FORCE ENGAGED**
---
Ah a new Redditor! Welcome! These symbols and blue text next to names are called "flairs". They are different for each subreddit and can be given to you by the mods on the subreddit or 
---
"To get your own, look in the right-hand sidebar for "Show my flair in this subreddit. It looks like: {{ your username }}". It's a little small. If there is an [edit] button next to your username, click it to select your flair. (If there is no edit button, then you can only receive flair from the mods in this subreddit.)" - this paragraph is from Reddit Help
---
The flairs almost always pertain to the subreddit. I usually use mobile and I'm kinda new myself, so I'm not sure exactly how getting flairs work but I hope I helped.
---
Are you level 50+ ? 
---
Don’t run in the way of my bullets, I have passive mode on but usually If I’ve fired a bullet it’s either at an enemy or that car beside you...either way I’d prefer the bullet hits it’s intended target.
---
Also, on that second part, carry ridiculous amounts of resources please...just because
---
Its how the game is designed, its 100% correct to play any way a player wants to play.  Literally has nothing to do with decency or kindness.  Its a game, and it is being played correctly.  
---
Wrong game 
---
Negative - I'm not lunching...just prepping to make my first foray into the blast zone.
---
So duper in 76 means having a mule account. Why is it wrong to have a mule character like all other mmos ? 
---
/u/bolsey:
---
Just a small note, and it's not a big deal because they're obvious ones, but you have the C.A.M.P. names for the Generators instead of the Plan names.
---
The Plan names are:
---
Medium Generator, Large Generator, Fusion Generator, Windmill
---
Even though everything is non-functional (argh!), it might be worth adding "(no function)" to Nuke-Cola Machine, since you did make that note on some of the others, as it's one that players could certainly expect to have some function.
---
stop hacking dood
---
That's not the point. 
---
Sounds buggy.  Ship it!
---
Communist spotted on American soil 
---
Yup. And this sub is full of it. Angry nerds who form mobs. 
---
Don't be so obtuse. You clearly claimed that I didn't understand the terms I'm using, meaning that you believe those terms mean something else. Since there's only two sides to this argument, my side which correctly states that PvP isn't griefing, and the other side which incorrectly states PvP is griefing, then you're obviously saying that you believe PvP is griefing.
---
If you don't believe that PvP is griefing and instead agree that PvP is not griefing, then your original reply to me makes absolutely no sense.
---
Ferda!
---
Naaa you wanted me and my friends are hunting if your bounty is high 
---
Lol. 
---
If you go to the options there is a bethesda.net option. Maybe that let's you switch accounts?
---
Thank you for the heads up because my current base is designed to be mobile friendly. I will have to experiment with the placement of the purifiers to avoid having an issue like this.
---
Bipolar, like in real life.
---
I’m either extremely gregarious and overly generous or spamming grenades in your way just to annoy you and firing at cars.
---
Or sitting in camp lying in bed.
---
Right now I’m running around naked under my leather armour because I scrapped my vault suit by accident.  Oh well.
---
The bloaters that used to give 500-600 give 150-200 now.

I mean no?

Yikes! I have to ask, you or someone else hasn’t created another character and you won’t accidentally on that one? You know what I mean?
---
does double punching stims work?  I have a really hard time in battle getting h-key to register, since there is always some other animation going on like swing or reload.
---
(I use born survivor to mitigate this, but it doesn't always seem to trigger.)
---
Also, vampire weapon is highly recommended for healing constantly during battle.
---
I'm pretty sure I got mine from the assorted lights pack?
---
Had a similar situation where I crafted several handmade rifles to scrap for parts and disconnected as soon as I left the crafting bench. Reconnected, none of them were in my inventory, but I was missing all of the ingredients I spent on them. I'm still pissed.
---
I really, really wish it had a more satisfying shot sound effect, but I used my first legendary, a two-shot radium rifle, for forever. If it didn't sound like a broken speaker I would probably still be using it.
---
You sure? I just saw it the other day...
---
Really?
---
Anyone tested fireproof 3 but in PA?
---
The last one I did got to about 40% health then conveniently just gave up, hovered 20 feet up, didn't attack, and let us wail on her till she died.  Sort of makes up for all the misery killing the last SB that attacked my camp out of nowhere, wasted my time, gave me less XP than a nuke zone ghoul, and dropped a lung and pencil.
---
It is one I am not looking forward to them fixing but oh well.
---
My only response to that is bethesda has to purge the whole game of all dupes. Its 100 ruined the economy and idiots constantly selling dupes at top dallor
---
Yeah? I feel like I looked that up and whatever wiki or what-have-you said that was all gaslights. Watoga/Harper's Ferry for Assorted Lights?
---
Yeah, I play games for fun... I don’t want to play with assholes like you; you found out my terrible secret! Who could have guessed that I’d want to have fun playing a video game!
---
I couldn’t afford the game when it came out, and now ALL I hear about is people who have had the game since launch griefing low level players. I like 4’s building mechanics, and I was stoked to be able to do that in a dynamic world, but the world isn’t dynamic. It’s assholes. Just bags full of assholes as far as the eye can see. So have fun doing what you do, but don’t expect Beth to make more of them; they’ve lost so much trust that they didn’t have to waste, and driven away customers. Cool that you like it, really. But you’re in the minority, and, as I have mentioned, an asshole. 
---
Nope . I have no other characters. I found it strange that I was in a place I didn't recall being in. Then I realize that I'm wearing cliths that I didn't have on. Check the items and none of my stuff is there. This is someone else's character along with their stuff and progress
---
As i remember it was like "modern lights" or "advanced lightning" or something like that. Bought it from some vendor.
---
Sry, should have been more specific. The spawn on to the mat function was removed.
---
That one that is on the floor is not actually random. It spawns there
---
This might be my favorite question I've seen in a while.
---
I have my charisma at 4 and lvl3 animal friend. Couldn't tame a deathclaw from a random encounter sadly. It was a level 61 and I'm level 155. 
---
I'm assuming not but since it doesn't show up in stats i'm just looking for confirmation. 
---
Nah; we shot racists last time, we’ll kill em again. 
---
Oh. I was wondering why it was there, I thought it was weird. Thanks for the info!
---
No hacks on anything in my account. Bethseda has messed up on another level at this point
---
Believe or not I have seen the same question and the poster wasn’t level 50. seriously no idea though have the same issue with some of my armor mods they work at level 25 but not 35 
---
Who do you think I'm talking about?
---
I spawn in super radiated water every time . Built some steps up the side so at least I’m not totally dead by the time I get out.
---
you can open it afterwards again. its no one time use
---
This one just seems silly on your part mate.
---
Then again, users will find new interesting ways to break stuff so you’re right it should be accounted for 
---
\&gt;people who destroy your vidya base are school shooters
---
I agree, I accidently waited until level 50, and am pleased I did for the SMG. I wish you could upgrade all special weapons like the voice of set and blade of basset. 
---
A 100s party trying to kill low levels?
---
I am sure people with a lake camp don't like spawning in the radioactive water either.
---
That’s seriously messed up 
---
sorry /s
---
I think that would count as a bug, in that it's  sending you to the exit not the entrance.  You have to find the entrance, which is a nearby building of one type or another.  Once you find it, it will identify on the map as Site Alpha / Bravo / Charlie.
---
I am too. I've seen what it can do first hand. I don't care if I were to lose my only explosive weapon.
---
Obviously I didn't mean from proper explosive weapons, but from the explosive legendary effect.
---
shocks, helm, torso arms, the whole bit.
---
It has my correct email and username. Right account. Wrong character 
---
Should compare specials for some of those. 
---
THIS is what SHOULD'VE been in the official guide. Seems like guides these days are beyond useless now. I largekly in oart thank the "spoiler" complainers for that.
---
THANK YOU!
---
Hate born from willful ignorance rears it's ugly head again.
---
I don't mind the queen now, even though her poison is basically indefensible.
---
But the kings suck.  What arbitrary damage type is this that magically is unmitigated?  And three of them in crossfire?  Please.  (Yeah, I played NV, but they were in limited areas, not every wet spot in WV...)
---
It fires a cluster of electrical blobs that stick to the ground and damages nearby enemies. While cool in theory, the area it covers is small and the damage is negligible even at full charge.
---
On the contrary, I think TS needs a big nerf as well. My reasoning being that it is just so much better than the other prefix effects. Ghoul slayer’s, troubleshooter’s, mutant slayer’s all give +30% damage to one enemy type. Meanwhile, TS gives 100% extra damage to everything at the cost of *some* accuracy. TS just needs to be brought in line with the other effects.
---
Maybe make the 2nd bullet a 50% chance of firing. Or lower the damage of the second bullet to 40%. Or at the very least make it use twice the ammo since it’s firing to frickin bullets🤷🏼‍♂️.
---
You are amazing, thank you so very much for your work on this! 
---
I'm going to completely restart my computer and hope that this character is gone when everything boots back up. I think this is a server side issue but I hope to God that it changes back
---
FYI, Brain Bombs do +300 AP as well.
---
You seems like having trouble to understand some concepts. 
---
Your own choice to ignoring posts that think this is griefing behavior by saying only handful of posts refer this to griefing. It’s not convincing for you because you choice of being ignorant. 
---
I didn’t say pvp is suffering. I only refer griefing is. I choose to play this game because I like it. But doesn’t mean I have to like the griefing part of the game. Griefing is griefing.  
---
It’s the same refer to real life, do you always like what you encounter on the way? If you don’t, you should quit(suicide) by your logic?
---
Gotcha, I interpreted your previous comment as Bethesda discourages folks from hoarding, hence the 
---
Stash cap.
---
Speed demon helps a fair bit but yeah.
---
I rocked a two shot cross bow for ages before I got the lever rifle plans and could make use of my anti armour lever action rifle.
---
I just found a 3 Star crossbow (only level 35 though) that does greater critics damage, better aim in VATS and uses less AP in VATS.  
---
Point is the crossbow can be a viable weapon with speed demon and a stealth sniper build as you can one shot most enemies in complete silence...it’s crap one shit hits the fan though, just too slow and only “bullet” per “clip” means it can’t take enemies down fast enough (particularly ghouls)
---
With a trailer hitch on the power armor
---
i hope your comment stays at 1 with gold. who the hell? lmao
---
You can upgrade those two to level 45

---
I better not them so that Shit lol I’ll bring all 10 kinds of hell with me
---
Can I suggest this video it explains a lot. https://youtu.be/PlllJp_Lv4k it's attached to a play list of 9 other videos centered around a low health build. I suggest you give them all a peak. It's what I built my character around and I've been able to solo the SBQ with his build. 
---
It’s a very specific type of build but you can make a one-shotting stealth melee with the rewards. 100% armor pen on the sword when wearing the dress and the eye. 75% boosted stealth from the dress and the eye. Coupled with melee and stealth perks you can slink right up to just about anything and drop it in one swing. 
---
The gun is pretty ‘meh’ unless the stun robot procs exactly when you really need it to. 
---
Def will look. Does it cover armor and all else as well?
---
some were indeed fixed, but those seems not to be fixed. Just tried to do that with an alt and it didn't complete what's missing in the challenge.
---
I do it with a friend cause more legendaries spawn 
---
I get the same thing.  I've been watching my ethernet activity as it happens.  I'm not sure if it's my fault or the server's fault that I drop.  I see that my ethernet usage drops to 0 for less than a second but that also happens when streaming video, downloading, playing other online games etc.  I'm wondering if it's something like a timeout issue where if my connection drops or lags for more than a few millisec then the whole thing drops.
---
Or it could actually be a server issue but servers dropping every 20 minutes seems like it would've popped up as an issue if they'd tested it.
---
Console, but thanks anyway
---
D=
---
Not unheard of. Here are a few older posts on this. Maybe contact Bethesda?

This would be a great addition.
---
The glitch I have is , if you load in wearing your armor you have the +100 for wearing the complete set, but if you get out of it for anything, such as to build/upgrade guns or to cook, I lose the +100 cw until I jump servers then I get it back
---
Hmm. Not sure. The one on the hill (Camp McClintock), but also for the bots, is the one I'm referring to.
---
If I'm on the noob course, then that makes sense.
---
I agree though. Getting a little falloutish (being a dick) is a great way to roleplay. I always appreciate a snarky creative griefer. 
---
Nice, I'll do some fishing there. Any idea how much you got them for?
---
This is like those people who post on LFG, and say join on their profile, but they are showing offline, so you can't.
---
How much do you die?  It seems that bloody players accept this as the cost?
---
In this case, yes. 
---
If you read my past posts, you'll see that I am one of the people who played the various versions of Fallout before and had no interest in a multiplayer game. 
---
I don't like PvP in general, but I wouldn't be good at it because I fumble a lot with the controller. My preference is to shoot things from a distance as much as possible and, thankfully, switch to melee using the shortcut control when they're up on me. 
---
I have 2 levels of fireproof, so perhaps I can swap out 2 other perks and keep from blowing myself up. I'm set passive, so other players aren't at risk. 
---
There was a story about a group of dudes being homophobic shitheads that got banned forever when they were super shitty and unapologetic about their temp ban. There were a couple stories about people getting banned for using cheatengine and apps like it as well. So far no stories about dupers.
---
I have a zealots explosive 10mm. It destroys level 68 scorched like nothing and is somehow really good against ghouls too.
---
I probably could get a lot more out of it but I have no idea what perks to put into it. 
---
I was digging around trying to find info on this I’m glad I’m not the only one. 
---
I have dual Kinetic servos to charge up ap but it feels like the way the stealth mod interacts with it, and the way vats drains ap using this for a vats stealth sniper only works to a point. 
---
Sometimes other ap drain lag glitches happen at the same time and it’s like what even is ap. Like the game can’t compute the ap gains and drains. 
---
No I have no doubt there are posts like that. The stupid thing is I could build the left leg
---
That clearly communicated dialogue window you have to press 50 times when you're making ammo and have a shit load of loose and bulked steel in your inventory?
---
That window?
---
That window there? /s
---
Jesus christ...
---
See, bitches like you don't enjoy struggle. You avoid hard modes and pat yourself on the back afterwards. The community is by far more pussies like you that cant stand competition even though that's the most realistic shit to ever occur in a Fallout game, period. Hiveminds gonna hivemind, what's the latest outrage huffpo readers are always gonna be salty. The unthinking majority is never a concern to me.
---
I'm glad you quit, the wasteland is too real for you.
---
Yeah, just used it on Gary, my neighbor behemoth, &amp; he simply laughed &amp; chucked a rock at me. Needs a buff, lol.
---
I know...but those weapons shouldn’t be a thing in my opinion.
---
Being able to pump about tens to hundreds of bullets where every bullet does as much if not more damage than a Fatman is just stupid game design...especially when every shrapnel piece of a shotgun shot counts as an individual projectile and has the explosive damage applied.
---
I’m all for turrets (including our own) possibly having this effect because they are stationary and it only happens at high levels.
---
Perhaps one way around it would be make explosive weapons disproportionally heavy or automatic encumbrance.  That way you want have people sprinting around and spamming exploding rounds on every mob they see
---
Mine was a molerat that lunged out of an outhouse as i opened it. Didnt need the out house after that
---
He's saying he wishes all other special weapons could be upgraded in the same way you can upgrade those 2. 
---
It’s relaxing until it isn’t and then there’s some epic battles. Sometimes they’re unexpected which is also fun. 
---
Yeah and more doublewides.  But I was just thinking about this log cabin concept, in that other thread about pop up campers.
---
This happened to me, the server crashed upon me logging in.
---
Same. It's whatever the game feels like at the time
---
Seems mods are considered only as "junk" items, so it'll pull it whenever it likes
---
Lone White eyebot is a different spawn; try again.
---
I noticed that too, so next time I tried using the keycards in my inventory instead of picking up the new ones. They worked, so you can just proceed to swiping them.
---
ya......I guess you are the man on this.  I take it you need me to collect the parts and then get back with you.  
---
It is absurd, if something is different than what the fan base expects they will make a post complaint about it and then talk about how it should be better suited to meet their needs.  Despite that it’s only a video and isn’t catered to every individual. Every day there’s a post about change this / change that, it’s silly and it’s just turned into a karma farm. 
---
Smash all the C.A.M.P.S you want man, if the bubbas can’t handle it then that’s a shame. But “it shouldn’t be pvp tho” that’s a bit sad then isn’t it? 
---
I use cheeseburger build also and almost never die only time I really die a lot if I solo attack the queen but other than that I'm ok. His videos are really good at showing build and explains it well. Built correctly nothing can even do damage to me level 91 death claws hit me for zero damage. 
---
I know stealth amplifies damage and that the stealth melee perk amplifies it markedly.  I can sneak through whitesprings bashing stuff to death in a few hits from stealth.  
---
 😂😭💀﻿ 
---
Oh wow, an anti-duper who destroys other players bases because they suspect is a duper, and maybe all of them even posts their effort in the subreddit, only to be praised more by their peers.
---
Why am I not surprised?
---
WHEEL SNIPE CELLY BOYS
---
Which I'd why I think, as a rifle user, I think it's best to have (at least) one high damage per shot and one high DPS weapon.
---
Not too bad... Enemies are scaled to level.  I think I first went around lvl. 20 or so
---
Everyone is doing this now. It literally has happened to my friends about 3x in one day, the other day. No one is even safe in their own crib and I have no idea what idiot started this wave, but the shit is annoying. Of course this bullshit would start days before the dupe patch, yet no one did shit all of the weeks duping went on.
---
Awesome!!
---
Sorry for your loss too
---
How many levels?
---
&gt; You can literally repair your entire base with one click of a button, and it costs next to nothing. xD
---
When you have the perk that reduces the repair cost and have hundreds of excess materials to repair with, sure, it's not devastating at all. But she's probably under level 10 at this point from the OPs description, and isn't likely to have that many resources especially after building the base.
---
No joke...
---
Not too bad... Evening scale to level.  I think I first went around lvl 20
---
agreed.  very sad!
---
slow down. stop blaming other people for your mistakes.
---
Iv seen people nuking suspected duper’s bases!!!! One issue is for anyone above 140, there is absolutely nothing to grind besides queen and it gets old. There is nothing left in the game to do except pvp. Which is why I quit two weeks ago u til they release more content. When endgame becomes pvp I leave the game. Ruined my opinion of so many games I love. Pvp on mmos should be filler not endgame. Screw new content just let them kill each other 😎👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
---
If you need materials to get her base up and running let me know. For you idiots leveling bases with decontamination sprayers. They are very annoying to repair .. 🙄 even with previously me mentioned perks. 
---
Crossing the savage divide to get there will be tough for anyone under 20 unless you just haul ass and try to outrun everything, and once you get there you'll find either scorched or super mutants hanging out. If you're the only one in the area they'll probably be level 20 something, but since every high level player stops there on vendor runs there's a decent chance it'll be filled with level 60+ mobs.
---
If you decide to make a run for it I'd suggest dropping all your junk and making sure to hit all the marked locations along the way so you have a convenient place to respawn if something gets you. 
---
Also, watch out for the bridge just north of town. There's a level 60 hermit crab that likes to hang out there.
---
Yeah, I didn't get that part, either. Just repair, or move your base an inch and you can set it back up for free with no mats charge.
---
Mine’s suppressed - all my weapons are - so I know what you mean, but mine’s a little less irritating. 
---
What's your gamertag I wanna do this.
---
&gt; Outside of maybe serums and the occasional plan there's really nothing worth buying, ever.  
---
Player trading is most definitely worth it. There's no easier way of getting the exact items you want.
---
3's? Is that what it is?
---
If there's any other places / anywhere in the vault you wanna see just comment it ig
---
I'm level 26. Thanks for the tips
---
I sure didnt on pc.
---
Super Good Advice?
---
Found the Destiny player.
---
I’m with you, but I think it’s a lost cause to argue this perspective here. A pvp friendly subreddit is probably necessary, to be honest. 
---
I play both sides.
---
If I am bored and see a high level and a low level I head over with my Chameleon Armor on and make my way into their base undetected. 
---
Normally, I’ll check to see if the low level has many achievements for the game. 
---
If they do, I stick around to see if I can steal some free shit.
---
If they actually don’t have a ton of achievements I normally just leave undetected and go on about my business.
---
The game is not region-locked and there is no region selection, it just puts you into servers based on your location (some people said a VPN does change this successfully). So I do not see why it would not be possible. Just be sure you are buying from a safe source.
---
First time sucked, especially when new people would enter the inside and respawn the super mutants (all I had was a hunting rifle at the time) and I ran out of time.
---
Now it’s easy, repair cooling systems outside, enter, repair turbine hall, find entry to reactor room (I just know where to go now as it’s near the control room in every power plant) and repair that.
---
Go back to control room and power it up from the console, done.  
---
Takes less than 10 minutes now and that’s sneaking around.
---
Ok. Spoiler alert they all died? Is that really needed? Did you think anyone at the end of any quest would be alive or what? Without context it’s three people in a dress. Really not much of a spoiler at all. 
---
YUP!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
---
They released a game in a completely unfinished and untested state.  I can't remember the last online game I played where duping was so easily accessible and rampant, with no option for corrective action.   
---
Not to mention all the glitches.
---
Yeah... I doubt they'll lose more players by not wiping peoples inventories. You leaving the game hardly hurts it and I doubt there are more of you leaving the game just on the simple fact that people have duped gear in their inventory. There are far more fundamental and egregious problems I can think of for leaving this game than TSE weaps and duping. 
---
The only items I know of to be deleted from people's inventories that was public, was several mask that we're acquired in the Dev Cell due to hacking. Other than that, I haven't heard any other legitimate reports of this kind of behavior. Other than a friend of a friends type deal.
---
I firmly believe that the damage done by duping is to great and irreparable at this point. They are obviously trying to do some damage control via patches but again, doing a wipe of people's inventories will surely be the dumbest and possibly last mistake they can make. I firmly believe that by doing something like that at the very LEAST you will probably lose 50-60% of your player base. 
---
Common problem. The real kick in the nuts is if you finish the silo, launch, THEN crash. Waste the card and everyone else gets to enjoy your misfortune, assuming you can’t find anyone in the server or the server fully crashed.
---
If you stand outside the tent and push stuff inside it, you’ll have a much easier time fitting stuff in. You can also use the rug trick to fit things into the tents. 
---
Gauss rifle and Tesla rifle. 
---
Which is kind of funny given how much people are circumventing this or just carrying huge piles of stuff and simply taking the AP hit.  Although, it does get more annoying over 1000 lbs.
---
I check these and the cash registers constantly but never find anything in them. Am I just unlucky?
---
Fpr me, I love the TSE weapons. It finally makes those underpowered weapons to actually be viable, instead of having to stick to the same melee/shotgun setup.
---
Not everything has to be about TSE weapons being OP.
---
Yeah, screw that, who cares, spend the caps like the rest of us. There is too much trouble to get into by letting unknown players close. This just leads to trouble or unwanted shenanigans to often. 
---
bethsada cant even build a stable game... imo first orded is fixing this game. then make some kind of endgame area. then go nuts
---
If you read above people are getting hugely upset about people doing PvP.  They are comparing killing someone and destroying a base on a game to people with sociopathic tendencies, I mean come on... it’s a game.  I find it stretch  as.
---
If you have one vendor in the whole game world that sells a mod with RNG, are you just going to leave it thereand hope you don't have to server hop for 6 hours (cause that's fun)
---
Or are you going to pick it up when you see it??
---
Its all down hill after lvl 30. Promise. 
---
Right? I would love to keep All Rise and Black Diamond all the way through the game but eventually they're just gonna be not as good as something else anymore
---
This is so awesome!!😍
---
Furious shredding minigun. Ghouls just run onto it and you can back off if you just want to tag a guy. 
---
Gets easier as you learn where the stuff is, but then you’ll get the bug where repairing things doesn’t move any of the bars.
---
Honestly as you build up the build you become so strong you don’t really die 
---
Right. 
---
Scope the high damage one shot, and a reflex on the DPS is what I run.
---
Role playing is a thing. Just because someone plays a villain in a video game, particularly one with *zero villains whatsoever*, doesn’t make them a bad person in real life. 
---
This game is entirely set up to protect the heroes and punish villains, and somehow that’s still not enough. 
---
We’re not here to kink shame you.
---
Just submitted a ticket. Thank you
---
And this is the biggest problem with that armor right now... (aside from the high maintenance costs)
---
These arent showing correct values, ALL mutations gets 75% of the negative effects reduced. I've tested with Healing Factor for example.
---
i anticipate the log cabin set to be added either as dlc or as atx content in the future; it seems like it's already a cohesive build set so i don't think there would be a ton of legwork involved to get it into the building system.
---
Very nice, obviously part of a future dlc
---
Did you still want that sledge man?
---
Buy the collectors edition and complain about the bag.
---
That’s why I only play this game to play the grognak mini game. Every other aspect of the game is annoying or not fun.
---
So, you dislike TSE but are fine with melee ignoring 100% of armor?
---
TSE Gattling Plasma! First time use tonight with Scorch queen! But otherwise my Rocket Sledge! 
---
This is...as far as I can tell, completely false. I have six of the industrial purifiers and I'm lucky to get a TOTAL of six per hour. 
---
ya, I don't like any of those power plant events :(
---
so i have no power :(
---
Timed myself clearing alpha last night; 27 minutes though i did kill myself once accidentally with the TSE
---
Am I an asshole for my C.A.M.P being there? The bodies are still entirely accessible just a little hidden behind a brick house...
---
I traded a bunch of stuff for it from a guy who takes crappy legendary stuff as well as good legendary stuff and tries to find buyers for them. I asked him if he had any other handmade legendary rifles I could trade this to him for, and he didn't, so I posted here. 
---
It doesn't seem like he trades in duped weapons, which is one reason I like dealing with him. I can't guarantee it, but I have also posted previously that i'm set passive and I don't do pvp. 
---
Someone help me. Jesus. I spent 6 hours grinding fo lead and steel to make ammo for my new found 50 Cal..one rub through whitesprings and I'm out of everything.
---
You said it, man.
---
Also there's some holotapes.
---
How do you get another card? 
---
Yeah, I got bored and adventured every vault - each one seems to be fully fleshed out however this is the only one with new items/Assets that I can see, aside 94
---
Are you me?
---
Can't believe they have this for workshops and not for C.A.M.P.s.
---
It's just mind boggling.
---
Not to mention it's never consistent. I always get placed in about 3 different places around the general vicinity of my C.A.M.P. If they had at least made it spawning right next to the C.A.M.P. device, we could control it. But the Fast Travel Mats are the ideal solution.
---
I've had all kinds of spawn problems, including falling off cliffs.
---
Here's a couple I've had:

---
that sucks.  I respecced to add this.
---
So weaken guns, leave melee capable of ignoring 100% armor while getting double damage if enemy is at full health?
---
Does it move the boundaries of the camp too? 
---
Just finished mine. Used every scrap of steel I had.  
---
Really not all that impressive and I maxed out my budget. 
---
That gave me a good laugh 😂
---
Just move your camp out of white springs?
---
And has enemies in whereas the other ones did not, but Vault 94 did say danger when I was crouched
---
I do the same thing. I leave ammo, plans, recipes, treasure maps, aid, junk and legendary items.
---
It's not consistent though. There's usually about 3 spawn points that I get, whether Fast Travel or loading into the game for the first time.
---
Fast Travel Target mat is the solution.
---
Have you done the cache clearing fix?
---
Same. Some decent materials but no good gear. 
---
Have any of these limited time items come back into rotation yet?
---
After accidentally scrapping 2 calibrated shocks this way, I now make it a point to put all mods in my stash before scrapping all junk. And I never let my scrap steel in my stash fall below 200 until the patch at the end of the month. 
---
All this alliteration annoys assholes and anal antagonists.
---
There are a lot of possible outcomes to the quest as you progress through it, it's clear as you get towards that point that there was likely going to be a confrontation between the mother and daughter, and while we have no living NPCs in WVA, the outcome doesn't necessarily have to be that they both had died right then and there.  
---
With no other bodies around it shows that there wasn't a turning point where the daughter saw the error of her ways and fights against the raiders she was supplying info too and dies with her mother fighting them off.
---
With both bodies there, you know there there is no chance that the daughter moved on to join the raiders, or that neither one of them decided to simply leave the area to escape the scorched. 
---
So yes, there is a spoiler, while people might have a hunch based on other things we see, the picture removes any chance of a twist ending. 
---
Why are the lines of text at different angles?
---
I usually have to pause for half a second between shots otherwise it will miss every time, I put it down to gun recoil.
---
Occasionally I just have bad luck and miss multiple shots in a row but usually I never miss anything above 70%.
---
Perks must play a role even when the percentage is high or low 
---
Hop on the discord, there are also a few kik groups apparently
---
That last photo... XD
---
I’ve never been disconnected but I do agree the need to figure out this rollback shit. I go out of my way to wait like 5 minutes at my camp and then quit to main menu and I’ll still get slightly rolled back. Their auto save/roll back system is ridiculously stupid 
---
New Note Found \[Imgur\]([https://i.imgur.com/E78yS8m.png](https://i.imgur.com/E78yS8m.png))
---
I read the title like the coldopen of letterkenny
---
Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work at all.  Neat idea....
---
I agree they're poorly thought out for a multiplayer game, but they're in so not much to do but work with it. Unfortunately unless you want to hop with a very specific spec (unyielding build) that completely gimps your survivability they're essential in "end game" to avoid the Bethesda bullet sponge effect.
---
While I'd be annoyed in the short term due to how much they cost me, I'd support buffing ranged weapons base damage and removing legendaries all together, then assigning better designed legendary effect weapons to jnstance/raid bosses (upcoming vaults, SBQ, etc).
---
Buy now. Quickly buy. Limited time only. Hurry! While stocks last. (Digital item with unlimited supply)
---
Full set of assassins armour can help, combined with right perks and mutations.
---
Alternatively, duck and weave randomly at all times 
---
Could be a glitch that was preventing your regen if you sprint before flying, like the continued AP drain if you open your pipboy from a sprint. 
---
Uranium Fever is also a good event to do for legendaries. Typically at least 2 spawn during the event. But thanks for the list OP, knew of some of these, will check the others out! 
---
🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Your level? I don't want to suggest something you wont be able to defend.
---
Technically you can, friends can build in each others camps, so pop them next to each other.
---
Those first world problems. 
---
No chance of me killing myself with my fire axe though. Especially effective seeing as I’m specced as a rifleman. 
---
Everything that uses AP also uses battery power, from Sprinting to Vats
---
You should take a look at this chart that's been going around the past couple days.
---
If I'm looking at the right one, it's Assorted Lights.
---
Yeah I know how it goes brother, on the plus side you have something non-PA users don't have access to... Emergency Protocols.  That mod is insane.
---
Did you have room for budget in your CAMP?
---
Or doing a event and it happening half way. 
---
That’s not true. It just shows they died. They could have been ambushed by raiders or a bear. They could have died holding each other after the daughter had a change of heart. It spoils literally nothing. 
---
Would be interested in knowing if they figure out what caused that. 
---
Oh man, such a good balance change! Oh wait, it's not. Because all you people who cry "NERF TSE!" always seem to ignore the fact melee just goes around one-slapping everything cause 100% armor pen is possible for them as well as instigating and more damaging power attacks. 
---
Not for me, I constantly have to sell or just dump so many bulk resources.
---
I have springs galore because I don’t really use them and use tonnes of screws making weapons and upgrading legendaries but still get plenty just by picking phones, fans, scales and hit plates wherever I see them
---
Not immediately. You have to hit it, wait a second and hit the next. It's pretty rapid tho. 
---
Also I've yet to find a vampire weapon that's worth it at higher levels. They give e such minimal health returns. 
---
TS is not the only thing that needs a nerf in this game.
---
Instigating is also an effect on guns as well and tank killer is also a perk in perception. It goes both ways. I’m saying that the legendary effects don’t need to be so obviously better than one another. There are few circumstances where TS isn’t the best option for a gun build.
---
Perhaps there needs to be a damage modifier on PvP so instakills are less possible if not impossible. Perhaps players do 0.65x damage to other players when engaged in PvP. Just a thought
---
Get out of here Todd
---
A Hardened lvl 50 sniper will do 140 base damage. With rifle perks and sneak crits, they are excellent. Do you not have the plans to mod hunting rifles? 
---
How much caps? :)
---
You’re all from 76. Your minds are being affected by the radiation and emptiness of the land.
---
You need to be purged. For the good of all.
---
How about they fix the damn game before adding things. 
---
He shows up to my builds regularly, like I think he has days he attacks kind of regular.  I always have a lampost or streetlights, I am sure this what attracts him, because he doesn't visit my non-streetlamp builds.
---
Hmm my rifle build isn't much different. 
---
"We turn the assholes into interesting content" \*Wild cheering from the crowd\*
---
I'm playing on XB1X with Wi-fi, I maybe play 1-3 hours each time but I havn't had a DC for over a week. The game has actually only frozen **THREE** times ever. Two times in a row when trying to scrap items at the same workbench and once when a high level player initiated a trade with me
---
This happens to me if I server hop a bunch sometimes. It will just despawn my camp randomly for no reason whatsoever
---
helps alot adding 2h for close quaters.
---
Girl feet. You get damn girl feet. 
---
Yeah that's what I meant about the glowy part. Played with mods a bit already to try chat and flashlight fixes pre patch, still playing Vanilla right now though. Seems like Bethesda is in a bit of a community clean up mode. Gonna wait till the dust settles to start being morally grey with the TOS lol
---
Blue screen? My best guess is dupers trying to get as much done before the patch puts their bitch asses back to playing the game normally.
---
&gt;&gt; You need Level 3 Power User, otherwise it'll rip through fusion cores like a fat kid through cake.
---
I find this one strange. I have been using a jetpack since level 60-ish (X-01) and still throw away cores regularly to reduce weight. I've never noticed any serious drain, and I use it all the time.
---
(FYI I also have marsupial, but not bird bones - dunno if this makes any difference).
---
True. The only reason I use it is because it does double almost triple damage a sniper does.
---
It spoils that they both died in W. VA at around the same time.  It spoils quite a bit.  It spoils that there is no "next part of the quest" after you find this.  
---
I have made it to level 65 and never seen the Flatwoods monster.
---
I’ve made triangular-ish builds in game before but would usually result in a large house build not really a small AFrame shape build.
---
If you have just one piece of poisoner's gear, her poison becomes much more manageable. As for the king, idk, I never had too much of a problem with them dealing too much damage. I have an exterminator's auto grenade launcher and marsupial though, so I just fly up and pretend to be a scorchbeast and they're dead before they can hit me
---
This one was by far the most fun to capture: [here](https://imgur.com/a/YcVaMSN). Taking some of these is really challenging.
---
Up by Anchor Farm there is a pond south, southeast (general direction) with copper close by (other side of farm on rocks). 
---
Only launched one nuke (one attempt server dropped out half way through). First attempt it was all high level robots, but turrets did not activate? Second attempt the robots were lower, and every turret was activated. This was yesterday when I was at level 88 and second successful attempt was right after the first unsuccessful one.
---
(Never took enough ammo! Was reduced to beating turrets to death with the butt of my sniper rifle!)
---
Yes, but compared to the carry capacity of calibrated shocks, it's a very fringe choice imo.
---
Show your patriotism for the small price of $4.
---
I've gone from 2-3 hour run around without a problem, to 3 dc's in the space of 30 minutes tonight.  Peak time I guess :(
---
Agreed. Too bad it's the strongest sniper right now. Would much prefer a .308 or a .50 cal sniper.
---
Nope. The ten pounds for the chassis is all the weight you're going to have for a suit.
---
I didn’t test SM. Maybe you can test and confirm? :)
---
Power Armor pieces do not increase the frames weight when attached. It remains weight 10 regardless. 
---
The Vault-Tec Bed is used in most of the Vaults, while the Simple Modern Bed seems to be exclusive to Vault 76.
---
This game really needs separate pvp and non-pvp servers
---
Maybe if it was a thong
---
I ran into an albino scorched deathclaw, that was one ugly deathclaw, it looked like a giant molerat.
---
Probably a lot of screen shots from pipboy which isn't lined up and then put together in photshop or something
---
Exactly. 
---
As long as it's attached to the chassis then it'll weigh 10
---
Alas the lonely lives they must lead
---
Yes, I made sure I had more than 10% budget.
---
There are perk cards that allow for building more by extending your budget, but honestly, I don't care about it.
---
I think “Hardened” is the most protection and I would recommend “Deep Pocketed” for the second because who doesn’t need more carry weight? 
---
Ultra Light is useless because with deep pocketed you have more lbs of storage total.
---
OP herself gilded it.  Didnt appreciate the complete unnecessary genderization of MVP.  Which makes sense, cuz it's stupid 
---
are you stupid? who ever said anything about being wanted...
---
Been hearing that a lot.  Need to check them out
---
Make Fallout Great Again.
---
Agreed! Would love to see the existing faction flgs such as Responders, BoS, Raiders, Free States and The Enclave.
---
Not always easy when you are low level..
---
this idea reminds me of a fo4 mod (I think it is part of sim settlements but I cannot remember I have too many mods ) and you  put down tech/logistic station at a settlement , supply the station with supplies, and it will create an eyebot that increases your carry weight. if you put another station in another settlement you can set up trade routes for supplies from your workshop stash, the Idea is the same kinda but a brahmin instead. Sounds cool I like it and replace brahmin with Dogmeat and it would be awesome in my opinion.
---
PC is never going to be “safe”.
---
Just saw a post about a guy who logged in and had  a different character lmao.
---
Console is the only way to go for “safety”.
---
&gt; tank killer is also a perk in perception
---
Tank killer: 36% for three points.
---
Incisor: 50% at 2 points or 75% at 3 points.
---
Such balance...
---
&gt; Perhaps players do 0.65x damage to other players when engaged in PvP
---
65% of 1000 damage is...? Oh right, still enough to oneshot a player... Melee can get obscene amounts of damage and armor pen, yet no-one seems to care about that at all.
---
It might be more in the same sense as how Pokemon were "cloned" back in Gold and Silver for the Gameboy Color. Disconnecting from the server during a data transfer of what you have and the container used. Obviously a disconnect is essential to the process but in what specific regard is unknown 
---
GQ10 is Grahm, which you can see if you keep following the Reference links.
---
Oh dang it was meant for another comment in this thread 
---
1) PC
---
2) Sigarthas
---
3) N/A
---
4) At some point, I lost my Veil of Secrets. I don't think I ever dropped or sold it, but it's not in my inventory or stash. Now I can't get into the Order of Mysteries base and have no way to replace the veil. Could you make this craft-able for those who have completed the quest line, or restore it to my character? Thanks
---
5) 190112-002155
---
This happened to me too. There are more on the actual range itself that you can collect. 
---
Yes it’s annoying, but it was my own fault for scrapping them. But yes, they should be marked as quest items. 
---
By how much you are down. It's % based not point based. 
---
&gt;&gt; (96% UPVOTED)
---
Who the fuck would downvote this??
---
Kk thx +karma 
---
I think the picture was wearing marine underarmor
---
On lvl20 ish i found 3k ammo in a suitcase at a trainstation. Until 50 i always went back, then i realized what happened. :D :D
---
So what you're saying is that you're supposed to witch hunt and harass other players while telling them to go screw themselves? Ah ok. I must have missed that in tip on the loading screen. 
---
I've been using this method for weeks, and it almost didn't work yesterday. Some guy found my gun I was transferring, while I was loading in, but he gave it to me when I showed up and went straight to that certain box.
---
Thankfully it was a very cool 110+ lvl guy that didn't spec to automatic weapons.
---
I know. This game has been out for years and this is a major gameplay issue /s
---
It did used to give higher level ones more consistently but it got nerfed a couple patches ago and hasn't been that great since.
---
It's a console feature.
---
It’s going to be added in a future DLC I heard. 
---
This is a valid point. 
---
Just type in fallout 76 trolling you’ll find it AcePlaysssS 
---
I feel for you. And the game balance/"PvP rules" are messed up.
---
One of the reasons I haven't touched the game since November.
---
Something happened, I play on PS4, and while I know the actual game patch goes live next week for us, I don't know if they did something server side or if something else is going on.  For the past two days I have not been able to fast travel or enter/leave buildings without often getting a disconnect.  Sometimes I'll just get server unresponsive, but the bulk of it has been when I fast travel. I've even lost stuff I had recently picked up as a result.  
---
Don't know why this got downvoted, Bethesda owes us after the train wreck of Fallout: 76. 
---
This. Is. Perfect. Thank you!
---
Yep. Big ol case of disappointment 
---
Damn you Grahm
---
For quantity, I only use a max of two purifiers. That is more than enough that usually I have around 20 give or take in my inventory. That amount is even taking up too much weight.
---
The only reason I could see having more than that is if you want to mass produce adhesive.
---
There are definitely exceptions to the "just an asshole" griefer. That is true. 
---
But the people who like to just go round destroying others stuff for no real reason...
---
So that is what is happening, some days I jump in my power armour and I have 450 carry weight, and I am like wheee, and go shopping, then I jump out to melee a mutant, and when I get back in I am &gt;350 again.  So if I put my armour on and get 450 don't take it off til I am done shopping?
---
There's night in this game :O?!
---
Two shot stuff is fine. Explosive on top is too much.. leave explosive for the mark19 and missile launcher. 
---
Definitely. Just sucks when your whole base is kind of a structural lie coming off of one foundation piece with everything else upper flooring, even flooring at foundation level.even with my whole base thrown into my stash, the amount of planks and such that only fit because I did the this item is floating hokey pokey is a little high. Big fan of stuff like putting purifiers indoors, which takes a solid 30 minutes of very finessed campfire placement, water purifier placement on it, then cutting through that joining with a floor.
---
Just yeah. If certain bases get crushed, I've got 0 choice to repair if I want to keep it. 
---
My fix would be adding an extra layering to blue prints. We can blue print sectionals and such, but why not just blueprint the entire camp including cemented x/y codes for the CAMP placement? Instead of being able to place the CAMP anywhere, you scroll to the next option that instead only allows CAMP placement to locations previously blue printed. Youd see an outline like you do when a CAMP item is broken in build mode as a place to snap the CAMP. 
---
This way we can more or less save a location, not a design. Could still let blueprints do their thing, but this option would definitely help I feel. With those parameters, its translate perfectly to having blueprints ready doe favorite workshops. I stead of spending q0 minutes blockading entrances every time, your blueprint from the 2 hours spent making the power plant look like a fortress can actually be reset for a new server.
---
I dunno. Seems like an easy implement. And would make my anxiety of getting too invested in a plot disappear.
---
Good for you
---
Stick your head in the sand. Stick it nice and deeeep then
---
Alright. I can learn that and other mods by scrapping standard marine armors, right?
---
Yes, I have played it extensively, just hit level 124 and have yet to catch an STD so it seems pretty safe.
---
Im down. 
---
This is fustrating, my team is large and it sucks we have to have all these mini teams instead of one boh one
---
Nope I have 5 chassis all fully armored in my stash w the perk that makes them weigh 2.5 lb 
---
But Fallout 4 and Fallout 76 are in the same exact engine?
---
Mine vanished after ammo crafting -_-
---
I know of this, but it would be better to combine camps and reap the benefit of 2x building budget, and maybe even building space. 
---
First one I cheesed with VATS from range because previous Fallout games have taught me to be very wary of Robobrains. Second one I just sprinted through the greasy robo-guffs and bwapped him in the face twice with my trusty Barbed Pole. 
---
I found Pipfall (Pitfall) at the WV Lumber Co., top left of the map
---
So far no luck but I will keep trying 
---
PM me a source, I'd like to check it out.
---
I wanted to revive the daughter so I could kill her again.
---
I got the vent there yesterday.
---
Herd mentality has no negative effect with class freak 3. Healing Factor correctly only does 12%.
---
I'm not sticking my head in the sand. I don't believe you.
---
Its the same psychological systems as gambling. And its also where the entire AA industry is headed. At least until they get the wrong Legislator's son or daughter addicted to their shitty systems and someone finally cares. 
---
One of these days, the people who need to do so, will figure out that, where the brain is concerned, money does not need to be involved, for gambling addiction to take hold. RNG loot: Gambling. Random Daily login rewards: Slot machine gambling. To the brain its all the same.
---
Deep pocketed needs to be bought, hardened can be gotten from scrapping.
---
-_-
---
Even a two shot would be enough to solo it in about 10min, tse assault rifle/handmade/combat avg~5 minutes without exploits. I saw a hammerbro ten-shot a queen, over a month ago, (he was lvl60?) so I imagine people should only be getting stronger.
---
 "every tse is duped" mentality is frowned upon be people who invested hundreds of hours farming, it falls in them same thought process  that every pvp interaction is "griefing" 
---
As for duped tse users, they are a dime a dozen in the blast zone, but it's obvious they're just spraying and praying, with little damage contribution, either from lack of perks, or game knowledge. 
---
If you can't solo it in a timely manor, you're not high rank* regardless of the number next to your name. 
---
There are plenty of better/stronger players out there, these are only my opinions/suggestions from my experiences. 
---
Ive been told but never got one for myself. Deep pocketed plans are from the treasure  maps
---
Gracias. All FUD
---
A quick “survey” is your downvotes and my upvotes and that concludes you’re wrong.
---
Ok, so what I'm seeing after testing is that it "lobs" several energy "blobs" in an arc towards whatever ur aiming at. Can aim at enemy/mob, or shoot it at floor (think 'telesto' a la Destiny). I put it into the stash for now...will experiment more later, for science. ;)
---
Fine for me.
---
I do like the cut of that jib.
---
Need to scavenge more rubber and oil. 
---
Duping means that things like stim packs, bobble heads, tse weapons, etc... are sold for next to nothing. People who have tradeable items in the game, who have earned them legitimately, can't get decent sell prices now. 
---
All depends on your build. There’s no one best mod for anything.
---
LMBOOOOO. That sounds like a wild experience. 
---
I mostly wanted a pack Brahmin because all the traveling traders you meet usually have a few Brahmin and some guards, thought it would be fun to roleplay a traveling merchant with a pack Brahmin but i would also like a option to have a dog like dogmeat aswell.
---
That’s cool. Fact remains, I’ll remain loyal to tangible proof and not speculation or assumption. If I wanted to invest faith in Mother Goose I would join my kid at preschool, grab a lolly and snuggle up for story time.
---
Camp budgets need to increase. That is true.
---
Besides, why would hungry mutants or angry Scorched attack the walls of a base? You dont see them out in the Wasteland randomly knocking down buildings. But a player base? Oh yeah, they will happily make an exception and expend the energy in the players case. Not at literally any other time, but for the player? Sure. 
---
Its stupid and it makes no sense.
---
Sorry to tell you, but weight reduction perks don't affect the stash. They're taking up 50 pounds in there
---
You can get it from Harper's Ferry vendor as well, easy peasy.
---
Yeah. Theyll get right on that.
---
I can't stand their name, it's like a tongue twister.
---
I just call them the Bitches of Bafflement.
---
I kinda want this heh
---
The new CTD bug is the new duping exploit - mark my words on this.
---
Anything that abruptly disconnects you will roll you back, and this is the basis of pretty much all duping techniques.
---
I get this weird feeling that the dev team are on point with spotting and fixing stuff, but the testing team are absolutely asleep at the wheel.
---
I believe Metal Building Set is from Watoga Shopping Plaza or Grahm the wandering vendor.
---
Hmm, maybe the 6 charisma is indeed necessary, or maybe it was bugged. Thanks for the response, hopefully we can get some more consensus and solidify that requirement
---
or you know, just roll another character  and do those dalies.
---
and they're always unlimited size containers
---
Lol. No it doesn’t. Two corpses tells you basically nothing. Some people just really like to feel upset, and those are usually a big part of the group that cries about spoilers. 
---
More springs !
---
Where are these bonuses displayed? I don't recall ever seeing them.
---
Right. Thanks very much. Best place to farm for those mods?
---
Link the discord...probably doesn’t have it 
---
Welcome to this sub.
---
Saddlebag mods!
---
Just pop that 1000lb Brahmin up there on the modding table for me, will you? :)
---
Tyvm.
---
I don't know, you tell me.
---
you can enter without cheats
---
my friend did it 40+ hours ago
---
still not banned
---
&gt; Upon messaging the guy 
---
How do you... message someone in the game? Is text chat added?
---
Boiled just means you've killed all the bacteria in it, but still may have chemical and/or physical contaminants.
---
Purified is run through charcoal filters to remove those impurities.
---
I can see marking Purified as acceptable for making food (though that runs into the problem of people mashing the button and not realizing they're using all their Purified Water), but for crafting materials Purified is the only way to go.
---
It's a creative title sort of thing, less about shared engines and such. A creative IP is a creative IP. They're down for you making your own content, but essentially doing a large scale remaster of an entire title onto a different platform, that's sorta reserved for the rights owners. 
---
We just got the tomahawk plan. You still want this?
---
I don’t have a recon scope so I just kill them.
---
I just have gotten the heavy combat chest plan from that event some time as I definitely did buy it but do have it
---
:/ spoilers! So why did they fight?
---
😂 
---
And then you get one-shot in pacifist by an asshole griefer/duper stacking damage bobbleheads.
---
This is a bit rough, but has a list of the recipes I've found in game so far.  (Ignore the ingredients I haven't kept that up at all).

The same people hunting dupers used the carry weight glitch.

Hypocrites talking about server performance. If you want to jack people do it. Just don't be a hypocrite.
---
I got them dropped from an event. I think all "take  workshop" events give you plans building plans. 
---
Agree, just completed it solo last night for the windmill, then claimed the workshop for the weekly challenge. Might try Posiedon next to see how it compares. 
---
For sure, will log on right now. Will give you 1k Caps.
---
I forget what exactly the patch did, but currently legendary drops are capped to the level of the enemies, and mole miners stop at 40 for some reason. 
---
That’s annoying. Thx
---
Ok I got the plans and scrapped like 10 or something and didnt get 1 component is it a bug or something?
---
Drifters outfit.
---
For all your hobo needs but with a warm coat 
---
I don't think the Two Shot and Explosive modifiers should be nerfed, but I do think all the other modifiers should be buffed. For instance, the Furious (each consective hit does more damage than the last) effect sounds great on paper, but the damage increase for each hit is negligable. If they could improve the damage boost for each hit, Furious weapons could stand toe to toe with 2 shot/Explosive weapons. There's many other examples of modifiers that need a buff as well.
---
Right. Melee is OP, too. Thanks. TSE is the topic of this thread though🤷🏼‍♂️
---
My point being that a nerf across the board to both melee (perks like incisor) and to TS and explosive. My maths are a little off, but you phrase your criticism as if the idea is completely off the table.
---
I'm not on some crusade, hunting down people I think are duping. I killed him because he had a bounty.

1 of each flux with the card maxed if I remember correctly.

Good story
---
You were right! It is Assorted Lights. Got it in Harper's Ferry almost immediately. I appreciate you all!
---
I like the look of the Radium Rifle, but in a game where radiation damage is so situational I see no reason why not to use the Combat Rifle instead if you are trying to maximize your performance. Combat Rifle has more mods, has a higher rate of learning mods due to mod rarity and its drop rate from Scorched, and higher ballistic damage.
---
Lever-Action Rifle seemed to gain a faster reload speed since the patch, in addition to its reload bug being fixed. This is your best use of .45 in terms of pure damage, it rivals the Hunting Rifle's slightly higher damage with a substantially higher ROF, and now with the faster/fixed reload I would argue it even has the reload advantage.
---
Combat Rifle is great with a VATS build because it has a very low AP cost and you can just keep proccing crits. For scorchbeasts I like to carry a light Combat Rifle just for that purpose and swap to a high damage rifle for a big crit.
---
idk the void maybe todd killed them
---
Lol.... Wtf do you even mean?
---
I had this the other day and it turned out it didn't like that 1 of the 2 required materials, of the same type, being in my stash and 1 being on me, so maybe try putting all required mats in your inventory?
---
"Areeee youuu loook-in at meee? you best stop looking at me and start buying"

Basically everything the raider bot says as well. Things along the lines of "when you kill someone with one of my weapons, think of mee" "i love that my weapons cause chaos" "kill people who deserve it, take whatever you want"
---
I hope we can meet with him one day, I would like to kill Freddy Woods and his father myself.

What if they did what Tale of Two Wastelands did, and make it so you have to own both Fallout 4 and Fallout 76 before you can access Appalachia?
---
Should have called the Appalachian Police! Pretty sure thats breaking and entering

I do ultimately agree that they will, and posted about this before:

White knight plus it good plus that luck perk that gives a chance for armour to repair itself when hit.
---
I almost never have to repair armour.
---
Up until I had white knight and fix it good I’d only repair legendaries and scrap everything else and make new armour.  
---
I only use leather armour as a stealth sniper because it feels more suites character wise and I like the way it looks...plus that vault tec paint job

Xbox you can message.

I want a lvl35/40 legendary handmade/Combat rifle with 90% weight reduction and either AA/TS/MS 8-) so I take it that’s where I have to go 
---
If you’re not running 1080p (the assumed standard) your FPS metrics aren’t really useful. 1440x900 is just over half the pixel count of 1080p, so it’d be expected that your FPS would be significantly better than OPs, even on an older card with less VRAM.
---
I don't want to watch all the videos. How does the build prevent so much damage?
---
Level 91 and only now kinda getting my build right for my playstyle. Mostly sniper rifle, Underlever and handmade (with a 10mm for trips back to the forest) but also high strength with rocket Sledge for when it gets up close and messy. Kinda wish I understand the perk system earlier, and also not examining all 2-3 star legendaries before I scrapped them? It's only the last 10 levels I started using legendary armours, but as my look is set in stone. It's a slow process.
---
Ok. Getting the plan now from my scavenger
---
Need PvP and PVE servers.
---
I hear you but they dont care. These guys want to argue that "it's not that bad dont call it cheating" when all you are saying is that BY DEFINITION it IS cheating, regardless of the impact on the game or individual players. logic often gets downvoted here on reddit, dont feel too bad. 
---
yep
---
Nice!  My fav is Tesla Coils since they do damage to hostile mobs only (so I can tag glowing ones at Whitesprings with out making the robots hate me xD)
---
Yes. I get very good rolls there but they are never max lvl. 
---
Just NW of the Sunshine Meadows Industrial Farm along the river. Right after a drainage bridge you’ll find a Junk pile.
---
Brilliant. Am queued to enter world with the eddynasty account now.
---
I seems like having trouble to understand you because it's difficult to understand your poor grasp on the English language. Only a handful of posts do refer to PvP as griefing. 
---
PvP isn't griefing. This is a PvP game, so if you don't like PvP, it's not the game for you.
---
I'm not the one demanding everybody else change because I don't like something. If I don't like something, I just don't participate. The same is true for this game. Since you don't like PvP, which you call griefing, you should just not participate in it. And since this is a PvP game, it's best you just play something else that you might enjoy more. I'd suggest WoW. In that game, there's no need or reason to ever interact with any other player.
---
You've got a point.
---
You don't really need power user or batteries included. You find enough fusion cores everywhere there's no point in carrying more than 3 on person and 5 in stash. Other than that, my only advice is to find AP restore items instead of AP refresh items. Nuka Quantums restore AP, whereas canned coffee and nuka cherries increase refresh. If you want to superman your way up something, quantums get you there.
---
Every time I spawn somewhere a super mutant warlord appears before disappearing a few seconds later.

I’ve reported him to the police robots but there is nothing they can do until he actively hurts me :(

Fireproof now adds explosive resistance in addition to fire resistance. Up to 45%. When stacked with a dense armor mod, it can completely negate explosive damage.
---
"Fallout shouldn't be a multiplayer focused game" we said, "it'll ruin what makes Fallout fun" we said.

I am only level 39 so this is perfect for me

Cool thanks! I gotta remember that as I’m leveling up. 
---
Ok....

you say you don't want it reproduced, but all through the topic you're asking how to do it lmfao.

There's a perk to increase Chem duration.

I don't how I can possibly live without this epic hat, buy am gonny give it a good go.

Holding out for faction themed paints / camp items.
---
I have a feeling whatever vault tec is doing is probably punishment enough. 
---
It was pretty brutal, esp. on the missions where you had to traipse back and forth several times all up/down the map.  On the flip side, I pretty much covered every square inch!  Still finding a few hidden places though
---
The sheer number of duplicated TSE makes for a slightly degraded experience in some ways. 
---
For example after finding legitimately my own non TS explosive, I feel most lump me into the "he got that from a duper/is a duper" category pretty fast, and rightly so I suppose, it's a real issue.
---
Unnatural supply of these weapons, rather than their actual use by players, causes issues. One might be excited to team with a player using such a weapon if they weren't expecting 50 more to pop out of nowhere.
---
I never thought about this until now. A couple of days ago two guys came and obliterated base with tse. I thought they were just being assholes, but to be fair I was at my base for over an hour trying to remodel my house. It's pretty sad that you cant even enjoy building without having everything you own destroyed. 
---
Quit being a baby. You know none of that stuff has ever happened to you.
---
I’ve checked there all the time and only ever seen strengthened marine armor plans, never buttressed or hardened.
---
I have never checked that cash register... I thought it was a prop. Dolt!
---
That's what I meant. I wish it was the case for all special weapons.  
---
It's Bethesda coding, so yes.
---
There’s a pretty big area that can’t be built in next to a camp and you’ll get that message.   I use to camp in the lake across from the station across to top of the world.  I would get that message and the next camp would be easily 2-3 camp circles away.   You can’t have next door neighbors in the game I guess.
---
I absolutely agree. All I want is a nice view at the top of a cliff but Bethesda keeps spawning me at the bottom
---
The damage does suck with the CR.  What I do (stealth rifle like you) is carry around both the CR and HR and just switch depending on the targets.  Maybe you'll luck up like I did and get a furious CR.
---
Sniper is more than viable.
---
Stealth sniper with anti armour legendary is OP because you one shot everything but scorch beasts and mirelurk queens and occasionally bloated glowing ones.
---
Lever action rifle anti armour with right perks mean I can kill anything bar the scorch beast queen in one clip.
---
Fallout 4 has a creation called **Sentinel Armor**, a second companion which is an empty, automated suit of power armor. 
---
Aside the benefits of not voiding lone wanderer (and letting you benefit from companion-worn targeting HUD helmet), it has one more piece of magic. You could choose what personality to give him, from protection, Mr Gutsy, possibly sentinel / assaultron, and even liberty prime. 
---
I had mine set to Mr Gutsy. Having someone on your team, spewing out enthusiastic. Relentless over-the-top US army drill sergeant rhetoric, particularly entering combat, and on high rotation just never got old. Good for team morale :) 
---
Huh. Looks like people still aren't ready for criticism...
---
im looking to slim down on weight and both of these guns are super heavy. i have standard versions of each. and im looking for something that would let me help out with those scrochbeasts. im only lvl 44. the lever action is the coolest of the 3 however. im getting rid of my hunting rifles in favor the lever action at least.  i might even get rid of the .44 revolvers. the way you make it sound, they both have their ups and downs.
---
Yeeeeaaahhh. Bethesda said all along that it could be played solo. I've put in 120 hours solo. The game follows the same formula as the single player games, and if anything the multiplayer elements feel tacked on.
---
I go back to the overseer's camp and put weapons/ammo/plans I don't need in her box there. Always tends to be lower level players around there.
---
Combat rifle that’s why.
---
Do you have the tank killer perk, armour penetration is key
---
I haven't been impressed with the combat rifle in 76, it's okay for trash mobs and mid-level Scorched but lacks the punch needed for bigger game. I prefer the Lever Action rifle by far, gets the job done much faster.
---
What about the clean flag behind him?
---
Because I didn't have the armor yet maybe?!
---
If I see a mod for sale on an RNG vendor you can't find in the world (cause why wouldn't have you it obtainable only one way at one vendor, shared between 24 others on a server, plus anyone dropping in an and out to "farm" the same thing) I am going to **FUCKING** buy it.
---
I love the cat lady house, but all of those eyes...
---
Oh, nice. So .50, hasty, refined, hardened, and critical are all there?
---
Same problem here.  I did use the weapons workbench to add the swinger analyzer to the sword but still no luck.  The fabricator says items found then says not found.  Strange.  Do i have to go around killing monsters with the sword before doing the fabricator?  
---
Cool 👍
---
Honestly I just started crashing to desktop after the latest patch.. noticed it only happens in nuke zones. Not sure what causing it but it wasn't happening before..
---
And this is the game where everyday someone posts something about how good the community is!
---
Wow! That’s pretty cool. I have a wood box with a door.
---
I don't think you realise how rare even just a nat two-shot weapon is to get in your required flavour in regards to build, and regardless of that 10 mins of continuous fire is a shed load of ammo. I'm not sure what point you're trying to make.
---
Your post is some real gatekeeping shit man.
---
Put your trash in the trash cans, litterbugs.
---
I advocate for hunting, however common sense needs to be applied if people are at their house actively building leave them alone. I mean there is normally a large stutter when you near someone actively duping or if their carry weight is over 15k (noticed anything over 100k the entire server is lagging over 1 million you get total instability)   
---
Yes it is wrong to assume everyone is duping that is teamed with a lower player, and the ignorant ones "hunters" are ruining the sport.   
---
Also if you are hunting you should be waiting until you catch them in the act that is when the true fun begins to get the loot. Don't just go waste peoples time including your own.  Long time on weapons bench bag dropped to ground back to bench back to bag bag goes away then moves to a world stash container. Once at container wait 30-45 seconds then rush it .   
---
Quit hunting people that are not actively doing shit wrong. 
---
I just did a limited test, and it seems they do stack multiplicatively, so you get -75% repair costs, with a minimum of 1 of each resource per broken item. I'm not certain about that last bit, but 2 broken wooden fences required 2 wood each to repair, then that got halved to 1 each for at total of 2, and then when it got halved again it's still 1 each, 2 total. Whereas 8 aluminum got reduced to 2 (I think that's a combination of my fusion generator and decontamination arch).
---
Initial repair costs:
---
* Steel: 7
---
* Copper: 9
---
* Gear: 5
---
* Wood: 4
---
* Aluminum: 8
---
* Nuclear Material: 3
---
* All Flux: 1
---
With Rank 2 Contractor:
---
* Steel: 3
---
* Copper: 4
---
* Gear: 2
---
* Wood: 2
---
* Aluminum: 4
---
* Nuclear Material: 1
---
With perk and Backwoodsman 9:
---
* Copper: 3
---
* Gear: 1
---
* Aluminum: 2
---
&gt; can't get decent sell prices now.
---
You mean during the incidental sales that might happen when two players meet up ? 
---
I don't like dupping and I agree with banning them. But to just spout bullshit about it ruining the 'in game economy' is stupid. There is no in game economy in fo76. If you are able to sell an item to another player for 1 more cap than you get from a vendor, you should consider yourself lucky. 
---
I think I've been punched by one once but mostly they just smoke grenade and die :/
---
Get rid of two-shot and explosive together and I may as well bin my LMG.
---
IIIIIT’S... GRAFTON DAY!!! 
---
I was talking about deep pockets, hardened is gotten through scrapping.  I have gotten deep pockets from Harpers twice for two different characters using marine armor, hardened twice by scrapping mods.  Easiest way I have found to farm marine armor is to get a friend and duo/trio/quad farm the behemoth south of Solomon's pond.  He drops 2-3 pieces of armor every kill and if your friends are willing to kick over all the marine pieces you can get fully modded out in an evening spent drinking, talking trash to each other, and having some random grindy fun.
---
There's no end game anymore. Pvp is pretty much the only thing to do, griefing included. It beats farming legendaries for 5 hours and getting crap. Until next week it's likely gonna be like this. Join a raider clan
---
Can I get the science scribe? Also which is the boomer jacket?
---
It is sad that all the gear is essentially garbage.
---
I'm camped at the north west corner of the map, along the river. There's a couple junk pits.

I have this mod installed on my both hands and its doesnt work. My heavy attacks still consume ~20% of my AP bar.

I’ve bought about 4 things and I’m still on over 2000 atoms.

Just be a bit more frugal with them.
---
There's nothing meta about about an X01 jetpack. :P
---
The bird bones skywalking was nerfed so it's pointless. Emergency protocols on a bloodied build would be meta. ;)
---
There are only two mods so the RNG on it sucks.  I did 30-40 for my first mod and then got the second mod after doing two more.  The less mods available to learn the harder it is to get them sadly.  Scrapping chainsaws for mods I had to break down over 90 of the damn things for all three mods.
---
Agreed, the biggest problem right now is there's a bottleneck in obtaining the high tier items (this in turn have people server hopping because it is the most efficient way to obtain rares, this further exacerbates the black market for RMT (granted it is not just the sellers, but the buyers who are willing to purchase the items) and increases duping. Having more avenue to obtain end tier weapons will curtail some of these practices. However, it may give rise to another of more stash spaces.
---
Ding ding
---
Oh now you attack my English level. Typical. 
---
You can still choose to be ignorant to most of the posts here thinks that is griefing. That’s your choice. 
---
I didn’t say PvP is griefing. I just said their behavior is griefing and most of the posts here kinda agree that. 
---
I acknowledge this is a PvP game but as I said before like real life you can like the life but still not have to like everything about it. The world is not black and white and you have to either like everything or quit. You probably not at this level of understanding yet. 
---
Anyhow, griefing is not PvP, you can follow other people world to world to grief or verbally abuse someone to grief or you can level lower level character’s camp and falsely accuse them being duper. 
---
In my definition, PvP is player versus another player and not player versus a building materials. 
---
And before you also falsely accuse me not for pvp, you are wrong also. I played Ultima Online, Eve Online where pvp constantly happened and I enjoyed it. But I don’t like player griefing others. That’s different story. And if you want to justify your griefing behavior by giving yourself excuses this is pvp so it’s fine and not to take the moral hit, as I said it’s your choice too. 
---
Another satisfied customer! Keep fighting the good fight!
---
Eh, I didn't mean _you are a duper if you this gear_, but it's kind of an obvious side effect of the market and the market is duped guns.
---
You wouldn’t want your kid eating non-purified glue, now would you? 
---
&gt; And am I just imagining that I got lvl45+ items before  
---
Think it was the december 11th patch that screwed it for people. 
---
Well that's just plain wrong, guy. I used to get "name your price" offers for my explosive shotgun. Now, I'd be lucky to get 200 caps, because everyone has tse weapons from dupers.
---
I’ve got a basic lever action in my stash, might have to bust it out again.
---
I was impressed with its performance but I found a two shot western revolver that put it into retirement. 
---
This sounds like an awesome idea! I have seen deep pocketed torso at harpers but never deep pocketed limbs. I had to get mine from a treasure map.
---
Will try the behemoth thing shortly though! Thanks!
---
Haha awww this is so cute!  And I've been there! The repair costs can really give you a heart attack sometimes. 
---
Goblin you and your wife are awesome! I hope we can all play together sometime!!

For a control, if you have an alt without speed demon, repeat with that as well.

The game has frozen 3 times in 15min each time while in my inventory. My 4th restart took a long time to get started, but I was booted from the server the second it came up. I'm super frustrated. I feel like it freezes without fail when I'm in my inventory, at a claimed workshop, and while in battle. I enjoy the game a lot, but it's really discouraging that I can't get anything done.
---
I never knew what those were, but found them in Watoga last night.  Lovely bunch of tables.  Love the cloth chairs too.  The visuals and matching names have been so helpful.
---
Thanks for the tip. I have the card but I don’t have it equipped. 
---
Trolls want tears.  Give them none and they starve.  This used to be common knowledge.

If you are under the spray it’s effects will tick every few seconds. So you can step in and out of the edge of the spray after it ticks. But wait a few seconds to be sure what was removed because there can be a delay in notification.

I wouldn't personally use a combat rifle for sniping. The fire rate would be wasted because it takes me too long to line up the headshots.
---
Fire at a Mothman from range...
---
No worries mate, glad I could help :-)  PS:  Nuke him first.  More exp per kill on the level 95 glowing behemoth and he seems to have a higher chance of spawning as a legendary when you are doing the forced respawn trick on him with a group.
---
PS4 sorry
---
&gt;Probably incels
---
Bingo. The righteous fury they pour into demonizing people who have something they do not just smacks of incel. 
---
I think you’re missing the point that this game has a lot of balance issues: some are tied to one another and others are separate. The LMG is a fast firing peashooter that needs to do some more damage. It’s ammo ought to be easier to craft as well. But that’s an issue entirely separate of TSE. That gun is only viable with TSE because it’s a bad gun at its core. If it were buffed then it would be super OP like everything else when it has TSE on it.
---
Oh ill buy both please, just sent a request im birdjp19
---
Ugh soz totally forgot it was in your post. Tyvm 
---
Thanks for the update man, hopefully it's fixed soon.
---
I built it, think I may have gotten the plan from the queen. Ultracite energy weapons do drop as legendaries but are very rare. The only one I know I’ve had was a laser pistol. I can’t confirm any others but maybe someone else can?
---
I think I answered this question for overlord above before I got down to yours mate, hope that answer up their clears it all up for you, if not feel free to let me know and I will try to be more detailed, happy hunting and stay safe in the wastes!
---
ESO doesn't have that tho. Unless you duel someone or go into the one main pvp section you aren't going to get ganked by higher levels. And even then it scales really well so you can hold your own and win against them if your decent. And houses getting attacked isn't a thing. I'm just mentioning it cause it really is a good game, and I'd hate to see someone not try it because they thought they'd get destroyed by higher levels or something. 
---
I run a three-star explosive Gatling. Has +100 move speed when I have the gun out and double damage on full health targets. Modded with drum mag, long barrel, and bayonet. I was running a shotgun build until this dropped at around level 50 or so. Demolition Expert 5 is always on and I usually do a point each in the gunner perks. Also have three maxed out gunner perks for SBQ fights.
---
I mostly use it to farm since it only takes 1-5 shots to kill anything. Gunsmith at rank 4 also minimizes weapon degradation along with Luck of the Draw. I don't have to repair often. I use other regular weapons most of the time to keep it interesting. But for mindless farming, you can't beat it. I also have a two-shot Gatling but the accuracy seems way off; too much for my liking. But it's nice to have in CQC without having to worry about blowing myself up.
---
What is this forced respawn trick you speak of?
---
Are you kidding? Consoles are always the most unplayable because of the feamerate. Pc runs great and they fixed a lot with the last patch. We already have the path you will receive tomorow.
---
Lot of reasons. First you need to use VATS and specifically criticals, secondly you need to increase critical damage through perks and mutations, thirdly you have to go glass cannon and use Unyelding Gear with adrenal reaction mutation, lastly you need to buy a TSE lever action. Enjoy sniping
---
False. Duping ***is*** against the rules. Bethesda has already banned some players for it and has publicly warned that this is the very definition of the term "exploit," and they clearly ban exploits in the ToS. Also, it's clearly cheating.
---
Whereas PvP is not. Stop making false equivalencies simply because you do not like the PvP system that they have implemented.
---
Android 13 would love it
---
Talking safe as in hacker wise.
---
I have the XB1X and honestly have not had a single framerate problem since release. 
---
600 fps looks great but all you really need is 60 lol
---
Yeah, anything that uses AP will drain cores faster. 
---
Hit up r/fo76bazaar
---
Just so you know the radium rifle heals ghouls.
---
But wtf happened to Bruce? 
---
I like Ultra Light because it increases the condition bar more than the others, the AP bonus compliments my VATS/critical build, and AFAIK the lighter your armor weight the easier it is to sneak/remain hidden (I am assuming this carries over from previous games but not sure).
---
As long as you are not doing anything that will take away from another players experience, everything should be good .  At the end of the day I would see Bethesda judging players for turning their mountains of bugs into positives as absolutely mind boggling. 
---
T hat makes absolute
---
Bloody mess perk will give 15 more percent when maxed (luck)
---
Next time just leave the server. Then they can’t get off to the satisfaction of leveling your build.
---
Get a friend to party with you, nuke the spot you want to farm, kill everything, leave the spawn area (for the behemoth it's halfway up the dirt road back towards solomons pond), one person in the party quits to main menu and then rejoins someone in the server holding it via social menu, reinvite to party, run back down to the spawn location, and tada!  Easy pickings!
---
Fucking grow up. 
---
78 is 60% of 130. So you must be getting 60% damage from somewhere, maybe perks or items or something.
---
I seem to have a problem with bouncing plasma grenades off assaultrons right back into my face
---
&gt;I'm a woman
---
Lol, I feel this so much when I'm playing this game. Hi, I am actually female! Not a dude with a female character!
---
If it's queen I rollout the TSE Minigun, for a leisurely stroll through the Whitesprings I gently caress my communist Tesla so everyone gets to eat lol.
---
Something suicide bomb based. Like a scorched that blows up in rads and disease 
---
Lvl 72
---
And so poorly only one vendor will sell a set of mods, with no other way to get them in game, then add stocking them with RNG, shared with 24 others plus everyone server hopping through
---
I know it's an issue. I just hate that there's almost a witch hunt mentality in this sub. People are being attacked if they linger too long in teams at camp. My team and I take a while to trade things off at camps after big fights and I dont need to be briefed because someone thinks they're playing vigilante hero against dupers. 
---
Having an explosive weapon and mutations doesnt make you a duper either. Just wish people would be more careful when accusing people. Unless you go to trade and see tons of dupes in an inventory, or find a box with duped items then people could be legitimately playing the game. 
---
There needs to be an in game report option, not vigilante justice. 
---
 But then you have to play on a console, and I would not wish that on my worst enemy. ;)
---
"occasionally drink heavily" lol
---
Well you will be spawned at nearest travel point, when you log in. Not exactly where you are.
---
EVE Online is designed around allowing people to be assholes. this doesn't mean people being assholes in the game are not assholes.
---
i'm not saying they are playing incorrectly, but quite obviously you are missing the grand point because you gloss over it time and time again. i don't think anyone really cares whether the game mechanics or not allow it, and people are going to complain regardless, so whatever.
---
i just wanted to point out that he did have a point and you saying "resort to petty insults immediately." is completely off base.
---
Maybe they fixed it with the newest patch on PC. I dont really know because im on PS4.

Although Olivia excelled at the training, she became frustrated with her mother's end-of-the-world coping strategy pretty much across the board (as her daughter, as her subordinate in the Order, and so forth) and sought out the Raiders to systematically dismantle the Order, ending with a one-on-one mother-daughter duel at their favorite Pre-War camping site. Although Olivia's youth proved to be the winning edge in the fight, she was betrayed by the very Raiders she had been using, and died with her mother in her arms.!&lt;
---
The whole thing is spelled out in the terminals, notes, and holotapes throughout the Order of Mysteries questline (though you might not see every note the first time through if it's been picked up by someone else)
---
DEATH IS A PREFERABLE ALTERNATIVE TO COMMUNISM
---
Sometimes the endurance bobble head is at the end so you are intended to be able to get there. It sure is frustrating though 
---
I doubt the game can run 60 fps on console. Even PC strugles at 45 fps in Watoga.
---
You got a refund?  Do you play on PC or console?  How difficult was the refund process?
---
You mean the Scan &amp; Repair option? Yes.
---
I am often not sure exactly where I am, but I am talking about spawning in areas I have never visited.....it's weirding me out.
---
All of the train station registers are connected?
---
I see this sometimes on mine, I think it's just based on how the game decides which poi you are closest to when you quit/crashed last.  On laggy servers or when I crash it's sometimes a few POIs behind where I was or even POIs that were in the general area but farthest away from the others.
---
Oh fair enough, I always just looked at the silo with an eye on the end goal. More time wasted there, less time to kill ghouls (before the nerf!) 
---
And I do hope that's not a TSE and we're done kind of date...
---
Just saying  
---
That would make this game almost heaven
---
Ahh ok yea there wasn’t a bobblehead. Hell yea it’s frustrating lol I was getting so mad that I couldn’t save scum it haha
---
Perks
---
They're in the effects tab on the Pip-Boy.
---
Sensational inSightful Scientific reSearch Sir!
---
eh hem... repair costs cannot drop below 1 of any single material.  I think I remember the patch notes for recent update stating that cost reduction perks will now require 2 of any single material but that may only pertain to armor since that was the subject mater.  
---
They are not as far as I know.  But I also haven't tested this. 
---
What system? I may be able to offer protection to you and her. 
---
Upvoted for the title alone.
---
FISTO isn't a companion, he's a life partner. 
---
The latest patch fixes the lever-action reload glitch, so it's a good time to get back into the cowboy rifle lifestyle. With a hardened receiver and stealth bonuses you'll mow through the mobs. 
---
So dupers are this games version of synths? 
---
This is great! How do generate water?

Not as great how do generate water as yo momma!

I have a bunch of "wishful thinking" or "will eventually get to it" stuff down there on the bottom. I'm slowly getting there. I'm level 119 with about 350 hours played on this character. But lots of them on the bottom are "maybe I'll try this at some point" cards.
---

Pretty fucked up I have to serendipitously check that stats tab and have to notice it to ever know these items have any use beyond cosmetics.
---
Oh man, I wanted to role play as a bad cop. I recently got a junkie's baton with swing speed. 
---
I plan on going around the Wasteland handing out arrest warrants and when I see their inventory Confiscate the chems. 
---
Then after walking around a corner start taking all of them. 
---
I got a "suppressors" combat rifle and set it up with a severe receiver and armor piercing/higher capacity magazine and one of the better long barrels (true barrel maybe?) and furious stock and compensator. The thing is fantastic for VATS. Better than any other gun I've found yet, including the handmade, lever, and radium (and any of the heavy guns). With a full vats critical build it takes down level 68 charred in one burst. Not even the Ghoul Slayer automatic handmade I have does that.
---
Thank you. I hadn't thought of that. 
---
they've fixed duping, still no new dupe has been found on PC, so console dupers are going crazy before patch hits.
---
Wait mob justice doesnt work? Color me suprised
---
Levels like the ghouls? They were all 50+.
---
Gun Fu works with melee, so I've been running Gun Fu, Ninja, Escape Artist, Grim Reaper's Sprint, and 75% Sneak perk.

You can dash between targets that way.

Crafting: Lowered chance of Power Generators of spawning fusion cores - what is that exactly about?
---
That is amazing, thank you for sharing! And figuring all this out omg
---
how far are we talking? Are you logging out in flatwoods and spawning in at whitesprings or something? in that case you should change your password and stuff to be sure.
---
If you are logging out in a town or something and spawning outside of it, that is normal. I think it places you so you dont get attack by enemies as you log in. (or so people dont see you in your undies before it loads in your stuff)
---
Why are Mules even a problem?
---
Your English is perfectly fine! 
---
No, how many levels did you get?
---
I finished the quest line before that pose was added but *good grief* I need to find them again so I can snap this photo too.

    It has just given trolls a way to vindicate being douchebags, and then receive praise from the community for it.  They know destroying your camp was just being a crappy human but will do it just to do it.  
---
    I know people like that, don't understand it, but it's similar to arbitrary trash talk when someone out plays them in games.  Somehow the guy who killed them 4 times is a "garbage player" or "coward" even when the object of whatever game is kill count. 
---
   Don't let it sour you on playing with people you otherwise enjoy playing with or you will miss out on meeting the much larger share of the awesome community.
---
I just logged in to check my rifle stash which no sane person should have all of these modded rifles because its too damn heavy.
---
All of them are set up to my liking, so you could add or subtract a few pounds, or if you have no mods at all you could significantly reduce each weight.
---
Laser Rifle - 5.7 lbs
---
Black Powder Rifle - 6 lbs
---
Crossbow - 7.2 lbs
---
The Dragon - 7.8 lbs
---
Tesla Rifle - 10 lbs
---
Handmade Rifle - 13.6 lbs
---
Lever-Action Rifle - 13.8 lbs
---
Hunting Rifle - 15.15 lbs
---
Combat Rifle - 15.40 lbs
---
Assault Rifle - 20.8 lbs
---
Energy weapons and their ammo are shockingly light. But if they are still bugged so, energy weapons also do not benefit from any source of armor piercing, so their effectiveness falls off harshly for higher leveled enemies. I would think plasma would fare better due to its split ballistic/energy damage.
---
Todd sent them to be NPCs in skyrim forever

Pointing out that you have a poor grasp on the English language isn't attacking you.
---
There are only a few posts saying that this is griefing.
---
You say PvP is griefing later in this post.
---
If you don't like something in life, such as PvP games, you can choose to not participate in those things. If you do choose to participate, then don't expect everybody else to accommodate you.
---
PvP is PvP, not griefing.
---
This is where you try to say PvP is griefing.
---
PvP isn't griefing. If you had played EvE or UO and enjoyed them, you'd know that.
---
Try Sugar Bombs too. Recipe is in the Whitesprings. Sugar Bombs x3 (irradiated), Glowing Fungus, and Mothman Eggs I believe. Essentially an improved Sunshine Oil. Best part? It's food without ever spoiling. Throw in Herbivore for bonus plant food effects, shit's essentially a super snack. 
---
I'm not exactly "farming" for anything anymore. I've got neat stuff, just kinda waiting for better drops. Gives me something to focus on crafting over time that actually feels like I'm getting a decent consumable from it. Pretty sure I get more excited to see the irradiated Sugar Bomb model than a legendary at this point.
---
The assumption is that they all would / should come here saying they were banned or something?
---
Not an asshole per se...but I really would recommend moving it. I would have been immensely disappointed had I gone there only to see someone with a camp sitting in this otherwise deserted, tragic spot. Its sort of a mood killer, to be sure. 
---
I wanted to honestly. Super pretty location
---
Holy Moly! Thanks for taking the time. I appreciate this. I'm gonna refer back to this reply often. I try to contribute but I had a level 37 supermutant chasing me. I had to run. A level 14 at the time with a .44 wasn't cutting it.
---
Not risking being banned 😞
---
Programmers aren't artists &amp; vice versa. Doing one does not obstruct the other.
---
Buttressed is the strongest material mod for marine armor. Not sure what's second. They're all scrap unlocks, but hardened mods (not plans) seem to show up frequently.
---
You want Dense for the torso. Gives very strong protection against scorchbeasts and exploding cars. It's a vendor/found plan, but apparently the plan is misnamed in vendors, claims to be combat armor. Dense mods also show up, which are at least properly named.
---
Raider vendorbots sell the plans occasionally, try the two near Top of the World.
---
I'm half and half on how I feel about it. Part of me is tired of hearing about every little issue there is an excuse to report on, the other half is glad people are holding Bethesda to account for the mistakes they've made and continue to make with FO76.
---
Except Bethesda isn't known for buffing weapons, just gotta go look at FO4's minigun for proof of that.
---
If the ghouls go the the far right (if you're facing the tennis court) edge they can get up there but only one at a time. 
---
I don't know about a witch hunt, at least not any worse than it was before. I get the same number of people wandering through my camp as I have since I placed it.
---
Mutations do not mean you are a duper. You're absolutely correct. And as someone who has been accused of being a duper for having more than one Speed Demon serum I crafted from a queen drop in inventory and being over level 100..... I get it.
---
The point was that it isn't "natural" to see everyone with a jetpack, Marsupial, TSE handmade, and birdbones. Surely there are more viable options than the cookie cutter kit - a cookie cutter kit where birdbones doesn't even work like it used to. In fact, there absolutely are: emergency protocols, bloodied, etc for one, and stack Adrenaline, maybe use a bloodied .50........
---
Building to skywalk is "so last season" and seems artificially what everyone is wearing on consoles.
---
Anyone grabbed this yet?
---
Agreed.
---
Doesnt help that my male character is not running about in a dress, no matter what the bonus. Its just too ridiculous to contemplate.
---
So far this quest and the enclave storyline have been my favorite. 
---
~~Great retort mate~~
---
No it wasn't. Back in your little bubble please. I'll be blocking you henceforth as you are clearly a little bit brain dead and no useful or well constructed comments will ever spew forth from your noise hole.
---
No, they did t, still does fuck all...like explosive vents, expensive nothingness.  
---
In people's fantasies
---
I don't think that's accurate, when I go into my stash they say 2.5 lb and if it's because im in the stash (which is at Max capacity) it would go over the max if they suddenly became 10 lb
---
[This might help](https://imgur.com/a/3ZhkLJl?fbclid=IwAR1pJH-RZmoyyHg0haE6J_AD8D_i5nuGnh7x4Krgmculvf_cXzM2JNdeUfc)
---
Doing the work bethesda should be doing.
---
So to clarify, as this just happened to me, its just dropping the actual Technical Data item? And not a random item from my inventory?
---
- big enemies like scorch beast queen, scorch beast, mirelurk queen,fog crawler, or behemoth.  (Stealth is essentially for more than one shot against some of these).
---
- opening shot against grouped enemies
---
- weapon of last resort when swamped (suicide unless you have dense mod and level 3 fire proof).
---
And when I take them out u definitely don't get 40 lb back (bc I keep one in my inventory)
---
What kind of resource deposit?
---
lol k
---
I was super excited to use it, until I actually used it..
---
Goodbye sweet .308
---
Does the gun have legendary effects that might change the damage depending on some condition? Do you have perks that change damage, like Bloody Mess, Rifleman, etc. Do you have mutations that might change damage? Did you take chems something that might change the damage? Have you tried unequipping the weapon and reequipping it?
---
Most games like this have a way to opt out of pvp if that’s not how you want to play the game. There are ways around everything else pvp related, except this. It’s not the way a large percentage of us want to play the game, so I guess I can blame the creators for it. I just don’t understand why in the hell anyone would enjoy tearing down other players’ hard work. What’s in it for you, besides being an asshole? 
---
dense mod you can find at watoga all the tme
---
Stay away from the cars! (or blow them up yourself if no one else is near them) Most of my deaths are from auto explosions.
---
Really cool!
---
neat
---
Robots hostile me all the time, I always think I’ll kill them fast enough to cut through their area and always wind up running away and jumping over the fence and down the cliff
---
What if I told you... it's not the dupers but instead it is shitty servers.
---
Honestly? Literally hacks. Runtime modifier called Cheat engine (or they might have another tool, but I’m pretty sure cheat engine is the most well known one). That’s why Bethesda’s been handing out actual bans for this stuff. No bans for people running stuff like the perk card and chat mods. 
---
It couldn't be that hard to add a separate lock feature for items in inventory. Lock it, and it needs to be unlocked before you can drop it, scrap it, sell it, etc. That would fix quite a few issues(I'm looking at you scrapping mods for steel.....). 
---
I have a Dense Torso Mod, but unfortunately 'Hardened' is the best I can craft currently.
---
1) equip weight perk
---
2) put 600 pounds of junk into stash
---
3) take off weight perk
---
4) now have way more than 600 pounds of junk in stash
---
Ignorance is bliss
---
You don't have to believe someone for it to be a fact. Just take a look at the Flat-Earthers.
---
You’re right there. This is also Bethesda’s first online game of this kind where revisiting weapon stats is more necessary.
---
Found one.
---
All I could think of reading this was that intro to fallout 2 where the vault opens to the Enclave soldiers. 
---
It's not a foolproof identification of being a duper, many legit players have mule toons as well. But nearly all dupers use one or multiple mules, imagine duping hundreds or thousands of items, there's no way you could  keep it all on your main character.
---
Also, the current and past duping glitches involved using a friend to be able to get back on the same server. Many times these dupers would go to an out of the way place in pairs, the one duping would be on a low level mule and the friend would usually be a higher level. In this case, the legit players were mistaken for a duping team by a group trying to harass and annoy suspected dupers.
---
K that won’t do anything 
---
I hotswap out those perks and I don't want to have to swap everything out just to _use_ my stash.
---
I'll answer this hot take with that every time it appears because it's an awful idea.
---
It kinda sucks. Fallout 76 is already just a copy paste of Fallout 4 with better textures and they still fucked up some things from the previous game. 
---
Most duper’s have two arms and two legs too. So? 
---
I will echo all of your remarks here - I used the combat rifle while I was in the 25 range, because you can find a scrap a bunch of them, and they're useful for mobs around that range. It uses 45s by default, vs. the hunting rifle that was my main, which used 308s, so it helped me to conserve some ammo. 
---
But as you unlock mods and progress in the game, the lever action rifle definitely works a bit better than the combat or hunting rifle. With the LAR, it is somewhat easy to throw out five shots from VATS, and then duck into cover while you reload. It also helps that I got a nice 3-star Legendary at level 45 - 20 percent damage to super mutants, 250 to damage resistance while reloading, and 20 percent faster reloading.
---
Not banned yet, just an FYI
---
Nope just assholes for playing the game and using a game mechanic. /s
---
Again? Didn't I just do this? ;)
---
Stairs aren't and neither are floors. That's why I use them as a roof. 
---
&gt;i'm not saying they are playing incorrectly
---
You might not be but many others are.  And no he didn't have a point.  Thats what the game is, thats how its designed.  Literally screaming obscenities at everyone who wants to play the game how they see fit is wrong and there is no point to be made.  
---
We are pretty used by now
---
Instant Kharma!
---
Please quote the line that I said pvp is griefing. 
---
As I said pvp and griefing is different thing, I agree to that. That’s why their behavior is not pvp but griefing. 
---
Judging by the upvote and downvote of your post, I would say yes most of the posts and people agree that their behavior is griefing to lots of people eyes. But you can still turn blinded eyes on that. 
---
And to some degree what you said is right you can opt out on certain things but not always. Still I like the game but do not like the griefing part of it which is not pvp. And I do not need others to accommodate that. I simply point out that is griefing and others look down upon that kind of behavior. 
---
You kept trying to defending their behavior as pvp though. And people downvote you. Still not waking you up that’s not pvp but griefing?
---
And why are people hunting for those? Its totally fair? The stash system is flawed and they found a way arround
---
It says whatever it will weigh for you. Go ahead and try taking them out, it will reduce the weight in there by 10
---
I feel like it's just those really high level players looking for any excuse to level places. I've had 140 level players destroy my base while I was standing there in the midst of building stuff. Friends have had their bases destroyed by high level players too. Basically I just avoid anyone at a higher level than me at this point and have moved my camp to places that are less popular/accessible.
---
This camp is awesome! How did you manage to build under ground??
---
At least three and I was like 150ish then. I can't remember the xp they were giving 
---
Ditto. I usually play with my husband and we’re both similar levels, but recently I let me son create a character and his camp has been getting attacked. 
---
I thought it was due to the high traffic location but now I’m thinking it’s because people assume a lvl 60 and a lvl 10 = duping. 
---
Meh I've been running about 7 mods now since November, no issue, most are for quality of life. 
---
This isn't /r/elitedangerous
---
Also do you have any camp plans?
---
Stupid, stupid never changes
---
That's why it needs to be passively applied.
---
&gt; I think move speed is just capped.
---
 Now that might explain it!
---
Passively - meaning you don't have to swap them out every time.
---
just turn voice chat off if you are claiming bounties heh, this community is way too short on manners :P
---
 The problem with consoles is the controls. I have friends who have played on consoles a lot and are good on them. 
---
Compared to me they are crippled. I have trouble watching them play as I have to keep quiet as they stumble about the place.
---
 Now some guy did do Doom on Ultra Nightmare, on a PS4 so I have nothing but admiration for that guy. I can play it on Nightmare but its taxing. UV is perfect.
---
&gt;definitely duper’s or at the very least bought that mini gun off eBay.
---
I've been farming legendaries for ages and this is just discouraging. Even if I do find a two-shot explosive or some other 'top tier' weapon, after hundreds of legendary kills, people will think I just bought it or got a dupe from someone.
---
Kind of kills my motivation to even play at this point since that's the only real goal I have left at the moment.
---
Thanks for the tip. I'm getting close to end game now and have been dreading the launch because of the feedback. You've made it sound more manageable 
---
Shhh!  ;)
---
I'm carrying around over 1000 lbs. If I get into a fight with a Scorchbeast I have to change all my cards around and them I'm in walk mode. I use a low health build also, so if some of my cards are missing when a horde attacks me I don't have a chance to change cards. I don't know what is weighing so much. I have no idea. I have to go through everything with a calculator if I want to figure it out. I know I have a lot of everything. And I don't like to just throw stuff away because maybe it will be useful. Maybe I will throw something away and then a few days later I need it because suddenly Scorchbeasts are animals and nobody knew and that hunting prefix is great for Scorchbeasts or Scorched prefix is good against them or whatever. Or maybe I want to try a whole suit of Troubleshooter armor but the game punishes me for even considering it.
---
Cool thanks!
---
Thank you for the visit😊
---
Same with power armor chassis. Finally found maxed raider power armor and just finished modding it, put on 2x calibrated shocks, 2x optimized bracers, targeting hud, and a shock torso mod. Accidentally dropped the chassis from my inventory and the game crashed not a second later. Pretty disappointing.... 
---
They do have a few log cabin buildings and forts in the game, I wonder how much more it would take just to use those graphics for buildable items.
---
But there a few bases which have to be blown up! 
---
Charleston station where the rnd vendor spawns and whitespring golf club of course...
---
My TSE comes out when scorchbeasts do. Other than that I do 98% of content w a regular hardened rifle. I like that when there is content for groups I can still play solo.
---
I agree with you having also thought about ways to improve it.  For me it's either increase for everybody or increase with levels.
---
Eh. Every time I launch a nuke at fissure prime I swear 100+ levels crawl out of the wood work
---
Buddy you’re acting like griefing isn’t a thing.  “No that’s pvp, nah that’s just pvp”.  Yeah technicially it is a player vs player situation, but the issue is deeper than that.  Either you can’t comprehend the situational difference or you’re just being obtuse.
---
All griefing is pvp, but not all pvp is griefing.
---
Great idea. Why didn’t I think of that?
---
True.
---
Who are you?🤔
---
I feel like the enclave storyline hasn't finished yet. Not to mention MODUS seems very "Eagle Eye" to me...
---
Just accepted it. Come on by the shop
---
He can make ultracite ammo if you want some +caps
---
You drop his dupped goods and move on. There was no reason to post about it other than to give yourself likes. 
---
My solution is to move Two Shot and Explosive in the same category by swapping Explosive with something else
---
It's still a pass. You want a permanent weight reduction just for unlocking the perk itself? That's just a stash increase and the end result being even more nonsensical weights.
---
This is pretty much PVP in any game sadly, too many people get upset over it instead of having fun with it.  I loved Rust for this reason, some of the absolute angriest people in the world playing that game lol.
---
Wait, so you should'nt be doing a Nuke Silo by yourself? 
---
I launched my first nuke at Level 43. It took a hour and 5 minutes, some stimpaks, and a lot of shotgun shells since all I had was a Level 35 TS douboe-barreled shotgun, a Level 40 All Rise , some grenades and Daisycutter.
---
I hated the Sentry Bot. And I loved that I could make the Robobrains and Turrets obsolete by hacking the consoles and shutting them down
---
My understanding is that the last official word from Bethesda is that modding is fine, but they're not responsible for stability issues caused by it.
---
I saw that video from late last month, but has there been an official change in position from Bethesda?
---
Is the miner gauntlet or the death tambo a fist weapon?
---
I am talking logging out in Watoga and logging in at the rebel-museum up north. It’s not consistently happening but it’s really noticeable when it does. Am mystified tbh.
---
I know you posted this comment a month ago but good doggy and slow metabolizer is actually insane. I got slow metabolizer rank 2 and stacked with good doggy gives me a whopping 45% of my food bar!

Yes. Just tell me what your looking for and I'll if I got it
---
I can craft any serum if you are interested 
---
I think console runs on 30 normally. Truth is, if you don’t play a lot on games that run 60, 30 is fine and it never drops so you always see the same fps regardless where you are on the map.
---
Additionally, if you have a 120hz refresh rate on your tv, 30 is comparable to 60 believe it or not. I personally cannot tell the difference.
---
Good to know! 
---
I think wrecking ball and contractor were designed around attacking and defending workshops honestly. They haven't said nor done anything to prevent someone from using the former to level a camp, so it is what it is. 
---
Nope. And radiation arches cost 1 flux each to repair even using the camp thing. 
---
Exactly. He's activating his Persona. 
---
This happened to me and my boyfriend yesterday (I'm level 32 and boyfriend is somewhere in the high 20s). We were just trying to get the exavator armor and some level 144 or something close to that starts trying to kill us. We ran away, fast traveled to my camp nearby, and a few minutes layer he came over to my camp. We then logged out. A few minutes later he sent me a ps4 friend request saying he had a video of us duping and was going to post it online. We obviously weren't, so good luck to him trying to prove we were duping. I was so confused because we weren't even doing anything that I think would even look close to duping ( I don't even know how to dupe and would never try it if I knew how)
---
Yeah if you head inside the turrets inside will light you up. 
---
This is crazy helpful. Here's a 24 of Nuka-Cola. 
---
Though find this “need” to destroy said CAMPS dubious to begin with, that is not the subject matter at hand.  Furthermore anyone with enough game to knowledge know the significance of these sites has likely had access to this facts already.
---
This happens whenever you enter and exit worlds alot.
---
He is just Salty cuz you took his caps. It's his fault for getting such a high bounty
---
Adding to the Herbivore suggestion. Meat is plentiful, yes. But if you're not doing a typical play session involving clearing mobs, maybe you're CAMP building and vendor selling for your hour of play for the night. Yeah, kinda SOL. Gotta go running around killing stuff and cooking to get your hunger back on track.
---
Herbivore makes all of the ambient flora great. Green thumb for 2, pick through a small patch whether your own or ambient, shove it all in your face with no rads or disease. Even uncooked they give quite a bit of hunger replenishment in a pinch. Like the guy said down below, razorgrain soup, corn soup, and carrot soup are all clutch when you're prepping for a play session.
---
When I didn't have either Herbivore or Carnivore, I honestly did most of my food management with plants. Meats were used, but my habits made plants the clear winner.
---
Honestly, go with your habits. Have favorite craftable buff food? Pick which ever one makes that better. I use Herbivore primarily for Brain Bombs as they're my go to consumable. 
---
Both are viable and have their strengths. Whatever you feelin dood
---
This is one of the reasons I've cut back on the game. Defense against other players is basically impossible. The game tells them exactly where you are and base structures are weak and unable to be upgraded or defended. You are basically at the mercy of other players.
---
Ark is a huge grief fest but at least you have the ability to make people work at destroying your stuff. 
---
Its only a reduction for the stash, not while you're carrying in on yourself though.
---
&gt;Typically at least 2
---
There's always 3.
---
Seems like you have bad luck like me. I spent 5 hours one day and 8 hours another day. He would show up multiple times but never had the Hunters. When my friend was able play I asked him to help and in the first instance I found the vendor, I got my friend to join my server and the Hunters showed up for him. Took like 10 minutes. Good luck.
---
Yes but getting fixed means nothing if it ruins your game, as soon as people know they will be  exploiting it before you can do anything about it. Keeping that information to yourself and not plastering it everywhere means it will likely have a very small effect in the game 
---
I've kitted up your Marine Armor and handmades in a skull mask a few times now. ;)
---
I haven't been answering PSN messages because I've been getting spammed after adding someone from market. Sorry about that.
---
If you don't find someone in the next hour I'll try to find you.
---
lol Why is this such a surprise?
---
I saw people getting banned for reshade and retexturing mods
---
I wanted to install the text chat mod, but after seeing people getting banned for just retextures, well, I'll wait for private servers 
---
I agree some times things can be obvious but ive seen so so many posts on here about people bragging that they attacked dupers and when I look at my team it concerns me. We all have excavator armor. All the same level. We all busted our asses to get the caps for marsupial serums. We have vastly different weapons and play styles and I'm the only one with an explosive gun, not a two shot. I just would rather people reported with proof, those they caught duping and let Bethesda do something about it. Because now I have to worry when we play, or camp too long to trade, that some asshole with a justice boner is going to ruin our game. We take a lot of workshops to grind for supplies and once already had to jump servers because 3 guys were fast traveling workshop to workshop to destroy everything we built. It just sucks. 
---
World full but omw, hold those outfits down if possible, and for camp plans do you have the toolbox? Not the large toolbox but the other one
---
If someone is willing to use 5 INT points for max demo expert, they should reap benefits from it. Not to mention the risk of killing yourself goes up exponentially. 
---
It’s nerfed in PvP which is good, but they’re allowing us to feel powerful in PvE which is even better. 
---
Radstag herds would be fucking great. All of this would be great
---
That fact the you believe folks are saying that PvP and griefing are the same thing proves you have no idea what you are talking about. You cannot tell the difference, or you wouldn't be defending what is actually griefing as PvP. Thanks for your time.
---
This is a great picture. Double awesome. 
---
I don't remember that much blood.
---
Not able to replicate this. Maybe in beta you were able to snap a floor on the edge of the grating, and then overlay a floor into the grating by snapping it to the outside floor? But that doesn't work for me right now.
---
Someone wise here once said something along the lines of "if the game isn't letting you build it how you want it, think of the most ridiculous way to do something, that would make you think "nah that would never work", and it will probably work". That's the motto I've been living by.
---
I think the skill gap from console to PC is very large personally.
---
The KB/M can be mastered more easily than a controller, and the “roof” of skill is much higher.
---
I grew up on console, so it has always been my thing. I cannot imagine playing any games with vehicles (or anything with varying speeds) and not having a trigger.
---
Also has always made the guns feel a little more realistic than using a mouse. But of course PC has quite a few (for sure more) advantages than console, but I cannot stand hackers and truth is with the release of the XB1X you can’t really modify it without getting banned.
---
Ive had my X for over a year and have never encounter a hacker on any game I have played ever.
---
That to me is the most important thing, and is why I never switched to PC
---
Super recommend Herbivore if you ever get to the point where you have a pile of serums and want to curate a bit more.
---
Both are nice, just feel like the benefits shine more with plants due to availability and quality of gourmet level buff food in comparison. A lot of the best meat buffs use the highest quality meats like scorchbeast and such. Can be hard to stack up the good stuff, especially with spoil rates.
---
Brain Bombs are super good and never spoil. count as plant food. give it a look up!
---
Does OW even have a release date yet?
---
If you liked fallout 4 esp on survival mode yes buy it
---
In beta you could place the wood floor over the pre fab. It was changed on the Dec 4 update, or at least that’s when I noticed it.  I think it was changed due to the multiple doors on the same frame camp glitch. 
---
Another one of those QoL updates you can thank the self entitled duper’s for. 
---
They do have legendarys, but nothing that should effect it. Perks yes, but those are the same, I tried unequipping and reequipping and it still happens. No chems. It seems that it changes depending on when I open my pipboy, sometimes it will show lower damage and sometimes the normal damage, without rhyme or reason.
---
Even scrolling through my weapons now, the dmg will show something, then when I click to equip that weapon, the damage changes.
---
For example, I have a legendary revolver that says it does 125 dmg, which it should, when it's unequipped, but if I equip it, that changes to 75 dmg. Weird.
---
And the worst offenders are Cliff Racers in Morrowind. Endlessly frustrating players who just want to have a quick nap, but can't cause one of those fuckers is stuck in a cliff nearby. 
---
Any but i prefer wood, concrete, oil, acid, or nuclear
---
There are a ton of folks who will 'poo poo' it, but I for one love it!  I regularly play  with friends online, and it's great!  It's NOT Fallout of 'old' it's a stand-alone game.  Buy and Play it!
---
My thoughts exactleh.
---
How much do you need? I'm just the middle man here lol
---
Thanks for mentioning that. I'd only seen Heavy Leather at Flatwoods before. Got my legs at Charleston just now. 
---
Also the Ice Box outside Whitesprings Golf Club.
---
Awesome. I will give it a shot if one of my buddies gets on later lol
---
Yes, and it's even more worth playing. It has some warts yet, but the world is good.
---
if it is just there and everytime it might just be some weird glitch with how it loads you in. if it is happening from other places to other places you might want to change your password and contact bethesda support to see if you can find out if there has been other ip's logging in.
---
i like to think my character is pre-war intelligence DIA that has now turned into a character similar to the survivalist from honest hearts
---
How dare they. These thugs need to be rounded up and banned.
---
Not just TSE but the legendary sytem as it is now ruins the system. I don't know who at Bethesda thought it was a good idea to have the same legendary system from FO4 in 76 but it was a really short sighted decision. Ridiculously strong effects like TSE aren't an issue in a single player game where balance doesn't matter, but for a multiplayer game stuff like that absolutely matters and it kills any kind of variety if everyone is using the same OP set up and the endgame becomes stale.
---
I saw another post on the sub and where someone suggested that certain legendary effects shouldn't be able roll on the same weapon. So you could have an explosive shotgun or two shot shotgun, but not a TSE shotgun. A system like that along with nerfs to certain effects and buffs to others could potentially add some balance and make the overall experience of the game better.
---
That would be funny to have busted ass mobile homes as an option lol
---
So, another computer log fetch quest?
---
So, bumblebee?
---
Yeah, but the roof is clearly extending beyond the garage door. Nothing about that image adds up
---
Thanks. And yeah, herds would be nicely thematic. Get some food, newbie friendly. And would signal a more dangerous event to prep for
---
Hmmm...don't know how to feel about this. Because the last version has instanced loots for everybody to get their different things so yeah another questionable change.
---
This calls for a full on witch hunt!
---
the new dupe method is even worse, it requires the whole server to crash. I haven't lasted more than an hour in one server.
---
DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE
---
At $20~30 sure you can justify it but not any higher.
---
Shop around for a deal on it 
---
I'm good with staying away from this game now, I learned to accept that $60 dollars is gone.
---
Nonsensical weights.
---
Carrying the equivalent of 600 Bethesda units of crap on our person with a couple of perks that doesn't transfer to stash is nonsense.
---
It seems there are a couple of types of Fallout players: those that build in to Bear Arms, for example, to fit their kit and those that have every weight reduction perk equipped all the time to carry all-the-things.
---
The second type creates their own problems. This post is yet another hot take on a solution to the problem those players have created for themselves......
---
Drop some stuff. The wasteland is literally hemorrhaging stimpaks. You'll be fine.
---
Cazador. I want something to be afraid of when exploring. 
---
There are always 4 but they don’t drop level 50 stuff ever so it’s a little mixed. 
---
This is a great reason why griefing/PvP needs to be completely optional and should be disableable. I understand that player interaction is a huge part of this game but it’s too open for assholes. 
---
I'm someones favorite! Yay!
---
Thanks, this is the most useful topic I’ve ever seen on here. 
---
Brain Bombs you mean?
---
Yeah those are solid too.
---
But they give 300 AP like coffee, whereas sunshine oil gives 400 AP, not sure why you would say improved.
---
This game, unfortunately, has a population of toxic sacks of shit we call "griefers". This board has a pretty fucking massive population of said scum, so you won't get much support.   
---
Hopefully when the PVP servers get launched, that fucking garbage will flock to that and leave the rest of us in peace, but...lets be real, they get off on killing people, specifically, who DON'T Want to deal with their toxic fucking bullshit. 
---
I would love it if they would test their work before releasing it -- at full price -- to the audience. Almost all of the controversy of the past two months is directly related to B. refusing to beta test in-house before release.
---
They sure do. I've been through a hell of a lot.
---
I'm not being ignorant, I believe you are lying because no one else has ever had their mods deleted while they still had plenty of that material. Mods are on a lower priority list than raw materials, that's why I do not believe you.
---
Go into the game, look at the challenges, stop being a fucking idiot?
---
It's not like the supply drops have great things in them.
---
Feels like a frustrating change for new players to find out the hard way.
---
Someone at bethesda has been playing too much PUBG :P
---
Really? I get a bunch of level 40’s who hit her and then hide in the trenches. 
---
I think 3k is fair if he has ammosmith
---
I think it is worth even full price despite its flaws.  It is not a gem like Wasteland, Fallout 1, or New Vegas.   But I find it tremendous fun.  
---
I know we are getting another patch towards the end of the month, but it is still a bug fix and balancing patch. there has been no talk of new content this month. 
---
[https://bethesda.net/en/article/3wohkyIGcEOE8gayy6yCMg/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-9-2019](https://bethesda.net/en/article/3wohkyIGcEOE8gayy6yCMg/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-9-2019)
---
Have you gone to Camp mklintoc yet?
---
Sure, it's better, goes from approximately 5 of standard lasers to a durability to 6.
---
I don’t remember. Been so long.
---
Play something else. Problem solved.
---
One issue is, just like turrets, sometimes the game bugs out and you just get attacked walking up to a camp with no provocation. I've had to kill multiple "pets" because they flat out attacked me when I walked up to  a base to use a workbench or whatever. 
---
Ours hits Tuesday morning I think
---
Absolutely nothing but grinding whitesprings and buying Tse weapons off reddit.. Actually, I'd do the brotherhood of steel quest and enclave quest.. Random encounters are fun as well, just travel to each place and explore.. 
---
There are some locations that have holes or very small caves you can build in.
---
Your build is actually a sphere so you can build underground or even over the side of cliffs. If you can place your camp higher when you set up, you can build higher.
---
hell no I finally got one and if they nerf it I'm out. 
---
It does say "steal," right? I know it said that before and there were no consequences but now that it does mean something, that warning is still there, I hope.
---
What are TSE weapons
---
Great read :D 
---
So..cial...life? Man you're speaking in tongues. 
---
**"Beyond Monday’s patch, we’re working on another patch that we hope will hit near the end of the month. This patch will continue to add fixes for issues being voiced by the community, including the number of plans Vendors have available, fixing a few Legendary mods, and continuing to address issues with some Perks".** That is from the inside the vault this week, so the end month patch will be more fixes. If they ending up nerf some legendary effects, people will go grind the BiS so I guess that the new content?
---
I hear it’s a thing.. 
---
Thanks for clearing this up I must have misunderstood
---
I was able to lay it over the grating. The cool thing was that it allowed stairs to attach to the 1/2 floor overlay, which allowed for 2x2 multi-story building. Oh well, time to try something ridiculous then. lol
---
I really need amino scrapping, I’m sat on 1,300 .32 rounds that will never be used, can’t be sold and I don’t think anyone will ever want to take from me
---
If I ever run into you, keep your grubby cop hands away from my hundreds of psychobuff.
---
This gun was nerfed before it was nerfed: Poor accuracy, poor damage -- exactly the opposite of the real thing -- but it looks marvelous, darling!
---
I don't think he can make that much, I am trying to purchase the gatlin reciever for you right now 
---
An advantage to being 50+ is that all legendaries under lvl50 are useless because you will out level them and there will always be a better version.
---
Additionally you can probably not fully finish your build by level 50. Maybe if you planned it perfectly and saved a ton of points. Even then a lot of builds take more perks than you can achieve in 50 levels.
---
Personally I was around level 70 when I finally finished all quests. 
---
~~That comment wasn't mine~~
---
Not yet
---
It does exist in game, just not as a drop. It's a super rare plan to buy to make it. You are good 
---
Two shot explosive weapons. Like a handmade rifle that shoots a additionally bullet and the bullet will explode. 
---
Quad explosive on a double barrel seems to be where it’s at.
---
I'm perfectly happy with my lvl40 armor piercing explosive Gatling gun I got from that event.
---
I'm not going to make a mule for the same reason I don't dupe for the reason I don't buy duped weapons because I like playing the game honestly and not cheating. 
---
Your acting like it's not an exploit unless the server explodes in the process.  XP farming via traps was an exploit, it allows people to shortcut the game and was patched.  Infinite item farming with server hopping was an exploit, it allows people to shortcut the game and was patched.  Duping a single item doesn't crash the server, it allows people to shortcut the game and was patched.
---
Using a mule to trade to yourself and store unlimited items is an exploit, it allows you to shortcut the game.  It allows you to completely cutout inventory management which is a core mechanic of the game, hence the number of perk cards that center on it. You can store unlimited stimpacks, bulk junk and have every type of weapon.  You never HAVE to sell anything so nothing worth buying every gets sold - screwing the game economy.
---
If me telling you that abusing an exploit in an online game is cheating "ruins the game" for you, tough cookies.  A more apt analogy would be we're playing a multiplayer game together and you're choosing not to follow any rules of the game that you don't like.  If you don't like playing within the game's mechanics maybe try playing a game where you do like the mechanics.  Or play a single player where using exploits doesn't inherently disadvantage everyone else.
---
Again everyone defending using this exploit are using the exact same logic dupers do "everyone can do it, it's more fun for me, it's Bethesda's fault for making the game this way, I'm not hurting anyone by shortcuting the game, the game is flawed anyway, yada yada yada"
---
I can't stop anyone from abusing any of the exploits in the game, but I can call you a hypocrite for decrying dupers while abusing an infinite inventory exploit.
---
Its early days still, lets not forget about The Division or no mans sky which took a whole year before it had real content its only been 3 months let’s wait and see
---
I was banned. I was drummer.
---
Anti-Armour Explosive Gatling Gun and normally a Vampire Power Fist, but if im going for a scorched beast it would be quad fire and forget bunker buster 
---
Over 170 hrs in, I've not had public mic on since the beta and am not usually in groups. Did join a group once from a random in-game invite, chat was absolutely awful. But most groups from reddit/LFG on xbox have been great in chat.
---
I did have a higher level last night (I'm at 100) with a 40 cap bounty rush my camp and seemed to want his bounty cleared; I was skeptical but obliged. Except pacifist mode was still on,so after shot 1 he started ripping into my base. He had over 200 bounty by the time I quit and it cost me 40 to 'move' my base (which fixes everything when it stores it/is placed again). Only time I wished I had a way to tell someone how poorly they failed at griefing. 
---
And how do i do these things 
---
Am I the only one who eats anything that I find even if it's radiated or chance for disease?  
---
Not to mention I'm sitting at 24 Disease Cure pills thanks to Pharma Farma.
---
Imagine if someone wanted to make a game and make money from that game. A massive investment is required to do that. This game has already had that investment. It already has the foundations that can be built on. There's no reason they can't radically change stuff in the game to make it more fun and rewarding, and make the atom shop highly more profitable.
---
I have this problem too.   I have one calibrated leg that gets left off making me over carry weight
---
Normies stay out of our server reeeeeeee!
---
Two things seem to govern whether you see an object like a fan or a battered clipboard where it spawns: 
---
1. Has someone else picked it up in the last X minutes? If yes, you won’t see it. This seems to be a server setting. You can server hop around it. 
---
2. Have **you** picked it up in the last Y minutes? This is an character specific setting and follows you across servers. 
---
That’s not definite, just my experience. 
---
It was a useful feature for building small foot print builds, even if it drove me crazy trying to get it right.
---
Could always make it so being over encumber like in fallout 4 survival, you take damage for being OE
---
Pvp is broken and not worth it right now. With all the duped tse weapons pretty much everyone can 1 shot anyone else. Pointless
---
What about 2.5k if you can get the mod 2k
---
Will also pay for mod in addition 
---
Ultra laser pistol plans can spawn on BoS vendor. Have never seen one for the gatling though.
---
If trion could make defiance when it first came out last as long as it did I'm sure Bethesda can make 76 work lol. 
---
Cons are pretty funny 
---
i just got the advanced power connectors AND the brick building set from the vendor bot in Harpers Ferry...maybe check him out?
---
Depends on how they will improve the game in the near future. I mean ESO had a disaster launch but they fixed that and now it is one of the best MMOs as of right now.  
---
Oh are u lantern?
---
My friend has been server hopping for a week or two looking for X-01 calibrated shocks. That's all he does. He doesn't actually play the game anymore or joins our party sessions to explore and have fun. 
---
Vigilantes are just as bad as griefers and dupers.  They don't realize they're not helping anything.  Let Bethesda deal with the issues and dupers.
---
Off of legendary enemies but it's extremely rare. Or you can do what everyone else does and buy duped guns with this effect. 
---
Ah i probably should put a picture 
---
Except that it is a failure. Sale statistic, stock review and critic and user scores prove it. It was an unfinished mess.
---
I can get the mod and do caps, he can't make that much ammo unfortunately 
---
Yeah I kinda sweated the game when it came out and im level 135 so whenever I play with my lower level friends we get messages and "trolled" because we are apparently duping
---
This was almost 2 months ago lmao, thanks though.
---
No worries. They were talking about new content coming in 2019 when the patches first started, not surprised some people took that to mean coming in January. Personally I would have bet on March. February at the soonest, but 2019 has 12 months.
---
Where can I kill Legendary enemies? Are there locations and can keep running to kill them or just encounters?
---
Pretty close to what a bunch of us do.
---
The inadvertant death due to explosive effect is something I will never get used to and it happens at the most inopportune time. Someone always walks away with my loot lol.
---
I had a couple people come up to me and a friend who was a lower level than me and I was afraid this would happen to us. Luckily they just looked around and went away. This reddit witch hunting is stupid and people should stop. I get it, you want dupers to stop but you run the chance of fucking up people just trying to have fun
---
Whitesprings golf course has the most by far. Plus randon encounters. 
---
You go through soldier training. Do an obstacle course, find out who is a commie, and a shooting exercise.
---
I'm located near Toxic Larry's Meat'n'Go.
---
I've been mentioning this in so many posts. Even made a post or 2 for it. 
---
And you haven't played this game at all, by your highly logical and well thought out statement.  Go troll at the mall.
---
61180420
---
Dude, even your Radposting group doesn't respect you and bored of your reposts. Gtfo of reddit fucking reposter. I feel sorry for your parents lol.
---
I am going to continue to buy Atoms each month to financially support the franchise. 
---
For the past ~3 months they've awarded an average of 50 atoms per day with 10 of those atoms coming from a "Level up" challenge. 10/50 = 1/5. The comment I replied to suggests that I because I want them to remove the challenge, I must also want them to remove the ability for players to earn those 10 atoms. I'm suggesting they replace the challenge instead.
---
Just don’t bother asking for opinions, cuz there’s too much difference in answers.
---
The game is good, but needs a LOT of work. There’s a short-ish story which is best if you keep your ears on the taapes, but there’s not much other than farming for end-game armor or buying specific weapons from people, unless you manage to find your own.
---
The game is gonna going to get new content “*soon*” so you’ll have to ask yourself if you can be patient while dealing with the current state of the game.
---
Not sure about the rules on spam, but this is the fourth time you've posted this in less than two days. Not counting the posts in 76market. 
---
Kind of pissed me off loosing 160 odd caps but it was still worth it in the end
---
Yas!  Always up to hiding more things in your camp &lt;3!
---
*"I can't feel my legs!"*
---
Sure. That all makes sense and you don't sound at all like the cookie cutter toons.
---
The bad news is you're going to get grief for any number of virtuous or non-virtuous reasons. More than once I've lost a camp/workshop to 4 dingbats talking over the public mic about "pwning the noob bases on twitch" and the number of times that has happened is probably the same as "gtfo duper - you're over level 100"......
---
Both are just ridiculous.
---
On the flip side, Whitesprings about a month ago was just flying toons (bird bones glitch) in X01 "bombing" the ground with TSE handmades and that kicked off a ton of "share Whitesprings" posts. Whoever is doing the complaining is obviously also doing the consuming.... ;)
---
My main melee at level 89 is still the sword.  I’m getting 200 plus damage per swing, coupled with incisor and martial arts I’m taking down nuked whitesprings ghouls in 2 swings.
---
I agree I was a little frustrated when I realized it had been changed. 
---
If you actually wanted the game fixed you’d be messaging Bethesda not commenting in fan threads just trying to discuss and enjoy the game. While Bethesda is listening to us and sometimes they read the subreddit your efforts seem oddly misplaced when you can directly contact them.
---
2 months...lol
---
Spine Rep checking in, spot on description, good post yo!
---
I think they have invested far too much into fallout 76 to back out now. It was a terrible mistake to not include interesting npcs with equally interesting backstories.They need to back track on that majorly. That is largely what helps make a fallout game.
---
The slap damage mechanic exists for a reason. If another doesn't want to PvP, then why continue attacking them and their base? Many are going to fight back unless they know they're up against TSE weapons. Some won't for various reasons. Like cleaning up their inventory and doing repairs  after doing a nuke zone or getting ready to log out. Then someone comes along wanting to do PvP and gets denied. And don't play that "I'm roleplaying a raider" crap because raiders don't just run around killing. They raid. You can't actually raid a player's camp. Only reason remaining is no reason...because you can. Because the games lets you. Because there is no mechanic nor no rule in the game saying you can't so you do without remorse. Because it's just a videogame.
---
And I'm just generalizing with "you". Point is, just because someone isn't interested in doing PvP when you do doesn't mean they never want to or that on any other occasion they wouldn't wreck you or at least attempt to. Just because a Iverson wasn't to PvP doesn't mean they have to be an asshole about it "because the games lets you".
---
That's bullshit and everyone knows it. You can be king or queen of PvP and still be respectful. Raider or not. Even the in-game raiders respected the monks at that monastery place. 
---
Which platform and do you recall what this person looked like? 
---
Ok maybe we can do something else which mod is it?
---
Wow that really sucks. I went to check after seeing you buy it from the Enclave vendor and found the jetpack right off the bat but no calibrated shocks :/
---
Got a 3star tse gatling laser from the white spring train station vendor. Definitely check the weapons tab at vendors. 
---
that is the spirit. 
---
Highly doubt it the history of MMO's and triple AAA titles that launch which have had issues but ended up not only surviving and thriving but getting expansions and sequels ate numerous.
---
The gaming industry is largely trial and error given the many components that go into.
---
Todd Howard has already committed to keeping this title going so giving it's financial and tech backing it will survive. Six from now this game will be a different best and a year from now the dude will settle and it will be giving the credit it is due.
---
The fallout brand is one of Bethesdas oldest portfolios even if it was not the original creator so it is highly likely the would concede and tranish it's brand and Bethesdas name.
---
It's not like attacking camps was an oversight: theres a clear cost, you become wanted, same as a workshop. I pay caps to level your shitty camp, often times much more than the cost to repair it. It's completely legitimate, all the whiners can deal with it. 
---
Prime reciever gatlin
---
Nice, thanks.
---
It wouldn’t stop farming but it would stop the passive farming that happens at whitesprings I don’t have a problem with active farming eg killing the ghouls with you’re weapons and not turrets that costs resources to repair guns and make ammo so they are still having to put some input into the farming all the time
---
I would rock that gun for sure if I had it.
---
There is a mod available that will not allow you to drop your favorited stuff.
---
Top of the world is really good. Loads of supermutants up towards pleasant valley cabins (sometimes mole miners instead), I had repeat spawns of a three star mutie up there, there’s two vendors nearby plus stash at the station and most (maybe all) crafting stations in mezzanine level of top of the world.
---
Last time I was there I got this insane Mutant Slayer’s War Drum; 40% more power attack damage, +30% damage to super mutants and 90% reduced weight. Smashin 
---
Under normal circumstances I usually don't blow myself up. It's only when there's a few mobs and the game lags/stutters and when I fired a shot at a ghoul several feet away, it teleports in front of me and my shot goes off in front of my face. And I stay the hell away from cars or just blow them up myself first haha
---
Yes!! I have bee waiting for this forever. Let the mad shopping of plans begin!! Caps be dammed!!
---
Would be nice if All loot was instanced like in containers. I don't see a point in exploring an area already picked clean. 
---
does paying 15k caps and a x01 suit with jetpack make up for a two shot explosive revolver? cuz i think thats pretty fair.
---
not bad obama.jpg
---
Not saying I haven't been there.
---
Im also doing this with excess plans, recipes and ammo.

I can relate, I was wandering around a blasted whitesprings when I saw a lvl 28 running around trying his best. I saved him from ghouls with another lvl 88 guy who ended up dying. Without realizing it was another players,  the 28 took the like 5 screws he had in his paper bag so the lvl 88 decided to troll us w his TSE shot gun, he then one shotted us both, took our things and invited me to a party just to tell me we are the assholes. I told him it was an accident and he goes "oh well I don't even need this stuff but now I got it." 
---
Isnt this game a copy paste of fallout 4, but worse? 
---
you guys really need to find better games to fervently defend
---
How well does it hold up to mini nukes?
---
Nuke whitespring. Hurry and do it before the update. Xp will be cut big time there after the update.
---
or or or dont engage in pvp with people then?
---
No one has been banned for modding lol. 
---
Just refreshes the duration
---
My favorite quest line in FO76, so far.  
---
I’m also out of the loop with this game and this is the second post I’ve seen about duping. What is duping exactly?
---
That's not a bug. It's WAI.
---
It's great until you are in an area with other players or friendly turrets etc.. then it's annoying as fuck.
---
Thank you so much. Now I know what to get. A shame the tool chest is unverified.
---
if spend weeks trading and searching for a two shot explosive revolver, stay away from my gun.
---
Look for caves or tunnels. Think outside the box. You can place your CAMP in any place not marked on the Map. So you find a couple train cars you can make your camp there and incorporate the train into the build.
---
I love exploring an finding weird places that could make a great camp.
---
Wish we could make multiple CAMPS and simply change which one is active. 
---
Or someone purposely runs in front of you while shooting an SBQ so they can take the loot.
---
Somehow if I put a bunch of resources in a pile it magically fixes its self. \*Shrugs\*
---
I would like to add let us have neighbours. Tires of not having my camp placed because someone a mile away has theres. I would welcome the idea of close neighbours.
---
Yeah, melee has Been one shotting stuff since beta. If you dont have tse weapons its pointless to go gun builds. Melee is king in this game.
---
Oh no! I hope Bethesda see this then! 
---
Radium rifle heals ghouls a little bit as they heal from radiation damage
---
I found a two shot cryolator in one. I always check around stations, found some good stuff.
---
Should either be the front door, or the C.A.M.P. module itself, that you spawn at.   Maybe a "welcome" mat, that you can place, and you always spawn on that?
---
if its not a bug , bethesda should change it anyway
---
I’ll give the pistol for the mod and as much ammo for it you guys can get
---
Even better if we can get a trailer park camp going haha. 
---
Pictures up 
---
Lol these people obviously don’t understand that you wanted them to lose their stuff...they think you’re dumb lol
---
O shit i must have this now thanks for the PSA OP.
---
I didn't manage to solve the problem on my own, so [u/sirachillies](https://www.reddit.com/user/sirachillies) helped me personally through Skype. HUGE Thank You for him!
---
You've put a lot of energy into trying to make your point. 
---
#No one cares.

yeet
---
If you don't get motion sick is fine i guess. I know this is my personal issue but even with 120hz monitor on medium pc i got motion sick when fps got too low. I had to upgrade to a 165hz g-synk monitor with a new GPU and now i'm finally motion sick free. G-synk makes even 30 fps look smooth.
---
Dude that is badass
---
Or you know, listen to holotapes and read terminal entries. The Eye improves the Regalia of Mystery. What exactly did you think was happening while you were jumping through hoops to reassemble this equipment? The build described above is exactly the combat style described by the Mistresses and the raiders they were apparently slaughtering wholesale. You appear to be entirely too eager to blame the game for your oversight.
---
That perk is for the grenade, missile, and fatman. Other guns benefit from that perk makes these guns obsolete. And also the risk of killing yourself is gone now with the right armor and perk. So where is the downside?
---
Are using a SSD or normal HDD? I have lesser components and had bad lag. I upgraded my HDD to a SSD and now have 0 lag.
---
so, can you send me printscreen with hardened .50 receiver?
---
I bought it. 
---
And I’ll rock it in my Marine combat armor. 
---
* *Operator as fuck intensifies* *
---
Not a problem! I hope you enjoy your time on Fallout 76 finally.
---
Maybe I'll put this down on my resume for a position with Bethesda or Zenimax Game Studios! Haha
---
Cheers from the US!
---
Thanks, took me forever to fix the quick travel problem I had as if jumping up there wasn't hard enough 
---
HDD
---
Yeah, It will be pointless to use guns again If they take out tse guns. Everyone will go back to melee builds what is stupid for a game set in 2100.
---
Will you be playing later today?
---
That’s what I thought, maybe it’s from the dev room. Don’t really have any information about it.
---
then why in then name of atom are you still wasting time on this subreddit?
---
Where was it dropping you when you traveled
---
It’s fucked up you have to look at an items stats to see its stats? What?
---
That seems like a easy way to prey on other players like raiders. Just sit back in stealth and wait for the unsuspecting person to get flagged and one shot them  before they get to loot the junk from the drop.
---
man, you guys are the definition of delusional. watch the "making of fo76" doc dude
---
leveling a camp is PVP?  
---
I thought it was Player verse Player not Player verse Camp.  
---
Guess the definition changed somewhere throughout the line and im just getting too old to keep up
---
Im lvl 51 but will add you need somone to quest with
---
It sucks, but until stability improves I will never, ever, ever launch a nuke without being in a team. Even if none of my actual friends are playing I'll find a random person and team up with them prior to launch so that I can get back into the game if things go wrong.
---
So is this game basically Rust now?
---
I'm lucky if I make it that long.  Like every ten mins max... 
---
Why the downvotes...literally this entire thread is filled with idiots.
---
You are not the first one in gaming history to say this when developers nerf something ridiculous. 
---
Actually the normal marine helmet is not obtainable normally in game, Only the marine tactical that goes with the wetsuit.
---
Oh man that’s nice, what platform are you on? 
---
Good call. They do have that mobile home model in-game. Wouldn’t be too hard, I’d imagine.
---
Oh, I was in a team too. my teammate actually crashed and then I got the error message that the server had disconnected :/
---
Add me : Vibehawaiikid32 
---
have you tried scrapping?
---
You don't get one shot by TSE, dupers stack 20% damage bobbleheads on them and they one shot you with them :/
---
Depends if you're limited by carry capacity or how many fusion cores you find. Unless you use gatling lasers, you're probably better off with Batteries Included, especially since the workshops were buffed in the last patch.
---
Off the cliff, the two bottom levels were there to stop me from dropping
---
Imagine if someone wanted to make a game and make money from that game. A massive investment is required to do that. This game has already had that investment. It already has the foundations that can be built on. There's no reason they can't radically change stuff in the game to make it more fun and rewarding, and make the atom shop highly more profitable. And it's a much easier process for them, than for someone starting from scratch. All they need to do is get creative. Any idiot can come up with great ideas. They just need to put some into practice.
---
I recommend this book for any game developer or even gamer. By the guy who worked on designing Ultima Online and Star Wars Galaxies, a few of the best MMOs ever.

# Theory of Fun for Game Design by Raph Koster
---
Ah man
---
If you’re on Xbox I can help you with a run
---
The weapons are absolutely fine, it’s the mobs that are two easy. 
---
The explosive bobblehead will stack because it's bugged, but the rest of them just refresh the timer.
---
Let me know if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure the materials required for the 'repair all' function at your workshop are minimal. You don't have to pay the full cost of every individual item. :P
---
For example, I've repaired turrets for workshops and the cost was something like 10-20% of the actual turret cost. Should be affordable for a lowbie since she likely doesn't have many items built in the first place.
---
The game was made to be grief-free, so it just seemed weird to me that someone was being griefed!
---
This thread is filled with idiots. They can’t comprehend that it’s an exploit. Literally everyone that states it’s an exploit and that it affects server performance negatively is immediately downvoted to hell.
---
Ran away or died to Scorched like all the other raiders 
---
i could care less what i look like but i accidentally scrapped my dress. anyone know where to find more?
---
Yes they stack. 
---
Damn, we just killed a sbq with you like 45 mins ago. I remember your name being super unique and my buddy commenting on your level. Nice playing with you! 
---
I would bet this is your issue. I have a gtx970, 8gb ram, and a phenom x2 proc. So all your specs are better but the hd. I had insane load times, stuttering while running and pauses during actions like entering power armor or using stations. After switching to SSD I have no lag and near 10 sec load times.
---
Couldn’t say it better myself.
---
I succeeded in my build in a crude way. Power counter is definitely broken, and because I wanted stepping into traps to be 100% the will of the one who is stepping in, I just added pressure pad on one side with a label "no step", warning signs on the walls in the locked room, and a switch that is labelled with "dont touch the switch" that, if touched, powers up the traps and the sirens.
---
Im now refining the design as players tend to escape. I killed four wanted people in my base the first day of testing.
---
The build looks like this, you enter a corridor with two powered doors inside, one on the left, labelled "private" with neon signs, the other one opened, labelled "public", and containing all the crafting amenities. There is also an open top flor which I tried to make welcoming, with "open/beds" label and what was to be a nano scale motel.
---
To open the private section, one must step on a pressure plate labeled "no step" first, then ignore all warnings to actually trigger the traps.
---
I also have been leaving them in train station suitcases: past, future and in the now.
---
Learn to properly scavenge you filthy animals!
---
Elder Maxson maybe?
---
I was lucky enough to get an explosive minigun maybe 2 weeks ago off of Uranium Fever. Ever since then, because I am level 125+ I've been a target of this kind of harrassment. At least I can defend myself with it, but everyone I come across  questions me whenever I am playing with my friend who is around level 50. He ends up getting harrassed any time he plays with me just about. 
---
Until they implement a "join back to previous server" feature or fix the server disconnect completely, you will have to expect these things to  happen regularly.
---
Yeah I had mine on my roof to keep everything self contained, and it wouldn’t place for that reason when I moved.  I have them external to the main structure now with the hope they will end up in stored and the main structure will still place.  I have rebuilt so many times now that it isn’t a huge deal to redo it anymore though.  
---
RP would be an actual thing if one could use an actual *name* for their character instead of their Bethesda.net account user name, because no matter what else you do, you will always only be that one name and everyone will recognize that only.
---
A second thing that would facilitate actual RP and really improve on the game's immersion would be to have the option to *not* have your name show on the map unless you were wanted. This would also make things much more difficult for all the griefers. Having everyone on the map able to see who is on the map and where they are is just plain stupid in a game which encourages griefers by design.
---
Lastly, having it so that when your property is attacked is the same as being attacked personally would be a big improvement, along with real -- and harsh -- penalties for griefing others. For example, a 95% damage reduction alongside a 95% damage vulnerability for initiating PvP combat outside a workshop area or arena (and zero caps payout from the victim) would be good.
---
I just tried, on PS4. I increased the dam output to 75% (that was the highest option I had). I went to Dyer after, but just saw pods and no blooms. :(
---
WoW, The Division, No Man's Sky, and Sea of Thieves were all either buggy fucking messes and/or devoid of end game content when they launched, and they're all still going. I don't see them giving up on this any time soon.
---
You’re bout to get downvoted to hell for being right, just like the rest of us.
---
PS4 I'm afraid, but appreciate it! 
---
Shoulda bought that. Even if you don't want it can sell for like 2,000 caps. I've yet to see jetpack either.
---
It's nice to see that players are taking it upon themselves to become the problem rather than the game itself, way to step up guys!
---
Ah but seriously screw those types of players.
---
Their are a lot of great people in this game and lot of questionable if not down right maliciously evil players similar to the real World.
---
The great part though is you can just block them hop server and never deal with them again.
---
I play on Xbox so i locate their gamertag and block them that way also to ensure I don't have to deal with it.
---
Why should anyone post anything? You basically just described everything on reddit.
---
Explosive weapons need to be removed 
---
If you're on a team, you're part of a team. This includes sharing perks and the empath mutation. Whether you like it or not, if you have the ability to enhance your teammates, you become part of the "active target" when PvP starts. This works in your favor when your teammates kill folks and you get caps off them, so it's a give-and-take. But regardless, if you're on a team, it's all for one and one for all.
---
At least two new party related bugs were introduced: invite to team being available for people already in your team, and people disappearing from your feiend list.
---
I also observed that being killed by a player on your friend list nos blocks said pkayer for session :o
---
Ouch. That really sucks.
---
Thx
---
IIRC the second bullet from Two-Shot is already weaker.
---
The extra bullet when firing doesn't take into consideration any buffs you have applied from perks and the like. So in many cases the extra bullet is dealing about 50% of your main bullet.
---
I can build them on XB1 if you want one to check out. Probably cost about 175 caps to cover crafting costs.
---
I've killed the SBQ like A LOT lol. I must have been really lucky to only have seen it recently i guess.
---
Because that is the inherent nature of humanity... sticking their nose in heckin everywhere.  Happy cake day btw.
---
I feel your pain. I think it's to teach new players how to platform in the game
---
This is my first "multiplayer" game in years. I need a game with a pause button, like Skyrim, FO4, The Witcher 3, etc. because I have a busy home life and can't really ever find 1 hour uninterrupted. I don't have friends on the game so I made a solo build, stealth(so I can hide as my "pause button") and have had no issues with doing all of the quests and killing all the enemies.
---
2. I stay away from the yearly releases that only tweak 1 or 2 features, COD type things
---
3. I stay away from mostly everything but what I mentioned in the beginning. I will buy a game and play it for 2-3 years on and off, so I cannot keep up with fast releasing titles.
---
3b, tried mass effect, had fun with it but lost touch with it for some reason
---
4. never heard of those titles
---
5. Not really a Youtube watcher
---
6. I have friends who play similar games, just not the same ones right now.
---
7. Don't know enough about the industry, or games in general. All I know is this title needed more time before release. Some things were clearly oversights and would have been found by a real beta testing session, even an extra month.
---
8. Generally positive. Only lost my "paper bag of junk" once or twice to server crashes. Scorchbeasts are just freaking annoying right now. I fought 2 lvl 80 SBs at one time the other day and just the constant spamming of the sonar, and them never landing and just farting that green crap on you was really annoying. Even inside of a closed building they can damage you with the screeching! Just cut back that screeching 50%, increase landing 50%, and make their attacks avoidable. In a sealed underground building their ass-gas shouldn't reach me instantly. Also their loot is garbage. If you give me their bones, let me craft some armor out of it or something.
---
I am a pretty casual gamer, and didn't buy into all of the freaking out some people did about the game, hope this helps.
---
Who gives a shit? Hop servers, spend 30 wood rebuilding, and get over it. 
---
It's a game. These guys didn't blow up your real house. 
---
Okay thank you :) Then i will stick to Batteries included, because i only need these sweet fusion cores for my PA ^^
---
Cool! My camp is just crafting stations, so it doesn't take much to destroy.
---
Nice and cosy 👌
---
I’m absolutely confused when it comes to the advanced power connectors they need to have some sort of directions rather than just a small info text about the actual device 
---
&gt;Go play Fallout 4
---
I can't pay Fallout 4 in a party with my friends, dipshit.
---
Destroying a camp for no reason is griefing. Period. 
---
If I could start a private lobby I would.
---
I also wish we could find out what happened to Bruce!
---
post in /r/fo76bazaar
---
As sad as it is to be cheating for an edge in a non-competitive game, I feel like it's actually more pathetic to be white knighting and potentially ruining newbie's experience in a non-competitive game. Like you're so upset that your gear isn't super unique to you at endgame, that you're going to ruin the experience for lowbies? What kinda horsespit is that?
---
West virginia?
---
I say you deserve it if your sharing perks.  They get the boost from you so your fair game.  Passive is to stop you doing accidental not to protect you.  There is no I in team. 
---
And how would you sort out people toggling on and off passive to stop being killed or how do you identify the passive in a team, who goes aggressive when someone's seeking revenge.
---
No, it would be bringing your gameplay back to the level of a normal or average player.
---
I have yet to honestly run into someone that does destroy things but I know theirs always at least one person that likes doing that.
---
I placed my camp in a premade log cabin I found in an unmarked location. Its awesome since im not much of a builder.
---
welp there goes console chance of getting a feature like this for know plans as the modding commutiny has already done it and Bethesda love modders to make there game better 
---
*reads in sneak sniper*
---
Any good locations where it is high up with no need for turrets, but still have access to water?
---
You just said it after this sentence.
---
Their behavior is PvP.
---
A few downvotes doesn't equal most.
---
You're not complaining about griefing, you're complaining about PvP.
---
It doesn't matter how many people think PvP is griefing. It's not.
---
Any bloodied + swing speed works. I use buzz blades, pick axes, combat daggers, pitchforks, whatever. Don't turn your nose up at things that aren't grognax or super sledge, everything works with the right mods and you'll save money.
---
Armor wise I currently run a 1* unyielding wood chest for stealth buff. Full unyielding gear pumps my agility high enough that I can repeatedly sneak attack the queen and she can't spot me. One star works for this but I like unyielding with agility or harder to detect while sneaking.
---
Nicely done
---
scrapping the blueprints is what duplicates the items and the blueprints dont go away. and after scrapping items there are more items in my stash and my stash is over the limit
---
Sorry bro, he/she and all the rest of em can’t comprehend that it’s a disadvantage that they can whip out 50 different legendaries to counter you, and store infinite heals...while you struggle to quit lagging because they are making the server lag with their infinite weight characters loading in and stressing the database due to a failure to be able to track a whole other character who holds millions of item id codes.
---
Most of my issues stem from poor RNG with legendaries. My best weapon is a 3 star fire axe and I’m not even specced for melee. 
---
I’ll keep hunting for a legendary lever-action, because it’s my favourite gun looks-wise. 
---
**Hundreds of hours** worth of farming has dropped us dozens of ts, and tse's, first one is the hardest. Get efficient at farming, then move onto optimizing your build to whatever works with what you have. Melee is strongest when it comes to damage output/cost but its not my playstyle.
---
I assume you'r struggling with the queen, do whatever works for you but you'r spending over 2k rounds into her you'r ~~doing something wrong~~ not being efficient, and would advise you to look into your build, or try something different.  Bloodied builds combined with adrenal, and nerd rage take healthy sized chunks from her health, and spend no ammo. 
---
 I use rifles since thats what dropped for me, ts pipe pistol for everything but the queen, because cost of repairs and ammo abundance. The queen is the only time I would ever use either .45, or the 5.56, for additional damage you can invest into the ultracite ammo but it costs flux, just one more thing to farm.
---
As for gate keeping yea i could have worded it better, its been a common occurrence a few weeks ago of people just exploiting/buying their way to higher lvl's, but having none of the tools/armor/weapons to be useful, queen fights make it more noticeable.
---
Just today I joined in a world were at least five people were using e/tse weapons, the queens health didn't even have a dent in it, having god roll weapons help, but it's not going to win the game for anyone in a fight like that.
---
I might actually hit you up sometime lol
---
Enemies are like level 60 there, i’ve barely started into the game
---
Hmm I’ll double check. That is to say that, without any perks a gun with TS, at base, does double damage? Surely this is then the same for the other effects? The bonus damage is calculated before the perks rather than after Either way, my main issue is that the TS effect does considerably more damage than the other effects, which, in my mind, is why it needs a big nerf. TS eclipses the other effects in strength. That’s my main problem with it.
---
He seems to be getting cold feet, I have the reciever if you want to get it from me. I don't think he wants to use his flux. 
---
Alot of people are doing this just to have justified griefing. They get to grief someone (although sometimes rightly so) and expect loot and praise for it.
---
I get it when people just happened upon this stuff, I hate how dupers are crashing the game too, but now its all bounty hunting for recognition and praise 
---
Its actually shameful really. Some of them are almost as bad as the dupers themselves. They're ruining others experiences which is exactly what they say they're going out to 'protect'. Petty and stupid.  
---
I see your point here, this is probably just a window of opportunity these types of people have been looking for, using this giant high pedestal of "you're wrong I'm right and if i yell dupers people will support me" to enforce griefing behaviours without much consequence or backlash.
---
I've had my base here for about 2 weeks. Just got attacked for the first time by 2 sb's.
---
I never said griefing isn't a thing. But the scenario being discussed here isn't griefing. It's PvP.
---
Mine is in the same spot. I really had no idea that it was a quest location as I never even started that quest line when I built there. 
---
I still have notice anyone drop by when I have been online. 
---
sounds like a great location, what platform are you on would like to see it, ive placed mine at the very top of the mountain near seneca rocks great view 360 but have the same issue with fast travelling, always have to wear PA just incase 
---
I would do the reciever and 1k for the gauss rifle
---
Tho not complete I find that the [https://fallout.gamepedia.com/](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/) site is very useful when it comes to weapons and mods as they include some of the information you are wanting.  it still isn't straight numbers but seeing what mods at to AP cost may help
---
The scorch beast doesn't harass you ?
---
Nicely done.
---
Salem witch hunt 2019
---
No sorry i don't have anything for that
---
TSE weapons aren't the real problem the problem is how they interact with certain perks and the dupers that made them so prolific. 
---
If you changed the way the perks interacted with the weapon it would fix the problem by severely gimp the weapons though because we know what bethesda would do they wouldn't decrease the buff they would just eliminate it completely and no one that uses these weapons on the daily would want to give up that advantage and I wouldn't blame them.
---
People are saying that very thing here. They're arguing that the PvP that happened was griefing. PvP isn't griefing. Thanks for your time.
---
Funny how you partially quote me, I said if you want a single player experience where nothing goes wrong. Sounds like you want to have your cake and eat it too. 
---
Destroying a camp because I want to is an ingame feature. Griefing is a non sensible word made up by complete pussies that would rather whine than fight back. Go conscript your supposed friends to help you if you're so buttmad. Shit costs me significantly more caps than the measly steel your repairs costs you you bum motherfucker. 
---
I know which I am missing. It's finding them that I have a hard time with. 
---
u/LoneVaultWanderer and u/LadyDevann can you lads do us a favor. Look at this mod and see if its ok to use or not?. Its not an interface mod exactly it injects code into the game from the looks of it. 
---
Rather be on the safe side since alot of are or planning on using this mod.
---
So a swift reply would be very good. Its hard to know what Bethesda is ok with and not regarding nexus mods. The support page seems to suggest use at your own risk but something like this could see bans?.
---
Well sheesh... that explains why I couldn't find it!
---
Finally, I got an pump action with this effect but it seems not to work. Looking 5 days for it and it's useless now 
---
Just explore the map, unlock places to fast travel too and if you run into quest on the way complete them.. But mark my words...... YOU. WILL. GRIND. WHITESPRINGS.. 
---
I’ve started playing fo76 this week (level 11), expecting super unstable servers after hearing all the bad buzz, but i haven’t been disconected once on OG Xbox 1. Guess i’m just lucky
---
No only had one attack and that was as I was logging out I think that it only spawns when players get close to the spawn point and since this path is so rarely tread on.
---
Ouch 
---
 We pay attention to what we validate to avoid duplicate items :) 
---
Non-consenual PvP in a non-consenual PvP game is PvP.
---
Awesome, but the scenario being discussed is still PvP, not griefing.
---
I've tried really hard to be an NPC in this game.
---
Attempt 1- Small toll road camp, where for keeping the road clear of super mutants I demand a small of appreciation in the form of chems, ammo or junk - people just went around instead ( although the deathclaw probably wasn't a good idea to have hanging about)
---
Attempt 2. " Molly's Chem Den", location by whitesprings where any chem could be made to order and a lovely open air chill out area ( with lava lamps! ) to chat shite or listen to me talk about the time I read out a mothman sermon to 6 random on NYE etc. Also turned out bad as nooblords with bad aiming skills would keep nuking it. ( only positive being I could charge an extra 1000% for rad-x )
---
I personally am a fan of PvP...when its done mutually and right.
---
whats the fun in attacking random people in a game that have no want or ability to fight back? especially since i can go around one shotting most smaller players and enemys at this point, without a mutual PvP session its just boring, useless and poorly implemented.
---
The last thing i want to do is ruin someones experience of the game and be a massive chode n sack
---
Yes, i did do that
---
They don't care about any of this.
---
PC.
---
What sucks is that you can’t even place two CAMPS righty next to each other. I guess they have to have a buffer in between. It sucks when you’re in a team and want to have CAMPS right by each other. 
---
XB1, my friend dumps her extra ammo in the cigarette machines at the train stations. Just a heads up!
---
Conscripting the 3D artists to program would probably create more problems. It's like, "can you believe these baristas are just making coffee? THEY SHOULD BE CURING CANCER!"
---
I never did Falsely Accused and I get it in like 1 of our every 5 times I hop
---
Level 25 lilmarc410 psn
---
What would you take for it ?
---
So, uh, bumblebee?
---
Bethesda should fix pvp (no Tse), disable the map tracking and enable that the first shot does the full damaga, that would be really exciting feeling and enviroment
---
Somebody gets my point. Thank you. Checked OP’s posts and I get it now. It’s impossible to have a discussion on this sub without getting attacked and downvoted. 
---
.... I might be really off base. Maybe Herbivore boosts it? Don't have it anymore as I've been redoing mutations. eh
---
A friendly reminder that the wasteland don’t give a shit
---
Thank you I spent weeks trying to find a great place to build a camp and I finally found it I think.
---
I haven't had anyone attack mine, only mole rats and stuff. But since it's just a bunch of benches in the middle of nowhere, people overlook it. I did see some dudes running around destroying camps though.
---
But what if it's [your ass-kicking outfit?](https://youtu.be/xq1tN9jZI80)
---
Of course they too easy you have a TSE
---
in a fucking videogame about a post-apocalyptic wasteland??? YES YOU IDIOT!
---
Got a picture of it in game?
---
You are putting words in my mouth that I didn’t say. 
---
As I said quote it. 
---
As I always said their behavior is griefing but not pvp and pvp and griefing is two different things. 
---
I am complaining about griefing but not pvp. 
---
I put this statement in almost every replies and you still choose to be ignorant about it and think what you want to see/think.  Just like you being ignorant regarding posts and people think this is griefing. 
---
I did lol
---
Double Hunger and HP restore, and only those.
---
As far as I know there is still one that works. Although it takes longer and is more costly. Haven't ever tried it, but it was still working after the original method was patched at least. 
---
You're confusing dueling with PvP. PvP refers to game mechanics which put players into conflict with each other, whether that is over resources, K/D ratios, W/L rates, territory or for fun. By your logic, PvP can't occur between more than two player because it's only one PLAYER vs one other PLAYER, not PLAYERS.
---
I wouldn't say so, with the high amount of low level players holding high levels of loot for dupers or even veteran players killing low levels is just a low risk high reward venture at this point.
---
Has anyone tamed with only 3 charisma?
---
Welp that's a bs excuse and you know it
---
Whenever is good 4 u ill get on i have nothing planned for tonight 
---
probably when they Release the private servers than we could do rp servers
---
I threw it away already but it’s totally the same as fallout 4
---
I had mine at the lead deposit on the other side of the lake and every time I would go home it would attack, I had to move. 
---
Even my new place which is no where near a fissure, it shows up now and then and attacked my camp once even when I moved away from it ..
---
I feel your pain.  3\* Instigating board is my best on my stealth rifle build.
---
Is that something that comes up often? I haven’t played too much im still around Flatwoods
---
North of Braxon's Quality Medical Supplies in the Mire. This is at the same body of water as Thunder Mountain. This is an Oil deposit. Does this fit what you're looking for or would you like me to keep looking?
---
When i first found this spot I was afraid of the scorched beast but after a couple days I discovered it never spawns so long as I stay away from that area and the only creatures that do spawn here are some really low level super mutants and wolves.
---
1.2 and you got a deal
---
Their behavior is PvP, which you keep calling griefing, thus proving you think PvP is griefing. This probably explains why you don't play UO or EvE anymore, since both of those include PvP.
---
The vendor Phoenix at Watoga and the Watoga train station vendor 
---
well you know you don't really have a point either. this is what reddit is, that's how it's designed. so if you really have a view like that then you're not really in any position to complain over others. and if you do, realize that other people might be feeling exactly the same thing as you but not towards reddit but towards the game; and that's ok. people are allowed to dislike different things. and they are free to say they dislike said thing, especially on reddit. and, of course, you are allowed to retort.
---
here's where i come in: you said he has no point. if he has no point, then neither has you; if he has a point, then you do too. the rest is semantics to me, and this is getting awfully pedantic, so whatever. cheers mate.
---
Now you’re sacrificing three more points for fireproof. I know I wouldn’t invest three more points into Endurance for it, and I’m not willing to give up anything I have there now. I don’t PVP so I don’t care about fireproof. But people who do, are investing three more points. It’s a specific build. The guns are extremely powerful with all of their respective weapon cards and demo expert. That is a lot of investment. 
---
They won’t effect PvP as much anymore and powerful guns should be powerful on PVE. Can’t believe this is even a discussion. What they should do is make even better guns in the future and have enemies ridiculously protected from explosions. Force us to change through gameplay, don’t just make us weaker. 
---
1.1 make me feel good about myself 
---
What’s duping? Duplicate? 
---
Just got game level 19 add me or not Decisiveremain 
---
So you think it’s ok to ban YouTubers from the game permanently because they raised awareness about a potentially game breaking glitch?
---
Careful before you do lets check with the Beth community managers on this one. See my comment below just waiting on a response.
---
This is why I always sneak, even when in my own camp
---
I've got a character specifically built to use Dragons.
---
I just thought it would be cool cause I like them.  
---
I have like 3 different dragons and I take a shot then swap to the next one. I only have a bloodied and instigating so it's not doing the insane damage you will see but I like them. They can usually take down big mobs in 2-3 shots so by having 3 guns I can usually get rid of the threat then run around while I reload all the guns for 30 seconds.  
---
If I was you though, I'd probably just save it for super big enemies and use regular other weapons for normal enemies.
---
What's wrong with having a mule? 
---
I just left a session because four asshats destroyed everything in my base, and I had to sit there and watch because none of them gained a wanted level doing it. 
---
All right psn Mackdaddycash I’ll be on in about 30min
---
Aight
---
You cant. It sucks. 
---
I honestly have no idea what makes some bases attacked more than others but i do wonder about it constantly 
---
The game allows endless duplicating too it seems, i suppose thats something thats fine and dandy to do also.
---
Im sure your opinion will change if something you work on for ages gets decimated the second someone less than a level 15 pops over to have a look
---
Well that sucks, my camp is in the forest so I often get low levels hanging out using my workbenches and I like to make them armour and food, often I'll accompany them on quests or they'll tag along with me. Granted I'm not in triple figures yet but it never occurred to me anyone would see that as suspicious.
---
I transferred my camp and 55% of max capacity got deleted, the only part that survived was the main house. All crops lost, all turrets and purifiers lost and only two lawn flamingos survived. Moving camps is buggy as hell and not advisable with complex camps... 
---
Yah it is not just you.  Getting really weird disconnects regularly each play session. The strangest one was last night when hubby and I were playing for less than 30 mins and we got some stuttering and lost connection to server messages pop up, then suddenly we had a message up top that said they were taking the servers down for maintenance. Except there is no maintenance.... It was so confusing. 
---
It’s griefing but you gave yourself excuses of pvp as I stated before. If you choose to give yourself an excuse for not taking moral hit, that’s your choice but this is considered griefing by most of us here as I said before. 
---
And you are wrong again to assume about not playing them anymore. 
---
Fallout has always been an exploration game. That’s what this was supposed to be. If you aren’t interested in exploring, I’m not sure why you bought this game. There are plenty of run and gun games, but the whole point of 76 is to slowly work your way to the queen and the journey is part of the fun. If you want the best of everything as fast as you can, no wonder you are not impressed with this game. 
---
O\_o well thats a new one. never heard of infinite blueprints before.
---
THIS^ and server hop for the rare power armor mods you want. But take your time :) if you are new to the game, just enjoy wandering around, exploring places making friends if the opportunity arises. I have a group of friends and we make a party chat outside of the game while we server hop/launch nukes/bounty hunt and we end up having a blast.
---
Throwing around the "duper" word is just an excuse for them to be a jackass. Sorry ya had that happen.
---
You have to let the ticks hit you.. as they hit you, they fill with blood (feeding on your blood, just like real ticks).. you will see them fatten up and turn red.  Then squash them.
---
PvP isn't griefing, no matter how much you wish it was.
---
And what's your toon's name? I'll introduce you to a little PvP.
---
Absolutely. We are always looking for more people. I figure the more we have, the better we can rep the group and fight griefing. If you are on Xbox lube anytime, go to the groups section and look for a group called “SG Raiders”, has a red-ish skull emblem. There are more of us in game, but I’m trying to get the Xbox live group active now so people can post their videos and such, as well as chat
---
Yes and no. For example powering up any power plant requires a certain level of platforming.
---
You can learn to scale tree's and buildings for advantageous sniper positions or to locate hidden loot or quest items. 
---
Some places you are able to bypass all the mobs if you figure out how to sneak around them etc etc.
---
Otherwise it's just for fun. For another example you can clear all of West-Tek in spots that the super mutants will not hear your guns report when you fire it so you can clear out the area relatively easy.
---
it is exactly whats being discussed
---
I defiantly had a run that seemed like every other mutant was a legendary there. It was one of my first runs after I got a 30% more damage to mutants lever action rifles. Sad to say I've never had a run that good again.
---
Just a small water tap, shove it in the dirt and you're good to go or if you wanna bulk you can just parkour down to the swamp, spam R then fast travel back to camp as a way to teleport back up... When I do that I gather around 100 water for drinking, soups and med crafting for the session, this only takes no more than 60 seconds.
---
You should check out the lead deposit, I loved that spot, got this beautiful arch, built steps up to the cliff above it, beautiful views. Also you can have an acid and lead in deposit in the same camp, but you would need to be able to handle a scorchbeast. If they ever get nerfed, I am moving back there, beautiful views of the lake.
---
Fireproof rank 3, and dense mod on your chest piece and you will laugh at TSE users.
---
I don't have any stimpacks. I give them away to low levels I meet. And my purified water. I give an instigating level 25 legendary to a level 20 I meet. I give a fully level 50 modded instigating golf club to a level 48 I meet. I'm a traveling collector and helper, and I'm punished for it. I give them something nice to use in a few levels. I also want to collect some armor sets, and have some weapons to try out. I'm just meant to drop it all? Because they have given some RNG system that gives you all of these prefixes that you're just meant to instantly throw away as legendary trash? And a limited stash that can hardly hold your junk. Nevermind a few rifles shotguns and heavy weapons.
---
&gt; Being 1shot by someone using vats and a TSE weapon grinds my gears so bad
---
So you're fine when it's a melee build that just runs up to you and insta kills you?
---
There is this sort of feature if you're on a team and you disconnected. It will send you back to the server you were just on with your team
---
It arguably *is* griefing.  🤷‍♂️
---
What mission can I find this in?
---
Unless you wanna server hop a whole lot
---
No its not.  
---
I just had a group do it and none of them got a bounty
---
I did not know about hotkey search in the inventory. What a game changer. 
---
No they are to easy no matter what, it’s a major problem, as there is no reason to group up in this game.  
---
 When I was a fresh lvl 50 with a melee build there was nothing I couldn’t handle, and if there was something that was risky, well I have 50 stims to pop just in case. 
---
1. Badly implemented pvp
---
2. CoD, CS:GO, Dota, LoL
---
3. Battle Royale, MOBA - 3b. good story crap ending
---
4. Story is good if done properly with decent writers that have experience in the genre they are writing for.
---
5. None
---
6. Yes
---
7. Unionise the work force
---
8. It's been okay, not great, just okay.
---
love the log cabin idea ... the doublewide idea too, oddly enough
---
Do you think Reshade is a mod?
---
Where’d you get it?
---
&gt; I think I found a bug
---
This Bethesda game; bug find you! ~s (tongue-in-cheek sarcasm.)
---
First time I've seen someone use the tunnels to the extent I did months ago; bravo on taking a space and making it truly unique!
---
Trying to keep it positive. 
---
Calling people that may disagree fanboys. 
---
3/10 keeping it positive effort. 
---
Thanks brother!
---
If they paid for a second copy I don't see the problem
---
I think mine, unfortunately, was a completely random drop from a super mutant, so I can't offer you guidance. The lever action rifle plan has a low chance of spawning at Responder vendors for about 600 caps, or you can get it from other players for around 2000 caps on the Market. Even non-legendary, it is a nice weapon, but it isn't dropped often by enemies. 
---
I agree with this .. although I wouldn't want to pay full price.
---
posted this before, but you can just take over one and save all you bugdet https://imgur.com/a/w3PJ6z4 EG HERE
---
How
---
I could pretty easily build a base for killing scorched beasts but I just wanted a nice little place in the mountains. I don't see my self moving anytime soon I really love my current base although i do thank you for your idea.
---
It is not on the item's stats.
---
Are we seriously expected to try on something and check the effects tab just in case it has hidden attributes?
---
Pvp isn’t griefing I agree. But griefing isn’t pvp either. 
---
No matter how you trying to justify that. 
---
really? nice
---
It's ok to keep it since you haven't used any cheats, It would have most likely already been deleted from your inventory if it wasn't ok just like the owl mask etc.
---
What even is a TSE weapon?
---
Lol I love that you cuddled with them!!!
---
1.  If it's a multiplayer game then it needs to have as many methods of communication as possible to be as inclusive as possible for all gamers.  I have seen many folks in the Deaf community feeling pretty ignored and left out of a game that was supposed to be all about MP experiences.  For me the game has to be fun and have some time of progression or depth that allows me to invest deeply into playing it for long periods of time.
---
2. Fuck battle royale games.  I understand they are flavor of the month right now but I just don't get or understand the appeal and this is coming from someone who loves FPS games and PVP in general.
---
3. I see all games as telling a story or sharing an experience.  They are games, just not my cup of tea games.  This is like when people try and say the Wii wasn't a real game system... after it targeted a segment of the gaming population that was untapped at the time (super casuals) but it sold a metric crap ton of consoles.  To each their own and no reason to bash someone elses cup of tea.
---
4. I have been diving much deeper into indie games over the years as they have had some of the most interesting ideas and systems other than some of the very few main stream games that get it right (Witcher 3).  Sunless Sea was amazing and I am looking forward to playing the sequel.
---
5. Never heard of those channels.  I tend to look for gaming channels that are covering games I am currently enjoying in a positive light.  Ser Winter is a big favorite of mine even though I don't play Rust anymore, I like his style, I like how he treats PVP as an honorable contest and doesn't take it too serious, and I like how he treats people.  I have VERY few Youtubers I watch for Fallout 76 that have more than a few hundred followers because it seems like all the channels bigger than that are using this game as a shit post spring board to grow and I feel like that's taking the easy road, grabbing low hanging fruit, and probably not going to help them in the long run.  If you dislike a game you have tried, cool, I can agree with that, but how long can you keep beating a dead horse for views?
---
6. I have 1 close friend who plays every game I get and vice versa, we tend to attract like minded people who play games for the right reason, like a little light hearted trolling, and generally just want to make things better than they were when we got there.  We have belonged to large multiclan games in the past and been bothered by watching large groups of close folks implode over dumb drama or just drift apart so we tend to avoid them now and just do our own thing.
---
7. I would make all pay to win and loot boxes illegal.  Pay for cosmetics can stay (after seeing it actually be used responsibly in Path of Exile) until it starts being abused.  I have no problem paying 60 bucks for a game.  No problem paying for DLC, as long as it doesn't feel like the game I originally bought was cut short to fleece me.  I just hate the predatory nature of so many of these modern game systems and that is what often drives me to explore so many indie games where they focus on making something FUN first and then profit off selling that fun rather than making a system to money grab first then building a game around it (looking at you Diablo 3 RMAH).
---
8. I will say what I always say to this question, I am loving this game IN SPITE of it's many flaws.  Yes, it's buggy as hell.  Yes, it had issues aplenty.  But I see the bare bones of a game that I am already 340+ hours deep into and STILL looking forward to playing it every day that has so much potential for growth.  If Bethesda continues listening to the valid concerns of the community and puts out interesting new content at a timely pace I could see myself playing this game for many years to come.  When WoW came out it was plagued with a lot of similar issues (remember the teleporting farmers, speed hackers, and lack of content to get from 40-50 so you had to grind on 3 small pools of owlbears for days on end, and the frequent "servers down for emergency maintenance"?).  It sucks but Bethesda admitted up front this was their first stab at making Fallout MP, I knew it had a chance of being bad and wanted to play anyways.  The amount of time I have been able to play and fully enjoy what's currently here has been more than worth my 60 bucks.
---
Nice screenshot art
---
You could favorite one but not when it’s in your stash 
---
Pretty sure they did fix it to where it is right now. It was being abused so they made it where the whole team gets flagged now.
---
You shouldn't be allowed to add benefits to your team by sharing perks and then not expect to to be magically protected because you are in passive mode.
---
If you play on a team with people who go around shooting other people then you have to accept the consequences of being on their team.
---
Is this another Dev room item?
---
I have been running a couple of the normal QOL mods (perk loadout manager, chat, better inventory) that are all relatively safe and are amazing.
---
To be completely honest with you, if we were not allowed to use these I dont think I would want to play the game anymore they are that good.
---
Really these are the sort of thing that should be properly put into the base game and there is no reason not to have mods but that's just the way it is at the moment.
---
I got disconnected from a queen fight about 5min ago, after killing a legendary that it wouldn't let me loot.
---
For some rteason I can never loot anything during queen fights until it's over. The progress wheel just spins and spins when I cursor over a dead enemy.
---
Patrolling Appalachia almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter.
---
And unscrappable. 
---
If there was a non-legendary server - maybe even with hard mode - i'd never play vanilla again.
---
As it is now i can spam invites to everyone in the nuke zone and they're just like "why bother i can do it all faster and more selfishly solo."
---
Someone might be able to correct me, but I’m pretty sure the only supply drops that have locks on them are the ones from the Enclave that include nuclear key cards. You shouldn’t become wanted from picking it, even if you aren’t the one who requested the drop.
---
Next I must find an underwater site.
---
Aquaboy is a must.
---
Awesome, I'm glad you finally see that the scenario being discussed is PvP.
---
So what's that toon's name?
---
Atom store paints add an icon, although this doesnt work most of the time :/
---
Im 25 and still need way to much healing to live without it i think but that is a player and playstyle situation.  My weapons are not one shot and way to many packs chase me. And currently out of 308 so shotgun survival for now
---
It’s multiplayer fallout.  I don’t enjoy it as much as 3 or 4 when playing solo but being able to run around the wasteland with a buddy makes it worth every cent of the $40 I spent on it.   Right now I’m about 80 hours into it and that’s about 50cents an hour.  Good deal.
---
I just cringe at the TSE circlejerkers in-game and in the marketplace. I swear every time I team up with a stranger the first stupid shit thing they say is on the lines of "Ah I gotta go grab some ammo for my Two-Shot Explosive Handmade right quick." or my personal favorite when a random is trying to provoke you in to PVP: "Fight me boi you won't do it you won't do it." Then sprays the ground with that familiar sound of their TSE weapon they paid $5 for.
---
I never disconnect unless I take a workshop. Even then it’s about 50/50. If I don’t take a workshop disconnects are very few and far between. 
---
Oh man it's a named mega sloth, bet he has cool loot. 
---
Fair enough, not saying move, but go take a look, I bet you might reconsider ..
---
O i use all of them as well but this one is different man its the main file of the mod is a .DLL.
---
Preston Garvey's great-great-granddaddy.
---
I think they have to be three stars for it to count.  I got this unlocked earlier and thats what worked for me.
---
i think its more the necessary destruction of a house someone worked hard on, and having a very low level player with no way in hell to defend themselves. This is not rust lol, and with god tier weapons its not even fun pvp its just walking around looking at things and watching them die
---
Want to organize workshop PVP with me? We could maybe even start at level 5. I got a message group going with a handful of names.
---
Why are you so defensive?
---
Check my post history, I'm not some frothing 76 hater.
---
I don't like the way they handled ONE item in the game and that makes me a bumbling fuckwit?
---
Can confirm. I kept spawning in my foundation so I moved the camp a few times until respawn worked.
---
Yah you're just a dick.
---
Nope their behavior is griefing but not pvp. 
---
I run several mods that I consider QoL or stuff that should be in the game. I would be a bit hesitant to use this since is uses a dll though and not just a ba2 archive fix. Not that I don't trust it (source is provided) but that I am worried Beth might look on it as ban-able since it's external code.
---
Sorry not everyone wants to deal with 30 different launchers for games and doesn't want to spend  more than 300$ just to play games.
---
Don't group with people who want to PvP, how hard is that? Answer: not at all. 
---
Lets say we remove legendary items. On day 5, when I am done with quests, have all the max armor and weapons, what are players supposed to do? Do F76 should just say:"Hey, congrats you finished the F76" and then roll credits. No place I go or event I do, can reward me a thing that I find rewarding, because I already have the max gear. And PVP for sure aint keeping anyone, because there aint any PVP.
---
Quest and events that give legendary items are garbage, but those events are last line of defense, that is trying to desperately keep players from leaving.
---
That's where the pacifist mode and collars come into play
---
will def check it out thks.
---
Good question that i didnt really think of... proving it would be subjective but i think im gonna give it a go. I also have several melee perks equipped at the moment, gotta try changing them to shotty perks maybe.
---
And you are one of them dupers.
---
Ironically the explosive mini gun was most likely duped. 
---
That sounds fun
---
Yea I stopped using them as soon as I saved Atoms and bought the different floor types, to enhance my rooms build.
---
Expected beer hat and was not disappointed.
---
Also the tin foil hat is pretty cool
---
Whats in it for me? PvP battles, raider roleplay, fun, cap gambling, junk, funny situations on the mic, fair fights, unfair fights, fights that attract other fights and turn into big fights, getting better at pvp, winning, losing &amp; teabagging.
---
They originally said there were no plans for dog companions in the game and said they might look into it in the future.
---
They should definitely expand on the animal friend pet aspect now that it's all anyone seems to talk about. Even simple cosmetic pets that can't die and just follow you around would be a decent enough gimmick to entice people.
---
But the dupers!
---
And you're right back to saying PvP is griefing.
---
Did you find your toon's name yet?
---
but it is 2x budget and space ...
---
Perfect I will look into this!    Do they have an API we can pull against or are you having to investigate this via PC looking into the code?  API calls would be so nice!
---
Thanks for the atomic shop info too.  I will look at both links tonight :) 
---
Oh dam, I havent actually looked at the mod yet. I have not touched anything that messes with the actual game files....
---
They kinda of already can in a way, since team mates can fast travel to your location for free. 
---
I've been thinking about joining these posts and go camp in the barn or the bunker after tapping the queen like once each time lol 
---
Nothing more than highwaymen and bandits pretending to operate for a noble cause. 
---
Thank you :)  --Dudette  LOL!
---
Indeed, people are arguing the PvP is griefing, but that doesn't make them right.
---
No, they don't.  You also can't activate more than one at a time; last one consumed wins. 
---
It was spread around before people seemed to mostly know how, but how to watch for it. They said look for three people together near any game stash(which is almost anywhere you level together. Im not attacked all the time but it has happened twice.
---
You can do this.  Just fast travel to a location and your team can spawn on you and it unlocks for them if they havent been there yet.  I think the other idea ruins the sense of wonder and exploration the game is trying to give players.
---
Dupers are cheating trash and deserve every drop of hate that goes their way. 
---
I got lucky with the plan early on so I can make them at will. I might start crafting &amp; scrapping some so I can get some more mods for mine. It’s not legendary but it does pack a punch. One advantage to it that I’ve just noticed is it weighs half of what my recon rifle does. 
---
I started crashing to desktop in nuke zones now and I'm also getting that wierd loading screen as well
---
His logic is a bit f-ed up. If you were a duper, then what would leveling the base do? You could just walk over to your C.A.M.P. and rebuild the whole thing in 2 seconds with the 10K of each material you'd have. So either he was pretty stupid in his logic or just using that as an excuse to troll and be a dick.
---
He sounds like a dirty pervert to me me. He killed you and got wood. 
---
Yeah its why i really want to know. Brain you have no idea how much i want this mod lol. I use alot of mods  already but this one would be the cherry on the icecream for me. :)
---
These people are bad people in real life though.
---
You act as if everything can be fixed at once. If you had any sort of basic knowledge of how these things work, you'd know why the term "fix one thing, break 2 other things," is so common.
---
They apply fixes as they can get them and verify them. They need to get in-game for most of these and attempt to reproduce them. Not everything can be magically bandaged.
---
I suggest actually reading the patch notes to see what was fixed, instead of incessantly bitching about bobby pin weight.
---
I've actually stopped play until this duping shit dies down. That and until we get a proper endgame.
---
I begin to suspect your English level now. Pvp is not griefing. Griefing is not pvp either. 
---
I've heard a couple theories that the DCs are due to legendaries...
---
I spend all my time in power armor so I changed all my regular armor to ultra light instead of pocketed.
---
The semi auto and auto non charging barrels work well for an energy weapon.  The only really practical use for them is tagging mobs in someplace like whitespring though, the damage is lackluster even though it should be decent according to the numbers.
---
You are welcome!  I make spreadsheets in every RPG type game I play because "I CANT EVEN" and want to make sure I know what is out there to want and find.  I learn so much like about the prime receivers and scope options.  Helps to understand the weapons when I can see a list out of the games action.
---
I’m no wise one but looks for military amp bags 
---
Same here. I'm hoping the game's story will be updated in seasonal chapters that move it ahead and one will focus on something like MODUS trying to take over with all the robot patrols I've been building him.
---
Military ammo bags 
---
True, but it would be neat to be able to see everywhere they've been at once, without having to coordinate. Also, why not make it possible to fast travel to a place you've never been, under the idea that your team mate marked it and told you the way? In my mind, that's more reasonable than fast travel to an event at a location you haven't discovered yet.
---
Not that I have seen yet. However, according to one of the users here, all you need is max level Animal Friend (Not necessarily WW), which would in theory suggest you could tame with only 3 charisma. However, I have not seen any proof of this theory yet. If you end up trying it, let me know!
---
Thats odd.. I put a Christmas tree up in my buddy's house around a few weeks ago and it's still there. I also built him a racecar bed a while ago and he still has it too.
---
Can somebody verify that this is legit? The fact that it doesnt go in Data folder and no need to add in cutom ini is a bit alarming for me
---
Yeah I just wonder about the caves and such because I see alot of people who build in a cave and when they spawn in they glitch into the ground or are stuck when joining a server.
---
Betray and be betrayed. Olivia deserved that fate, imo.
---
Just stop being a hoarder. 
---
On a social level this is very curious.  This is the EXACT reason that vigilantism is illegal as fuck.  But that is basically what is going on in the game here.  Groups of players are taking a kind of justice into their own hands, and of course not caring if they get the wrong guys or not.    
---
In places where the law is weak and cops can't do their job this kind of stuff happens all the time with many innocents killed. 
---
Funny thing is, shit just started happening this week after all of these fake ass vigilantes got the guns they have from dupers.
---
Where abouts did you make it in the end? I went up into the mountains myself be surprised if anyone finds me lol proberly like yourself lol.

Insane asylum has announced bags all over. Like 4 or 5 so you can farm there

Then you get less effective adhesive.

You've advanced the questline for your character up to 'Officer on Deck', right? Enclave events only appear for you once the Enclave bunker quests are nearly finished.

If she was fresh out of the vault, how did she build a camp?

Military locations. Ammo bags, and military grade duct tape.

It's not me who thinks bobby pin weight reduction was the answer to all out problems. It was the people rejoicing over it. And I suggest you STFU and listen to what people are incessantly bitching about instead of being a braindread fanboy.
---
White knight rank 3 only use 1 ballistic fiber to repair armor 
---
Pretty sure it can only be obtained through the dev room, and supposedly items that are only in the dev room are getting wiped from players' inventories. I wouldn't risk buying it even if you see someone selling it.
---
Good to know, thanks for posting.  I'm kind of bummed that I apparently missed my shot at the Blackbird paint because I didn't check the store when it was there. 
---
I’m in the middle of the quest and didn’t know this stuff either. I just assumed if a weapon or armor gave you any sort of bonus it would list it on the item itself. Not sure why you’re getting such a hard time here. 
---
Isn't this called "Bank alt" and done in almost every single other MMO? .....
---
Whatever you want to tell yourself. 
---
I play escape from tarkov in addition to fallout 76. Tarkov: way better graphics, gameplay, animations. However it's way to intense.. I cant just relax and play. Fallout is super chill and I like that, something I can relax and play. I'll still play both but 76 is my go to chill out game. I also want to point out the original fallouts were like this too (minus the water chip timer) you just wonder around casually exploring shit and finding weird stories/secrets/encounters
---
I think that those of us who trend to play solo might appreciate the option of sharing locations with the ability to fast travel there for caps without having to piggyback on others.
---
'Dear Bethesda' is kind of like flagging your post 'Important' what's this ain't
---
Don't worry about it, you won't get banned for having it in your inventory, Bethesda knows that some people have acquired these from other players. Previously people were able to get hold of Fasnacht Masks and after the latest update the masks were simply removed from both the inventories and stashes. If Bethesda doesn't want these items to be carried by players they will do so again.
---
1) It's kind of hard to say since I'm relatively carefree with games - I can make the best of a bad situation or ignore a problem entirely if it's not in my face. I like having customization and replayability. I absolutely love hoarding and collecting things. I like being able to publicly display my achievements - it's probably one of my biggest pulls to the call of duty franchise, the fact that I can show off my gold/chrome/whatever camo the game has, or a calling card to show that I've gotten a nuke. I don't like PVP aspects that are forced into a game that doesn't revolve around it - this game does it well enough that I'm fine with the pvp being there. I also don't like in your face microtransactions - for this game, I'm rather on the fence about it. I'm glad they are cosmetic only, but I feel like the systems and practices they have in place in the atom shop don't belong in a game that's not free to play to begin with. Skins costing upwards of $10 and even $15, limited time items, cosmetics for individual weapons, etc.
---
2) I might be a bit of an exception because I don't really have a specific criteria for it - I just don't like games that are pushed in my face by people, but sometimes if I get a recommendation from a friend or just want to try it by myself I'll do that anyway. As of now I'm definitely not touching fortnite, PUBG, R6S, and pretty much every other major release. I also play only on PC, so many of the big name games aren't even really available to me. The only big names I play are CS:GO, Call of Duty, Dark Souls, Fallout, and Warframe.
---
3) Not a fan of MOBAs or battle royales. I like shooters, but not if they are overly competitive. I like being able to play by myself and just have fun without needing to always have a team of competent friends to join me. I'm not particularly opposed to puzzle or story-driven adventures, but I just don't enjoy most of them. I actually like adventure, platformer, etc kinds of games, but again I just don't find too many that I like. For these last three categories I generally just watch playthroughs instead of getting them for myself
---
3B) Never played or watched mass effect, but from what I can understand, the community consensus is that after the second or third game, the series massively dropped out. I love fallout though - I got introduced to F1/F2 before 3 even came out. I played through all of them, but probably had the most fun in NV and least fun in tactics. 
---
4) Heard of Thomas was Alone and Celeste, but never cared much about either or even watched anybody play them. I'm not generally drawn to games like that. I don't necessarily think they're bad, they just don't interest me
---
5) I don't really follow any of the youtubers that have been involved in the drama on this sub. The closest I watch to "gaming news" is boogie or pewdiepie. The other gaming-related channels I follow are more for their personality than for the topics they cover, but I do have a select few like lobosjr for both the personality and games he plays
---
6) Not really. I used to have some friends I played CS:GO with on a regular basis, but they stopped being active a few years ago. I also do have some friends that I play warframe or dark souls with, but they don't play too often. For the most part I do everything alone or with a group of random people I get matched up with
---
7) Center the focus of game production back to the passion of making a product. Before gaming became so big and mainstream, you'd see the coolest projects out there. Many of those projects, including fallout 1, are what made some of these big names today what they are. Nowadays it feels like these companies are betraying trust and making so many shitty decisions just to please investors or corporate heads who are laughably out of touch with their audience
---
8) Overwhelmingly positive imo. I've played for around 200 hours now and love the game. I have certainly had some frustrations with mechanics and disconnects/crashes, but it was never really bad enough to ruin my day or whatever. I do admit that my experience is probably better than most because A) I seem to not have had nearly as many issues as others do, B) this kind of sandbox game that some people would call unfinished or lacking is exactly what I've wanted from the series for a while now, so I'm definitely biased, and C) like I said before, I can easily just work around issues or accept them in some way, I guess I have a much higher than average tolerance to annoyance like that
---
I'm on 9/10 Commendations, so I am past the point they should start showing up.
---
Have you tried posting on r/fo76FilthyCasuals? There's tons of people who want/need help with a specific quest or just want to game with someone occasionally
---
no. i love the game, but less and less every day. stay away.
---
I'm using it and it works for me.
---
Do you have an addiction? Take and adictol to clear it
---
The secret is to only craft new armor, until you can get all three ranks of white knight, then repairing only requires 1. Places like fort defiance and camp mcclintock gives lots of fiber, and soon you’ll find yourself dumping it on the ground 
---
Game isn't like that at all. Heck, I've went days without seeing people.
---
I love the game because I can play it grouped up with friends.
---
I think primarily because exploration is a huge part of the game. They do have the ability in many ways for example the prospectors map that will randomly mark a location.
---
But once again I doubt it would be considered since you could essentially discover the entire map with little effort.
---
If you climb Ranger lookout towers it will also mark new locations because the game design is built around the spoke and hub concept from my observation.
---
I second this. Never had a problem with ballistic fiber since getting this weeks ago, now my fibers stay in the 40-60 range constantly.
---
I like to be a bit courteous with my writings to a hard working dev team and they have an official input system on their website for more important items like bugs and exploits, that you may report directly. :)
---
My handle online is flooping_pig, while playing solo I like sheparding people through Cranberry Bog and putting on Santa PA to leave goodie bags at people's houses. We can also run silos and force spawn the golf club. If you want we can do events or just wander around and protect the other person while they read journal and terminal entries
---
What a great community
---
I made it near the middle to bottom of the mountain a few minutes walk away from the boundaries I took a screen shot of my location it in the images. 
---
I have found only 3 basses Including my own in the mountains so far a lot of people just fast travel everywhere and miss the things in between.
---
Mikegarr16 level 122 but always up for helping someone out.

Last night had a lvl76 guy come up to my camp, I'm 70, and proceed to melee me with his miner gauntlet.  Just for fun. He wasn't even hitting me half the time and all of a sudden I'm dead without retaliation.  My friend had just spawned in and he proceeds to do the same to him.  We follow him back to his camp to find him with approximately 50 turrets.  Fucking little shit still antagonized us and we proceeded to kill him 5 times before he finally left the server.
---
Naughty naughty
---
I do not remember calling anyone a bumbling fuckwit. As for it just being one item? I suppose it was too conspicuous. Dedicated questline, numerous journal entries, multiple related items in the set... you, uh, missed a big one. How should the Eye have been handled? What could have been done differently to improve the user experience?
---
Fort McClintock and Fort Defiance. You can find plenty of military ammo bags and military duct tape there to get 10-12 ballistic fibers every run
---
Hey brother, anywhere with a military feel to the area usually has some but here is a playlist I made with some pretty common spots.  The first three are out with 6 more dropping over the next couple days.  Hope this helps and stay safe in the wastes!
---

---
So cheats are good because artificial difficulty and you don't think you should shame / degrade cheaters.
---
Well i'm a huge Soulsborne fan too and you're playing it wrong this duping happened in DS1 too. Duped characters destroyed the divine blessing economy and also there was no one fun to invade except for noobs or boring duelists.
---
Too many HP? You're meant to team up instead of just swap to your TSE. Nowadays i can spam team invites to everyone in a nuke zone and why would they bother to accept? The real complaint issue here is that melee is OP - nothing survives 4p swinging sledge's.
---
Carrying also deserves to be made fun of because it's the same as watching a stream.
---
This may not help, but since the patch on PC the fast travel mat seems to be broken - it keeps spawning me a level below or into the floor of the workshop.  
---
I have a cliffside base and moving the CAMP unit right to the back of the camp sphere does help a lot.  
---
I found mine on some dead tubers on the little river outside of Vault 76 on day one, it was my steady hat for awhile.
---
Thanks, I think it actually improved stability for me!
---
Does anybody have a link to a resource that lays out the damage difference between say Executioner, and Bloodied (with various states of health value)?  That's the only part I'm cloudy on as far as which is better there. 
---
Furious seems to not be worth it really if the damage only goes like 50% additional at a maximum.  I suppose you could stack that with adrenaline perk, but seems like either executions or bloodied would be better with that anyway over say instigating or furious. 
---
For anyone who isn't aware, while using that many mutations, be sure to get Class Freak and Starched Genes under luck. The former repressed negative mutation effects while the latter ensures you keep your mutations while using radaway.
---
Yer so kool
---
Thanks. So looking at the image, the plan with icon means you haven't read it? 
---
I could list every single perk I use, and which I'm referring to, but yes, all 39 points I'm claiming have some hold in my Heavy Weapons build. I counted. 
---
I believe it also wasn't counting the 5 Points used for Mutations, either, since Mutations are a necessity for an effective Tank Build.
---
I had a legendary gauss rifle just disappear.  Logged in for the first time in about a week today and it's no where to be found.
---
Some people on the forums over in Nexus say Bethesda might have a problem with it, I'll update this if something happens.
---
Lvl 54 but only play with 18 and older.  If that's you msg me your info.  Also must have a mic.
---
And unsellable.
---
Ya, what about my one sentence post makes me "overly eager to blame the game."
---
Dude is white knighting me when I thoroughly enjoy and actively play the game. No other item I am aware of has hidden bonuses like this.
---
Of course I've noticed the comment on the Eye of Ra, but why would that make me assume that it is anything more than flavor text?
---
There is a ghoul/super mutant/ liberator spawn point at that hanger right outside. But just east up the hill from there are three cabins, one of which spawns super mutants. You can camp up in either of the other two and have invincible walls.
---
I camped there for quite a while. The middle cabin is best as its two story and has a wrap around porch. And the defense fences can fit inside the doors so enemies can't wander in. Great for saving resources.
---
Don’t pay full price. Some places have it as low as $35. If you get it for that, it’s plenty worthwhile to play
---
Love this quest though it is pretty damn depressing. I mean all of the game is truthfully, but this one in particular makes me just all little extra sad and a little extra mad (at the daughter). No idea why.
---
Amen
---
Do the event Line in the Sand at Fort Defiance.  It only begins when you get there it isnt on the map.  Even if you fail the quest, two scorchbeasts show up which should get you the commendations.
---
Yeah, what the hell Bethesda.
---
Oh man, if youre right about this your a MVP. Ive stayed in a server well over the cooldown time and it would never spawn, assuming someone didnt complete it while I wasnt periodically checking
---
You're welcome to join me whenever I'm playing, level 63 but just taking my time and exploring. PSN Bibliophile999 - West Coast Usa time zone, but I generally play late at night.
---
Slap damage is bs too. I've almost been killed by it, because some people have weapons that still do ridiculous damage even at that state.
---
#Marriage
---
Wedding Band Plan: *consumable, crafted at armor workbench*. Allows player to combine CAMP budgets into one central CAMP. 166% added budget and CAMP zone diameter. 
---
If both characters are not online a default bachelors pad will spawn. 
---
Wedding bands must be consumed by both players within the CAMP location. 
---
Moving the CAMP results in a DIVORCE.
---
Yup that's absolutely true. But most people play the game alone, I guess you can randomly add someone in the server if you're doing nuke or queen run but it is bit rude adding them just for that.
---
Are you online right now?
---
The ones with the icons are ones you have read. If you find one on the floor you will have to pick it up and drop it to get the icon to show if you had read it. Also applies to ones that are already in your inventory.
---
😂 here, have an upvote.
---
Fair warning, Aquaboy does not protect from waterborne diseases. 
---
Side note, one of my favorite side activities is to find people's camps on the side of ponds, wait for them to show up, and then pop my head out of the water and ask "Whatcha doin' in my waters?". More often then not, people don't understand the reference and shoot me, but it's totally worth it.
---
The way the recipe system is designed in Fallout to make the water interchangeable would require 2 recipes for every water based food and craft in the game. A good way around that would be to make Purified Water scrappable into Boiled Water. That would solve a few problems in the crafting system.
---
Yes, it is worth buying.    No, the servers are not yet stable.   But it is fun.  
---
**Communism is the very definition of failure**
---
Don’t listen to TedBacon. 
---
The game has its flaws, but it’s a lot of fun. However, don’t get the game expecting a single-player experience. The only NPCs in the game are hostile. Human players may or may not be friendly. There are still a lot of bugs, and the game does frequently crash and disconnect you from the servers. Sometimes, you’ll lose progress and items you’ve looted.
---
I’ve been playing since launch on PC, and honestly? Getting past all the annoying stuff, the game is still worth playing. Especially fun when you pick up bartering, and start selling rarer items to other players on Reddit. It’s a fun end-game; looting and selling. 
---
Yeah, that's odd then. They ought to appear at the start of that quest.
---
I read reports bethesda is going to start giving items unique ID# to stop people from using duped items.  Dont know if this is true tho.
---
The game has many bugs, crashes, server issues, there are parts of it I really dislike and will probably quit before long. I paid full price for it and I don't regret it. I love so much about the game. And if you like this kind of game you will love it. There are so many things done right in the game, but also so many things done wrong. You won't notice many of the things done wrong until you get further into the game. There are a lot of cool armors, weapons, perks, character building is awesome, lots of clothing and outfits if you like that, base building is excellent, workshops are excellent though have a few issues. It's a good game that could be really great. It could be so much better and maybe one day it will be.
---
Hell no, there are two end game things in this game, farm white springs... which they already nerfed, or the queen. And you want to take that away too, what on earth will we do. 
---
&gt; perimeter is smeared and irritating.
---
It's like Khajiit night vision.
---
Yes, it's from the dev room, you can however learn a plan for it by scrapping one.
---
It’s a well designed look, so happy it’s not your typical wife beater wearing hard hat modded baseball one 
---
Can someone explain why they aren't skeletons?  Did we seriously exit the vault 3 weeks after everyone died?
---
Honestly, I think I would rather see non-destructable structures. Even if it costs a lot more to make them, it'd be better than wasting my own resources and materials to fix a structure that's been destroyed by some Griefers getting uppity.
---
The only time I've seen anyone's base get destroyed by Mobs in the game are when people have shitty layouts and no defenses. Even the odd glitched Liberator or Mole Rat that'll spawn inside doesn't do too much damage. 
---
I mean... A level 120 came in my nuke silo after I did most of the work and was made that I used the nuke which was rude. This said, if you communicate with the player about something, it should be fine. If they communicated about the nuke, i would have listened but whatever
---
I have built in a few and never encountered this. I did have a normal house that would eat me occasionally when logging in. If just fast travel back to my camp to get out of the walls. 
---
Have you dropped the nuke yet
---
Here's a picture I've submitted to the wiki:

---
So pessimistic. There will, of course, be an official version in a mod store for $4.99 in atoms by the end of the year.
---
When you play on a team, your team mates can build at your CAMP using their own materials.
---
Same with me, I haven't been banned for my mods an don't know why people keep insisting it's because of that.
---
I bet I’m not the only one. 
---
Fallout has never been exploration game. Up till F76, Fallout has been RPG game, what rounds around building character, defining what you are inside the game and playing that role. NMS is exploration game, where you fly around and watch some pixel animals. Fallout has been all about doing quest, getting gear, getting stronger and beating your enemies.   
---
How about adding text to the garb stating its effect like literally every other item in the game.
---
Also, why should I be expected to read and listen to every entry in the game? I'm sure that is something on look y a minority of players actually do. Beyond that, those entrys don't say anything to the effect of the garb having a hidden legendary effect.
---
I finished this quest line this morning. Such a good story. 
---
Like the little BoS camps? :3
---
You travel the wasteland with an inventory of melee weapons with Martial Artist equipped at all times for weight reduction of a golf club in case it has furious?
---
Part of the game is decision making. Stimpaks were used as one example because it's an obvious trade - do you want 3 points of damage or do you want Traveling Pharmacy? Is handing stimpaks out to new players worth it to them or teaching a bad habit later? Why not just farm the recipe and give that to them?
---
I don't have any trouble keeping a full set of unyielding heavy combat, a set of Assassin's gear, a WIP sentinel set, 3 suits of power armor, 4 rifles, and 3 big guns in my stash along with everything I need to craft. And the !@#$ rifles weigh 20 Bethesda units each with **no weight reduction perk** available.
---
I swear they are attracted to headlamps.
---
It would be better if they'd just release the files on things like this so it could be picked apart and cataloged into the wikis
---
Cheers also does it offer any protection?
---
The terminals that are supposed to unlock locked doors within Morgantown airport do not function at all. Even after a successful hack the doors remain closed. 
---
There is a way to set them up so they work correctly, someone on discord explained it to me once but I have since forgotten.  The problem was when you fast travelled away everything broke again so when you go back traps would immediately go off so....they are broken.
---
It's definitely worth getting. Especially since the DLC are coming soon.
---
Getting commendations is not the part I'm concerned about, this glitch has gone on for three days, I'm concerned about never being able to do enclave events on a character.
---
I dont know about you but when I got my hands on a TSE by trading a duper for it I was ecstatic.  Main character is 237 levels in now and I still have yet to see a single TSE drop for me; it's soul crushing so when I got my weapon I absolutely didn't feel a ruin of reward, quit the opposite, I felt a sense of reward. 
---
Granted I'll be happy once Bethesda does fully manage to squash all that to see if we get a more stable game to enjoy, but sorry to say I still see value in the being around to make the exotic stuff attainable by plebs like myself. 
---
Times are rough, you gotta pay the bills. Best I can do for my kid is boiled glue
---
I got one of these before, I never even got loot. Just the endless rotation 
---
Last night we killed the queen. Spinning loot circle everyone's standing around aaaaaaand poof the bodies gone.  Checked for meat piles and everything.. no one got anything except wasted ammo lol

I'd like to organize workshop PVP on PS4, Dark Souls style anti-teams, Man Hunts, and RP each location. Would be fun to do workshop PVP @ level 5.
---
Working on it, by trading and giving stuff to friends. Wanna buy some gear? But seriously, other similar games have some sort of vault to share between characters. I don't think that's an unreasonable request.
---
Yes, however only if you over repair it, so I assume it's just a bug.
---
Not a bug
---
If you're too fat to travel you can only respawn at the nearest location
---
Makes sense, as you can't FT when encumbered
---
That guy was also the same kid they turned away soon after the bombs dropped.
---
Its a lot less common than you hear. I have over 210ish hours on this game, and have never once had this happen to me and have MAYBE run into 5-10ish people who were even slightly  jerks. For all the bad stories you hear, theres WAY more good stories of someone using a stim to res you instead of letting you die to steal your shit. People just dont post the good stuff too often, but when something "bad" happens people will post about it. Visibility does not equal common occurrence. 
---
I want one of those trailer homes. Or better yet, a truck with trailer so you can build inside. 
---
my CAMP is on a cliff, and sadly just about everything I tame will go to my camp than randomly teleport to the base of the cliff (outside my green area) and just stand there. it's really annoying as when I first heard taming was a thing I put a lot of time into trying to get one I wanted, only for them to glitch every time. 
---
I'd hope Bethesda learns something from these mods, its what everyone has been asking for.
---
No kitty that is MY pot pie.
---
Don't know. That's why I posted. Bought one of a dude in watoga last night 
---
Just a heads up. You can daisy chain your generators together so you only have one cable going to the connection on the wall. Could clean up the spider web if that bothers you. 
---
Level 49, usaf_idmt

Also double thirst? (like vegetable soups). Thank you for the response!

Are you hooking the power straight to the traps?  You need a wire from the tripwire to the trap.  Same with switches.
---
I’m just upset with legendary enemies not dropping any legendary gear sometimes. Just spent 30 minutes in anime’s whitesprinns and killed 6-7 legendary bloated glowing ones with only one dropping a nocturnal cane...
---
There is literally no other locaton available and there are plenty of other locations closer as well as a team member that no longer shows,so k dont think the "closest location" is what's going on here
---
This thing is a Godsend!

Dropping

Now where is the fun in picking on someone that can fight back?
---
Dude that's incredible. I don't even have a slick of this type of visionary talent! 
---
Use the fabricator and make a new one
---
Hm, it's always been closest for me when I'm OC
---
Maybe there is an issue with the fissure site then
---
You have no option to fast travel to other players when OC too, I figured that out very recently after puzzling out why I couldn't travel to someone in my group, lol
---
I earned them all, nuka cola modded, ultrascite, xo1-modded w/ flames, and excavator. I usually farm wearing excavator and carry xo1 to wear in events and nuke zones. **Except xo1 flame I am unable to tell them apart while stored on chasis (lighter weight). If i could find more plans to mod pa i would care which were labeled. Bethesda needs to fix other more urgent problems like the hideous pa body glitch or the hat big bald head glitch. Naked butt gouls need pannies, god damnit fo76 is weird**
---
Yea it just happens in this game. Everyone I have met has been cool for the most part. One dude tho did this to me stood around while I was doing stuff in my camp. Was there for about 10 minutes. 
---
He offered me one of those shotguns with explosive shells and personally I want to get everything myself. Not handed to me in a trade. After I declined the trade he just started leveling my camp. It’s funny cause instead of standing around watching I went claimed a few workshops came back and rebuilt my camp once he left. 
---
I don’t really get the point or why you would do that. 
---
I see people post on this forum about the cave issues but then again I've never built in a cave myself so I can't be certain.
---
While I am still mystified by the lack of NPC's, I feel that they have done an amazing job with the in game stories. There is so much detail and emotion,like this, embedded throughout the game
---
Your entire demeanor has been that I'm an idiot who can't pick up on contextual clues.
---
If I had encountered literally anything else that behaved this way, MAYBE I could be expected to watch out for it. 
---
You have been extremely condescending and hostile here. I understand that we are all overly sensitive to criticism due to all the bullshit, but come on guy.
---
Are you smashing all the idiots who build on the Whitesprings too?
---
Lame.  Camp building and making outfits is my favorite parts of the game.  then dressing up weird and going out scavenging for plans i dont have and stuff i need to make them.
---
My team and I often welcome low levels to come with us for experience.  So they die a few times when some fights are too much.  No biggie.  Its like having people show you around and we enjoy doing that.  
---
So a low level player at a nice Camp with several other high level players doesn't mean anything about duping.  Its about rebuilding West Virginia and helping the few other people in it!  :)
---
You on XBOX?  we play on xbox...got a good crew from all over the US.
---
That sounds right, but I don't have tripwires yet so I can't be of any help.  I didn't have any issues with my regular switches.
---
That sounds like a ridiculous but possible method that can also slow down the game. Like literally cause it to slow down, we're talking about indexing trillions and trillions of items. Unless they only decide to index the most duped types of items. Like only indexing Nuka Cola and legendary items. 
---
Psn is GTMBros level 106 but love helping new people
---
It wasn't just the Raiders, it was a boy who had lived across the street from them pre-war who, after the bombs, had to scavenge and join the raiders as Shannon wouldn't allow any boys to stay with her, especially as the two children had a crush on each other when they were younger.
---
Thank you God!
---
Or one of his allies...
---
I was thinking of doing that with my current PS4 and a PS4 Pro, but they didn't drop the price enough to make it worth the small upgrade.
---
you can't.  BGS lol
---
Now if we could only fill it with the many varieties of brew that we find. Steady your rifle and sip your beer, no hands needed.
---
Aight, I'll give it a try.
---
It’s all part of the game my friend.
---
That's true, and the scenario being discussed is PvP, not griefing.
---
I just got this bug after mutation farming, did you ever find a fix please?
---
I just buy them from vendors, when you have excess caps ofc.
---
There is none I'm just saying that nerfing the TSE weapons across the board would kill it for people who just play the game. In PVP servers (if it ends up going that way) it needs to either be banned or nerfed but for PVE it isn't necessary. Maybe pacifist just needs to actually 0 the damage instead of letting some through. Or stop the stacking of explosive bobbleheads. 
---
I'm rp in game as enclave officer. 
---
I'm using only plasma weapons, and wearing only scout armor/X-01 PA.
---
 I'm attacking anyone, who came near by my taken workshop
---
Also trying to fight anyone who is wearing BOS  themed things(Painted PA, scribes uniform, etc).
---
Everytime I see enclave event - I'm trying to complete it.
---
There is no npc, so I'm trying to be one :""""D
---
You can’t. If you scrap or drop it, it’s gone. 
---
Sure, harrassment, part of the game. Keep telling yourself that.
---
They fought because olivia is a self entitled cunt. That's about it 
---
Uh, no, because I actually enjoy the game and want others to as well.
---
ya, this is wild conjecture by OP
---
Annoyingly they HAD the welcome mat in BETA which worked like in FO4 and let you do exactly this. Then they removed it!
---
That's odd, because my melee character that I use has been over encumbered from day one and I've always been able to at least spawn at my friend, I just can't actually fast travel. 
---
This just started for me last night which is why its so confusing
---
Damn, that's really annoying. They definitely travel outside the green area often. Tina (my Deathclaw) goes up to the doorway of Charlston Station (which my CAMP is near) and scares the shit out of patrons. 
---
Similarly, Gregory (my Mirelurk Hunter) would glitch into the foundation of my house and I would have to remove walls to get him out. 
---
It's all part of this game still being buggy. Sadly, this will probably be one of the later things to get fixed. But hopefully with more stabilization progress, teleporting etc will go away. 
---
Coming from XB1, honestly 100% of the time the game is usually a &lt; 15 fps chaos fest.  I honestly can't say I've ever seen it be a smooth fight FPS wise, and I'm talking like say 30 fps smooth for us lowly console folk lol. 
---
I've really died out desire to do SBQ runs, it just way too unstable and ultra shitty performance 100% of the time.  I can say that I haven't gotten a lot of crashes/disconnects, got to be less than 5 on at least 25+ runs of her, but the performance has been absolutely terrible all of my runs I've ever done.
---
The worst was when someone put down like 20 turrents in the main player area, the server crashed after finally succumbing to like 10 minutes of event time of &lt; 5 FPS easily.  It was so unplayable, but an absurdly awesome way to troll everybody that went to that event, I still hate whoever did that lol. 
---
I agree. I enjoyed this quest.
---
&gt; Maybe a "welcome" mat, that you can place, and you always spawn on that?
---
They had one in BETA and then deleted it for some reason
---
Probably right beside the video that proves the trade steal glitch.
---
I don’t know about that. My sneaky sniper likes that dress and the Eye of Ra combo. 
---
I think the boxing glove has a ding sound when you hit nicely or something. Maybe thats it?
---
I agree 
---
It’s griefing to most of our eyes. You can have different opinion though. 
---
I maybe don't crash that often, but I do at least once a session. I find that it mostly happens when I get to a legendary weapon, that's when it usually occurs. It's incredibly annoying, and you will find your game crashing in many other instances...it's a problem 
---
You'll need a VPN to activate it but only to activate it, you won't need one to play. There are free VPNs available as browser extensions, you can install one, activate the key on Bethesda's website, then uninstall it. I may or may not have done exactly this when I bought the game myself; if Todd asks, I plead the fifth.
---
But that's exactly why I destroy their camps there, out of consideration to everyone else.
---
If you destroy people's CAMPs, you HAVE no consideration.
---
Lol I cant believe people are actually buying items. There has got to be something wrong in the head of these people. 
---
want so bad... that's badass
---
Here are the ones I found. [https://imgur.com/gallery/fqASGnC](https://imgur.com/gallery/fqASGnC)
---
God no.  You need to earn getting there across a hostile world.  Otherwise let's all start at lvl 100 with a TSE and a 1,000,000 CAPs
---
Yes totally okay, stand back a bit and you can see a person has a responsibility when they have information that's as dangerous as that, all the good intention they may have had are meaningless if it causes even more damage 
---
You can not be the most powerful tank in the game and an assassin as well.
---
Reminds me of a old saying about cake and eating it.
---
Anymore dumb edgy shit?
---
Add me GTMBros I would love to be ur friend
---
I’m not disagreeing with a thing you said. Cheaters are bad, you should team up (which I do when my friends are online), I don’t use melee at all (it is OP), and you shouldn’t ride coat tails. 
---
Shame cheaters to your hearts content. 
---
I gave my thoughts on whether they ruin the experience and for me, no it doesn’t. I purchased my whole TWO guns on the marketplace before this whole duping thing got out of hand because, while I enjoy grinding, I’m older and don’t have the time to do the same repetitive task for a .01% chance at something good. In fact, this game is why I joined reddit. I had the caps, traded honestly, and went on my way. What that seller did is beyond me, since I wasn’t versed in the duping issue at hand.
---
Again, you’re spot on with your statements, but the question was does it impact your enjoyment. For you, it might, but for my team and I? No, it does not. We’re enjoying it now more with our god guns, since we can just hang out and enjoy the sights without the constant back and forth of repairing/gathering (which of course we still do, just not constantly) every session we get on.
---
Hope that clarifies, I’m more on your side than you think. My rant basically wishes that we can all just be ok that people are enjoying the game and whether they choose to make things easier by using TSE guns or not, that as long as they don’t blast others in PVP, blow up someone’s base, or manipulate the game to copy items, let others enjoy the game (difficult or not) in their own way.
---
Hope that clarifies, have a good one!
---
He could have been in our vault. 
---
I surprisingly haven't had many crashes outside of the C.A.M.P. issue. Maybe once every 3 sessions or so? But my time spent playing the game varies too. But since I can't scrap the legendary weapons I took out others like a double barrel and a combat shotgun and it froze up and crashed on me.
---
People are pointing out that by the definition of cheating, muling and stashing is not cheating. Cheating is when you act dishonestly or unfairly to gain an advantage. Muling/stashing is not dishonest or unfair since everyone can do it - there is no magical incantation you have to know in order to access it. And people who do it are upfront about it.
---
Play any real MMO - WoW, Guild Wars 2, Black Desert, Final Fantasy XIV - and you'll find that the majority of players who mule are completely transparent about it, because it's not infringing on the game rules.
---
If Bethesda has a different opinion on this then they will implement safeguards. Until then, nobody has an unfair advantage when everyone can easily do the same thing.
---
Too late...as far as I was aware they can't track items. Which is why they're having so much trouble with dupers.
---
:(
---
I’m also 20, so maybe around that age group as well? 
---
[PC] I can't jog (using AP) when over encumbered, i just walk.   
---
This bug was gained during mutation farming. I've tried toggling the walk/run key, it happens even when 1 lbs overweight (so not the when 4x over your limit thing) and i have 100% AP which does not get used. I also only have 19AP.  
---
it's the same as this thread https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9ynqyb/i_cant_sprint_and_its_driving_me_crazy/  
---
LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE!
---
&gt; The old dupe method doesn't do this, and **contrary to popular belief doesn't cause server instability.**
---
Source?
---
I thought about it recently, but realized it was too late. I just hope there’s enough to do to keep us playing until next year where this could be a possibility 
---
Im not sure what you refer to with that, in context of my replies or this branch of discussion.
---
I think you are referring to healing with radiation. But it wasn't me who complained about needing a lot of stims to deal with the SB.
---
I have been using diluted stims since about level 30 or 40 or whenever I got the perk that makes stims more powerful. With later aquired perks you can craft a lot of them from stims, you can use them far more often because you aren't wasting their healing power as much ect. I only need to use real stims when I need the faster healing rate they give, like when attacked by several powerful melee enemies. SB can't outdamage the healing rate of diluted stims when you also have the other perk making stims and radaway work faster, at least not with my armor pieces, which are quite ordinary.(mostly vanguards)
---
&gt;but the question was does it impact your enjoyment
---
See my name.
---
I felt bad last night when I nuked Mama Dolces and a lower level spawned in with his CAMP nearby. Poor guy was sitting there dead. Must have died before he even fully loaded in. 
---
I hope not as I do this whenever I can. I particularly like putting it in places around flatwoods and train stations 😁
---
I heart you so bad!  LOL  Please play on xbox.  :)  You would fit well with our team of silly folk
---
Also prompt when you try to sell or scrap one of these. I have lost great weapons to glitches in the trade screen because of this.
---
I wouldn't say this game really has an endgame, but there is plenty of stuff to do. While we can't be scorchbeasts, you can try to tame stuff like deathclaws. You can make a sweet crib. You can bounty hunt all day long. You can try to do every quest/event on the map... although some quests are kind of lame and some are just straight up bugged. The challenges are kind of cool since they're like achievements that give you atoms, and you can repeat them.
---
I also have a lot of fun with the photomode since I do photography as a side hobby IRL. I'd love to see a mod that gives us DSLR settings in photomode.
---
Allow me to remind you that the first glimpse we got of the game was a player attacking another player who was on their knees, blowing their brains out. 
---
There are perks that add additional damage to player structures, and weapons that add bonus damage to other players. 
---
Here is the definition of Raiders: 
---
“Raiders, sometimes referred to as bandits, are any group of wastelanders who pillage, plunder, murder, or otherwise ruin the day of anyone unfortunate enough to not be one of them. Raiders tend to organize into loose confederations of gangs in the post-apocalyptic wasteland and are a constant problem. Raiders typically prey upon travelers and very small towns, leaving more populous or larger areas alone.”
---
There’s even a loading screen that said “Repeated unprovoked attacks can cause you to become wanted, allowing anyone to freely attack you.” They knew this stuff was gonna happen. It’s part of the game. 
---
If you don’t like it, you may be wanting to play Fallout: Wasteland Sims Edition. Lmao 
---
Fixed an issue where Fusion Core generators were producing cores at a slower rate than intended. They are now back to 8 cores/hr.
---
Is this about the fusion core processors at power plants?
---
This is what I did. It gets super frustrating at times when you accidentally clear a good mutation trying to fish out a bad one. Around 4-5 mutations is the max I'd ever push my luck doing it random. I got a run of Bird Bones, Herbivore, Electrically Charged, and then Speed Demon. I figured I used all of my luck for the year and just bought Marsupial. 
---
If there is to be an NPC in this game, for the love of God let it be Gary.  And if you kill him, like the Mothman, another one shows up elsewhere with the Vengeful moniker.
---
He has it now but you can’t build them anymore. My friend experienced a bug where he couldn’t place anything I built and he had to dismantle everything in his base basically. So they’re gone forever for him
---
I could craft you one or two if you're on PC.
---
Dupers who have large amounts of unique items cause serverwide lag whenever they trade with another user, or open a barter/ transfer menu.
---
Will this ever happen for counsel? :( 
---
xbox :(  kind of you to offer though, thanks.
---
Hmm. All I'm hearing is "If you can't learn to play like me and like it, you don't deserve to play at all." Rather short-sighted, don't you think?
---
Where your CAMP physically is inside the area determines the fast travel location.
---
It likely does work with Herbivore, which is a really attractive option I didn't think of.
---
I wonder if Sunshine Oil does as well.
---
Ahhhh...Gary
---
I can imagine all the trailer forts now :D
---
most events have a chance to drop plans /s
---
I mean they do, but good luck finding anything but furniture.
---
With both carry weight, stash glitches, and duping completely patched up, and server disconnects and game crashes being even more rampant than it ever has been, I can guarantee that the primary cause of server instability is not due to peoples' inventories. 
---
I don’t even know what to say to this one.
---
I'd just like to see seasons. With chance of freezing to death or dying of heat stroke.
---
If you are in a team, and you equip a strange in numbers perk card, and your teammate disconnects (so still in a team, but number of teammates = 0), then you strange in numbers will ELIMINATE all the positive effects of mutations (by multiplying them by 0) and leave you only with negative effects.  I suspect this is what happened here.
---
Uh, so.... Uh, Bumblebee?
---
That was the name of the city, Flatwoods. Thank you, rofl. That said, it's definitely good to know people are wanting to be helpful. :D Here's hoping the answer definitely is no.
---
Contact Bethesda
---
Yeah, clearly we disagree and that’s fine.  I’m sure there’s other stuff we would agree on.
---
WTF! That's the rarest of the rare enemies, and you had a legendary version? Maybe even 3 stars?! I'm jealous and you're just bored?!?!
---
Why would you even disconnect? Like you couldn't go around him? Where did you even find it?!
---
Last time i found one i spammed the server with team invites just to show it off! You would've only had to spend 100 shells in that case and might've made a friend! STOP BEING SO LITERAL!
---
I'm with you on the XBox boat. Right now, I just got  back from being out all day, and within the first five minutes, my game has already crashed.
---
It literally *only* happens with this game. Even PUBG worked smoothly when it was still a preview. And it's not my internet - I run 200mb/s.
---
Literally just crashed while I'm wandering the Savage Divide to look for a new CAMP place for an idea I had.
---
Two X01 sets seem to be the only choice
---
Dont have strange in numbers.
---
Good to know though
---
 It is. Not my creation, I stole it from another post 
---
Agree, constantly spawning in water under my base. I love my location, but the spawn breaks my heart.
---
what do you expect when some people take video games so seriously? 
---
should see the comments about dupers on this subreddit lol,i dont know how some people take a fucking game so seriously if they dupe let them dupe its bethesdas fault they dupe and about server stability servers are still dogshit on pc so the myth of dupers crash servers is disproven 
---
Something very Meta about a Responder saying "why can't we work together" and a raider "that's the game!"
---
Looks like you both found your right fractions 😂😂😂
---
I'm level 55, and survived on fungus soup and flower teas for at least 40 levels
---
If that’s all you’re hearing then you didn’t read. You’re playing a multiplayer game where this stuff happens. There are a number of things you could’ve done to leave these folks behind. Of course they obliterated you, so it cost you your junk. But that’s just tough luck. At least it ain’t like rust and you still have some of your gear. 
---
It's ridiculously consistent unless you place it on a significantly different elevation.  Once you learn the direction fast travel puts you from the module itself, it never changes, ever.  It will only snap you to a different elevation if it is EXTREMELY close to the landing spot of the fast travel.
---
I am level 216, I do events for plans and nuke, thats about it. Sometimes rebuild my camp. 
---
I'm playing less and less with each day as there is just a huge lack of anything significant to do.
---
I actually like this game. I dont mind the lore coming in the form of Holo tapes. But i am so tired of 0 human NPCs. I'm glad they are adding some
---
Well this just makes me not want to pick the game back up. My husband wants me to level my character(I'm either lvl 16 or 17 lol) so when we get another ps4 I'll be closer-ish in level to him(I think last I seen he was 105-ish? possibly higher) but damn if this doesn't put me off playing. 
---
I'm already iffy about the pvp aspect and people being able to destroy others houses but now they're actively hunting people they suspect of duping? That sounds like a super fun time. 
---
Haha I know, it’s fuckin hilarious...the Responders are too green for the fog!
---
Yeah, it's a hefty fuckin' fee.
---
something something "solo servers can't come fast enough so I don't have to deal with idiots that think/play like this"
---
PS4 if so I’ll give Serums to her 
---
"If you can't learn to play the game as it was intended, maybe you should play a different game."
---
I also smash the shit out of those whitespring camps if the have turrets.
---
Say no more fam
---
Did you look up on how duping effects other players?
---
That would be quite to surprise to come home and find a stranger in his underwear resting his nutsack on the couch you just crafted from scratch...even though it looks like you found it in a dumpster somewhere.  He just looks at you and says “sup”...I know what I’m doing tonight!
---
Good grief this sub is full of terrorists.
---
Oh I have found so many lovely helpful people. They far out way the trolls 😀👍
---
Nice!!!
---
The dupers, the unlimited carry weight is the one the fucks up the servers the most.    
---
I know that you hate them but the blame for server instability lies solely on Bethesda, the glitchers are a convenient scapegoat... with the exception of this new dupe method, it FUCKS everyone.
---
I'll let you know when I'm on!
---
Don't support duping. 
---
Fair enough man, I don’t invade workshops when others have it, and outside of the food factory, none of them seem worthwhile anymore (to me at least). 
---
I never get taken over at Sunshine farms, so it’s an aspect of the game I’ve never worried about.
---
Like I said, though, you trying to take over a workshop and being one shotted with a TSE sucks, sorry. But, I don’t PVP (didn’t in Dark Souls outside of the required amount either) so isn’t an issue i worry about. 
---
I think we will continue to go back and forth, but hopefully we can agree that options on playstyle would be nice to have.
---
Honestly, I really hope that things get balanced where losers like me don’t need legendary weapons, much like FO4 (which on both of my 200+ hour characters, neither had legendaries). 
---
Regardless, best wishes on taking those workshops ;)
---
Damn you’re a fuckin pansy. Here’s a straw. Now suck it up. Lmao 
---
Wrong.
---
Yeah I have all of those. 15 strength, all weight reduction perks, melee, chems, food, armor, heavy weapons, power armor. I have fully modded Excavator - Calibrated Shocks - Motion Assist Servos and a Black Diamond. Still over. I keep stuff for other people, or for myself later. The only option I have is to throw away pretty much my entire inventory or walk with some damage perks, or run/walk with all weight reduction perks equipped. No fast travel. Stash size is too small for a bunch of people. For people who don't just want to throw everything away. It's not fun for me. I know I can reduce my weight a little. I can get rid of some things but it will take a while to figure it out and it will just be the same unless there;'s more stash size. 
---
A lot of people horde in these games. In WoW I have banks full, alt banks full, guild banks full. In Skyrim I have bookshelves full, chests full, one with this item type, one with another type, one with armor, one with weapons, etc. One of each item. In FO76 50 of my storage is already taken by one of each clothing item I have found so far. 
---
Yes it is my fault, but not only my fault also the games fault. I could throw EVERYTHING away, and then Bethesda could lower your carry weight to 100 and your stash to 100. I could say I throw EVERYTHING away, what';s your problem? As you say this isn't suitable for you. We would have a different perspective and playstyle. Just because it's different doesn't mean it works for everyone.
---
Both my guns broke during this mission. I had to beat the last few robots with a machete. 
---
Server lag. 
---
Plus it breaks any kind of economy/market the game has going.
---
They can take your caps too?
---
Kinda?
---
Nah. I just prefer to play the game. Bubbye now, go back to playing with your toys.
---
Fantastic! Have an upfote. 
---
Besides the stability issues, it puts a huge gap between honest players and the rest.  Good luck against a bobblehead guy.
---
people being banned over mods is sensationalist bullshit.
---
they're barely banning people who are blatantly exploiting the game and selling their goods for real money. they aren't banning anyone over item icons.
---
Blue ridge mountain?
---
Not really. You can just quit to main menu when anything starts going south. Your camp doesn't remain while you're offline. Nobody can attack it.
---
Because its duping, it rips all the fun out of the game. And plus its not entirely pve, there is some pvp elements
---
This was a standard government supply requisition from a tower using a consumable holo tape.
---
Must have changed last patch.
---
They stay in the container till taken or the server shuts down 
---
I place my extra stuff in cash registers by vendor bots
---
Next time some people attack you in the game try not to cry about it 
---
Yeah we are on PS4 also
---
Update: I got an explosive  goul slayer assault rifle.  Gotta use it at the white Springs golf club although I'm a heavy weapon build.  I would kill for an explosive 50.cal.
---
The mass distribution of WMD like TSE weapons negates any protection what so ever and PVP quickly devolves into I shot you first and had the right build to one shot you.  The existence of these weapons is necessary for late game especially scorch beast queen so you can’t outright remove them but rather make them extremely rare which leads into the other issue of legendary farming being a lot of work with little reward. So you have a select lucky few with guns that shoot bullets with the punch of full on nukes, they find a dupe glitch and realize they can get lots of caps and resources by trading these weapons. They go in to dominate the trading scene charging exorbitant amounts of caps which people willing shill out. In the end the masses think of this as essentially cheating the system (which it is) but also hypocritically only want to trade for ridiculously rare legendary weapons. It’s overall a moral grey area. 
---
A normal legendary, without star ranking has no 100% chance of dropping an legy item. Just FYI
---
And i can´t do whitespring anymore. All these people, running around like crazy, shooting da hell out of golf club with explosive weapons, killing each other to steal fckn hardend mass no one needs anymore...
---
And last but not least the orange color of the nuked zones, my eyes gettin a pain from that -.-
---
That´s no funny gaming anymore. My method keeps you coming around, see some new stuff and kill different enemies. More fun, better loot, less dumbstaz
---
Just be careful Bob.

She shouldn’t have lost caps unless she was wanted?
---
How did they take her caps? 
---
Unlimited carry weight was patched awhile back.
---
Disconnected 3 times over the last 3 days, each time was after I launched a nuke.
---
You seem like a lovely person. I'm sure you like stabbing people and telling them it's just a little papercut?
---
You can get the plans for the power station from a couple of places. One you'll encounter during enclave quests and one is a side quest for excavator armour.
---
I'm trying to be vague at the same time as helpful and it's difficult lol
---
That sounds right
---
Good lord you are delusional.
---
No, that's why I asked. In other games it helps players get better equipment with almost no effort, which helps them with KOS and griefing. That really isn't as big of a deal in 76 though.
---
What is it used for?
---
Yeah she only had around 350 caps and after they killed her she had around 50 left
---
I just never removed it
---
How so?
---
They are not permanent they only affect you for a period of time how long I do not know
---
Oh, okay. Thank you for answering!
---
No, I like stabbing people and telling them “Yeah, those are your guts on the floor.” 
---
Get a grip, it’s a fuckin game. Lol 
---
I've personally tried building into two separate caves but gave up and built elsewhere because I was constantly spawning inside the rocks 
---
Oh yeah, no rest for the wicked on the scavenging front
---
She was definitely not wanted. We both had only recently gotten on and were just farming some xp 
---
You're so tough and we're all soooo impressed.  We're not going anywhere, bully-boy. The guts of it is, you get off on wrecking other people's fun. Own it - don't try and get a game maker to legitimise your stupid, mindless activities. 
---
It was such a bad questline. It would have been so much better with npcs.
---
Destroyed trade economy.
---
You're in a fun party then a high level cheater comes in and carries hard steals all your fun and meaningful challenge.
---
Cheaters are boring to talk to they brag about their damage #'s obsessively and never role play. Generally acerbic people. Cheaters never change it's a lazy narcissistic personality flaw.
---
Killing yourself more often than the enemies is stupid.
---
No more teams because you're all anti-social when not carrying / showing off / bragging.
---
If i played for 1000 hours i have no more advantage than a filthy cheater 10 hours in. Can i post my 3 star legendary to reddit for upvotes? Nope. No one cares.
---
Awesome. :D I've seen more people trying to be a dick lately to be honest. It's a shame. When I first started it was far more common to see nice people around. I did see one guy running around with his microphone being hilarious and acting like a shady salesman last night though. Lol.
---
Destroying camps is part of the game. There is literally a perk that gives more damage towards camp objects. Your camp items also have HP. It's a pvp game. Deal with it and move on 
---
So far in my experience they've lasted for 30 minutes.
---
Nice angles, cool bunker!

No, I like it, it needs time to improve. But if your friends play it I say give it a shot 
---
That's why I feel like the game lacks NPCs, Phoenix is programmed to say a couple lines, but even the one about being careful of other robots is probably one a BOS member programmed him to say. The Grafton mayor has a bit more personality but he only has one interaction. MODUS is one of the few, what I would call, actually NPCs. His problem is he is robotic in a skynet way, just following a directive . You suspect he is up to something but never really find out. I hope they flesh him out in the future and give him more of a personality. 
---
Now Mr. Fluffy, he was awesome, I wish I could have him as a companion.
---
News flash, it's not. That's what gets you wanted, you realize? AKA, not supposed to do that. But I digress, this sub has turned to trash.
---
I was not prepared for that fight at all. 
---
I just got disconnected half way through a silo run, also about 5 minutes ago
---
Um... no. Fallout is, and always has been, about the NPCs and the story... the world is used as a supplement to the story to make everything feel more alive, to make the choices matter, to create emotional investment. 
---
I'm expecting a nerf to TSE and will happy put down my TSE shotgun for a normal one. Trying to setup as a shotgun / medic user for vault diving. I don't want TSE items to make vaults pointless.
---
Just to confirm, PvP and wrecking people's houses and killing them are not the same thing. That's why they have the bounty system in the game. Two different things entirely.  
---
I see you too are a gentleman and scholar :) lol
---
You can do all that in an exploration game. You can have RPG elements, but the point of fallout was to slowly explore the map. It’s the reason you may meet some companions and not others because you are free to proceed to the story along the path that you choose for the most part. Fallout 3, new Vegas and 4 were all like this.  A lot of effort is put into world design and the game is purposely slow so you can experience it.
---
I like checking out other peoples bases but like yourself I never seem to find many ,although I did see 3 on whitesprings today which was weird lol. What console are you playing on? Or is it pc? 
---
I don't understand the spam R?
---
It very well might be false, but it's based on what I read from other sources and my experience.
---
I stumbled upon their bodies during beta before I had started the quest. I was so confused lol. 
---
I got a team of 5 going to join you 
---
Pretty sure your mistake started when you bought Fallout 76 
---
What parts of watgo exactly? I know the high school sometimes has a legendary ghoul as you come in or in the library, not sure if there are other locations.
---
Even though I agree with most of what you said it's pretty arrogant to speak "on behalf of the community". Nobody asked you to be their spokesperson.
---
Still a thing lost my best gun
---
PS4 and he was pretty quick I didn't really notice
---
Starting to run out of ideas for builds, wish they'd let us just move in anywhere :(
---
That's a pretty good spot too. I was thinking of leaving a bunch of them on the corpses in the Flatwoods responder building. The ones on stretchers.
---
I'm wearing marine underarmor on my character and can confirm that this isn't the case. Even still, OP is talking about the item's model, not an image. Bad wording on their part.
---
Wait for content updates.
---
No problem. A lot of us end game players have been doing the same. When I started out I had trouble maintaining ammo, food, and water, so I usually drop those 3 at the overseers camp 
---
There are 3 enemies. And cause they´re lvl 40, you just get max lvl 40 gear. But 3 legendary enemies in 8 minutes is nice. 
---
Was a pain to get the mods but oh so worth it.
---
I use the dead raider in the middle of the church in Flatwoods as my dropspot.  It's nice and central, a spot often passed through by newbies, and ut allows me to make a "dead drop" pun.
---
Im with you mate i share your struggle, ridiculous i have more carry weight without PA. Been tryin to get atleast one for ages. 
---
It's been that way since their inception on Fallout 4
---
PC? If so thats odd because my rig can handle 4 at once no problems. Its even more hectic in a nuke zone.
---
Looks like a nice gun for the queen 
---
Thanks. I wouldn't mind one of those - at least until some incel troll attacks my base to deal with his raging hormones. LoL.
---
I stopped playing the game about six weeks ago. Every so often, I check back in on Reddit just to see what the community has to say about the state of the game. Every time I've checked back, there's always some new issue(s), or concern(s), that reinforces my decision to quit the game as a sound one and that my decision to not return to playing the game is equally sound. Maybe one of these days, I'll want to return. Good luck to everyone who's still playing it. Thanks for sharing.
---
Take the elevator
---
Oh yeah worse then getting handmade mods still not as bad as tesla was for me though took me 40+ tesla to get all the mods -_-
---
Yea but if it doesn't exist normally in the game you don't need to track it. Just delete all instances of it.
---
how much????? 
---
That would be great. I'd still be using that armour-piercing .44 from right at the start.
---
The townhall, the emergency service and the bots around. Also, if a bot in the city is a legendary, it will be a legendary all the time. So just check all out 1 time, remind which one was legy and go for them specificly
---
So you lost 500 caps in order for the other guy to have to use 30 wood?
---
I don't see how this file would be any more or less concerning than any of the Reshade dll mods.
---
Is the lobbing barrel learn-able?
---
What platform? I can handle that on PC and in full 1440.
---
Which mods do use an injector? Never heard of any.
---
Does the radiation healing to ghouls outweight the damage done? Id imagine so.
---
So optimistic.  They'd hardly sell it for less than a garage door.
---
I'm an idiot, I totally didn't even think about ammo. That would be useful as hell too. By Overseers Camp, though. Do you mean inside her stash?
---
PS4
---
Condescending? Maybe. Hostile? That word must not mean what I think it means. You keep making these baseless accusations. As for encountering other items with 'hidden' effects? The power armor frame has a nonexistent description and all sorts of fun bonuses. The Mistress of Mystery questline and Regalia of Mystery were a fun part of the game. You seemed to have different experiences. I wanted to figure out why. From my point of view, obviously very subjective, it all flowed together nicely. You... seem genuinely upset. Is there something I can do to help?
---
I’m on PS4
---
Nah, kills ghouls just fine.
---
[PC] Flamer fuel is incorrectly priced. You can craft your entire stashes supply of acid (200+ units and tens of hours work) and half your supply of oil into fuel that will get used up within 5 mins. That simply cannot be working as intended.  
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9xyc9z/fuel_crafting_requirements/
---
Can’t be that long. Whitesprings seems to respawn every 15-20 minutes during a nuke lol
---
It’s literally in the same place as all the other bonuses you get from anything in the game. Pretty fucked up that you couldn’t figure out a simple menu. It’s super intuitive. 
---
Maybe. It's annoying. My turrets keep bugging out. Some dogs once ate my bed. Dogs eating crops I can understand.
---
Same here as soon as i reach lvl \~60. Now i am 75 with my second char and its really boring to do the same things again and again. Maybe starting a 3th char, but meh...
---
My character started as a typical punky raider. Killing people, stealing scraps and he has nuked a camp, too. But after he recovered the Nuka clothes and PA paint he found his one true god Nuka and got addicted to cola. Against his raider nature he tried to share the joy and gifted cola to many other dwellers. Then he had a great time at the Fire Breathers who showed him his purpose: kill the scorched. So after learning that giving can be better than taking and killing the scorched Queen he bacame a responder Firefighter with an open camp in Flatwoods. He likes to help people, kill scorched and drink Nuka Cola. 
---
The only thing that has never changed is his love for dog food. His diet is just all dog food. He likes dogs and because he cant keep one, he eats like a dog.
---
It counts as a PvP kill for some reason, it happened to me right after the Queen once and I lost my stable flux and 50 caps from losing PvP
---
Reshade
---
When your getting rushed by enemies sniper build becomes ineffective. Meaning you will have to run shotguns or melee also = more points spent on offence 
---
It would be fucking amazing to make 5 jukeboxes blare country roads
---
Yup find them and scrap them. Scorched also drop rifles.
---
It's good. I play as one. I prefer stealthy approach. Sniper and bowie knife. (I started to play recently, so far, so good). 🙂 I'm level 17, don't know how it works at higher levels.
---
Haha that's hilarious. Would of been good to see that. Its odd I hear about people being dicks but never had it happen to me. I have just met really helpful people. What are you playing on? 
---
They’re making it soon
---
RNG gods, my friend. I learned about those guys some days ago, went to hunt one, first one I got was legendary.
---
Punched it 10-15 times with my powerfist and started regen, then 20 more hits (like half a minute) and boom, dead.
---
Droped a 1 star shitty melee weapon, 2 plans, 1 of them a BoS armor mod and a shitload of materials, also I think 20 or 25 caps plus 3 stims.
---
I'd say it was pretty woth it. But I prepared, using extra penetration and extra speed for melee perk cards maxed. I enjoyed the experience.
---
Tried to repeat it but next 4 I've found have been regular ones, wich dropped way less stuff, nothing out of the ordinary. Probably a lvl 10 Grafton Monster was better loot but still I enyojed the big roar when I woke them up :)
---
&gt; I saw people getting banned 
---
Please link evidence
---
Have you checked with other players to see if they can take it.
---
Try doing it spec'ed as a melee. :(
---
Shenandoah river?
---
I think the quest would have gone completely differently if we already knew him. 
---
Hey u/morepowertoshields,
---
The dev team is aware of this issue and actively working on a fix. I'll follow up as soon as I have more information. Thank you!
---
Using a bug to duplicate items
---
I think corpses are personal loot aren't they?? 
---
You are not high enough level. 
---
How do I wreck your fun if you press one button and fix it for less than it even cost me to destroy it? It's a stupid and childish argument you make. Great job implying I'm doing anything other than having fun on a game like you do by enjoying ingame features. Mindless activities? Yet you're oh so stimulated? Get the fuck out of here. Completely illogical nonsense. 
---
It's even more hilarious that you're so fucking mad that acting within the behaviors of an ingame faction is too much for you. I dont even need that justification, but its there. This is the real Fallout experience, not baby's first rpg. And getting a game maker to legitimize it - what the fuck does that even mean? I'm playing said game maker's game, using an intended by design ingame system. Dry your tears, cause Bethesda sure won't. 
---
There's always the novel alternative of going and playing Red Dead 2 and leaving the rest of us alone to have our turn to play. 
---
My results say 👎
---
I have a feeling there is more to this story. It just seems a little too vague to the level I am suspicious.
---
Miner hat or miner helmet? Two different critters.
---
Hey just want to run something by you. Have you noticed any changes to the chainsaw's/mods with the latest patch? 
---
I just added the bow bar mod to my chainsaw and I swear it used to say that it added bleed damage, however, now the description states that it is armor piercing. 
---
I don't have the plans for any of the other mods, just wondering if you could take a look at some of the others and see if you notice anything about them that might be different.
---
Nothing else seems to have changed, but just thought that might be something of interest.
---
Great story
---
Seen the mod every blue moon though
---
It was patched, for now, with the last PC patch in January 10. It was never fixed before then. 
---
That's an awesome gun!
---
&gt;Your entire demeanor has been that I'm an idiot who can't pick up on contextual clues.
---
So do you disagree with this statement?
---
You don't understand how your demeanor could piss me off like it has?
---
I think the stalking one just...uh...stalks you. The Vengeful Mothman is out for blood. The Wise Mothman just wants to share its wisdom. And the Stalking Mothman likes to follow people around and scare them.
---
Ya the first cache at the overseers camp. The game takes you there for the tutorial so new players are guaranteed to so it. Or the cash register in front of the Responders Vendor Bot in Flatwoods
---
Nah, I mean the corpses that are pre spawned in there. Like the old man on the table.
---
Interesting, so if you or your camp starts getting attacked you can just immediately log out? I guess I'm used to other games where this is designed out for purposes of PvP and such.
---
ESO is great about not having to engage in pvp if you don’t want to, but as far as scaling well... a lvl 700+ champion specced right can almost fight unarmed and/or naked against a fresh 160 champion and beat them in a duel :-/
---
I've heard if getting your gf to try 69 but 76?
---
i can't wait to get to a high level so i can do shit like this.
---
Well done all that hard work now you can get the best plan :ashtray
---
This. And all the other dummy posts about it.
---
If your buddy shares Ghoulish (rads heal health damage) you're pretty much set for nuke farming.  You can take hits all day and just heal them back.
---
Have the terminals to either turn of the turrets or disable their targeting restrictions. Troubleshooter gear and weapons help.
---
I'd figured. I've only see it once and it was already on the gun that dropped.
---
I'm sorry, I know there are no bad questions, but I feel like this is a common sense thing. 
---
 You're basically asking why a person being able to create duplicates of all the most powerful and useful items is a bad thing in a survival game where you can fight both other players and the npc enemies.
---
It almost speaks for itself WHY this is bad for the game for everyone who isn't duping, not even getting into the server issues it can cause.
---
It’s called under armor linings. All under armor has several tiers of lining that can add damage resist and special increases. You’ve probably seen the plans at vendors. Lowest tier is called treated and highest tier is shielded. 
---
Damn, good thing I put off filling out that spreadsheet until tomorrow and also just figured out how mods work again
---
o_O yes plz. You're awesome for doing this!
---
Called various things, just depending on the circle you spend time with. The original term, in the "old school" mmo days, was indeed mule. Bank alt, cash cow, loot bish, etc. People call 'em whatever I think. Mule just happened to stick really well xD
---
I leave all my legendaries I don’t want and can’t sell to the vendor there too.
---
There's a broken down truck by my camp, and I spawn inside the geometry of the truck every single time.  I'll have to try moving the camp module around and see if I can spawn somewhere better.  Maybe inside of a tree next time. lol
---
Bethesda either can fix it and won't or they can't fix it, my money is on the latter. It is a half assed game made from recycled assets and they never intended to give it the support that an online game needs.
---
Level 51 - you all can add me! Went through a divorce and lost my gamer tag. Started over. Could always use new friends!
---
Tag is ApostropheThief
---
Okay sweet.
---
You CAN build them but they will not be able to place the item once their base is moved. When their base is stored it will be unplaceable because they don't own the content. This rule also applies to any items that the player does not have plans for.
---
I'm starting to think you're full of shit for some reason. The unlimited carry weight exploit was fixed a couple of patches ago. Also you still never answered the original question... What's your source on all of this?
---
I think it's your attitude people are downvoting, so I would say it's correctly interpreted.
---
Pretty sure its a bug since launch. It has improved though. 
---
Happens to all enemies except to scorchedbeasts of course, afaik.
---
Nothing like getting the rare responder vendor to spawn then having it just die on you for no apparent reason.
---
I play a unarmed, whiskey fueled, raider. This is his backstory if you're interested.
---
~~~~~~~~~~
---
His name is Ashely. A point of ridicule for some of the more immature vault 76 residence. His father was accepted into the vault on his athletic merit. Being a three time national boxing champion apparently meant he had the right stuff to rebuild America. His wife wasn't so lucky. 
---
Lucky for Ashley he was born three months before the bombs fell. Although his mother wasn't allowed entry they made an exception for the new born baby.
---
Ashely's time in the vault was difficult. His father, never fully excepting the loss of his wife, was distant and stern. Seeing that the boy wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed he focused his efforts on training the boy in what he knew best. He quickly became more of a coach then a father.
---
For Ashley, the vault was a cage. The other vault dwellers avoided him. They said he had a bad temper. He heard the other kids parents urging them not to play with him. But he didn't care. No friends meant more time training, getting stronger, and getting ready.
---
The night before the big day Ashley sat alone in his dorm. His father having pasted away three years prior meant he had been moved from his childhood dorm to a one room singles dorm. As he heard everyone celebrating outside he drank from a bottle of whiskey he had lifted while on inventory detail. He didn't care what waited for him on the outside. Anything had to be better then fucking 76.
---
He woke up the next day bleary eyed with a headache screaming inside his head. After popping a couple buffout he grabbed his things and started heading out the vault. Everyone was gone. For a moment he stood there in the silent 76. It was like a completely different place then he had known. He was almost tempted to stay, but pushed toward the entrance. 
---
As he stepped out he was blinded. He patted his pockets and found his sunglasses. The name finally made sense, as he slipped them on. In the distance a plume of smoke was rising a short way down the path. The sound of a full band could be heard echoing through the forest. He could even hear a couple excited shouts. 
---
Ashely set off towards the revelry. Out of one pocket he pulled brass knuckles, and out of another he pulled a sack hood. He donned both. As he continued down the path he said to himself,"This is going to be easier then I thought."
---
A raider has entered Appalachia. 
---
Class freak
---
Yes - I am having fun. Yes I have had frustrating d/c but when that happens it normally time to take a break anyway! 😂
---
They item description says it improves stealth, just need to check stats to get the exact value - like every other item in the game with a special effect.. 
---
Awesome voice over acting! I'd say put me on the list for some bare knuckle duster fighting but you're on Xbox.
---
Good luck with this, happy murderkilltime bruisers!
---
Cash register might be a better idea. The camp is a quest loot spot. Those reset frequently, that much I do know. In the camp cache, loot is more likely being wiped before anyone gets to it.
---
I have instead shotgun plasma flamer :) 
---
I'll be keeping my eyes on it but if I do get banned for using this then we will at least know the extent of mods. 
---
Yeah shame to make a great way to tag enemies in corridors
---
Exactly what Frodo said. It's just hearsay right now, though, so let us know if it actually does get removed from your inventory or not.
---
Just relog, SB aren't worth the effort or resources needed to kill them.
---
Same tho
---
Probably because the precise effects depend on whether you’re wearing the eye or not. A general description is given on the item, and the specifics are listed in the effects menu.  
---
It’s under Luck (: 
---
Right, I know this game is a fucking mess. A fuck up. A half arsed piece of shit. But surely, just surely, they can’t have fucked up to to the point where they can’t stop players duplicating thousands of items over and over again. 
---
I’m good with that. Just got the barn set before  A server crash. Hoping to use it when I get on in a couple days. 
---
Excellent. Thanks for linking that article which pointed out that it's meaning has largely strayed from its original inflection and technical definition and is now (ambiguously)  likewise often 'misused' in the wonderful zeitgeist that is common parlance enough that it's generally tolerated or it's definition is expanding or in flux. So... arguing both our points at the same time. Does beg the question why though.
---
Haha I agree. I quit weeks ago. And will only be back when the first expansion comes out. But the truth is you can't stop people who are going to grief from doing it. Simply leave the server if you are getting attacked and it annoys you.
---
Also you can rebuild all using your C.A.M.P and it can cost half price with the right cards. So in all it usually doesn't cost too terribly much to repair damage.
---
And not everyone has money to go about buying new games every few weeks. Or for that matter not everyone has a ps4 to play red dead. 
---
When thet reply back i will make sure to let you know the response here as well.
---
Well Bethesda made a sandbox game... and a sandbox game mandates that players make their own fun and do as they will. And guess what? People are doing as they will. If you wanted “people should be as the in game lore dictates” you are not wanting a sandbox...
---
Honestly I'm a little afraid to pick up the early fallouts. I'm not super into turn based combat but I think fallout is at its best when its dark and gritty and I hear those are more dark and gritty than something that's really dark and gritty.
---
It works don’t it.
---
How else can I continually signal every one for miles around to come my location so I can ambush them and take their stuff.
---
I don’t have a box, a stick, a piece of rope, and some candy, so this will have to do 
---
I think you can, I've looted containers my friend put stuff in a few times. Though we were also in the same party, so I can only assume that you can out of party.
---
I am on pc. I must admit I don't play late at night maybe that's when the trolls come out 😝👹👹🤫🤭
---
Easily my fav questline but this was about when I quit because of the damn bugs and server bed-shitting.  I know they fixed most of it but I've no interest in the game anymore but as I got about 30 hours out of it, I'm not mad at the purchase.
---
You can still lament liquor stores popping up on every corner around your neighborhood if you’re an alcoholic.  He’s not saying they made him have an addictive personality, just that it sucks it’s hard to find a good MMO that isn’t ramping  up micro transactions.
---
We live in the era where a “free” app can earn millions and well-developed games are barely sold or heard of, so many developers are adapting to the times and it sucks for many of us.
---
1- PC
---
2- IGN DjenkoUnchained
---
3- N/A
---
4- Several instances of being able to exit power armor.  Sometimes it fixes itself, but usually requires soft logging from the game.  Uncertain at this time, but I think it has to do with carry weight capacity outside of power armor being higher that the carry weight capacity in power armor.
---
5- N/A
---
This has got to be the stupidest thing I have read in this subred. 
---
Yeah, I think I keep running into this same moth man. I get his health down to about half and he runs off. 
---
Alas i'll be too busy on the PvP servers.
---
Not much at 250. Self found both bloody explosive and tse weapon gatling (oddly enough) and have most blue prints. I could start a new character I suppose but most likely ill just wait to see how the dlc's turn out.
---
A lot of people say they're just Roleplaying an ass hole /or sociopath. I have a suspicion its not always if ever roleplaying.
---
You logging off and losing prime real estate is not the current players fault, did you ever think to just switch servers? 
---
There's a brief glimpse of vending machines in the E3 trailer from two years ago when going through the camp stuff, it looks like there will be six-seven different vending machines selling basic supplies instead of being able to put your own items into them. 
---
Everything about the queen sucks, dude. For me, a trophy hunter trying to make fallout 76 my 76th plat, one of the last two trophies I have left is to kill the queen and its such a massive pain in the ass that I want to just ditch it. Not to mention the rewards for people who don't care about trophies being a bit, well, shit. 
---
If you actually want to know about what's going on, it's all over these boards. 
---
If you want to come in here with 0 prior knowledge, very little effort beyond knowing heresay, and really only seeming to want to get negative about it if any discussion is going to happen at all, there's plenty of that already. 
---
Don't need another thread.

Fever Claw and/or Rattle Hands?

I'm just sitting on the sidelines, enjoying my Fancy Lad Snack Cakes, waiting for the nerf bat to come down and make TSE's balanced.
---
Probably nerfed legendary drops til duping settles down, squashed. Patch tomorrow might pick up drops better. Excited to do more events
---
Not gonna lie, I’m kinda proud of this entry
---
Honestly, it’s gonna be a while before I give up my Diamond. 
---
My main gun is a .50 explosive machine gun with 2 other useless legendary prefixes. My sidearm is a one star two shot gatling gun. Most of the time, i use the gatling to one or 2 shot most mobs and for big ones the .50cal. Build is this one: [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=e343d8b&amp;d=ic4ip2l22l71lu2a04sq2s32sr2s22lt2pe2s01ib4c71e60a72eh2&amp;w=&amp;n=Explosive%20.50%20MG](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=e343d8b&amp;d=ic4ip2l22l71lu2a04sq2s32sr2s22lt2pe2s01ib4c71e60a72eh2&amp;w=&amp;n=Explosive%20.50%20MG)
---
Ah, cool. I wanted it on PC but my laptop is a colossal piece of shit. Haha. And just might be, I'll have to compare when I have more time during the day.
---
Thanks, I was going to continuously check it but thanks for having my back anyway.
---
downvoted lol
---
That is a legit idea.
---
you need a specific miner helmet for this. There are lots of variations of miner hat but only the type with different head lamp modifications is for that challenge. You can find one of this hat in the warehouse outside black water mine.
---
Well the problem is that the dupe glitches basically abuse a system that’s there to safeguard against you losing items when you store them in containers on the server and lose connection somehow. If they were to simply remove that safe guard then duping wouldn’t be possible(with the current methods) BUT if someone stores something right as either the game crashes or server restarts or some other problem out of 1000s of possible problems happens, the items being stored or exchanged will be at risk of just being lost. 
---
People would be pissed if they started randomly losing rare items and resources. People are pissed that other people are getting free rare items and resources. It’s unfortunately a bit of a lose, lose situation at the moment but I’m also pretty confident they have some solutions in the works. 
---
SaltySpitoon909 I have electrically charged , Marsupial , speed demon, grounded , bird bones , healing factor lmk 
---
They patched the extra eggs with green thumb unfortunately. But it’s still a good way to make caps.
---
By the way. Servers are mostly stable. You can play for hours and not have any problem. I get a few crashes and disconnects from time to time though, but that happens with many games, especially at the release period with online games. If I was doing something important it would bother me, but I just wander around a lot of the time and if I crash when looking at my stash box or something it's not a big deal.
---
Why are you even here? You have no interest in playing the game, you're not getting paid youtube money to hate on the game like most of the gaming youtubers have started doing. Is this how you spend your free time, hating a game that sucks to you?
---
I don't think they fucked up, to fuck up one has to actually try.
---
Springs, gears, screws, or any other crafting materials. 
---
I don't think it ever added bleed damage for me, but I can go back through my screenshots from when I was progressing up through the ranks with it sure mate!  I also plan on doing a final build showcase video for this week sometime so that I can move onto the ripper and mr handy builds next.
---
I had a camp there but I got annoyed with the enemies spawning under foundation or whatnot and stopping me from fast travel
---
Dont you get enemies spawning in your bunker when you fast travel there?
---
That dress is the only outfit that does that.
---
THIS. Seriously, this is the way to go into nuke zones. This in PA will make you unstoppable (at least against NPC opponents). 
---
Help low level players level up @ whitesprings nukes, help newbies when they occasionally ask, grief bases that look awesome, trade, buy stuff from players, farm legendaries as much as possible, PvP about as much as I PvE, and get bounties from time to time to play cat 'n mouse with players and that's about it, still can say I'm entertained @ lvl 237.
---
It is kinda the fault if Bethesda for everyone rushing, especially the Whitesprings Golf Club. Bethesda changed how respawning works from being on a timer to new people needing to enter the area. Now of course basically nothing respawns so people rush to get what drops they can since they can only do it once instead of continual spawns for the duration.
---
Before this change I noticed people were rushing a lot less and instead getting in good farming positions
---
Duper proaganda trying to guilt people into laying off.
---
No problem i think we all want this mod bad.
---
Oh look here another twat fortniter
---
I have a dumpster at my camp with the label "free loot" and a cardboard cutout pointing at it. I drop stuff I don't need I there, have at it :) 
---
How do you accidently press a button that many times?  Weren't there some prompts that alerted you? 
---
Does everything have a plan though?
---
Specifically looking for buttressed marine arms.
---
As you’re making a good point, I’ve updated the OP with the background to this. 
---
Not sure if you've run into this area before, but I spent a good month+ at this spot refining and redesigning my CAMP. 
---
Really felt like a home, Haven't settled for more than a few days since I moved away. 
---
A lot of potential for adding character. Downstairs area is fully furnished living space, so your budget is super free to get weird with it.
---
Had a post I made of it here.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout76settlements/comments/ac10mx/my\_favorite\_spot\_in\_the\_mire/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout76settlements/comments/ac10mx/my_favorite_spot_in_the_mire/)
---
Really trying to find static locations that I can build at these days, Really enjoying the extra budget. Having to cover every sort of thing needed for "yes this is a CAMP" aesthetic can take a huge chunk of budget. The more amenities I can ignore building the better.
---
Why are you defending this broke dick piece of shit game? Can’t even acknowledge my post about a huge problem and go straight to the “eeeehh stop hating”
---
I believe the price range is usually anywhere from 250 to 500 caps. That's what serums go for on r/fo76bazaar subreddit anyways.
---
Why would you come here to post about it if you don't play, and haven't heard anything good? Just to stir up arguments and to call out devs as "lazy"? 
---
You should have just ignored and blocked him
---
I think what RealRelight is saying though, is that even if you never reposition your camp item, you may not always show up at the same spot. For my camp I have two, both right in the outskirts of my build area, but nearly opposite sides of my camp. 
---
No. Also no. Did you pick up on the contextual clues? This is what has been so fascinating. The difference between our experiences. I am suggesting you did not. You essentially admitted as much. What is unclear to me is why you appear to be reacting negatively, or are at the very least perceiving hostility from me.
---
I wish I still have my Responder's police uniform...I accidently dropped it. :( If anyone has one they wanna give me, I'll happily take it. :)
---
I'm really hoping for them to just use the code and add it to the next patch. Especially if they ban the mod.
---
but i spent all my money on 76 and cant afford red dead, so say goodbye to your base.
---
you missed the watoga high school roof one
---
No one could have predicted this. No one could have seen the cult following this subreddit has established over Bethesda and "dupers are the problem". The problem, and i'll reaffirm this, is that Bethesda hasn't made the game correctly. As a result we will fight until things are fixed. Blame it on Bethesda, be mad at Bethesda, don't ruin other peoples' game. 
---
Kill, loot, sell to vendor
---
You've not played since Cata have you then?  Most of the ways to get the loot for class sets now is on a 1/day timer
---
Yeah I know, if foresight was as good as hindsight I would have just blocked and hopped as soon as he started.
---
Not bad, can't really fault it. Maybe run Fireproof but other then that.
---
Griefers gonna grief. This is just some video game version of virtue signaling/white knighting that they hide behind but even without duping they’d be a huge asshole in game when encountered so don’t take it too personal!
---
Fortnite, a game with little to no bugs and a very enjoyable experience.
---
Fallout 76, broken as shit.
---
It could be very well possible he hasn't done anything except retexture the Excavator PA with a dds tool such as GIMP. Are the FO76 texture still DDS? I'm actually quite curious if this isn't a retexture how i can get it :)
---
I so wanted to post this same thing!
---
I just put a welcome mat down in my camp hoping it would have this effect as it is in kind of a high exotic location, but yeah, same ensued.
---
Yes, because I've had some pretty awesome melee fights where we both used marsupial and a jetpack. Awesome mid-aid clashes lol. Requires actual skill.
---
A TSE on the other hand requires zero skill, and the fact everybody and their nan has one makes it even worse.
---
Tagged this post for later.  I rebuilt my cabin after finding a great location by a stream and lake.  This will come in handy when I remake it with nicer looking walls.
---
What a POS. I was considering doing what you were doing. I give a bunch of Stims and Radaway to every newy I meet. Meanwhile garbage like that guy do that to you. -Shakes head-. The duper garbage is just a lame excuse to cyber-bully people under the cloak of anonymity. 
---
Don 't have any arm plans but I du have the Ultra-light build ĺimbs if your intested.
---
Next time you see someone doing a power station event, join in, you get a generator plan that you do not already have as a reward.  
---
My x1 can handle 4 at once
---
Better dead then red
---
Oh hey I recognize your name I just bought some serums from you lol
---
Instigating Axe / All Rise / TSE Lever Action for ranged tagging
---
Tesla and Gatling gun.
---
Why would this bother you if you aren't playing the game? 
---
Why would you moan about something that is not effecting you in anyway? 
---
Get of the bandwagon, play the game, make your own decisions based on your own experience or just quit your whinging!! 
---
Still trying to get atleast one TSE weapon or x01 calibrated shocks. Almost lvl 200...
---
RIP Console...
---
If you watch your combat rifle build weights and find a good legendary you can have a really decent one for around 16 pounds that can do just about everything. The only thing I carry other than that is a good melee weapon and a good shotgun (I have a two shot hardened double barrel and really like that).
---
Sweden might be okay. I'm Australian. Hell of a distance.
---
There are no prompts, I accidentally bought a dress from the atom shop today. They should add a confirmation screen to buy items in the atom shop.
---
Thought about sticking that in there for after the patch (ps4), I just figured I'd kill myself in 1-2 shots regardless 
---
To me bounty hunting is to discourage griefing, which I hate and an opportunity to make a few caps. 
---
Theres ultra rare events that occur in game. Not much but still... e.g. I had a tank spawn once in front of my camp in cranberry bog, complete with soldier skeletons and ammo boxes. Spooked the hell out of me.
---
Yeah, I'm actually really glad they made it this way. I played about two hours of rust total when I learned that I'd have to be online the whole time. Didnt really care for that.
---
Oh I’m not role playing I’m just a douchebag
---
You know your kind are getting banned right
---
Robot revolution storylines have only been beaten to death more and more as time goes on I'd hate to see Bethesda do yet another take on one of the most lazy and contrived cliches.
---
I feel like I got my plans for that at Lewisburg station, but might have been the bos vendor in watoga.
---
If someone is trying to pick a fight with me, I WILL fight back. I am talking about the actual base damage TSE's have, not the bobblehead boosted slap damage.
---
again, why are you here?
---
its a damn fair question 
---
Eyes up, guardian. 
---
[morepowertoshields loved that]  
---
Thank you. I means a lot =)  
---
Yeah screw them bethesda should make a game where we don't have to put up with them don't you think? We'll call it a "solirare player" game or something
---
It doesn’t bother me. I just find it funny that people can still defend the game when shite like this glitch is the only media attention it gets
---
You have to have Marine Arms first, then you can buy the Buttressed plan, usually from the Harper's Ferry vendor (may have to server hop a few times for it to come up).
---
That I know of, any mod can also be a plan, but you need the base plan in order for either to work.
---
It is not exactly deleted. Only available at workbenches, not your personal camp.
---
Raider leathers underarmor
---
No. I need buttressed for arms.
---
The best course of action is to get it out, and FORCE Bethesda to address it quickly, so I'd suggest that rather than just submitting tickets cause they don't seem to respond fast otherwise.  Look at the other examples from dupe videos getting out and catching on like wildfire and how they did 'emergency maintenance'.  
---
It's not pleasant but I'm willing to suffer shitty stability to force B's hand to respond quickly.  The more heat you put on them the more they will see the importance to address it properly even if in fire situation. 
---
 Reshade IS a mod? Anything that modifies the game in any way is a "mod", so you'll need to be more detailed.
---
It happens and does occur. 
---
Ive fought radstag, molerat, radrat, brahmin herds before. 
---
All spawned about 10 or so in a group, traversing the wasteland.
---
You are my best friend
---
To get an answer to MY damn fair question which you have failed to give.
---
Or your know pay fucking attention 
---
Got the same problem, can't put them anywhere in my camp, home defence3 active, lots of budget left
---
Really? O.o so I'm really looking for is the marine arms plan?
---
I did answer it, look you can believe your Bethesda fantasy if you want. Feel free to believe I'm full of shit as well.
---
Here's one more, there are 2 other dupe methods.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9ytn03/has_anyone_else_run_into_grahm/ea3xetv/
---
ITS BEEN DONE!!!!!
---
It was doing the same to me but my character was grunting. I thought he was really getting into grilling yao guai ribs 
---
Change servers. Perhaps it's time for the righteous to band together and form possies to hunt down those varmints. 
---
Lol the last company
---
One with atomic shop paint has a symbol next to it, otherwise nothing
---
Yeah I would have posted pics on what I was talking about but I didn’t know how but yeah we need to figure out a way to get someone from Bethesda to see this post lol 
---
P.s sorry bout my bad wording 
---
I'm tired of it too. People who don't understand end game mechanics always accuse end game players of duping or hacking. I craft and sell serums daily and 1 guy that I sold to sent me a message after saying he screenshotted my ammo and was reporting me for duping. I had 9k 5.56 rounds and a couple low charge fusion cores. Anyone end game can make 9k rounds with a few hours of junk farming. 
---
I report these people for harassment to bethesda and on xbox. Hopefully they at least get 30 day mutes from xbox for being stupid. 
---
The only problem is it absolutely kills a radicool bloodied build
---
Nice, I've always wanted a friend
---
I am talking more over a server wide thing versus the random events. 
---
Of course they are helping by making the problem worse they make it so bethesda can't ignore the problem
---
I bought a bunch of 'Marine XXX Toso' mods and couldn't figure out why they weren't showing up.  Then I found the Marine Torso and they showed up as mods I could make once I had a torso to modify.
---
In your own post you say you haven't tried it with the Mining Helmet.  Try it with that and it should work
---
It just happens i accidentally pressed the button, why isn’t there a confirmation screen? 
---
It's in the game, dunno how I would be. If Bethesda would fix you falling through floors I woulda never found it lol
---
I wondered too, and also Mysterious Stranger can revive you in Luck. Seems good. But I doubt the individual items stack.
---
I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream!
---
Na this op is full of shit and a youtuber dick rider 
---
then go ask the damn developers, do we fucking code the game?
---
Yeah pretty much. Explosive shotgun brings me to 20% ish health without having padded armor or w/e. It's nice for enemies with rocket launchers though. 
---
\&gt;drop my explosive combat shotgun in the cranberry bog, so it’s in essence unfindable, and then I disconnect. Great. Just lost my best gun.
---
I'd wager you have another one ;)
---
I'm sure it'll get easier once I'm further along in the game and have more factions to trade with... I'm weird about not wanting spoilers so I haven't looked up where they all are even though it'd likely be an easy way to solve my frustration. :P 
---
I decided to use my ongoing storage problem as an excuse to put a bit more effort into my CAMP (waterfront by camden park, should you be on PS4 and find yourself nearby). Now that I've made it more visible and easier to notice, other players are actually visiting and trading with me. Perhaps in the end I'll get over my grievances, I just feel like I see a lot more 100+ level players in general and wonder whether that's just how it randomly ends up on the server or whether players are getting frustrated and quitting before they make it ;( 
---
It is constitutional
---
You should mention which platform you are on 😉
---
You can sit way back and it will take them a long time to find you.  And once you get the perk to hide again and your stealth is up, it gets easy. (At least up to 40 where I am now)
---
Jesus, you mean people are getting the slide-rule and compass out to see if people are walking funny to decide if they are going to kill them and loot the body? The world is going to hell in a hand-basket!
---
The Blade of Bastet is a solid, light weight back up melee weapon for when All Rise breaks.
---
Ps4 ? 
---
It really goes to show the knowledge of the community here based on the number of posts about TSE, with the lack of understanding of in game items and perks that allow several ways to counter them.
---
Ive tested fireproof now with a bunch of other stuff, and I can confidently say I dont leave my camp now without 3x fireproof. :)
---
Ah makes sense. Thanks.
---
I hate those dgen feral ghouls from up country.
---
Would ask the developers but they would probably make me pay $80 for a plastic answer. Haha, get it?
---
Lmao. No source just like the "people can steal your weapons" 
---
Same thing. Big ol scary words. 0 proof but you get hit with the "I DoNt wAnT tO sPrEaD iT"
---
Carry weight has been patched for a while. That's not the case. As to a new dupe method. Again. 0 proof. 
---
Coz it's fun and we are enjoying playing it.  We can make that decision since we have actually played the game! 😂🤣😂
---
Well I just got it to spawn on my first server hop after finishing falsely accused, where I tried server hopping 5-10 times the other day and could never get it.
---
I dont know for sure, but there might be a 15 minute cooldown before *you* can retrigger the event, which is why you only see it one out of every 4 times you server hop.
---
I sell serums on xbox for 200 caps a piece. Message me at GT AngelOfDeath116. I'll be online in a few hours when I get off work 
---
How can you give me some more garunteed plan spawns, please?
---
It's such a tragic story. No good guys. Just people being people.
---
Favourite one in 76 to date, though still have a long way to go.
---
I’m not even trying to kill them. They’re at a spot where I’m trying to quest.
---
Going to the main menu and reloading still has them in the area.
---
Thanks, I'll give it a non party check the next time I'm on and let you know if it doesn't work.
---
I used to have two lifesaving arms, it seemed to proc about twice as often, but it wasn't 100% of the time, more like two tries at 50%.
---
Buy it (most likely off dupers but I don't care I need it). 
---
If your too poor, go look at army sites for army bags. 
---
I *think* they stack, but in an atypical fashion. 
---
IE, if on the first check it does not revive you, you are provided another 50% chance of reviving yourself. The total doesn’t add up to 100%, rather, you’re just given two random chances. 
---
The eye has some effect text saying something along the lines of "Enhances Mistress of Mystery Apparel" (don't remember what it actually says since I sold it a while ago lol).
---
I dont even need hours to make 9k rounds, one run of Fort Defiance for steel and cloth and lucky hole mine with registered excavator PA for lead. Craft with max Ammosmith and Super Duper perks, 10k ammo in about an hour. People just dont know how easy it is to get stuff like that later in the game.
---
Does radiation speed up the use of your fusion cores.? Cause I went through way too many 
---
Carry a stack of grenades on this for a quick, low ammo use way to destroy the mainframe computers.
---
it's unarmed yes.
---
You may want to research a bit more on what Cheat Engine is being used. For example, very commonly being used as one of helping tools for fixing issues with games running on ultra-wide monitors. For when games are not supported anymore or developers simply don't give a crap.
---
I have tools installed that literally capture, dissect, analyze and emulate network traffic. That's in violation of their EULA too. I would be banned from that game because I have such tools installed for my work as a network engineer.
---
haha yeah, like in that game for toiletdrinkers, fortnite was it?
---
People with poor social reasoning skills are on a justice high all over the place. Mostly kids or... More immature and sheltered folk. 
---
It's an excuse to feel vindicated in judgement and bullying. You've seen it I'm sure quite a bit lately with our current social climate.
---
Basically grumpy people forgetting there's a person behind the other screen riding outrage morals, or literal trolls just bored using "duper" as an excuse to harass you for their own immature enjoyment.
---
Anyone somewhat normal would've backed off once seeing your stuff. He had already decided you were a target the moment you killed something faster than he could.
---
Sigh at the state of social contact in online gaming, block, and move on. 
---
Us normal folk are out there. Unfortunately ass holes are the ones seeking out a lot of the interaction right now. Cool people all give a friendly wave and respect your space. Wish we had better reasons to interact when passing a stranger beyond offloading stuff if they're lower level or seeing if they're actually carrying anything they'd want to sell, which isn't often.
---
Sucks. Do remember that ass was the minority. He'll probably blow a gasket whenever the next "controversy" starts for whatever reason and quit. Good riddance to bad attitudes.
---
Thanks a bunch. :D Going to be real awkward for those who've been doing this for a while.
---
You're only required to implement what is achievable within reasonable effort and expense, and one of the criteria for reasonable is what impact doing the work would have on the game.
---
It's enforceable, FCC have authority to directly impose fines of up to $1m. But that's just a crowbar to use in case companies refuse to cooperate, the usual process is for FCC to mediate between company and consumer to get the issue fixed.
---
This is dope.
---
Make favourited items unable to be SOLD or SCRAPPED or DROPPED... period.
---
You will find more.
---
I guess I did take it kinda personal, like the other replier said I should have just blocked him off the bat.
---
The 10 was only for pc,  consoles come this week.
---
Believe it rolled out on PC on the 10th and it’ll be hitting consoles this week 
---
It's going to get wiped 
---
didn’t even think of doing this. I might have to go back now lol
---
Console is on monday. Pc was the 10th 
---
Get yourself a weapon you can one-shot enemies with.  Something like a two shot explosive rifle or shotgun.  You’ll make quick work of all the robots down there. 
---
Why am I reacting negatively to you condescending me and accusing me of eagerly searching for problems to blame on the game?
---
Because it's shitty behavior.
---
I haven’t paid a single penny to play fortnite. How much did you spend to play Bug76?
---
I did this now I cant reequip the quest
---
If you are in pc feel free to add me.  Shredingmetal41.
---
I've only seen addition to ballistic and energy resistance, not attribute additions
---
Yeh boi judge me in a video game and link it to my real life achievements.
---
This is about 95% the mentality of a pvp player. 
---
Dont get me wrong, I love me some pvp. Just that I realised a long time ago that its just a game.
---
Is electrically charged useful at all? Doesn’t seem to really deal damage or have other effects. It can’t even one hit lvl 1 miles :(
---
lmao
---
I did it during the glory days of bugs, (carryweight etc.) Grabbed 80+ hunting rifles or pump shottys off of scorched and scrapped them all
---
Reminds me of an episode of Skyrim COPS. 
---
I have a Mule. On a 2nd account. Yep i've bought the game twice. Once pre-ordered and the second time i got it on sale. It's easy peasy. I run two Fallout 76 instances on the same PC since you can login manually if you're not using [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net). Can't get any better. ALT-TAB ftw. I'd say if they see me with a lvl 2 char let them kill me. I'll lose a couple of Ks in junk but i'll get that back eventually by scrapping stuff for 2 days.
---
Sure, I have been doing it since the beta days. One of the bodies outside the vault, the med box in front of the Flatwoods church, but recently most of my drops go to the containers inside Watoga station, either the suitcase or the blue pail box: plans, ammo, legendary wood armor, you name it, you can find it!
---
I do the same but farm pleasant valley ski resort. Between the weapons dropped from mutants/miners and the 6 tin can traps, I get a good 500 steel. My serums too. I sell for 200 each but according to half of reddit I "have to be a duper to sell that low." All it costs to craft is 1 flux and with super duper that's pure profit lol. 
---
Because that would be very misleading to have as just flavor text. Also does anything else in the game have flavor text displayed like that because I don't remember seeing any like that?
---
I launched my first nuke last night, and disconnected when I zoned to the Nuke zone.
---
I was livid and totally pissed off.
---
I "finally" understand why people say this game is SHIT.
---
I'm going to work on another nuke tonight...
---
Not that bothered. Only paid 1k
---
as much as i wanted to, since i earn my money, have a problem where people spend their money?
---
That's cool. Hope I didn't drop any of those pieces. Maybe you can get closer and closer to 100% with all pieces but never actually reach it, like the Goat Legs and the armor pieces that take you over 100% fall damage reduction.
---
This is so fucking sick 
---
Thanks. &lt;3
---
Reshade and Cheat Engine.
---
Are you locking them?
---
This. A thousand times this!! 
---
Good points. It is mainstream, for lack of a better word, to stand up for something nowadays. Even if what you're stand up for has absolutely nothing of value or if you standing up for it actually helps it in any way.
---
You have spare normal armour in your invntory that you aren't wearing and that makes the matching PA piece unequip, sell it or stash it :-)
---
Nice photo and good use of a pose but disturbing as AF if you think about it.
---
I created a camp in the Ash near the railroad station and every time I fast traveled I would spawn inside a house that has no entrance. Luckily I was able to just walk out and it would close behind me.
---
Heck!  Master race cousin, Xbox user :)  Gamertag - Amber 71 Stars
---
Hilarious post, thanks for the laugh. Another long winded and pointless rant about YouTubers not liking a game you like? My favourite, thank you 
---
If the eye of ra increases the effect of the garb, and the garb doesn't have an explicit effect, what would it increase?
---
100 x 0 = 0
---
Yeah just grab the base dress off any died mistresses. 
---
Mine is on a cliff as well.  I used to always spawn at the bottom of the cliff (never in mid air though).  I moved it back a little bit and now I spawn on a tiny little outcropping mid way down the cliff wall and inside the rocks a little bit.  I just jump a second time and it ALWAYS puts me in the same spot right beside my camp the second time.  I'd love to know why the hell the game can put me in a good landing spot the second time, but never do that the first time.
---
People are taking it..
---
Ah dang
---
I just switched from Xbox.
---
Not to mention Green Thumb doubles the raw flux you collect so it's even cheaper to craft. 
---
I've got over 300 hrs in this and I only remember some twats killingneverybody in a nuke zone. Apart from that I can't remember any real griefing.
---
If you need more info on finding the plans let me know :)
---
I got my first one after about 30 hops the second one was over 300... Through all the hops I only got 1 Jetpack, for reference.
---
Wrong i beat it around level 32 solo 
---
Here are a few google doc spreadsheets that I found useful.

---
What do you think of 4 Leaf Clover when compared to the other one (I think it's called Psychopath)?
---
I saw this  same type thread a while back and started doing the same   Extra Plans , ammo etc. it’s a great idea. 
---
I don't even have a door 
---
THIS WORKED!  Thank you!  I transferred all the mats onto to me and suddenly it recognized them.
---
I had the opposite happen, the Gustys all attacked the Scorchbeast instead of me, so I was able to pick them off easily. The Scorchbeast was too busy with the rest of the town to bother with me.
---
Gun-Fu is what really made my build fun.
---
i meleed them to death rather quickly myself 
---
I see what you’re saying. 
---
With five pieces, you’d have five chances to revive yourself. Six with the perk. You’d have essentially a guaranteed revival, unless you were outright killed instantly or had just *awful* luck. 
---
Yeah the numbers you can get on shotguns are crazy high, I'm not sure what I'd sacrifice for it either. Nahh, with the ability to spam 5 stims at once in PA, smaller bursts of damage like that shouldn't be a problem, right?
---
Well it's not Xbox
---
God damn watching your temper tantrum is really entertaining
---
heck!  wish the game let us cross platform play.  too many wishes :)  Fun people servers this way!  LOL
---
well you probably are playing with duped items seeing that you got those for free and almost free.
---
Are you at like 15 agility -- have so much AP!
---
What's the secret??
---
You cab place it down without dropping it, so that you dont relinquish ownership.  Press e or enter in PC, not sure about console.
---
So because the game is so fucked and Bethesda is so incompetent, players who earned their legit should be punished... 
---
Some more neon signs would be great, tiled roofs, a radio that plays the Appalachia radio station, trap doors, light up flooring to go with the mirror ball, to name a few ideas.
---
Exactly, which is why the best part of it is the exploration and environment while you complete the quests. You can replay new Vegas and not meet the same people and it’s amazing, it’s story and exploring. 
---
Same thing happened to me a while back. Submit a ticket explaining it was an accidental purchase, you’ll then get a canned e-mail response(2 days later for me), e-mail back restating that it was an accident and that you would like the atoms refunded, after that email they had my atoms refunded in another 2 days. 
---
Also on the same page where you submit tickets there is a section where you can leave feedback, I suggested adding a conformation box after the page with the description it wouldn’t hurt for you to do that as well. 
---
Have you checked in “Transfer” and not just in the quick pop-up menu? I’ve had mine be in there and just be a visual glitch on the outside. 
---
