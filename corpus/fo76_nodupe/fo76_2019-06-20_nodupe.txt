I still gotta find my way down there. So many times I go to look up where to buy something and things are all "Oh just go to MODUS in the bunker."
---

---
Like, shit, I haven't gotten down there yet.
---
---
---
I never got diseases from veggies when I had Herbivore (now I have Carnivore) on Xbox, so it could be bugged for you.
---
As for rads... IRL, plants absorb radioactive Cesium and other radioactive elements and incorporate them into their structures, making them lightly radioactive. When Fukushima Daiichi blew, the tea gardens upwind had leaves that were testing in the unsafe-for-trade levels, since Camellias are really good at absorbing heavy metals. Washing these would not reduce ionizing radiation from the chemicals incorporated into the leaves.
---
Kill enemies and then server hop to do the same location over again.
---
Go to the Charleston courthouse (it's part of the capitol building) and kill the scorched. Once you're strong enough do the DMV instead of the courthouse.
---
Vault-Tec University in Morgantown and kill the ghouls/robots.
---
If you're high enough level that you can get to Top of the World without difficulty, do the ski resort and cabins there.
---
Late in the game, farm the Whitespring gold resort and the West-Tek facility.
---
Oof.  Yeah, that's rough.  Give them pictures of Foundation for extra rep.  You can give the people at Ohio River Adventures mirelurk meat for rep too, to help catch up.
---
Then, honestly, why even wear a specialized backpack? What’s the benefit if when you die, the game fucks you? I use the grocer’s backpack and the chemist perks (90% red), but every time I get killed, gotta head to 76, even though I weigh 155 out of 265. That is a pretty shit bug (I say bug, because it definitely shouldn’t be a gameplay mechanic).
---
Not getting exp was tougher to do than I though it would be. Luckily enough a separate random invited me to their team and they happened to be next to the cave I needed to get into. I used them for free fast travel and then they left the server, so I’m not sure why they invited me in the first place.
---
Well hey, if I did it at level 4 it’ll be a breeze! MODUS has a ton of neat stuff when you can afford it lol
---
No I definitely agree it should still register that you’re wearing it. I get annoyed every time it happens.
---
5000 scrip, 150000 Caps and 4000 pounds of scrap would be a fitting price;)
---
Love a good tire fire
---
Haha it loses some mystique when you can see the foundations!
---
Yeah, I'm 24. I probably should get there eventually.
---
Thank you very much! It still needs some polish but I'm quite proud.
---
Yup. This sums it up for me. 
---
- 998 scrip
---
- turns in 3* 
---
- gets 2 scrip 
---
- :)
---
I was attacked by 3 people all over level 200 and they destroyed my camp and I didn’t even fight back. If 76 were to allow some stupid shit like that I’d probably quit the game...took me hours to rebuild so fuck any of that noise
---
[deleted]
---
I’m level 6 now because of how much exp doing the missions gave me 😂 as soon as I was in the exp bar just shot up there.
---
Bethesda doesn't have a server room, the FO76 servers are hosted in Amazon AWS. (Along with thousands of other companies)
---
I found a group of dead super mutants and one alive one. He had a injured tag on this name. He did not attack you and kept saying that a white beast attacked them and killed the others. Fucking creepy man
---
unarmed adds no additional weight, tough guy.
---
And 5g caused the corvid 19
---
Yeah, I suck at fighting scorchbeast queens, so I end up traveling to 76 and back like 5 times. It’s a lotta caps even with that 30% perk. Can’t even spawn at my camp OR tent. Annnnnoying!! Anyway, see ya in the wasteland. :)
---
It is literally the first and only server outage the game has ever had and yet we have people treating it like it was the end of the world and Bethesda needs to immediately put out a press release detailing every detail about what happened, why it happened and what they're doing to make sure it NEVER happens ever again because god help them if  this happens again and this guy misses out on TWO days worth of scrip.
---
I had this recently as well with some of the wallpapers.
---
Like a Fleet Farm on fire...
---
WHY?!
---
I actually want to address a different bug you might be experiencing. If you are a part of the event it shouldn’t make you travel at all when you die! You should spawn instantly back in the event? So that’s even shittier.
---
I saw that they where all open for me as well never used them though didn’t want them thinking I was a hacker or something lol
---
Check your Stats on the PipBoy after you’ve indulged.
---
[The Screaming Eagle Skin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKFfxNjp9wA) is a skin that has been datamined for the Handmade which means it shares its animations. It looks horrible with the Handmade's animations.
---
It's based off [early AR-10s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FXt5md6jPk) to the point that it's receiver states it's chambered in 7.62 NATO.
---
If it was someone deliberately sabotaging them I don't need to know who or why--they probably would love the notoriety. Why give them the satisfaction?
---
just for clarity sake since went back and found it in game.  the tunnel runs under the double highway heading n-ne from watoga, and it has several entrances along it.
---
The stats are the best of the best plus jetpack but you don't get pocket/deep pockets on the limbs.
---
Hahaha, shit. That is not happening with me even when I’m part of that event!
---
Edit: it does the respawn countdown LIKE other events where I spawn back at the same place, but this doesn’t happen when I’m doing the scorchbeast event or am in a nuke zone.
---
CAMP interior "shelters" are coming later this year. The assumption is since it will be a different loading zone they can have a higher budget because it won't effect the server resources.
---
Interesting any specific vendors, like just vendors in the toxic valley? Or totally random
---
But Raiders aren't "chaotic", they are so nice that it makes me want to shoot a settler in the face.
---
Thanks mate but I’m on Xbox, appreciate the offer though
---
No specific vendor as far as I know.
---
Don't know how many times I've repeatedly hit the key for a stimpak several times and still get killed.
---
The damage bug wasn't 'fixed' more they made it harder to trigger, a 2 shot auto tesla rifle does that.
---
Vault steel is also for thorn and solar armor.
---
Is it too much to ask for a tiny out of the way display shelf for a single item?
---
Shhh.
---
I killed all the blood eagles on a camp and after a minute or two found a button. It just said button so I naturally pushed it. The alarm went off and a few more showed up. I also noticed whenever it goes off, either by me or and blood eagle a dog or two always shows up.
---
claim workshops, Join a team, do events.
---
Ceilings
---
So I’m guessing I just did what you did because I’ve gotten a bear arm to drop during Fasnacht. Lol I didn’t even realize I learned it.
---
Unfortunately you can’t even do that so don’t lie. You can’t sell if the vendor can’t afford it.
---
The vanilla in game weapons can drop from legendary enemies and from the purveyor at the rusty pick.the weapons that have been added you need to learn the plan..IE the fixer,bear arm and others like wastlanders dlc weapons for them to drop its random though
---
Honestly, I just want to be able to place down single items out of my inventory. Like the OCDecorator mod. I wanna place some Nuka Cola around my tables.
---
Thanks
---
That voice... omg that voice. Couldn't finish the video, sorry, but that was annoying AF.
---
No i think you got me wrong. 
---
If the vendor has enough scrip but you don’t, it will just give you whatever to fill up. So if you’re at 970 and The machine has 100 scrip still and you then turn in a 3* you’ll just get The 30 and not 40. Therefore losing 10 scrip
---
yea and if you buy six or sum be able to craft 5* legendaries for 6 modules but you have to have max gunsmith perk and alot of materials and they would be like level 100 or sumn
---
That sucks. That's certainly not my experience on Xbox. The things you describe happen very occasionally but certainly not normal. Hopefully you can find get better luck moving forward.
---
Do any of the gold armors have pockets?
---
You can deliberately craft only a few weapons:  Gauss Shotgun, Gauss Minigun, Gauss Pistol, Plasma Caster...the new weapons in Wastelanders that you buy the plans for with gold bullion.  Everything else?  RNG at the purveyor, or (better) collect several thousand caps and server hop to different player shops.
---
Yup it's all still there, I'm personally relieved I have so many old photos I want to keep that I thought were long lost.
---
Idk
---
Where is is this located?
---
Agree 100%.  I have also experienced all three of those bugs as well.  Insanely annoying.
---
With VATS, when it keeps missing like that, I have to back out of it, then back in and usually it will target correctly.
---
Perks don't seem to work under VATS for me either. (is this a feature or a bug? one never knows with this game)  If I target a high level charred ghoul in VATS for example, it will take 2-3 shots to down it.  When manually aiming, one shot one kill every time.
---
I find VATS so unreliable I use it solely for varmints.  Low level enemies that are hard to manually target like sting wings or blood bugs.  Never on anything high level.
---
With it not reloading or switching weapons after several button presses in a row, I think it's just a case where the game's mechanics simply can't walk and breathe at the same time without passing out due to lack of oxygen.  
---
It seems to happen to me when I'm walking or running.  If I come to a stop, it will now swap weapons after pressing the button again once motionless.
---
Have an ice cold Nuka-Cola, free cap with every bottle drunk.
---
BFFR for the queen, BE for everything else.
---
Huh. This strikes me as so odd. 200+ hours in, I've rarely had a bad experience at all. Lots of players follow me around when I'm with lower-level folks and just give us stuff for free. I do have the mics turned off which I'm sure is part of it but. Sounds like a string of very bad luck.
---
Well when people post like this it is hard to see you as more than an annoyance.
---
Why weren’t you running Pacifist?
---
thanks for the advice, but i have 2, and i'm afraid if i drink one the remainder will get sad
---
Lol. Trying to suspend my disbelief for the sake of the aesthetic.
---
I go to high level zones, kill all the enemies there, take their weapons and sell them.
---
Idk i completely forgot and thought i had it enabled
---
problem: i'm level 39 ://
---
It was a reward for earning Nuclear Winter XP last week
---
“You wouldn’t get it.”
---
Then you shouldn't be complaining. Turn on pacifist if you dont want to engage in PVP.
---
Sell stuff to the vendor bot. 1400 caps a day
---
He also stole my junk and attacked me while i was trying to assign stuff to my vendors
---
Yeah, this is true. You can get burned the same way so long as the machine has scrip to give you.
---
Lmao
---
It’s not like you respawn or anything
---
sometimes happens.
---
I'm not even sure if this is just some weird glitch or somebody actually put them there as all of them usually appear to be unowned.
---
Well Pacifist mode allows players to murder you
---
Why were you carrying junk? Put it in your stash box.
---
Yep I agree, the little bugs are mostly amusing but after 5000 hours on my main account and with nothing left to do, you can truly see how broken this game is. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy this game and keep logging in every morning but they really need to dedicate even just 1 person to sit down and just work on bug fixes for a few months. The VATS bug is annoying but the fast travel and respawn bug drives me insane.
---
If your tough enough, do the manhunt event every chance you get as it gives 120 caps everytime you complete it
---
Okay ty
---
I didn’t realize i was even carrying it in the first place
---
Yes. Yes please.
---
Does a yao guai shit in the wasteland?
---
Similar to them not giving a notice on why they pulled out of the IGN season gameplay trailer they didn't give us any info about that either.
---
Then that's your fault not his.
---
that’s a sick picture and congrats. also what level were you when you did it. I’m level 31 and I want to launch one but I’m worried about me being a low level.
---
He can’t kill you for no reason. Don’t attack a high level. If you lost enough junk to ruin your days store it next time
---
Kill animals take their meat, cook it and sell it to vendors
---
That’s still a high enough level to make a decent profits in the mire
---
A good way at level 39 is to farm some lower level areas with mole miners or super mutants. Black water mine or Grafton steel yard. Kill the enemies and grab all the weapons and armor you can, plus any chems. Head to a vendor and sell it all. Repeat until you have the 1400 caps from the vendor. After 20 hours, you can do it all again. Getting your daily 1400 will get easier as you gain levels. 
---
The next best way to gain caps is to sell stuff from your vending machine at your camp. Although at your level you most likely wont have too much that other players will want.
---
Yes
---
You can also sometimes find enemies that are 'legendary' (even 3-stars) but don't behave like a 'legendary' as in they don't mutate and also don't drop any legendary.
---
Another thing Bethesda called 'fixed' but oh well....
---
The solar and thorn armors use scout armor mods from the Enclave bunker so yes.
---
I guess that's an upside, but can you restore them to the gallery?
---
On top of having uses, if I remember correctly, they don't even weigh anything. If there's something that I haven't seen before, I'll just search it up to see if there's any point to keeping it.
---
I appreciate the effort!
---
If they are not landmarks on the maps I can build in them
---
Thanks for the info.
---
I actually saw somebody selling one after the event today for 9k caps, and serum recipes for 6k(Guessing he duped?).
---
I bought it, made my character broke but I figured I'll make the money back if I happen to earn one from the event someday
---
I clicked on it thinking it couldnt be that bad... it was worse
---
Ok. I´ll look it over one more time. I guess I never paid attention to what pacifist mode is and only once initiated a PvP defending a workshop.
---
p.s.: I didnt activate pasific mode. so maybe it was a bug.
---
yea
---
There isnt and hasn't ever been console. Maybe pc? There are outfits but no camp objects.
---
yea its bethesda the game will never be optimized
---
I'm not joking, put on green thumb go pick flowers at the whitesprings or really anywhere with a High concentration of flowers. If you're really afraid of going into the higher level areas.
---
I understand the frustration.
---
Aim at where they're going to be, not where they're at. FL jumping puts them in a static arc, that makes them predictable. Once you get the hang of it, FL isn't hard to counter.
---
I dont see how frog legs is to blame here 😐 sometimes u just can't kill everyone
---
Lol
---
They already removed the 3 private world perks from the current Fallout 1st page.
---
Seriously, all I want are some good serious outfits (bear costumes and masks are fine for those who like them, but just not for me), and a skin for the gatling gun.
---
But that said... I did buy the mothman backpack and eye patches. Atom store isn't all bad, they just need to start re-releasing more stuff more often so there's some illusion of variety there (while we wait for new releases).
---
Not there anymore is he?
---
[removed]
---
I wanted those so bad but I didnt have atoms at the time.
---
grinding and events like line in the sand but thats it
---
You can get them quite cheap last time i checked, 150per flux
---
&gt; and Bethesda needs to immediately put out a press release detailing every detail about what happened
---
Um, they should. You're saying you don't want to know the reason why literally all of Bethesda game servers went offline? You'd rather them stay quiet?
---
The fuck am I saying, this subreddit thrives on Bethesda staying quiet.
---
It was most likely something wrong with their new MA system since it went down the same day they released it and it didn't affect just FO76, it took down most of their stuff.
---
Depends what resolution you're running? 4k+ it's probably about right, under 4k 40 FPS sounds low.
---
he iz baibee
---
There are a few tweaks that can make a world of difference. YouTube / Google it. I've got mine frame locked at 72 with a 1080ti and it hardly ever dips below that on the highest settings.
---
Why are you so upset? Don't get mad because people call bethesda out on their BS. They're greedy and apathetic towards the playerbase. They've proven that from since the announcement of F76. Remember when we were promised mod support and shop will be cosmetic only? Seriously go back and re-watch the reveal. 
---
The game is buy to play, with a pretty pricey subscription, and also has in-game microtransactions. Not to mention the game forces you into a corner with the absurd amount of crafting materials and the limited stash weight - sort of forcing the player to buy F1st for extra storage.
---
I don't care about re-skin for ranger armor or the survival tent. Exclusive discounts were promised for fallout 1st members. Now we get discounts and shit that re-enters the shop every other week it seems. When was the last time a new piece of bundle had a discount for fallout 1st members? Oh that's right, never.
---
I'm sorry but you're a joke.
---
You said they were being vague when they said things like extended camp budget, expanded build area on private worlds, and persistent workshops for private world. How the fuck is them literally listing those 3 perks being vague? And even IF it was vague (which it's not) that is still no excuse. It's going to be a year soon and we have yet to see or hear of those features. They even went ahead and removed it from the current Fallout 1st page. Which is a good indication they have zero plans to add it unless someone stirs up some shit and reminds people- and that's what i'll keep doing, while you keeps your buried in the sand.
---
Both are good but if ur not running all 5 stars or some in demolition perk then go for bffr
---
Loot everything, scrap it. Keep what you need, bulk and sell the rest to bot vendors.
---
dont forget to sell the aid items you loot.  At one point, I realized part of my weight issue was the 300 of stimpacks, radaways etcI had picked up...made a good amount of caps that day!
---
Yeah well that's anecdotal. Personally I rolled 40 armor piece (400 modules or 2000 scrip) a few weekend ago and literally did not even get one armor piece with the unyielding prefix, not even a 1 star.
---
Just not more reason to scrap PA
---
Yes. He still randomly "dies" after respawn or I won't turn invisible for other players at all.
---
Still there?
---
The aesthetic is spot on, dope af
---
I guess
---
line in the sand and launching nukes
---
No game I've ever played has had downtime that wasn't due to a dos attack
---
Personal experiences don't mean anything. Would you care to say you would be fine with Steam limiting your access to your library without prior warning? Somethin tells me ya wouldn't...
---
Yes....good ....good....let the hate fester.
---
Like I wrote before... continue to pester. Go out of their way. And then yes.
---
Events, trading and even PvP
---
Luckily the only glitch I've had with weapons is that my Harpoon Gun has all of the harpoons loaded at once. So I can just continue to fire without reloading.
---
I built this at the Raider Windmill north of Grafton, a preexisting structure where you can place a CAMP. Those stairs were already there.
---
I wish I was this creative. 😂😭
---
he is. Looking right at him
---
yup. but business is picking up so keep trying
---
Hopefully with patch 20 on the 30th we will get pockets for SS armor limbs, but don't hold your breath. This is Bethesda we're talking about.
---
Man i hate when this happens i feel ur pain 😭😂
---
They’re pretty dang good against trash mobs but the condition, ammo cost, and ammo weight imply they’re probably the worst weapon class to use for that situation. And as you said, any beefy/boss type target will shrug it off like a gentle whisper in their ear. 
---
My mirv breaks in 4 shots and even with the explosive ammo weight perk the nukes still weigh over a half pound lol. But man, Bethesda and balance go together like peanut butter and motor oil so my hopes aren’t high
---
i want it there is a desktop painting of it i think its either in a backroom in the nuclear power plants or the prison on the cell side across from the protectrons i was going to save it but autoscrap got it first
---
its not an outage per say but an authentication issue. my guess this has to do with them adding two factor auth.
---
nope T-65 uses normal scrap
---
Hasn't changed that I've seen. Were you previously using the Travel perk in Charisma?
---
make friends that are high level
---
Getting to redeem double the usual amount would be preferred. It's not that hard to stock up on notes, especially if you farm Encryptid, Scorched Earth, Rad Rumble, and Project Paradise. You'll be swimming in notes in no time!
---
Delayed response but hey futures looking bright finally!
---
I love this!!!! I’m getting earthship vibes!! So creative
---
Dunno bout you, but my Currency refreshed 2 times yesterday heh
---
Is this recently, or all the time. Some times there are things happening on the  server side. Then again, it might just be best to play in 1080p.
---
Maybe they have done it because u can get legendary effects like jungs weighs 20% less etc. If u jabe these perks i guesss u don't need the additional carry weight anymore
---
holy shit literally all your posts is just going around defending bethesda and being a dick to people who dare to rightfully criticize them. you defend them like they owe you something, get a fucking grip on reality.
---
Aaahhh lol. I went to the Charleston fire station
---
Be for pve, bffr for pvp. Because of damage cap etc
---
😎
---
I definitely get where they were coming from. Whenever another person helps me(even irl), I typically like to show my gratitude in some way. Since I don't have anything in-game that people generally need, I usually give away tons of purified waters since I have an overabundance and it's a simple item that everyone could use.
---
The only time i saw a creature in a pack like that was when i went to the capitol building and there like 30 or  more ghouls just in a hallway.  Got a explosive handmade so i managed to kill half of the pack in like 2 shots then got overwhelmed. I love this game sometimes.
---
Wait... you didn’t store junk in 100+ hours of playing?
---
Yes, cuz jumping in the air is a good way to counter guns
---
It's literally the best armor in the game...
---
yea they do that they are the crunchy melee version of the assaultron laser
---
Longshoreman outfit! 🙌🏻 and clean spacesuit
---
Just get better simple as that
---
This is what makes no sense to me.
---
hard bodies or just hardened masses?
---
Nice!
---
Hey man, wanted to reply again because I bought the farmable dirt tiles from foundation earlier today and couldn’t build them in my camp.  The option just wasn’t there in floors where it’s supposed to be, checked at foundation and it showed as if I’d never read the plan.  Logged back in 6ish hours later and was able to build them.  So I hope that your situation may be resolved like mine.  Xbox here if that matters.
---
You gonk
---
It’s great that everyone has opinions and that things like this are never actually right or wrong, isn’t it?
---
Purified water. Get lots of it. Curse those who lock up their water purifiers. They are scum of the earth who would sell their own mothers for 5 caps if they could. Take grape mentats. Boost that charisma. Sell to npc vendor. Profit. Bask in those free easy caps. Blow your caps on that over inflated item for 5000 caps. Weep when you see it for 50 caps at another vendor. Such is life.
---
Thanks for the story. Gives me some hope!
---
Its supposed to be 50, but apparently there's a bug causing the level 20 thing.
---
You can't craft rounds, but you can convert it to use cells for a damage loss if you know the plan.
---
The weapon is hot garbage, nothing of value was lost.
---
Lmao sounds like they forgot to let you know it was an endless harpoon gun
---
Since they primarily do melee damage, try the level 3 Blocker perk (Strength). It cuts their damage by almost half.
---
I was getting wrecked by them too, until I got this perk.
---
I don't have anything significant to add, but I'd like to know the answer to this too.
---
Damn dude that sucks, I was level 93 when I got mine the day before yesterday and it was level 50
---
Exact same thing for me just now. Third try worked perfectly. So frustrating considering this mission is so fing long
---
1920/1080
---
I’m playing in 1080, and i just installed it today.
---
that is besides the point since im talking about the support here , the second i did alot of weight manegement to make me able to fast walk while overencumbered and store most of my itens also: Remember the scrapbox is behind a paywall.
---
It's a bug. They said it was fixed, but I guess it got unfixed. There's an unmarked location where you can get AB rounds, but that's it.
---
No. But I once took my anger out on the chickens at Foundation via orbital strike.
---
Fs
---
From what i can find there are no red rocket themed plans in the plan loot list.

Yeah I’m not setup for encryptid, but I’ll tag the pylons. I wish the ones that stand around waiting for someone to get the pylons would at least clear the area around them of bots so I don’t waste half my stimpacks suicide running thru them to get to the pylons.
---
I play pretty much exclusively with a DS4, what issue are you having with it?
---
I love when ppl get creative with their CAMP instead of just having it be utilitarian. 👏🏼
---
theres a place its big and open it has a cave full of dead animals its at like the very top corner when you need a bloat fly gland to get the bug spray for the pioneer scouts guy in the mire that place seems creepy
---
I haven't played the last couple of days. It was being buggy, and then I guess the servers were down all day yesterday. To tell the truth, I'm kind of scared to try it out. However, I run a 2600x with an RX580, and I get around 60 FPS, even though it'll drop in high density places, like Whitespring and Harper's Ferry.
---
This was how I made most of my caps back in my FO4 days
---
I sell fat stacks of useful resources in my vendors at a good price, made around 8k caps in 4 hours one day
---
If it dips occasionally or in certain areas such as a player's base around whitesprings that's normal, but if it's happening all the time and doesn't return to normal quickly that isn't right. Your GPU is technically better than mine and I run 3440x1440 and it's 70fps minimum except for occasional dips especially around whitespring.
---
Try update your drivers or do a clean install.
---
Floating in space forever ...
---
Jeez. This all sounds great. I can already hear the wails and screams of agony coming from the dungeon of the old Creative Engine the game is running on.
---
Yea but even at level 50 it was only doing 30 damage a shot, I don't think it's a very good weapon tbh, it's definitely worth the scrip you can sell it for tho
---
Awesome congrats!
---
I am aware scrap box is behind a paywall. I don’t have one. I also don’t walk around with 100 hours worth of junk. That makes zero sense.
---
There is a Red Rocket garage prefab that’s been linked to the Atomic Shop, which would probably also arrive with the wallpapers and other missing bits
---
EDIT: Turns out the prefab is the only thing missing from this batch of ATX datamines. There was an issue where the Red Rocket roller door wall panel was replaced by the one that would be used with the prefab, and the whole thing was removed by Beth in a “hotfix”. https://m.imgur.com/a/Jqq5Awa
---
There is also a bunch of Slocum Joes stuff due to come, which also appears to be for the Atomic Shop, so maybe the prefab will arrive then
---
Plot twist. Wendigos used to wear PA.
---
Despite the outage there are still social menu issues. On PS4 the one friend who I have played with decided to boot the game back up and he can see me his list but I can't see him on mine. He has to load into a server to get the option to join mine. After joining mine he can send a team invite since I can only accept it if he's on my recent list. I tried all of the fixes I could find online and even removed him from my friend list and sent an invite from inside the game. Still busted.
---
Well sucks to be my character cause shes deathly afraid of becoming one xD
---
Truly a terrifying encounter.  
---
Bethesda must make wendigo power armor when they add the new boss event.
---
You know you can put stuff in your stash box right?  It's free.
---
Cranberry relish.
---
Equip Green Thumb.
---
Go to Silva Homestead. Grab all the corn.*
---
Go next door to Billings Homestead. Grab all the razorgrain.*
---
* may need to kill a few things.  Don’t takeover the workshop
---
Sell all the corn and razorgrain. Optional collect dirty water and wood and cook food with the corn/razorgrain. 
---
Easy caps for anyone.
---
Shotgun
---
Sending madd dog back to jail is 120 caps...I didnt knownit till a week ago and it takes like 3 minutes and it is always on.
---
What perks do u mean? Ones that were never said to be a sure thing?
---
Its not like youre behind, I woulnt worry about it till 50+
---
Even better if you do CAMP construction... at least when you craft you are warned what items are being destroyed (if any). Building just trundles along with nary a peep, eating all your lockets, cigar boxes and whatnot.
---
They suck, too weak, too heavy, ammo is too expensive to craft and their durability is shit, I had a heavy weapons explo build but went back to ballistic weapons. Bethesda could really show some love here, to have more variety
---
Best of luck!
---
Either was that or enjoy the game at the slowest speed still besides the point of the post.im talking about the bethesda support on bugs that happen. I just talked about my experiences since that's what affects me the most I wouldnt mind if I lost it on a pvp engagement. I'm mad because gamebreaking bugs happen and so solution part support.
---
I've seen a few things saying June 30th, but I'm not 100% sure.
---
It’s like the family trip to Disneyland. The adults are excited and doing their best to keep the kids happy until they get there. Kids hate the entire vacation. 
---
Once there the kids are still fighting except now who gets to do something before the rest and complaining when they have to wait. 
---
The adults keep trying to squeeze in some good times, happy memory building and smile knowingly at other adults whose kids are also complaining. 
---
Then before they leave the kids want all the toys and complain the entire way home that it ended too soon and they want to go back. 
---
Fallout is like Disneyland for me. I still enjoy it even if I have to endure complaining children. Pick your side. Lol
---
I would really like it, if there were (even if it was FO 1st exclusive). The XBox one S (and I guess by extension, the original PS4) were never meant for this game. With launch of next gen consoles around the corner, the hell if I'm spending $600 for the X (or PS4 pro). My PC runs it better. Let me have access to all my old toons.
---
I really want cross play too, because I bought this on XBox to play with my kid, but he doesn't really play it anymore. The only real friend I have who does, plays on playstation. So, now I've got a bunch of strangers, Bethesda calls friends, I only join for certain events; rather than someone to just chill with.
---
Find the marine tactical helmet plan, it spawns in cranberry bog either in the train car near watoga station with the submachine gun skeleton or drop site c2 that I know of (it has gutsys, so beware if not a stealth build). Server hop until you find it, craft 30-40 since they're dirt cheap and sell for 30ish caps a helmet.
---
Our knowing why the servers went down has zero effect on anything. 
---
Game servers go down all the time and the most you ever see on average outside of MASSIVE multi day outages is some brief notification of "We're experiencing difficulties and working to address it" which bethesda has been communicating here ever since people started freaking the fuck out.
---
You people are treating this like someone just hacked the fucking Pentagon and congress is demanding a full independent investigation.
---
Thank you yeah Mybad I’m new to this reddit posting
---
Everytime I see it. Once you get the key for the dam it gets faster and even more cost effective.
---
it definitely scales up. i’m level 120 and have some friends around level 20-30 and their fast travel is significantly cheaper than mine is. not sure if it scales by wealth or by level, but it’s definitely something
---
What Bethesda sees when they read your post: dailies for NW are too easy. Need to fix place your camp and photo ones.
---
But still why would you carry that much junk on your character, knowing that death results in loss of said junk?
---
I immediately put those in stash since I save 'em for screw day... wait, that came out all wrong ;)
---
Before the most recent version of Vendorgate, I had a solid stack of silver lockets, new toy trucks, cigar boxes and others that were both light and easy enough to obtain for day where you need to scrap for screws or fiberglass. I don't bother collecting for springs since it's easy and cheap to bulk and scrap.
---
A lot of assumptions here...
---
Dont use VATS with UGL, it eats up cores real quick.
---
Yeah it seems I'm well aware about that mechanic at this point
---
I like the idea of the visual distortion thing. As for AP i tend to use sunshine oil if i need that. Maybe faster movement speed/reload could work.
---
Also not enough space for my junk
---
No chance
---
I saw that!! And I want it so bad!!
---
So far it pretty much is. It persists even when swapping weapons or closing the game. Haven't run out of harpoons to see if will still load them all it once or not. I just wish the thing didn't break so quickly. I have zero room for the luck perk unless I want to get rid of Bloody Mess.
---
You can get allied without finishing the main quest. You just can't get bullion and thus can't buy the Gauss Minigun, but there is nothing to stop you from grinding your reputation to allied before doing the Vault raid.
---
If there was no max caps, I would have opened a million presents last weekend and be sitting on crazy caps. Know what happens when I buy stuff from people since I can afford anything. It would be like trying to win an eBay auction against bill gates.......
---
Well yeah, but I also wanna get to the shop. I'm obsessed with getting camp plans.
---
I agree , this painting is awsome
---
The Dude abides!
---
If you've done the quest for the BOS armor paints be prepared for the same frustrating moments. Some things roll your way right away other times it takes a long time and a lot of rolls.
---
You lose 500 rep if you take 1000 gold, which is about 1/6 of the bar to allied and about three days worth of reputation grind. But if you are already at allied level with the Raiders you could just do the raid with the Settlers and take all the gold for yourself and not take a single hit to your reputation with the Raiders. I did exactly that.
---
No not really. With enough grinding you can eventually achieve max rep with both factions.   A lot of people suggest keeping 100 percent of the bouillon. Their argument is that you don't lose much rep with your chosen faction. The problem is that you miss out on a fairly nice rep  boost by  giving 50 percent.  So I would give 50 percent. You have plenty of time  to grind for bullion
---
Most I’ve ever had was 1800 I think, and that’s cause I was saving it for a piece of the t65 (helmet I think?) and I immediately spent that once I had it.
---
Of course not. Our one true Todd needs those $$$.
---
Then sell it.
---
I don't mind if I lost it on a game intended way
---
Everything a fucking assumption, the difference is how the facts line up behind those assumptions.
---
Either Bethesda forgot they were going to offer discounts and then entirely separately happened to take all of this exclusive 1st shit they had sitting around and started giving it away for free... or Bethesda had these exclusive items set aside all along to sell at a discount and quickly decided to just put them up for free to keep people happy.  
---
One of those situations makes a hell of a lot more sense than the other.
---
That BE will break sooner. BFFR is more versatile.
---
If I don't want to?
---
I remember the first time playing Halo online. A bunch of kangaroos. It almost ruined the game for me because it was nothing like Halo just looked like Halo.
---
Damn well that sucks, thought they'd be able to connect it via [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) similar to how bungie does it with Destiny. Guess we can keep wishin'.
---
As a father of two I can say this would benefit me, I barely can keep up with earning 20 a day.
---
Takes maybe an hour tops to get through the three or four objectives before you have full access. Next time you’re on and just messing around maybe you can do it! I don’t think level is important unless you want to try and defeat the deathclaws.
---
Just nerf bloodied builds and junkies easy fix for the pvp problems. Then people are less likely to just one shot people and we can have actual pvp fights
---
Yeah.  I was originally going for the shotgun. Now I’m not sure if I want that or if I want to get SS armor.  
---
I just haven’t spent the bullion as I’m trying to figure out what I want first.
---
Because? Caps dont wt anything.
---
You cant spam frog legs. You get 2 jumps then theres a cool down. Unless you're on PC then you can just get ficked because of all the hacking.
---
The systems in place to slow progression down. It adds RNG to something that you would expect to be guaranteed to stop people just farming legendaries all day. 
---
So with the current system someone that only logs in for an hour or two once a week can still get some decent equipment but for people that play 10 hours a day every day of the week can't just amass a huge collection of equipment quickly. It's unfortunate that duping has effectively made this system pointless and now there's way too many amaze-balls weapons around.
---
The system is quite obvious when you watch it, you get 2 and 3 star drops, occasionally it will do a 1 star on a 3 star enemy but you get good drops, and then for a few hours you get 1 stars constantly with an occasional 2/3 star so you don't go insane, and then it goes back to normal and repeats.
---
I really need to do a spreadsheet on it and try find the complete pattern. Although I have noticed it is at least bound to the account, if you switch chars in the middle of the 1 star drops it persists to the different character. I'm not sure if it affects the whole server at the same time as I'm usually solo farming private server.
---
Fun fact. The spotlight turret only take as much budget as 1 light. Rather than the budget of a turret.
---
Increased camp budget on private worlds, increased camp build area, and persistent workshops.
---
Not sure how you can say they weren't a sure thing, when it was literally listed on their first advertisement page for Fallout 1st.
---
Every one has his/her game style. I'M trying to discuss the helpfulness of the support not about my decisions in game
---
Just spend your caps. On plans you don’t have, on player vendor items, etc. Do your part to stimulate the economy and the. having max caps won’t be a problem.
---
Yeah having the ability to just switch consoles and play your same character with different friends would just be great, hopefully they're able to find a way to add it 😔
---
+karma for successfully locating bot, also for use of “gonk”
---
Think my next goal is the plasma caster, and then maybe the gauss shotgun.
---
I’m just waiting for those concrete tire walls to come back. Maybe the raider vending machine to sell chems from. And maybe that stage made from scaffolding. Would be nice for crafting
---
Who is nukacrypt and are they on the ps4
---
Just wanted to point out you make bad ones....have a good night!
---
Sell Purified Water farmed from your own or other player’s camps. Sell Glowing Meat/steaks (from Scorched Earth or other events). Sell high value weapons like combat rifles and shotguns dropped from mole miners or mutants. Sell unwanted chems like Rad-X and extra Stimpaks (you shouldn’t need more than 15-20). Basically sell everything you don’t need and you should have no problem hitting the daily 1400 cap limit.
---
I'd like to see the response to the above comment because as far as i'm aware none of it is false.
---
&gt; All the content we ever put out for Fallout 76,” explains Hines; “all the DLC, all the post-launch stuff, is going to be free. That’s important. And to say, the Atomic Shop is cosmetic stuff.
---
Quote from an interview with Pete Hines. Bethesda did say cosmetic only.
---
The initial page for fallout 1st did list those 3 perks and they are now removed from the current fallout 1st page.
---
What's the argument here? Are people upset that Bethesda is being called out?
---
Lol side with the Institute!  I am a level 45 now. I picked it up again after wastelanders.  This place is great on answering any questions you have.
---
Let them fix the several current issues first guys, this will just add more load to the servers inevitably. So it probably won't even be feasible on their end due to limitations.
---
Caps are not useful you sell them a lower rate than you buy if I needed 1k of a certain junk I coulnt buy back still not about the main objective of the post but like I explained I like to have every thing that I needed on hand make my gameplay enjoyable caps can't repair my armour or guns caps can't make me ammo
---
I find it’s a cheap way to kill crippled enemies. Or ghouls from a high ground
---
I just rolled my eyes.
---
It’s all good friend—way to put yourself out there and give it a go.
---
A jetski can bring you happiness.
---
I understand that your point of view on this post was not to discuss about what is in the tittle but to waste my time
---
If I happen to down a player through absolute blind luck, I leave them as bait. If they are solo, they die. If they are on a team, I can lure in a teammate. Its worked once. I usually get killed by the teammate. Oh well.
---
About to sub for a year just because of this post.
---
Good? 95% of the people playing this game just want the "pvp" bullshit gone anyway. The baiting people into pvp thing was the worst part of this game. (Even worse than the bugs and the launch)
---
They should just removed pvp entirely so yall bitchy pvpers move on to ganking people in some other game.
---
This right here.  Is knowing going to change anything at all for the players?  Nope.  People here are way too entitled.
---
Glad to have you back, fellow Vaultdweller! Thank you for sharing your story, and keep fighting that good, tough, fight. You’ll always have friends in Appalachia.
---
Yes, let the butthurt flow through you!  
---
But seriously they already got that money its a moot point.
---
You should go try the wildy if you want to gank some noobs.
---
Anything you put on the ground can be lost. 
---
I understand why bethesda don't help you, because if they did they would open the flood gates from people saying they lost things they put on the ground.
---
I know you died, but the only thing that gets dropped at that point is junk. And the same rules apply.
---
Since fallout 4
---
&gt;I’d love to know how much your subs drop because of this...
---
Transparency is not in Bethesda's play book.
---
Sounds like you already do enough of that by not storing a HUNDRED + hours of junk and relying on these servers.  But I wish you well in your future endeavors!
---
Sell junk in your vendors at a reasonable price. Steel one cap per. You can sell acid, plastic and lead for a bit more caps per. People will buy it. 
---
Straight Jackets from the asylum sell for 42 caps each from the bot vendors if you have hard bargain maxed.
---
Yea, I mean - I especially vote for a settler or a person who simply offers the goods like any other merchant. It would solve the problem of not having enough 'allies' in CAMP as well. Just please please please don't give them lots of repeating and annoying dialog.
---
Also, I wish they would scrap the idea of having 4 vendors and just combine it into one.
---
Not gonna happen with all the hackers on the pc version, I literally just saw someone on facebook selling a broadsider with a gatling barrel that shoots orbital strikes.
---
I love the word gonk. 
---
also [https://youtu.be/PEsfMfN6fj4](https://youtu.be/PEsfMfN6fj4)
---
Can anyone explain why it even has a cap? I mean just cap the amount you can hold  and allow as much turn in as you want. No cap on selling and turn in, just on the amount you can carry will have higher buy/sell turn around too.
---
It's funny because Bethesda Game studios is actually in maryland.
---
You’re literally missing my point...
---
For those of us that don’t grief and just PvP with each other it’s shitty behaviour from Bethesda to take out PvP.
---
We paid to play a game and it’s been changed why does that seem acceptable?
---
Sorry sir you used an emoji, you've already signed your life away
---
Explosives builds in general were a casualty of the nerf made to make it so TSE wasn't the one and only way to endgame....bloodied just instantly took it's place and the meta hasn't changed in over a year now.
---
Thank you
---
That’s you call dude...
---
Those were talked about for future updates when they could make them happen. No where does it say this is a sure thing that will happen on this date. If u bought 1st because of that then read better next time
---
What I'd recommend if you'd like to make your own ammo is to first get an excavator power armor set. (there's plenty of materials around whitesprings and for black titanium, there's quite a few mole miners in the mines just east of the place)
---
With the power armor, you get twice as much ore when mining. "Lucky hole" has tons of lead ore(and some crystal). I find it better to have plenty of lead ore as it's much lighter than having lead(without weight reduction perks at least). 
---
As for acid for smelting, I farm cave crickets in "tanagra town" which is in a giant "tree" south of the abandoned waste dump(east edge of the map).
---
If you get "scrapper", the mole miners as previously mentioned or the super mutants in West Tek will drop plenty of weapons that you can scrap for even more steel. 
---
Not sure what I can recommend for cloth scraps(I tend to come across a decent amount but banknotes maybe?) but I hope this helps. If you're on ps4, I could probably help you out with ammo and toss some more stuff your way. I'm a bit of a hoarder so even just taking stuff off my hands helps me lol
---
He’s literally the guy whose a square.
---
Lets sell a game and then take the selling points of it out!!! Well done Bethesda!
---
My dad is a broad-accented Yorkshireman (Barnsley) and “gonk” is one of his go-to insults, alongside “chump”. I’m owm to you now - wish me luck! Thanks for doing this, too. You’re a true MVP.
---
The only useable heavy explosive weapon I have is a junkies auto grenade launcher, but the ammo is heavy and the damage isn’t great on high health creatures so I use it for groups of light enemies like scorched. 
---
Homing missile launchers are pretty alright in pvp with guided missiles, if a player is wanted and you can sneak up on them while they’re out in the open the homing range is pretty long so you can pop off enough missiles to kill them before they even realize what’s happening. But since mine was two shot and broke in like 10 shots from 200% condition... eh... I’ll take my chances with a good old fashioned Gatling gun. 
---
Heavy explosive weapons need a lot of fixing from Bethesda, I don’t even care about the damage I just want them to fix the god awful durability, 10 shots then a workbench repair is absurd, especially for a rocket launcher which logically wouldn’t require so much maintenance. It’s a big tube that vents hot propellant gasses out of a hole in the back, it doesn’t have to deal with the stresses of high recoil and chamber pressure like a regular old gun.
---
Never...
---
Tamed animals don't take up budget!
---
I agree! If they hit the right servers/connections it would cripple power, economy, anything "connected"... Which is everything and even more is getting connected at a faster pace as we shift to a working from home mentality. Pure science fiction? Maybe.. maybe not. I thought that about a pandemic too.
---
Nope, you didn't.  ffr weapons might have made it SEEM that way.  OR multi projectile legacies.  But you were hit with more than 1 projectile if you were killed from full health.
---
The trap base who knows maybe it was the traps that killed you, traps are not damage capped like pvp is.
---
ppl routinely complain I "1 shot" them with a ffr handmade but I'm 100% certain I never have done so.  I've had it happen to me so I understand that it's hard to discern the individual hits and definitely feels like it.
---
I understand that but in a mmo the game and the server should have logs enough to help the support team have some decisions based on something not just assume like they said to me I could be in a trade to that I respond I was not! You must have some logs to prove of that.
---
Dude, this is insane!
---
he iz ded baybee
---
Truly magnificent look. I shall put it above my ~~bed~~ lead extractor to scare thieves away.
---
I mean clearly it's working against you
---
 you are right I shouldn't thrust these server!
---
Not that I disagree with you tho lol, the PvP in this game is messed up
---
Just as a reminder though, after the +50 weight duration, you're at a -50 weight for a minute. It's important to try and let them know to use it only for fast traveling.
---
I don't know about strength, but it definitely restores your HP, if it is down.  I have routes for farming Bobble Heads and magazines, which also includes certain random spawn spots I swing through, because sometimes they are fun.  I have sniffed the pipe of life numerous times, ever since they started showing up after Wastelanders dropped.  If your HP bar is low, you can watch it quickly fill back up, while you are enjoying the lovely psychedelic views!  :)
---
People talk about Beth like they are owed something as well so it’s both ways
---
I tried it once and it had the same stock. You could try a couple of times.
---
Yup thats why people started nuking the bunker and making the forest area or one of the little bases the spawn point to the fight. Otherwise people just stay on top of the bunker or jump on the fence.
---
I just wish they lasted for longer than like 30 seconds or so
---
Maybe as long as people can’t tag other random player’s camps. Lol. That would turn into a nightmare! 😂
---
I feel this. 
---
I didn't know how much I wanted this until I played with a friend who would look everything up online and share it with me without my asking. I'm the type that likes to figure things out in game.
---
Then I accidentally came across GTA:O RP on YT and I've been watching that, wishing I had a gaming PC. 
---
I would love to RP an Atom Cats garage.
---
They probably do, but they have a strict policy that they dont replace stuff lost that was dropped on the ground. Bug or otherwise. 
---
Don't take it personal.
---
Google is your friend. I'm on fandom fallout wiki the whole time I'm playing
---
Closed game and reloaded and got different stock, only red/green skiing outfit, but I’ll keep trying.
---
I'm not wanting to start some sort of war, but this is honest to god the first time I've ever seen someone in a Fallout 76 community express disdain for Fallout 4. I'd assumed that if someone didn't like 4, they sure as hell wouldn't like 76.
---
Hahaha indeed it would
---
Better yet just add in spraypaint cans as weapons so we can make our own signs
---
I'm a geordie. We're practically neighbours.
---
Love it !
---
They wouldnt open the flood gates when they have enough evidences the only way that is more obvious is by logging relevant events of each character for example (probably there is a more solutions to this problem)
---
might be time to make an alt. just in case.
---
The only reason I ever side with the railroad is to keep deacon alive, god I love his voice lines
---
Cryo later does write nice messages😂 I confirmed this today👍
---
Hey, I'm sorry to hear you had a rough time, but it's good to hear you're getting back on your feet, and you're enjoying your time in Appalachia.
---
A fellow Welshman.
---
Baseball Bat, its pretty common, Good Damage, Decent Swing Speed, and you can make a Jet Powered Bat or Lucille from Walking Dead.
---
It would remind me of the mission in GTA San Andreas where you have to go into ballers territory to tag Grove Street everywhere
---
I agree completely. It’s cute to hear about that doctor, and your teas. It goes to show the possibilities of role playing. A tea shop? I never would have thought of that, but I would kill to have a dedicated tea shop on a server. And a doctor! How useful would that be??? I really hope something comes in the future, and if so, let me stop by, and let’s see how good your Jasmine Tea is, Uncle Iroh 🥰
---
Just pick up anything and everything, especially weapons, armour and chems. You’ll be surprised how much you can get for chems/other aid items. 
---
Bulk any junk you don’t want and sell them too! 
---
Make sure to have hard bargain on fully ranked if you have it and use any armour you have that increases charisma (especially unyielding legendary effect) if you have anything like that. Just make sure you lower your health when wearing unyielding so it kicks in. I always have a full set of this for when I sell things. You’ll max out daily caps for vendors in no time!
---
Good luck!
---
Unless you are a shotguns build already, I suggest the SS armor, it is awesome.  The dr is so high all around, it’s a great thing to have and gives purpose to legendary farming again.
---
I’m right there with you ☺️ Raiders are far superior, and it’s not chaos!
---
Yess, please more great roleplay! I have an adorable diner that I love when people hang out in. I just want to make food and be like, here, eat up! &lt;3
---
GTA:O is another place with a lot of role play potential. What accounts do you watch on YT?
---
That’s exactly the way I am with my bar &lt;3 I really hope something is in the works for the future, and if it is, let me know so I can stop by the diner!
---
The entire fallout 1st page from when it was announced has been cached so you can go read it yourself. Those perks were listed on there to be added, it's almost been a year and we still do not have them.
---
Furthermore they were removed from the current page, which indicates they have no plans to add them. That's called false advertising.
---
At no point on the page did they say "we may" add them, or "it's a possibility". It literally said "we're excited to add them in the future". Again, it's been almost a year, long overdue.
---
Preferably not Line in the Sand when it comes to events.
---
I think the best insults (when paired with accents) are shared between Geordies and Yokshiremen. Every woman I have ever dated has been referred to as “rammel” by my dad, which he tells me is a word for an old rag, not even useful for wiping as it’s too old and dirty. Classy bloke. In context, Bethesda approach to fixing bugs/keeping servers working is “a load of old rammel”
---
Things to remember:  
---
1)Scrap weapons/armor to learn mod plans  
---
2)You have an 800 lb. stash limit, so plan accordingly. Stocking up on an insane amount of consumables and ammo that you won't use adds up quickly.  
---
3)If you plan to do a lot of crafting, the scrap box that comes with fallout 1st is pretty essential if you don't want to be micromanaging your inventory all the time.  
---
4)Ammo is sparse in the beginning so keep a melee weapon for killing low level enemies.  
---
5)Make sure you have at least 5 luck because all end game builds will require that for the class freak/starched genes perks.  
---
6)Don't stock up on too many crafted food/drink items because they will spoil over time. Growing corn at your camp to make corn soup when needed is a good way to handle food/drink requirements easily and efficiently.  
---
7)Be prepared to switch around your perk cards a fair amount: things like crafting perks, repair perks, lockpicking perks, and hacking perks are situationally useful and can be swapped in when you need them.  [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124)  is a good tool for doing this using hotkeys.  
---
8)IMO automatic weapons are underpowered for how quickly they run through ammo.  
---
9)Also IMO, energy weapons tend to underperform their ballistic counterparts.
---
There already is, its 10.
---
HAHAHAHAHA!!!! If only they respected our opinions or cared of our distaste for certain actions. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
---
You are taking this personal. Move on, its not going to happen. 
---
Sucks but its not the end of the world.
---
Anyone know where to pick up the different power connector plans?
---
Guess what future was used for a reason and no dates were ever put so they could just not do it. Things change. Instead of being stuck on a talk from a year ago why not call them out of stuff that actually matters.
---
So why there is a support team even there for I thought it was to help also in this type of problems(game fault problems), on the early patches when Powerarmour could stack and bug the game at the point of freezing (it was a well known bug at the time) I lost my excavator when I reached the support I got the same answer. I understand that is a policy on part of bethesda but I think that is not a correct one.
---
You are refusing to accept the answers we are all telling you. I got nothing else to say.
---
For your future information, don't ask questions if you won't accept the answers.
---
only one I missed was the Crazy Man, oh well
---
The most recent one I've been watching is Zez
---
I believe it is lower for characters under level 25.
---
Not until deep pocketed limbs come out
---
No I understand that they have certain rules to follow. but I want to know if you agree if the support rules imposed by bethesda in this case are fair since I had nothing to do with it and it was game fault.
---
Why are you  on a gaming forum... to call us losers? Cause my guess is your reading DR. Suess if your even reading at all.
---
Like weapon balances and duping
---
never heard of rammel before.
---
you get 40 and a chance for legendaries
---
What matters more than promising a paid for service and not delivering? And why remove it from the current page?
---
Oh I guess I never used turrets. That makes sense

No jasmine at the moment; jasmine blooms in summer and it seems we’ve had a last week of October that’s lasted almost two years now, according to my Pip-Boy. Fortunately, I’ve been able to harvest a good amount of rose I can steep up that is sure to have all the wastelanders and more naive robots believe your stories about raiders stealing your photos and selling for better prices!
---
AKA Be a moisture farmer like Uncle Owen.
---
They are fair for the simple fact they apply the same to everyone.
---
A player sold them to the vendor.
---
Someone probably sold them to him
---
Since you just installed, you probably have everything set to ultra. Google fallout76 video settings, I forget who wrote it but there is a very good review of the settings and how the settings are not optimized. So you think you’re doing your game experience a solid by kicking up the settings due to big hardware energy, but really you’re just killing it.
---
A player probably crafted a ton of those and sold them to a vendor as they are relatively cheap to craft.
---
When 1st released did it ever say that those were included right now at this moment? No those were future updates at best and taking them off the page what should have been done. It tells u exactly what u get when I buy first
---
*is stuck in control pad

Hey

Oh interesting

Sounds like GameStop exchange to me 😂

What's Nukacrypt? Like a YT channel?
---
Insert funny James franco meme
---
lmao boy youre fucking delusional arent you. its been 9 months since fallout 1st was announced. thats aprox $117 from then to now for fallout 1st. youre basically asking people to justify spending $100+ for a preorder of a perk from a service theyre already paying for. you are a fucking moron if ive ever encountered one on these forums. jesus christ the dumbfounded and delusional people who defend this predatory company with their greedy practices never ceases to amaze me.
---
youre like one of those in-denial assholes who ignored covid19 stay at home orders and jeopardized the lives of healthcare workers and other people.
---
Like if they change the rules it would still be for everyone. I'm not saying them to make exceptions I'm saying probably to make some new rules that are more flexible like in case of game problems they would apply or at least look into it deeply to get some insight of the what happend to decide the outcome because the ones they are applying are basic. I believe that blizzard when it comes to Wow they do a better job.
---
Exactly! It really hardly matters what level it is, it’s not a viable weapon, and you can’t craft ammo unless you make it even worse by modifying it. I think it’s one of Bethesda’s many jokes that we keep falling for.
---
Let's go with no dialogue just to be safe =)  Just a nice quiet vendor who walks around your camp.
---
You can only put items on display in display cases.
---
Srry u want the moon for your 14 dollars a month. If u truly think they did anything bad sue them for false advertising. Then I will believe that u got screwed over.
---
Hey, you playing on console or pc?
---
It’s low cost to fast travel at early levels but doesn’t “scale” in any way beyond that.
---
Can’t wait to find even more hidden weapon balancing changes! I’ll keep a very close eye on this one. Maybe they’ll nerf the lead pipe next!
---
I'm not saying I agree with the rules. But I am glad they dont make exceptions.  Wanting an exception for you wont happen. Even if they do it going forward. Good luck
---
well when you're paying for something, you are owed for it. or do you pay for stuff and expect nothing in return? if thats the case let me send you my paypal email and you can send me money.
---
The Scourge queen is kind of like a pony.... a flying sexy pony....
---
Very creative out of the box thinking, nicely done.
---
$14 is quite a lot as far as a subscription goes.
---
You’re a good man (or woman) Rammadeus. I caught one of your Charleston bot posts before and have missed a few since but it’s great that you do this service.
---
Go to the steam library, find the Fallout 76 exe, right click it, and run it as Administrator.
---
Ps4
---
Well you could server hop to farm the AB ammo at the tnt dome in the forest
---
Which sucks
---
Only if they will let you spend them all.  I know I am hardly at the top with 620 of them waiting, but a large portion of the population will never spend the ones they have.  At least the exp will help everyone since you need so many perk points for the coming legendary perk system
---
Yeah, and?
---
You can get the Bow plan and all the "mods" plans too from a Travelling merchant, that can spawn in certain locations. I got it before starting Wasteland quest line, be prepared to pay quite hefty prices though, might be a problem at lvl 5 (I recommend following the Overseer quest line for while till you get the big Water purifier and start farming caps by selling water, easy money)...
---
I used the one NW of Vault 76, near Anchor Farm, just kept server hopping till I found one selling, took a while though, its all RNG. When you login, its just few second run on the road for the spot, quite easy to find, small clearing and big tree, usually there is some NPCs there, or mobs can spawn too.
---
Sounds like a steam issue, does it do this with other games? If not check the integrity of the files
---
Idk, the charred feral ghouls have always been level 62 for me.
---
I'm a man, man. 
---
It's just fortunate i dont have anything else better to do.
---
Honestly I think croos-save would open the door to waaaaay too much hacking and duping and as a console player that was the biggest issue with COD:MW going crossplay - not the performance differences but the over saturation of aimbots and hacks.In a game that is kinda loot driven, I think that would destroy any fun.
---
Make sure you get a fully leveled starched genes perk card equipped first!
---
Compared to? What other games have subs that you play? Just curious. This is the only main one I have played in a while.
---
 I just tried and it says that an audio file and input file are missing and it’s saying I should reinstall the program. How do I do this?
---
I don't want that either and I'm not looking for it. The point of this discussion between us was either you agreed if the rules or not not about the fairness of it.
---
BE usually requires Fully upgraded Demolition Expert for that extra damage too.

As a heavy explosive user this is an instant upvote.
---
They need to do something about the insane inherent explosive resistance some enemies have. I know this change was made to counter legendary explosive guns, but some kind of exception should be made for the launchers. 
---
The fat man should be the “oh shit I’m screwed” last ditch effort weapon to blow whatever is killing you’s face off. And yet it’s not. It’s a novelty weapon that is completely outclassed by any automatic gun with a suppressor on it in every situation. 
---
You’d have better luck throwing rocks at a scorchbeast than using a homing missile launcher and that is seriously fucked up. It should be THE BEST weapon to take these things out of the sky. Like, so effective it makes people’s seriously consider keeping one on them at all times. And yet it’s TRASH at it because scorchbeasts shrug off the 1 damage they do like it’s dust in the wind. 
---
On top of that, the broadsider still has horrible hit detection issues and a microscopic blast radius. Also, I know patch #18 finally added cannonballs to the “explosive” ammo section at the tinkerers work bench and yet they still aren’t affected by ordnance express (yup bandolier reduces their weight). Please fix that. 
---
I could go on and on. I love these weapons and the “blow shit up” playstyle. But they really need some love.
---
Luck and effort mate. Sometimes lucky trades in player vendors. I'm lvl 108 and had some really good rolls but the weaps I have for my build are trash
---
I'm just not into it in 76. I play enough other games with PVP that I can get my fix there. 76 feels more cooperative than anything else I usually play, so I'd rather just work together.
---
Well I'm just saying an alternative to crafting the ammo
---
I don’t think it’s as much against PvP as what passed for PvP in this game is a mess.  Poor balance + unaddressed bugs + Bethesda’s own attempt at trying to give a playground (survival server) was abandoned.
---
Did you buy arms or mods for the arms
---
Add me, majestic204, no mic tho ;-;
---
Not to worry, it'll probably be updated again when Steel Dawn launches. Personally I love the new screen and music, but peoples tastes are all different, it'd be great if you could choose.
---
i will be here for 14 more minutes
---
Said it once I’ll say it again. Biggest misstep in the development has been the scrapping of survival. It accomplished everything the community needed. A quarantined place where pvp was a core function. Not a shitty slap system. If you didn’t want to pvp no problem, if you did, it was against people who also did.
---
Yes pvp balance sucks and sucked. Same with all the other balances in the game, I don’t know why this shitty one was picked on in particular considering it is a free time sink, I know many players who don’t play anymore but just might be if there was more variety in the end game content.
---
I really love this idea!
---
76 is the only game he had installed but I’m reinstalling to see if it helps
---
just plain arms, im afraid to buy more to try in case they don't work
---
lets not get our hopes to high about human npcs at our camps
---
Add me. SinistrMark on PSN Fairly new. Level 45  i usually play 9 to 11 or midnight central.  I have a private server if you want to take over a workshop woth no pvp.
---
You have to build her console so then you can start doing her missions
---
Did you build her camp item? Under Allies in the camp build menu
---
Did you build her terminal? That's the only way for her to show up
---
Oh that was fast I’ll have to do that
---
i hate the fact i cant sell the new made items to other players. i finally got the gauss shotgun and made my first one. bloodied 25% faster 25% less action points. and i have to scrip it because its useless to me as a vangard.... i hate not being able to sell the new items
---
Am I the only one who would call it a tireplace lol?
---
How are chassis not worth anything it blows my mind. I feel like they should be worth at least something or when you scrap them you should get some kind of material
---
Main reason I don't care for PvP in 76 is just because most people who really enjoy it already have like all the best armor &amp; weapons so it'd be virtually impossible for me to ever win unless I also have the best gear, which I completely lack the patience to get. Plus like 95% of PvP experiences I've seen are over in less than 3 seconds. lol
---
Adding gauss shotgun and explosive bow just makes it even more stupid, though
---
I am waiting for the vertibot skin ir the liberty prime to come back (but that one will probably take a few months)
---
Are you the legendary hunter that seeks out Eyebots? The one that in campfire stories raids the TNT dome for 10-40 rounds a day? I bow to your perseverance. And sorry about your family being killed by Eyebots and all that. 😃
---
Nice use of resources. If you dont focus on the tire treads it looks just like a big stone fireplace,  nice work!
---
"Matthias, come and dance for your mother and I."
---
"Yesh daddy."
---
Tse is a second shot with I believe 20 or 25% more damage and a rough accuracy penalty
---
Junkies is 50% with 5 addictions.
---
Ok
---
Lmao ive never farmed anything in this game yet, don't find that type of loot gain very interesting
---
I like pvp when I’m ready for it. Almost all the time pvp gets initiated by someone that is set up perk/armor wise and I’m just out there farming or doing quests.
---
Yet another feature from FO4 that sadly didn't make it to 76. Would be super cool if there was a "junk" tab where you could just place anything in your inventory wherever you want.
---
&gt; "Gamer Karens"
---
That's the perfect term! This should be a forced flair on everyone who whines about the smallest thing on this subreddit.
---
Yep, I get that, but does the second shot of the TSE also have its own explosions (doubling the explosions) or is it the same number of explosions as any other explosive weapon?
---
Yes, your highness.
---
Thanks :)
---
Do people use pistols? How do you kill anything with them?
---
They've been doing the discounts, they just don't announce them and they're short sales.
---
I train them over to some WS robots, they kill them and you get xp yay
---
Great suggestion.
---
I’m pretty sure the second shot only does the base unmodded damage of the weapon. So it would just be a regular round with no explosive effect.
---
&gt; some actual cool stuff
---
That's a bit subjective now isn't it.
---
shhhhh
---
i can put whatever i want in my vendor ta
---
Today I spent 20 minutes looking for one cuz I accidently scraped mine
---
The difference between Bethesda's subscription and other games that i personally pay for, is content.
---
I pay a world of warcraft subscription so and i get content for the months in between expansions. And the content they add is substantial and worth the $15. But even if i didn't want to pay, WoW has the option to buy gametime with in-game currency through their WoW token.
---
Bethesda on the other hand is so sneaky and conniving they've managed to get people to pay for **industry standard qualify of life** features. They're making people pay to be able to store crafting ingredients.
---
🤐
---
Oh OK. Well JE is a clear winner then. Cheers.
---
If your on xbox .My buddy is doing this and we love new peeps. Plus I have 15 chrisma so I can share all crafting cards and inspirational
---
&gt; if the weapon and armor skins were like the PA skins that work on all weapons/armors
---
Wait... So you could have a flamer that shoots flame, but looks like an assault rifle? Or would it also shoot bullets then?
---
How exactly would this work without any restrictions?
---
haha i kid, it's an awesome spot though
---
And i'm gone.
---
I really really want Jes-2r. I love the voice acting work on him
---
I am on PS4 Unfortunately.
---
With all the people that duped presents and nuka-quantum I've seen. Horrible idea lol
---
PvP is best for Battle Royale style games.  FO76 is a game that requires work and effort to be successful. This works best when done with a team.
---
If you just want to shoot people, play Fortnite or something. They shoehorned nuclear winter into FO76 and I hate it.  It is everything that sucks about battle royale games shoved into the fallout universe.
---
I wish they spent that effort fixing adventure mode.
---
Yikes
---
It totally is. A had pretty great camp there for a while.
---
its not like we could not play other fallout games while the service was down waiting for when the servers came back on, that's what i did,i survived and had fun reliving Boston Commonwealth
---
This, it's not that we don't like PvP. It just sucks in this game.
---
“Arms”? You bought both arms? When you go to the armor workbench, does Secret Service Armor show up at all?
---
Assuming the yt in your name means youtube then checks out lol
---
Only thing that sucked is I had my CAMP unit tucked in the waterfall to backlight the water and the Wastelanders update filled that section in with rock, so I cant access my camp unit now
---
You should be able to see if you know the plan by checking the plans Reg sells, it will be listed as (known) if you have learned it.
---
But Beth isn’t required for play which is a big difference. Also wow is a way different game but I see what u are getting at. One is for extras and things not required and one is for the whole games content and content building up over the years.
---
To me it's more like there never should have been a large scale PVP system. Yes bounties are fine because that's punishing a player for being an asshole, but that's about the limit for me.
---
No no. I mean how the Blackbird PA paint can be applied to multiple sets of PA, the T-45, T-51, X-01 etc. It should work thr same for weapon/armor skins. Basically a skin or paint that's made and it can be applied to any weapon/armor. For example the Clandestine skin for the new guass weapons. Instead of the skin being only for the gauss weapons, it could be applied to all weapons in the game.
---
Because people who try to bait PvP are annoying AF. 99% or more of people aren’t trying to PvP so go play nuclear winter instead of trying to grief people. If someone is at a workshop that’s fair game, but the people who go around jumping in front of people or trying to trigger unstable isotope are douchebags. People who try to bait others with party request are even more pathetic.
---
They get dumped for script to roll more useless legendaries.
---
Going to need a 5Y, 8D and fishbone completed by end of day Bethesda.
---
Doesn't explain 4 gamma guns in a row or how all the melee weapons from Purveyor had limb damage for awhile, there is some sort of selection process that lies outside the generic response of "It's just RNG".
---
yes already learned but cannot craft
---
no secret service shows up
---
Hmm, filled it in with what? I’ll have to back over there and check it out.
---
When I fire my shotgun the enemy health bar will dip like it’s taking damage, then shoot right back up to where it was before I fired, maybe marginally less. Anyone else?
---
Did wow require u to buy all the new add one over the years or does that come with the sub now?
---
Right click on game, properties, go to whichever tab that has verify file integrity, itll check everything and see what is missing and download the missing files. Antivirus can also interfere with the downloading process
---
Bad luck. Just caught the wise Mothman, almost missed the event. (Xbox)
---
That’s what I wanted to hear thanks man
---
Good start. What do you see when you select it? Or do you mean it doesn’t show up at all? That’s a problem.
---
How do you set the enclave or other designations
---
That isn't the problem moreso that, even if you stash away the robot models themselves, any crafting which requires aluminum may use up the models for the required materials anyway.
---
Just saw it, PC.
---
OUCH!!!
---
There used to be a little alcove behind the waterfall, they just added more rock to fill it in. Not sure why it needed that, but I just have to manually repair, no biggie, that place never gets attacked anyway
---
Can you take a picture maybe in the sunlight? I can barely make it out on my phone.
---
I had a spot there once the radtoads were brutal
---
Thanks, I guess I need to be more patient. Been grinding the tadpole for a while and need to take a picture of a firefly.
---
I've never seen the styles tab change (if I'm thinking of the right one. Styles is the hair/makeup/tattoo tab right?). Outfits, Camp update frequently, but not the others.
---
I'd rather have them fix things like vats being broken for pvp.
---
Did you link your steam account before they added f76 to steam
---
it does not show up at all
---
All. The. Time.
---
Yeah, just the occasional scorched officer. Sweet digs :)
---
Ahh, I gotcha now. From how you were saying it up there, I thought you were referring to the PA paints (or textures/models, really), that turn any PA into the one unique PA type, such as turning a T-51 or X-01 into Liberty Prime, and it always looks like Liberty Prime, and not the type of PA it has been painted on.
---
What you mean is just more texture options within one theme. That, however, would more than likely mean more expensive bundles, or several separate bundles. If Bethesda is selling a bundle of weapon textures for X Atoms, then they're not going to double or triple the man hours put into making those textures, and still sell it for the same amount of Atoms.
---
But yeah, having more options is always nice. I for one am always up for more variety.
---
My next suggestion would be as another player posted: what does Regs show you already (Known)?
---
B-But it's so much fun hiding on top of the bunker or in my Fallout first tent!
---
(That's sarcasm if you can't tell, those people really piss me off. Just let the queen land so us newer players don't waste ammo trying to shoot her down! -\_- )
---
will never understand why Bethesda refuses to mark on camp stats how many legendaries are for sale. you'll tell me how much useless food they have for sale but not how many legendaries are on offer? stupid.
---
Yeah, it's the one with hair and such. I've been waiting for it to rotate so that I can buy one of the Hawk hairstyles.
---
I found him in the booth with the vendor bot. In the front right corner
---
Huge fucking waste of ammo
---
I've been playing for a few months. Haven't seen that tab change yet.
---
Is the T65 the best PA now? I don’t use PA but I’m sitting on a bunch of gold that I’m stocking up. I have all other plans I want already purchased. The only PA I do use, which is super rare is Ultracite.
---
Thanks for the information.
---
I guess it rarely rotates, if at all then. Which is really unfortunate. They should just have that tab always filled with all purchasable things. There doesn't appear to be many things they offer through that tab.
---
It's a trap!
---
It's stupid, anytime my teammates are 'downed' they just get slaughtered instead of left as bait. I don't waste my time when this is a  daily
---
It tells you how many weapons and armor are for sale just like it does with food. It doesn't specify types of food any more than it does legendaries.
---
Buy from players over modus, modus prices are usually like 4x higer or worse.
---
thanks for stating the obvious 👍
---
What I did was spawn at vault 76 and killed every scorch from there to the airport. Looted everything off them. I sold it all to the Morgan town train vendor then hit the airport. There's an event that spawns there where the scorch come in waves. I sold everything. I then server hopped and did it again (the event won't keep spawning). It's time consuming and I didn't even think of the other ways mentioned above.
---
Sounds good just trying to learn how to play and build my character and talk etc!
---
I mean, you were the one trying to act like them showing food was any different.
---
It seemed like you needed the obvious stated.
---
Rat poison sounds like the better choice lol
---
 https://imgur.com/gallery/OSfzkhL
---
They needed the middle slot for Fallout 1st a revenue stream was needed.
---
I had the exact same experience : been playing for a week or two, just recently hit 50 and I remember from lvl 1 to 20 I was screeching whenever I saw something move but once I got my hands on Blocker + Serendipity I could facetank just about anything that wasn't unloading a heavy weapon on my ass (god damn Super Mutant Overlord ...)  
---
I specifically recall being lvl 24 or 25 when I met 2 Charred Feral Ghouls and teabagged their dead body 30 seconds later with a great sense of accomplishment because of those perks
---
Mainly:
---
* Recipe: Formula P
---
* Recipe: Super Stimpak
---
* Recipe: Stimpak Diffuser
---
* Plan: Bear Arm
---
Just teams from what I understand
---
bullion? what is that? how can I get it?
---
Did they delay seasons? I thought that was with patch 20
---
I'm pretty sure it hasn't been announced with patch 20, which is on pts currently.
---
Did you actually read/consume the plan in your inventory? Otherwise it sounds like you bought a mod.
---
Same
---
I thought it was? I will double check.
---
Complete your daily quest:
---
Importance of Communication, and donate your reward
---
Retirement Plan, and get the raider to comeback to Crater
---
Do the daily quest Photo Opportunity, take pictures of Foundation and give them for free to Crater.
---
You can also go to Ohio River Adventures and donate 1 Queen Mirelurk Meat each day.
---
Honestly dose my head in im a first but don't sit on my tent when supist to be doing an event and don't hit somthing ro death just tag and wait best way to be is fair in wasteland
---
This makes sense and perfectly answers my question, thank you kind sir
---
Aholes are everywhere, honestly its part of these online toxic games, yes Fallout 76 is fun but avoiding others should be your priority.. Remember to switch to pacify after level 5.. Just let you buddy know not everyone  playing is a tool like that guy was..
---
I played to level 75 solo and yes i got killed a few times by tools myself best just to let them kill u and move on, you only lose a bit or trash.
---
Thanks dude how many of those daily quests can I do per day is it only one or can I do all three
---
Here's the "announcement" of the date. https://twitter.com/jg93/status/1273957170900619264?s=19
---
Pretty sure seasons would be a more exciting headline.
---
FYI seasons are not going to be in the PTS
---
camp vendors. sell every legendary you find for a reasonable price. high levels will snatch up one stars at 120 caps to scrip. 2 stars for 300ish, three stars 500 and up depending on prefixes. run super mutant camps to sell non legendary weapons to station vendors and max your 1400 caps a day there, sell any legendaries you get from those mutants at your camp. two birds, one stone. you'll be rolling in caps in no time. then you can start spending, buying up other players finds to resell at higher prices or keep for yourself. i personally both sold and then spent over 30k in the last 24 hours just from camp vendor machines. it's so easy to make caps in this game.
---
You can do all of these once each day, but Importance of Communication and Retirement Plan, rotate with each other everyday.
---
That's fine, but they're also not coming in patch 20 as far as I can see.
---
Right and when she lands is when she actually takes proper damage! The event could be over in 5 minutes if people just let her land!
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/udU1pW0](https://imgur.com/a/udU1pW0)
---
Since the nerf to explosive demo expert is wasted points. You gain 20% raw damage from explosive and then from that 20% max ~50% of that. 
---
If you are using demo expert on anything that isn’t an explosive legacy you are wasting the perk points.
---
The rewards are crap and you use up a ton of ammo.. best to ignore..
---
i want to be able to put plates and silverware and glasses on my dining room table. and toilet paper in my bathroom.
---
Unless they have been delayed they absolutely are coming with patch 20. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gnyjjo/inside_the_vault_52120/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
Also if you go to the original season announcement they said patch 20 as well
---
I got the mods for Bear Arm doing this event as well.
---
I either use a recon scope or just the non ads cross hairs to stealth snipe.
---
So your a low level selling  2 basic weapons then.
---
Logged in just for you cause I was done for the night.
---
I had no problem interacting with it.  I had already got my scrip limit for the day so I could not sell anything but I was able to open it up like normal.
---
I am on PC.
---
The hunch back of Flatwoods church is gonna get yea!
---
I've been playing too much lol
---
The game is taking me to dark places! 😂🤔🧐
---
I haven't had a run in like this in over a year, but i did meet some dudes sitting around after Fasnacht talking about pvp. I gathered that n there's a pvp subculture in the game which revolves around claiming workshops.
---
IIRC:
---
2 shot fires an additional projectile for 25% of the base weapon damage. The additional projectile is not affected by the explosive Major Affix.
---
Explosive deals 20% of the base weapon damage, and is affected by the Demo Expert perk, at rank 5, explosives deal 60% more damage (rank 4 is 50%)
---
So with a rank 6 demo expert the explosion from the first round deals 32% of the base weapon damage
---
Adding the two together gives you a 57% increase in damage (but only if the second shot hits as well)
---
Junkies has a max 50% damage increase.
---
I'm 63 solo as well and have never had an issue. It's one thing to kill once to be annoying, but to destroy an entire camp and slaughter people as soon as they respawn is so bullshit. 
---
We ended up switching servers but it took a while because we kept getting killed lol
---
Sadly this has been a common theme for 20 years of MMOs, never buy anything based on the developers "plans". Only buy on directly advertised features that are included... No asterisks, no "future date"... Heck I have friends that bought purely for survival and then quit when it left and haven't played since, Beth doesn't mind burning people. 
---
None of those features matter to me besides the discounts but it does suck that they implied it would be done relatively quickly. 
---
Unless I'm mistaken Bethesda hasn't even mentioned them since then have they? Honestly that's the worst part, I never understood these companies that think transparency is a 4 letter word.
---
Public Teams and Seasons are coming with Patch 20.   
---
Seasons were announced to be coming with Patch 20 and nothing has come about disputing that.
---
We got what they said would already be included in the subscription. We haven't gotten the few other things that were suggested would be coming.

It's hard to make a case that Bethesda has "reneged" on anything quite yet. Also, out of those things, if one absolutely has to be outraged, really only the Atomic Shop discounts would be a thing that can't really be argued - they probably could have had these implemented already. The other things are game mechanical changes that may have turned out to be a bit too aspirational and difficult to implement.
---
For example, if a private world has increased C.A.M.P. budget, how exactly does that work in practice? If you then join in an adventure game, will it just tell you "hey your C.A.M.P. doesn't work here because it's got too high a budget, sorry, you're SoL"? Would people be OK with that? Is that easy to do in code? Would people be OK with not having a C.A.M.P. on public servers? Or would people with 1st have to have two different C.A.M.P.s, one for publics, one for private? Is that easy to do in code? Would people be OK with having to build two different C.A.M.P.s for the same character? How does it work with all the displays and food and such that when assigned to devices also take budget? Seems like it would be understandable that there's some issues trying to get that to work.
---
Also, would it be fair to the rest of the playerbase if Bethesda allocated a lot of resources too developing stuff for the premium subscription, whilst everyone else gets nothing? With that in mind, seeing as though the game in general still has issues, and needs content for everyone, isn't it better that they're concentrating on stuff that everyone gets to enjoy, and those of us paying for 1st can just enjoy what already is included in the subscription?
---
That's how I personally feel at least. I've paid for Fallout 1st (bought a year.) I'm happy with what is included. I never took any of the other stuff as anything else than aspirational goals that may be reached one day down the line. I'd rather Bethesda put *all* of their resources into making the game better for everyone, and not just those of us who choose to pay for the subscription. But that's just me.

Sucks I bought 2 star range weapons and didn't give me anything useful,
---
The folks doing art work typically aren't the same folks doing engine work, just FYI.
---
Uhhh formula P is low key amazing.  Using three doses gives my gauss shotgun pin point crosshairs, it turns into a sniper.  Does wonders for weapons with crap accuracy like the gat plasma
---
Is the door still attached?
---
Add me stahrb035. I play two to three times a week. Level 108 currently.
---
Wasn't the issue that AWS had a massive DDoS attack, like record level.  
---
Hardly Bethesda's fault. It's whoever DDoS'd Amazon.
---
if you spam about 6-8 you WILL get addicted. Some people say to alternate a few drugs (psycho, alcohol, psycho, alcohol etc) and it works easily enough. But yeah, just visit some camps that are selling meds, you should be able to get it going pretty easily.
---
If you have a console then you can get a subscription for access to a bunch of games. Tv and movies I can’t help you with.  Maybe netflix? Go to Netflix.com and sign up for 30 day trial. This website streams movies and tv shows.  Lots of them!!
---
Having the same problem with mine also...with no door
---
Who’s more exited for fast travel fix than for teams?
---
So I can’t go take photos of foundation and get xp
---
agreed it feels like Bethesda made this as an after thought to Fallout 4 and tacked on multiplayer which was a horrible idea.
---
The bog definitely feels unfinished to me. 
---
My favorite is the mire... It just hits me really hard every time I get there. I've leveled up 4 characters and I still get a squirmy feeling in the mire.
---
I don’t really go after people with the sole intent of causing them misery, I genuinely like to pvp. If they’re up for it, cool, if not, I’m on my way. There’s a difference between griefing and a friendly battle, but a lot of people get legitimately mad about any sort of pvp, even at workshops. Bothering new players and picking lopsided fights is dumb, an evenly stacked contest is a lot of fun though. Getting real world bothered/angry because I killed you in a video game says a lot more about your mental state than it does mine TBH.
---
Well someone works for bethesda! Or sucking them off, there was shit that was promised for buying 1st that we still dont have! No one gives 2 shits about a ranger outfit!
---
My math to calculate the damage increase if the explosive major affix is as follows:
---
Explosive : +20% damage
---
Demo Expert: +60% Explosive damage
---
.2 × 1.6 = .32 or 32%
---
At the very least, it actually gives you a reason to play other than doing 5 minutes worth of dailies. Having a constant stream of rewards and stuff to work towards as long as you keep earning XP is a good idea.
---
Honestly suppressor is a very weak prefix. The Molotov may proc the suppressor perk (prob not thou cuz not initiating attack with suppressor weapon), but really it’s not worth making a while build for ~7% fewer damage from an enemy when late game that ~7% does nothing. 
---
Perhaps find a different more useful prefix for your currently weapon.!
---
A lot of pvp is done in very immature and 'cheap' ways. It's very loadout based in a game like this, and PvP does not do well getting new players, since veteran players often don't play nice or 'fair'. Its just not a fun experience for those not brainlessly aggressive players.
---
When fighting the queen if I see everyone bunching up together I take running into a different direction shoot at her a couple times to get her attention and she lands right in front of me.
---
nope. I just sell whatever i want in my vendor.
---
You’re* 
---
If you are going to be a dick at least do it properly lol.
---
Uh huh
---
My problem is, people still bitch when I'm on a lowbie and kill level 100+ players. No matter how much we get nerfed, the PvE community will never be happy.
---
That’s a rare roaming vendor. I’d imagine everyone is only grouped up there because of the vendor.
---
And it was due to the help out some randoms I met in a post.
---
That's a shame. Hopefully they add that as a feature somewhere down the line. I don't mind the junk items taking up more than usual on the build limit either. I mean they shouldn't since they wouldn't do anything and be set as a static object. But I wouldn't mind it if I could surround my bed with garden gnomes.
---
How about some Chinese Stealth Suit skins? it clearly has customisation slots.
---
😂
---
They need a massive durability buff across the board, and perhaps the support of a new perk (possibly legendary?) that I would call “Shaped Charges”, which would reduce a targets Explosive DR and Resistance, maxing our at around 75%.
---
...and I want a game refund (1400 hours played).
---
Anti-consumer? No, not at all. That word doesn't mean what you think it does.
---
Thank you! For some reason my other photos had my character look almost transparent. Like when items fade and they have that mesh texture.
---
That’s pretty much what it is, and look at the downvotes 🤣. How is anyone this salty over a video game? Can’t even have an honest discussion because the end game, PVE babies flood your shit with downvotes simply because you don’t have the same play style.
---
PC as well.
---
Not sure what is preventing me from interacting with the vendor, but I'm still troubleshooting it. Thanks for letting me know it's at least not a server-wide issue
---
"Where is all the good shit you dont use?"
---
I mean, not really any of your business. If I wanna save my random shit that I'm not using, that's up to me. You don't get to decide what I sell.
---
Thank you! Those darn small turrets were a pain. What got me through was a Vampiric Gatling Laser.
---
Yeah i know. I'm the one who's been there for 3 hours keeping it there =0
---
i think they're really missing both the boat and "point" to pvp.
---
nw and survival mode were steps in the right direction, but missed the mark.
---
especially with the introduction of both the settlers and raiders, they're ignoring the obvious potential of faction vs faction pvp.
---
make instanced versions of events, drop in two teams with basic gear they can upgrade through nw style stashboxes, and have them go at it to try and complete the events.
---
have a radio station like hunter/hunted only for forming teams to assault foundation or crater.  have the raiders be making a raiding run, the settler trying to rescue hostages.
---
you don't have to exercise the gray matter much to be able to have ideas.  as to whether or not they can get them to function as intended as they bolt the modes and etc onto the engine... is another story.
---
were there compelling pvp content, i'd be all in for it.  as it stands even the pve stuff is it times shaky at best due to the netcode being bolted onto a slightly upgraded fallout 4 engine.  i think, the lack of pvp, or for that matter expanded gameplay for nw, is entirely due to bethesda not knowing how, or being willing to rebuild enough of the game engine so that it would be able to handle these kinds of modes without falling apart.
---
there would also need to be some significant effort put into either balancing items/builds or creating frameworks to have everyone start on a level playing field.
---
They can’t just kill you over and over, you have to continue engaging.
---
You can take pictures of foundation, sell/give the pictures to Roxky and then go to Davenport with 8+ Charisma to double dip rewards.
---
Great point. Level 191 here and love the game.  But by far the glitchiest game I’ve ever played.  
---
I’m now building trap bases to keep it fun.  Haven’t finished it and plan on always letting person go get their stuff.  I don’t want it.  I give away lots of stuff every day.
---
...over 20k on a *CAMP*?!
---
Thank you! I did it at level 110. I’m not sure when is best to do it but having a Power Armor helped!
---
Ok, if it is literally one shot (as in projectile) or you melt in a tenth of a second, it's effectively the same damn thing:  You die so fast you have no means of reacting or countering it.
---
Because there is no pvp and you know that. It is just griefing. You could be in nuclear winter right now but you are here complaining about it being harder to fuck with people.
---
yeah i do teapot mostly cause i'm not that interested in repetitive content it bores me.
---
It was mostly a joke, but yes, as fablegames said it does increase HP. It is just too random to seek out if your purpose is to recieve such benefits cheaply.
---
if you're high level you probably have a silly amount of caps. Why are you crying? you don't HAVE to go to camp that has 2 armours and 2 weapons in their vendor.
---
I’ve never seen one. Where can I find it? Thanks!
---
This is the reason I got used to playing 3rd person lol.
---
I don't really like alot of the other stuff in the game ngl, except for some fun events like the wise mothman one, I've spend more time on settlement building in FO4 and camp building in F76 then I have spend done any other stuff, soo yeah lol, I barely have any weapons, I spend everything on camp building
---
There’s a glitch, but we’ll all get banned if we acknowledge it on here.
---
Correct
---
Are you possibly at a limit for something? Too much scrip banked maybe?
---
https://nukacrypt.com
---
It is a website that provides you with the nuke launch codes every week. Players do the work to find the codes in game and then share it on the site.
---
You are correct
---
Welcome back.  I wish you well!
---
The only legendary scrip vendor not available is the one at Berkeley Station. Every other ones work fine for me.
---
That was in February.
---
Xbox, PC, PS4?
---
Short answer, because they need to win every battle and can’t handle losing.
---
Yup, it just so happens that was the first one I interacted with tonight. Thanks for confirming!
---
Oh I thought it was a group who helped you out
---
Yeah thank God for fallout first. I also load up a private server for low lvl whitespings
---
If you are on Xbox I’ll take ya
---
They should give you increased budget for your private world with a separate budget for public servers.
---
So basically you should be able to build a bigger camp that will spawn in whenever you are on a private server and then a separate smaller camp that will spawn in when you are on a public server (and the opposite camp won’t appear in the opposite modes). And you would be able to have these camps in separate places.
---
Np. It's been that way since they moved the purveyor. Have a great weekend🙂
---
Nah, only at 300 scrip and still had about 100 left for the day--I think it was Berkeley Springs' vendor giving me an issue. All others seen fine so far
---
It’s a website with the nuke launch codes for the week. The codes change every week and players post them so others don’t have to go looking for them.
---
Xbone. 
---
BUT it's been over 3 hours now. And i am going off.
---
Might be a no brainer, but did you actually learn the plan in your inventory?
---
Ayup. So basically it's a question of if you want to risk losing the extra damage from the two shot mfer that 7% gain.
---
Ofc this entire situation is null and void if you can get yourself a Junkies Explosive handmade
---
Thanks anyway
---
turn on pacifist mode?
---
i can't even give them away in my vending machine for free. i just dump them at stations or in loot bags on the middle of nowhere if i accidentally pick any up.
---
if I’m not mistaken daguerre is a french surname, right? 
---
she has a darker skin tone, just like mine, I’m brazilian with a mix of italian and hungarian. 
---
so maybe she’s latin french?
---
Tell me about it, I have a level 60 something mule with some nice gear on it I use to just mess around sometimes. If you think people get mad dying to a higher level, you should see what a team of 4 “tAnKs” do when they lose to a sub level 70, the rage is real. “You’re not taking any damage, you’re cheating”. I’ve gone as far as to explain to people how my build works, and even shown them clips and my perk load out, they still don’t get it. Big number should beat small number, big gun should beat small gun, that’s as far as they look into it.
---
Definitely mixed race, but not sure if her ancestory is ever explained?
---
Enjoy your downvotes, the sweaty beta babies are out in force tonight.
---
I mean, once you're level 5, the game slaps this info right in your face. Turn it on and there's no problem. If people can't be bothered to read that's their fault.
---
I'm going with French.
---
So for all the questions but how do I take pictures of it
---
Dunno her ethnicity but shes voiced by Jeannie Tirado, an american voice actress
---
(She does dubs of animes like DBZ and works with funimation, so if that tells you anything about where Bethesda's budget is being spent...)
---
It’s tough because everything they’ve done to try and balanced it hasn’t had the opposite effect. You’re pigeon holed into a few very particular builds now if you want to be competitive. Casual players and multiple different builds need a better chance to fight back, I miss being one shorted by a guy in a tree 400 yards away.
---
Correct about the JE. TSE has been nerfed to oblivion thou. TSE versus J is while you theoretically lose 7% damage, you gain durability and accuracy. TS splits the base damage between two bullets, which means if your pipboy shows 100 damage you would 50(+32% with explosive &amp; max rank demo) and 50 (the second shot does not apply explosive anymore). TS you also lose something like 25% accuracy when firing. TSE you also lose quadruple the durability. TS you lose 2x more durability because game counts hit scan as damage to count for durability, plus each bullet loses 2x durability from explosive, so 4x faster then normal. 
---
They murdered our boii
---
Bethesda: I have altered the deal, pray I do not alter it further.
---
if the wall needs rehomed i got an empty wall
---
Yeah, I agree.
---
It feels like they did Watoga, and pretty much called it a day.
---
Oh boi oh boi oh boi. See I'm a self proclaimed wildlife photographer. I sneak around and capture up-close-and-personal pictures of the more dangerous wildlife and creatures in game.
---
Would you be interested in painting animals?
---
That would be cool.  Also be nice if we just got another 20%  + build size and used on private and public
---
Great breakdown, thanks. This was the reply I was hoping for! Yeah, I'll be trying to get a JE handmade. Hoping I can trade my TSE Handmade + 3* FE .50 cal for one...
---
Take pictures in general or the object Davenport marks?
---
In general you go to menu and go to photo mode to take a picture. To do the Davenport quests you need to have completed the ponieer scout questline to get a camera so you can take pictures of places or people Davenport requests.
---
Totally! Even creatures/monsters! So long as they’re within the environment and not dead LOL :)
---
The fat man did get a buff a while back. I think before the damage was around 900 and now it's 1600 (don't quote me exactly I'm not home right now). Even with the buff, they still suck unfortunately.
---
I jump up there if I need to get away for a few seconds.
---
Bro remember when TS and E each did 100% and The Dragon became a fucking God Tier weapon for stealth/sniper?
---
the blood eagles are the gunners without the military vibe lol
---
Some kind of Spanish...
---
Combat rifle/ Fixer skin. It's the most popular gun in the game. Just plain stupid not to have a skin for it.
---
It is a current bug that has been a more consistent issue since wastelander release. They have supposedly fixed it in patch 30 which should be coming next week.
---
I just moved the whole camp.
---
With every update comes another exploit to abuse, people will find ways to grief, forcing them to look only makes it worse.
---
Oh thank god
---
Does it have to be any specific pictures of jsut show up and take random pictures
---
Pepridge farm remembers. I run a B E now a days. Demo expert is a complete waste most of the time.
---
So far I have the torso and jet pack. Rolled 15+ looking for unyeilded. But if you aren’t grinding then you too new for this sweet armor lol
---
Ha ha ha
---
Have a weathered version? I'm a fan of Mr. Fuzzy, so I like this panda. Nicely done.
---
He will specifically ask you take pictures of things like ward or Paige or of a generator in foundation or the crop fields. When you use the camera it shows you in the top right corner what is “in” the picture.
---
Thanks for this! Been on since launch and haven't done one yet after getting smoked solo in a silo early on... it's been long enough to give it another go... Level 172 now.
---
She’s definitely not a space alien 👽
---
Good luck mate.
---
J/E Handmade is the current META for just about any commando/stealth commando/stealth sniper build. That and the Fixer with the same affixes are in stupid high demand, which means trade values are high too. You may not find any for the price you want, but dont give up on it!
---
Soon they are easy.  I miss the days when those killed me easy.  If you are on Xbox I’ll hook you up with some marsupial.  Hop on awnings and kill em

Sneak commando is sweet too.
---
No rush at all. I’ll be choosing photos tomorrow morning so take your time.

Yup, I've made my decision, the TSE is gonna go if I can find a trade. I'll be a little sad, it was a legit drop and it's served me well.. Cheers for the info!
---
[Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/FX1kDZ9) ya go! I have more saved on my ps4, I've just been unmotivated to transfer them over but now I have a reason to lol
---
Are you talking about what happen yesterday? 
---
That was an issue with them implementing duel authentication which caused issues with players not have credentials to login into the game or their website.
---
What are the numbers for Bloodied? That and Junkies are a pain to find numbers for lol
---
I’m on XBox
---
good thing is timer seems reset today. I can get scrip now instead of waiting 20hr.
---
Puerto Rican?
---
Cheers.. I might have a decent piece of unyielding to sweeten the deal, I'll have to do some rummaging!
---
could as well! 
---
fuck, I miss barcelona :(
---
drinking a estrella galicia naked in barceloneta beach is amazing.
---
Good job dude.  I give away good weapons too for the under 50 people
---
Have to agree. While I enjoy my Private World and the Scrap Box, at this point that's all it has going for it and I will probably transition back to Public Worlds and Scrap limitations again without much issue. The Atoms are hilarious, between daily and weekly challenges and the monthly stipends from foolishly signing up for a year, I've been over 20k Atoms for well over six months.
---
I am hoping whatever they add to the Atomic shop that is Brotherhood related will put a dent into the Atoms I have collecting dust.
---
Are we sure? 
---
&gt;!Where did she get her Alien Blaster from?!&lt;
---
Bloodied you technically can stack with adrenaline reaction. It gets tricky though cuz of hp pool but at 5% you don95% with adrenaline reaction and if I’m correct the same with bloodied. 
---
My base damage for my automatic BE25 handmade is 461 and do about 700 per shot to enemies and 1300 to glowing enemy.
---
Heavy explosives are still absolutely horrible compared to previous titles.
---
I wave at everyone. My characters right arm is JACKED
---
*This deal is getting worse all the time.."
---
Lol. I'm not new, I'm a 200. I just never really cared about any of the gold items but I have (had) all this gold and was just wanting to spend it, since I can't trade it lol. Saved all my gold since Wastelanders launched. So I bought all the main SS plans and butteressed plans
---
Hairstyles, facial hair options, and outfits.   
---
I have, in the past, spent a good chunk of money on cosmetics in other games. I love having a huge wardrobe for my toons. FO 76 just doesn't have anywhere near enough options, and what they do have is about 4x too expensive.   
---
If I have to stop and think about spending the atoms because something is so costly, then I'm not going to impulse buy. On the other hand, if there is a wide variety and I'm "shopping", and get a couple of outfits--then realize there's one more thing I want but I am just a little short, I'll spend a few dollars. But if I have to spend ten or twenty, then I'll stop and think about it.   
---
They really don't seem to understand the hedonic treadmill as it relates to impulse buying in games.
---
My thoughts exactly. Especially on increased camp budget in private worlds. I have no idea how that would work and I don’t think Bethesda did either when they released that.
---
Don’t forget the best reward ever...arkos lab coat...
---
Huh, interesting idea!  Will have to see if I can sneak that in
---
HAving the same problem, did you find a solution?
---
They are crap probably because you are doing event wrong. You “complete” the event by keeping one friendly animal alive. If you want any of the actual good rewards you must keep all 3 friendly animals alive.

The specific vendor has been disabled because there was an exploit that allowed players to trade wastelander weapons and armor between players.
---
as long as there is a bed.. the benches and an instrument that I dont have to look for.. Im good to go
---
vendors too if I am shopping obviously..
---
I just dont want to have to search the whole diameter to find the shit basically..
---
I'm glad you labeled the head and the body.  
---
I was really lost for a second.
---
First of all, how do you know it was someone from WOB? Second of all, it’s your fault for engaging multiple times. You kept fighting and brought it on yourself. Don’t throw a fit, PvP is part of the game but unfortunately you aren’t good enough yet.
---
She’s Latina. The Daguerre surname is Spanish in origin and she has a distinct Spanish accent.
---
tbf is takes like two seconds to do just 1 daily.
---
I know it may seem boring and lacking and stuff, try looking up the Cranberry Glades in West Virginia. It’s the real-world counterpart to the Cranberry Bog, just like the Greenbrier is to the Whitespring. And it’s...well, it kinda looks just like it does IRL as it does in game. In fact, the least realistic thing about the Fallout version is Watoga itself, which doesn’t actually exist.
---
What is it with reddit hating emojis, anyway?
---
The mole miner pales dropped plans to make the outfits, not the outfits themselves. You can make them cheap and sell them for profit to vendor. 
---
The beret is kinda worthless cuz the event drops were very gracious.
---
Is it a "for every 5% of health missing damage dealt is increased by 5%" type deal?
---
I've been contemplating a Bloodied build, but I could never find the numbers to figure out if it was worth switching from my anti-armor build (I'm only AA rn because I cant get any good Junkies drops)
---
Yeah, I think people get salty that my main 2 vendors dont contain what is advertised and just leave without having a look around. Like, I have 7 unlocked water purifiers and theyre always full of water.
---
What platform do you play on?
---
The event that article is talking about is from February. That doesn’t mean it isn’t what happened yesterday and into today as well, but that’s a different incident.
---
I think a lot of that is attributed to the total lack of quests/events in the Bog. Aside from the Brotherhood quest line and the Mayor for a Day side quest, there really isn't much going on other than a bunch of Scorchbeasts flying around everywhere.
---
And while I agree that the Ash Heap feels/looks great, it also suffers from the same lack of content imo. I feel like each area should at least have its own version of Fissure Prime, where you can summon a unique boss by nuking a specific location. Imagine some sort of Mole Miner King boss or something crazy like that. lol
---
Blackberries, harvest with greenthumb sell with either hard bargain or grape mentats.
---
Eloquent.
---
Server's wonky
---
Later this year they will add instanced bunkers so that they servers remain semi stable and we gain increased budget
---
Honestly i went through 10 000 rounds of ammo in that event, no rewards were worth what i wasted in ammo there..
---
People here probably just prefer the og emoticons I guess instead of the ugly looking new emojis
---
Okay, that makes sense. Thanks!
---
Really? you need that pinpoint accuracy for what exactly? we kill everything fast already.
---
AA and AAE is kinda crap because when you start dealing a lot of damage you bypass the DR anyway making the AA prefix irrelevant. Additionally explosive damage bypasses DR as well so AA E is kinda crap too. 
---
Bloodied info can be found just by googling or searching subreddit:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a8vld2/adrenal_reaction_in_numbers/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
In general lower health more damage
---
Seasons are supposed to launch with patch 20 as well. They haven’t been enabled on PTS because the Atomic Shop isn’t enabled on PTS, but haven’t seen any mention of a delay.
---
I'd second that. Likely facing west.
---
Only if there's a weathered version thata slightly bloody and missing the top left half of the head, because that would look scary asf
---
I know its part of why online pve/pvp games are dying.. Toxics ruin everything, best just jump servers asap in future i do.
---
What were you using? How did you go through that much ammo? Yeah if you use that much you need to get yourself a better weapon cuz you are wasting resources in every event. 
---
I do the event only with friends and we each defend one creature. I can usually do a whole section for under 100-200 5.56
---
Persistent workshops would be amazing. I did not even know that was supposed to be a thing.
---
I can definitely understand that not wanting to walk across your base location to be able to get something if I was to have more separate buildings they would all be kept hell close together anyways its more of a style choice but of course you're going to want to keep the main things all together
---
Thanks man. I'm at the crossroads of bloodied or junkies. I think I've gone with bloodied tho... I love seeing that ridiculously high damage feedback
---
I'm sorry that you lost your mom. My dad passed in February, so I know it's hard to lose a parent. 
---
Very glad you are feeling better! Welcome back.
---
They were more worried about fixing duping than game breaking issues ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Hello there
---
Im looking at the game case right here and not once is PVP even mentioned. In fact I havent even seen any advertisement about PVP, If you really want to gank people go play something else. There are plenty of PVP specific games, but muh fallout right?
---
Darn I’m on ps4 and have both.
---
Furthermore, I wish you to wear this dress and bonnet.
---
*steals your idea and makes a million bucks*
---
3000 minigun ammo 3000 [50.cal](https://50.cal) ammo and 4000 of various other ammos as my main weapons ran dry.. its crazy how many animals you must fend off in there, also i think a lot of others were dying and maybe to low for the event so i was trying to survive with my friend..
---
S’more recipe from camp fire tales event &amp; mothman has much better spawn at the new cult locations. Server hope and jump around to find it. (The one at the lighthouse is unkillable)
---
Dude it's a stealth build. You're not supposed to be getting hit. If you're getting too easily reveal then something's wrong with your build. I frequently move through white springs or West tech killing every single enemy without anybody seeing me I never get revealed I never get hit hardly there's the rare occasion when something happens to reveal meet but it's very infrequent. 
---
some key factors if you're getting revealed you know check your special points for agility. As rule of thumb if you're running a stealth build you should have your agility special maxed out. 
---
when I performed the search I was looking for answer as to why I don't need a sneak perk at all I sneak around all the time and I've tested it in front of turds without escape artist who seems like the turds kind of react a little in my brackets close up more quickly as I move aroundbut the sneak perk had no effect whatsoever
---
Ethnicity is of no importance. Her name is the cool thing. It means "Wisdom of War."
---
Damn you, Sony, for not allowing cross-play! 😭
---
I wouldn't know, I'm colorblind.
---
AA is definitely crap, but it's the best I can get rn because the purveyor, SBQ, and legendaries in general want to give me nocturnal scrip instead of Junkies Gold. 
---
Also, me after following that link: "oh boy here I go doing math again"
---
Sadly the wording on that page clearly shows two things, the actual benefits (listed item by item) and what they hope to do in the future (the words).
---
Its a bummer but they do that sort of stuff on purpose.
---
No kidding
---
I mean that is an excessive about of ammo. Are you just     holding the trigger down and hoping for the best? 
---
What’s lvl are you, what is your build?
---
I cant get the s'more recipe to drop from that event, and I'm at the new moth-home location, starting at a scorched mothman...right now...and it is glitched
---
Yeah I just got disconnected now. Happened a few times within the past 2 hours
---
I dunno but she my waifu.
---
I've been playing since last November and it's like this from the beginning for me. I didn't do much of it lately, since WL.release I guess, so can't say for last.months, but previously it happened more than regularly.
---
It's always empty for me. Only time it ever has ore for me is the first time I do it, any time after that, even weeks later, nothing.
---
PS4
---
Yeah that data might also be out of date (1 year ago) but simple searches should help you. 
---
You can find a lot of discussion of subreddit about junkie versus bloodied. Bloodied is typically the best, but obv has drawnbacks
---
Shit my guy, I'd give you a hand if I could log in ffs
---
Persistent workshops would be a game changer. Being able to just take over the handful of useful Workshops in Private Worlds and have everything still built every time you log in, would be the best thing since the Scrap Box.
---
Eyes red or green?
---
Seriously yes.  Three fast queens tonight, foughtball in the field by the sundews, she landed fast and melted.
---
Ah fuck
---
I have both xbox and ps4, but I only play on ps4 now
---
On xbox I have quite a few legacies that are just sitting and collecting dust. I def would've tossed you a couple of them to help you with your build if you were on xbox
---
Green I think...just left there as Campfire tales event just started
---
Not when you get to replay it with a friend! Got one of my buds into the game recently and replaying with him has been a blast.
---
Never completed the event with 3 animal survived. Got the melee weapon Bear Arm and Lab Coat....
---
Besides that, bullion notes, acid from bear &amp; crickets, few legendaries.....
---
I am pretty sure there well be a weathered version as well if it makes into the game.
---
I've tried my guy. It might just be that I suck at using google tho 😂
---
Anyways thanks for the info!
---
Junkies is hands down better. The explosive damage of either weapon is negligible, even with Demo Expert maxed, it’s the main effect damage you want. Two shot gives an extra 25% but takes that 125% total damage and splits it among two projectiles, the explosive damage is basically its own “Projectile”, so not a second explosion. Those lower damage projectiles mean less armor penetration, less accuracy and double the speed of weapon condition loss. 
---
Junkies is a straight 50% buff to your main ballistic damage if you have 5 addictions. Only one projectile (+the explosive) so it’s more accurate, penetrates more armor and is better on condition loss.
---
Bugga.. Cheers for the thought anyways mate!
---
No i'm not it was a lot of animals, lots of legendaries and the sheepscale at the end was super tough i pretty much ended it because it killed everyone else, i'm only level 75 and it owned many higher than me.. the friendly animals all got killed even the deathclaw.
---
That is my build

---
At least 7 other people besides me
---
Red ones are wild ones you can kill, the green &amp; purple ones I believe are like random encounter/event ones you can’t kill. 
---
Try server hopping for the camp fire tale and the locations. You’ll get it eventually. 
---
Also try looking to see if anyone is selling the s’mores recipe. I see them all the time for 100-500 caps.
---
“Fallout 76 bloodied versus junkie build reddit” 
---
Try that
---
So, this one time, LONG time ago,
---
I'm enjoying myself, you know, out in the Combat Zone.
---
A few bets, a few drinks, a WHOLE lotta jokes.
---
I'm makin' friends, havin' a good time.
---
This one guy, he gets jealous, I mean, I can't blame him--it happens to me all the time!
---
People just get upset, that thing is cool.
---
Anyway, he's this REALLY big guy, I mean like, HUGE guy, actually.
---
I don't remember his name, doesn't matter, shut up!
---
So this big idiot decides he's gonna challenge me to a drinking contest.
---
Guess he figures he'll make me look like a fool in front of the nice folks at the Combat Zone.
---
So, he lumbers up to me, comes up to my table, tells me he could drink me UNDER the table.
---
I'm like, "The HELL you can! Try me!"
---
So, everybody gathers 'round, 'cause it's clear this is gonna be the COOLEST thing that happens all night,
---
and we just go at it, just shot after shot after shot!
---
Now the whole time, he's talking shit about me, I mean, telling me I'm gonna lose, telling me that I'm a piece of shit, all that stuff,
---
and I'm just laughin', I'm laughin', I'm takin' my shots.
---
Now, I'm so drunk, I mean, SO drunk, that it's crazy.
---
Later on, people were like "Man, you were so amazing! I didn't even know how you could still be standing! I never seen anyone drink that much!"
---
And after a while, I see that big guy startin' to get wobbly, right? Like, he's not gonna last much longer.
---
But, like, I take a minute to make sure I'm not so drunk that I'm just seein' shit, but I'm right--it's him!
---
He is wobbly so I push through it, man! I knuckle down, and I keep takin' shots!
---
Finally, he just goes face-first into the table! Out cold! No question! And I'm so pumped up, I pick this guy UP!
---
I kid you not! I shit you not! I picked him right up, totally raged out, and just, BAM! Slammed him back down onto the floor,
---
and I'm screamin' "YEAH, MAN! YEAH! WHO'S THE BEST!? WHO'S THE BEST?! WHO'S THE BEST?!"
---
And this one guy, he comes over, he looks me in the eye, and he's like "Oh man! You blew all the blood vessels in your eye, man! That's totally messed up! That's SO COOL!"
---
Then everyone cheers even more, and I was so pumped up, I didn't even feel it!
---
And everyone's all like "YEAH, LET'S HEAR IT FOR REDEYE!"
---
It was pretty great,
---
you shoulda been there!
---
Truth is, the deal was rigged from the start.
---
Sounds like the pieces of flair that they made the Jews where.
---
the other girl has no name, no history and no hygiene.
---
It’s a great build, what is the weapons you are running?
---
They’re talking about the perk, not the prefix, which suppresses damage by 30% when fully ranked up
---
I had this issue because of the healing factor mutation. Once it was removed the issue was gone
---
I have lots of friends to play the game with, and they are mostly all in the same boat as me, unfortunately. It's sad when I find no man's sky more exciting than my favorite post apocalyptic series.
---
Bite the head off of a Super Mutant leader's dog.
---
The #HEAD
---
#CLEAN. off.
---
Yeah definitely. I noticed the down votes from what I’d assume is people jealous they don’t have Fallout 1st.
---
I mean regardless, the prefix is just meh. I mean using it on melee maybe, but if you using on swarms like this guy mentioned it’s worthless. Ranged you are most likely gonna kill them before they do significant damage anyway. Heavy weapons, again maybe? But there are so many better prefixes.
---
I built a tavern with a managers apartment on top, and a separate building as a workshop
---
Fo1st was a scam to begin with, you had a broken game and bad pr. Then they say heres an over priced scrap box with infinite space, that suddenly eats your scrap. The game had a lack of overall content let alone fo1st stuff, like no real end game. It had alot of red flags before you payed for it, you csnt trust this company to do anything for its consumer. That being said, I'm sorry your getting screwed by them.
---
Does that actually
---
Ok how do I get the camera
---
Good old nuka Raider radio.. thanks for that 🙂
---
Like I said complete the pioneer scout questline.
---
I'm sitting on about 50 unspent levels worth of perks and 600 treasury notes.  I also have my entire stash and inventory full of trash legendaries waiting to be recycled.  I play fairly casually, but I'm pretty efficient about it.  The only thing I give a shit about would be if the commies raised their daily rations of scrip/note/cap turnin so I don't have to use all weight reducing perk cards and still have to use alchohol to get the STR to fast travel.
---
I remember all my saves getting corrupted beyond repair because one save picked up an astronaut outfit. Fun times.   
---
NV is the most overrated game in history. I love it, but holy crap NV fans are insane thinking its as good as they say it is.
---
I heard something about data miners seeing a service rifle but it might just be a skin for the handmade which would be bullshit
---
Can you show me where it says that seasons are coming with patch 20?
---
lol. Me for sure.
---
source?
---
You deserve more karma than 1 can give lol.
---
Alrighty, cheers for the reply. Time to trade up!
---
Just completed campfire tales event...still not s'mores recipe 😑 I've also been hitting up vendors and player vending machines...no dice so far
---
Xbox or ps4
---
Xbox
---
I have the smores recipe you can have I think. Look me up tomorrow if you still need it. Gt:shadyrebob
---
I’ll send you a pm
---
I don't know man, does it!?
---
 
---
Hell yes it does. 
---
Just ask the legendary raider named Atlas.
---
Some say he was in the Great War, got hit right smack in the face with one of them Big Nukes, shrugged it off, and kept on goin'
---
Some say he just appeared out of thin air, like the Wastes themselves, conjuring him up. Some say he was the product of a night of unholy passion between a Super mutant, a Deathclaw, and Satan himself. 
---
He single-handedly took down that band of Super Mutants south of Boston. He bit the head off the leader's dog. The head, CLEAN. Off.
---
or that time he took a group of five men, ONLY five, downtown straight to a rival gang's territory, and walked out with their leader's son, just because the kid said some mean things about his mother.
---
I dont see where it says theyre in patch 20.. just this line 
---
"Finally, the Seasons system will not be available for play testing in our upcoming iteration of the PTS for Update 20."
---
Which only says it's not on PTS for patch 20
---
Imo a broken game, with no real end game content, doesnt deserve a subscription.
---
A three star +25% faster fire rate minigun and the beckets end weapon 50.cal i also have an explosive assault rifle and a crappy assassin plasma minigun..
---
Killing stuff wasn't the issue it was the sheer number of stuff we had to kill, there was about 8-10 people there
---
ok. theres a source. Thank you.
---
Weird that they only announced public teams today for patch 20. Hope nothing has changed
---
Huh, weird. Not like you can buy caps with $ or anything. And I’d imagine there’ll always be another duplication glitch.
---
Or, When you are sick of being to low lvl to use the cool legendary's you got as a *gift* from kind benevolent stranger at a train station, In a private world
---
Yeah your weapons aren’t too bad. I’m not sure if the amount of enemy spawns is affected by amount of players, just difficulty of enemies spawned, which maybe the issue. Need more firepower I guess. The small shit can be annoying. My BE25 handmade treats me right for those situations.
---
I just did and it said all game files downloaded but the problem still persists
---
Absolutely rdr2 needs dlc.... maybe add the rest of the map from first rd
---
Hoping that they utilize it more in the coming updates with BOS.
---
Gotta say which platform
---
Private worlds in my view are useless until they increase the size and practically let them be your own private server where you could have persistent players, playing a persistent story. Be nice to have camps as settlements spread across the map which mainly stay in place and grow adding to the world.
---
Ah OK man. I'm on pc myself
---
Most of this games community is pretty nice, but there are a few toxic people, like the one 200+ guy that hunted me down after I looked in the general direction of his workshop
---
Oh yeah lol, "change your outfit once" is always a pleasure to partake in.
---
i cant even sign in on my ps4
---
I would love the M79 to actually be useful
---
I have 15 agility naturally as necessary for stealth build. Three action boy. 3 Ninja. 1 escape artist. 1 adrenaline. Three evasive. 3 white night.
---
I frequently swap out white night for other stuff when I need it because light nights not really necessary. 
---
I run a melee build and believe it or not chasing weapon matters probably matters for gun builds as well some weapons are noisier than others and they detect you by noise and sight not smell as I saw something else mention. When you're shooting and they start shooting at you but you're still in caution they can't see you they just know somebody's there if you move they will keep shooting in the same spot. That means they hurt you or they saw the muzzle flash and they're shooting at where they think you are. the same applies to melee weapons some are really noisy and others are really quiet. Mostly though the only time I ever get revealed using melee weapons is if I get bumped into. Somehow they also sense that like if several of them are on me but don't know where I'm at and they bump into me I get revealed sometimes. 
---
mostly though I can walk into white springs and go right around the bunk the bungalows into the clubhouse round through the rest of the bungalows out onto the golf course and kill every single ghoul without them ever knowing what hit him. and for that matter I can literally run into a room rent in and crouch in immediately be hitting before they even see me. I've been doing a lot of scorchbeast Queens lately when people put them up I don't do them myself but I show up when the event is up and I when the scorchbeast queen lands I run right up to her and crouch and going mediately in the caution and then sometimes a second or so later I go into hidden but there's a lot going on there and I'm furiously swinging away at the queen so it's kind of hard to expect to stay stealth in that environment
---
I am going to re-examine the whole escape artist thing because I have also run into that situation where I get detected sometimes for no apparent reason and nothing I can do will get rid of the danger even though there's not a single critter around me usually it requires changing locations or even restarting the game.I hadn't really tied that to stay partes but it kind of makes sense I'm going to take a look at that next chance I get
---
in any case I I don't have any problems helping up to almost anything in the game and killing it once you start swinging creatures like the legendary sheepsquatch things like that they usually detect you but you're hitting them with a weapon I mean it's hard to stay stealth or hard to expect to stay stealth when you're repetitively hitting them with a very hard hitting weapon. that's my one Nemesis is the sheepsquatch cuz it seems like I can't kill it before it regenerates and then it turns into a fight. Don't get me wrong I have lost that fight yet but I mean it just has a lot more work if you don't get it down before it gets that health regen that legendary have
---
Yeah, the Ash Heap and the Cranberry Bog far and away feel like the most unfinished zones. Toxic Valley is pretty close 2nd too. The Ash Heap just doesn't have much to do in it, and it's a low level zone. The Cranberry Bog at least has high level enemies. There's no reason to go back to either one besides events. They're atmospheric, but that's about it. None of the quests/events there are interesting.
---
The toxic Valley seems like the most boring to me, but that might just be because I haven't explored the bog very much yet
---
Its a camouflage skin that was part of the nw survivors challenges
---
It was a phantom buff. After patch #10 the base damage was shown as double what it had previously been, but in reality it seems that’s an error on the pip boy and it still does it’s original damage. Fat man’s old base damage with no perks was 460. Now it’s 921. This is twice the original amount + 1.
---
Same applies for the missile launcher, broadsider, and gamma gun. They all follow the same formula too. Twice the original + 1. It’s very strange.
---
Though two shot actually does double damage for all those minus the gamma gun. You can easily see this by testing it out for yourself and examining enemy health bars. Thankfully the launchers were sparred from that nerf. But they still aren’t great by any means.
---
Yep. This has been an issue since FO4. There was even a crappy mod to try and address it.
---
Pc. I get infinite  loading screens that last an hour or two
---
That's why i bought a month and will only pay for another month when i feel that i got more than my money's worth out of this month. So far im at around 40 hours, so it's been worth it so far
---
it does suck though buddy
---
'Finally, the Seasons system will not be available for play testing in our upcoming iteration of the PTS for Update 20. There are technical reasons for this, which include the fact that the Atomic Shop is not available in the PTS.

" and everyone will be able to join in the Summer fun immediately when our first Season arrives in Update 20."

" In Update 20, you’ll find a new option on the Main Menu that will take you to a uniquely Fallout-themed seasonal progression screen. During the first Season, this will be a themed boardgame, and you will be placed at the first space on the board at Rank one out of a total of 100 Ranks."  
---
Seriously, these aren't hard to find.
---
I find i enjoy it best in 1-2 hours throughout the day. Anything more gets burnout faster. If a new tiered armor comes out before i get a second acrobats SSA piece I will give up lol
---
Yeah and you gotta waste a fuck ton of lead on those cannonballs and they weigh a pound each
---
The only things that Betheada says are included are the features that we have. 
---
There is a brief mention of adding the features you claim you are "entitled" to. But it specifies those will be added at some point in the future. The very last bit of the article literally specifies "in the coming months and *years*."
---
The only players who logically should have purchased the 1 year deal are the ones who knew without a doubt they would play this game for a full 12 months straight. That's a long ass time to play a video game, most games are lucky to get a month's worth of play. Otherwise the monthly fee should be considered for renewal every month, hence the word *monthly*. I subscribed the first month it came out and took a break the very next month and didn't renew. I didn't renew until right before Wastelanders came out in April, so I'm currently at a total of 4 months subscribed. Roughly $56. 
---
Bethesda can take their time with adding increased camp budget and persisting workshops. Everytime they bring new stuff they break a bunch of stuff too. Neither one of those features are even going to be groundbreaking anyway. Workshops are a terrible way to farm resources and increased camp budgets are probably only going to be on private servers, meaning you cant bring your super huge camp over to a public server. Unlike stash boxes that are overfilled, enormous camps can heavily affect server stability to the point of causing constant crashes. Kinda pointless to have a huge ass camp only for no one to see it unless they join your private server, which will mainly be friends. 
---
There's been no announcement that these features aren't coming anymore, and considering how Bethesda is in the business of delays and taking incredibly long to accomplish anything for this game, we probably won't be getting those features any time soon. But that doesn't mean they aren't coming ever.
---
If you are still having issues I can help you tomorrow. I just racked out. But should be on tomorrow afternoon. I can make you 3 to eat.
---
Actually it was OP who was having issue. I already am helping them by the doing the same thing haha
---
You're joking right?
---
Not at all I was just as surprised as you
---
Cool. Half asleep here.
---
Honestly I am awaiting SSA paints since I will probably live in that with a jetpack for a bit.
---
Nah, non power armor has plenty.
---
Haha no worries
---
I felt the same way for a while but I tried building a completely different character and it added a new feel to the game I use the bow with some pistols to make the game more difficult since pistols are rather worthless in this game.
---
There is a few in seasons
---
Same (no offense to OP)
---
lmao i’m pretty sure everyone knows about it, it was also clutch when the mole pails were here since you were able to buy each pail from the faction vendors so five total of all kinds
---
I'm crouched all the time and I've had the same issue so I don't think it has anything to do with the chameleon effect an escape artist when you crouch. So if I get detected while crouched I don't come out of my crouch I just quickly try to kill everything in the room expecting that the moment I do I'll be hitting instantly but I'm not I stay in danger mode when there's nothing to detect me and I never left crouch. at that point I'll stand up and crouch several times trying to get rid of the danger but frequently the only thing to be done is to leave the area and then it mysteriously goes away. Admittedly though I do have the chameleon mutation. I am using the Chinese stealth armor and I am running The escape artist perk only no sneak.
---
First chance I'm going to try running without The escape artist perk. Then maybe I'll refer to the Mistress of mystery garb with just chameleon and see if the problem goes awaybecause I never had it when I ran back here alone with the sneak perk and escape artist and the chameleon mutation
---
I'm personally just thinking that it's just a new bug that got introduced than it really is randomly connected to people who are sneaking
---
I'd never heard the term before a black friend mentioned that some old white guy had called him that as he pushed past him in public. He sort of chuckled as he said "moon cricket" - I think the chuckle was at the ridiculousness of there still being such old-timey people with racism ingrained into them. Though I think it's worth mentioning that, if I recall correctly, my friend grew up in Chicago. So it may be a term used more in that general region. The incident with the old man, however, happened in Las Vegas.
---
NO! Don't kill the Scorchbeast Queen! She is hot and we are in love! Leave her be!
---
You don't say? I suppose the next thing you'll be telling us is that there's a magic fountain there that cures all diseases?

I made a 4x7x7 unarmed fight arena with 2 riders of seating

I just told everyone on my Team who’ve been playing since launch they’ve never heard or seen of it.
---
I keep a MIRV around for the lulz
---
Usually i fire some from a tent during the Queen ads
---
Or just random fuckery
---
It especially hurts coming from NV with its hugely varied selection of explody toys.  There's just nothing like loading up Mercy with some GRA Plasma grenade ammo and going to town.
---
bro 😂 yeah you’re a troll man
---
I feel really stupid now
---
How did he get them to stay there without them being automatically recalled to their inventory
---
When will people learn that Bethesda doesn't give a fuck? They farmed a MAJOR deviation to one of their two maIn franchises out to a newly acquired studio after cancelling that studios "dream" project. There is some oversight by studio grey beards, but the heavy lifting is being done by people that maybe like the IP, but probably don't care - it's a job. They definitely do not care anywhere near as much as the players.
---
Well. On one hand I could understand your frustration. On the other hand, what you're trying to get from them is literally doesn't worth any time of the support and that's what they told you. You enjoy looting and say you're there for it? Then go on and loot again. If you've been around forlonger than a week, you might know this game is bugged beyond recognition, there are bugs that are literally game breaking. What you're bothering them with is petty and is litigation, from my perspective. What you lost is JUNK. Knowing this game is bugged, you're still doing it. It's on you then.
---
Cringe?
---
I PAY FALLOUT 1ST HOW IN THE EARTH I CAN'T GET A RARE MASK? WHYY BETHESDA? I ONLY PLAY 30MIN A DAY I DESERVE A RARE MASK BC IS RARE!
---
DR for regular armor gives diminishing returns after a certain point (I forget the exact threshold) so honestly idk. I don’t think there’s a huge difference in 300, 400, 600, etc. when it comes to non-power armor.
---
I have a nearly complete vanguard trapper set (4 out of 5 pieces) that puts me around 300. Not the best I know, but I like the look of trapper armor. Sue me.
---
Anyway, I recently got the scaly skin mutation that bumped me to 350 and I notice literally no difference in damage that I take. I feel like I would’ve been better off getting enemy specific armor to use vs the imposter or something else. But maybe I’m just missing something. If I am, I’d love to be politely corrected on the matter.

If you just want the backpack, there are other badges that are easier.

Wow damn that's huge as hell not seen that before
---
Or fix the clipping with 90% of the backpacks. On most armors. Plz.
---
You know when you’re more scared to fight a group of floating testicles or a giant crab that vomits on you than you are of fighting a nine foot tall monster that guts super mutants for breakfast, you know there’s a problem.
---
Watoga has a great backstory but yeah in general the Cranberry Bog is pretty underwhelming unless you’re really bloodthirsty and want to kill some high level enemies. I absolutely love the Mire though. Challenging enemies to kill and the atmosphere and overall feel is one of the best in a fallout game
---
So sorry to hear what a hard time you were having, but welcome back!
---
there were a few outages early after release, including a couple times when they took the servers down as an 'emergency' amidst some of the early duping revelations.
---
If they're goibg the same way as Keretus on his PC mod, you'll be able to save your equiped perk into one of many slots. Then you'll be able to load each saved loadout with a key/key combinaison/clic. It's very useful to swap between your "combat" perk sets and your crafting/looting perk set.
---
Never used that one, but i do miss using big bertha and doing the bbs for ammo hotkey glitch.
---
Oh, you have my mouth watering already!
---
Not a bad channel, but there are certainly better ones.
---
I'm not sure you get it. There's plenty of time for other things, but since you are limited to 150 scrip via legendary turn in max per day, you need to get it every single day.
---
Preach! I'll take a deathclaw any day over a snallygaster or wendigo....
---
it's kinda your fault for subbing after everything bethesda and similar companies have pulled, bethesda aren't blameless, in fact they are very much to blame, but you should have used good judgement
---
Incredible ingenuity.  I'll have to rip that concept off in my CAMP.
---
Consider Athlete, Hunter, and Archer - those were the easiest for me, and I'm a shit player who is really, really, really lazy.
---
Archer was only challenging because I had to find the plans to make the crossbow first.  Then I just made three, low-level bows and used each one until they were just a little bit damaged - then you can repair very fast.
---
For me it was reviving someone - because besides being a shit player who is really really really lazy, I'm also a compulsive solo player who doesn't like groups.
---
Lmao it never fails. Someone is really trying to defend Bethesda. They are shitting all over everyone.
---
An Atom Cats garage - or greaser garage in general - would be amazing!
---
Bionic, your lifestyle is good as long as your happy! Hell, I wouldn't date men either, lol. Great story though!
---
i'm not sure that would be a good idea, even with the camp budget as it is i run into camps while shopping that cause my FPS to tank down to like 10 - 20 FPS
---
Didn't even know that was a thing
---
I engaged twice, not sure how he managed to kill me so many times then. Also fat man'd my camp to dust.
---
I had a expat daily time i would get it and when I was available and now! It’s way later in the night when I’m busy 😤
---
Run for your poor little life, and if that doesn’t work, shoot them in the legs (preferably with a shotgun). If you can manage to cripple them all they can do is slowly hobble after you as you pump your store of ammo into their skulls.
---
Bloodied is fun, I have a bloodied unarmed sneak dude and a bloodied stealth commando. My favorite character is Chameleon mutation commando junkie /shrug
---
At this point this may be the last month of paying for Fallout 1st if they don't provide anything
---
Yeah I've literally never had an issue. This guy was wanted and had been griefing all the camps on the server it seems like. So ridiculous. Go find a PVP centric game!
---
Wow that's cool.
---
probs not. wait for a fair few more updates if you are so burnt out. although i think a new colossal wendigo event is coming with this patch but im not 100% on that
---
Good Bot!
---
I like building with pre-existing things.
---
I think a good first step would be to remove the "non explosive" part of the heavy guns perk. It's really not needed.
---
she's mellow as fuck though and doesnt give me a headache with her headache dialogue lol
---
Yeah I was trying to, it was tough because I'm trying to server jump and coach my friend into respawning/getting out of there all while my CAMP is being blown to hell. Quite chaotic
---
As subscribers? mate we don't even get what we pay them for let alone lip service.
---
Those wendigos are no joke! I was attacked by one early on and it rag dolled me. I didn't go back for my loot.
---
I'm going to be bold and brazen, but you kind of paid for what they offered when you signed up. 
---
$13 or so worth of atoms which to some people would consider it the price of admission  
---
Private World  
---
Scrap Box  
---
Exclusive Emote  
---
Exclusive Outfit  
---
I mean.. yeah they vaguely promised more at an undetermined date in the future, but it's not like they offered a guarantee past what was just listed. Just stupid on their part to say things that never end up happening like PvP Factions (Mentioned February 2019), Hardcore Season Mode (Todd Howard Interview), etc..
---
Absolutely not. It's cool to hate on things, sure. But RDR2 was amazing on its own. And they made that while milking GTA one of, if not the top, earning game ever created. They make a base game and then focus their time, effort, and money, on the things that are going to make them more money. Ya know, like how a business works
---
This will probably get down voted even though he isn't lying about anything.
---
maybe try contacting Bethesda their support team is shit but it might be worth a shot
---
well I guess when they realized the typo that's why they changed everything that was released after that ad to say they would look into adding increased camp budget for private worlds,  increased camp build area for private worlds and  persistent workshops for private worlds.
---
Which from a design stand point the first 3 are virtually impossible. There is no way for you to chose a different version of your camp when you join a public world or a private server that is not yours. The game as it is designed can't support it particularly for console.
---
They would have to add a 2nd loading screen to the game so that you can chose the camp you want to enter the world with before you select the world and someway to validate if it is the version of your camp for your own private world that you are indeed joining your own private world and not someone else's or a public server.
---
Right now one of the things that is bringing servers to a screeching halt is folks that are using glitches, mods, and other exploits to build massive camps that are far beyond what they should be able to put up in the server. To be quite frank I am getting tired of servers crashing from that crap.   Imagine if they increase the area for camps on your private server then someone figures out a way to glitch that camp onto a public server.  I don't need to imagine whats gonna happen if there are already twenty people on a server and just one person brings their glitched camp on to it, the servers gonna crash.
---
Fallout first was a cool idea, but I did what most people did; I bought a 2nd account and use that as my stashbox its cheaper in the long run and I only paid for it once.
---
If they ever FIX the bugs in the game that are causing the new players to leave...I might get Fallout 1st.
---
VATS - Still broken since wastelanders release and they have not even acknowledged it.
---
NPCs- the quest givers for the dailies are broken, they have no plans on fixing them get used to having to click on ward 100 times to get him to give you your daily.
---
shotguns - still suffering from damage refund for almost a year now, not even acknowledged its an issue
---
cycling gun stuck - still an issue it was never fixed
---
SBQ - they have acknowledged shes broken, she is not on the list to be fixed get used to not being able to keep her on the ground for a while.
---
oh and as its pretty much because it is as much a trademark of Fallout as Power Armor I'm gonna mention this again VATS IS BROKEN! its a trademark of the game a literal built in aimbot that has been broken for months and they will not even  acknowledge that the issue with not even being able to hit targets with it exists. Let alone that many VATS bonuses are not working as well.
---
Power Armor is a fashion accessory, they have relegated Power Armor to being a fashion item they expect us to buy skins in the atom shop for something that the only point in wearing 90% of the time is for look and feel as there are few builds that need it and greater DR as well as carry capacity can be  had wearing regular armor.
---
Fast travel bugs- most common of which is clicking on spot A and ending up in spot Y instead of even B let alone A. No acknowledgement of the issue.
---
I am not going to spend another dime on this game until they start FIXING whats broken. I don't give a mole rats hairy ass about new content I would like to see them STOP putting new stuff in the game until they have fixed the issues that are broken first.
---
They should be devastating, I agree.  They should be picking us up and throwing us around like sack of potatoes.
---
Still under budget. First floor is vaulted cielings so there is no second floors. I need to tour it in a video or something.
---
Aside from that, how many caps is it gonna cost to fast travel, at most? 45 if you're on the other side of the map? 
---
I can make 45 caps just by walking behind my house for a minute or two, picking plants to sell.
---
This. Just bob and weave and get your pot shots in.
---
I may be a minority, but I just generally enjoy the post-apocalyptic world enough to be content with the game. Having played WoW for more years than I care to admit, I don’t have the same end game expectations for this game. 
---
I did delay playing the game until Wastelanders arrived, and the quests have been mostly enjoyable. Hopefully they continue adding more story content though.
---
I hope they can fix this, couse I just start to play the game and a lot of it is broken.
---
Yeah i run into that problem a lot, its why i dont touch photo mode much and either just screenshot or use the camera when i remember to make film.
---
Lol been here since beta and I’ve noticed this lovely trend of behaviour too.
---
VATS is a mess. When it works it's magic, when it doesn't it sucks big time.  I have the hit enemy/no damage (one-shot damage numbers on screen but enemy health bar still full) constantly.  Guaranteed to happen on the first shot when first spawning into a new location.  You have to shoot once and reload and then you're good.  Stealth is buggy as hell too.  This is where you get stuck in DANGER or it takes a billion years to change from DANGER to CAUTION. Switching weapons is a joke.  Get swarmed by mutants while trying to switch weapons is no fun and usually you just consign yourself to die and respawn.
---
Shotguns have been busted for over a year.
---
You should definitely do a video tour bro
---
Oof
---
Things change...
---
They announced what they wanted to provide for the FO 1st subscription initially, and shortly after it was released it was changed. 
---
Why does everyone keep saying this is what they promised initially and seem so shocked that it changed...there isn't a thing they have promised in this game that has come out 100% as they initially stated. 
---
What is listed on the FO 1st page currently IS WHAT YOU GET...not what they may have promised...but what you get. If you are unhappy, cancel your service. Every company has a right to change what they offer, and every customer has the right to stop purchasing said item if they are unhappy. 
---
You have known for what 8 months what you were getting, not what you thought you were getting...and they did at one point provide reasons for the change...mainly your fellow players who felt that some of the items were unfair, like camp space and atom discounts, hence the free stuff in the atom shop every month, and what not.
---
That sounds like it would be a pain in the ass my dude lol
---
time for a lawsuit
---
Your buddy might’ve still been red to him, even if he killed you and young sought revenge but didn’t fight back immediately, he’d still be able to destroy your camp.
---
good ideas, but outside of the fast travel mat and discount, the rest prolly aren't even slightly possible in the engine.  maybe card games, but proper minigames would undoubtedly beak all the physics in the game.
---
I have two characters over lvl 100 didn’t know about this until last week. A noob told me lol.
---
Wow that is awesome!
---
Agreed!!
---
If you drop them from your inv (instead of placing them) they become unowned and stay there till someone claims it
---
Sorry, i couldn't hear you over the sound of my level 5 blody black powder pistol, speed demon, adrenal reaction, max rads, and the sound of level 76 deathclaws in agonizing pain
---
During fasnacht a guy put a bunch of them circling the bonfire at the church
---
Only thing that really grinds my gears is during a SBQ fight when I die I respawn in the middle of damn nuke zone or it makes me only able to respawn at 76.
---
Interesting. It's known that carrying around lots of different Notes and Holos can slow your inventory down to a crawl because the game engine is kind of stupid in how it loads items in inventory, but that slowdown in your videos looks worse than anything I've seen. Wow. Are there any other parts of the user interface that seem slower in Japanese? (World map, NPC dialogue, perk cards, etc?)
---
So in ten days we get to assume the position and brace for a whole SHITTON of new bugs, while still being worked over by the bugs that have been in since wastelanders release like
---
VATS IS BROKEN!
---
Yes. I'm gonna run around with my fists doing absolotely nothing just so i can seem like i'm doing something. That doesn't accomplish anything. I'm fine staying at the back thx.
---
We are playing a game set on a post apocalyptic world we are the very definition of masochists .
---
Yeah Fallout's historical megabeast is something I pop a few rounds in and goes down. It's not the insanely tough creature I remember from the 90's... Was it in the LA Boneyard they first appeared? Near the gun runners? I can't quite remember.... But yeah, they're a joke now.
---
Meanwhile doing a nuke launch and you see the face beam of an Assaultron go off down amongst the launch crew robots- and you shit your pants...
---
Actually..... it might take A LOT to change. It probably has something to do with fundamentally how Beth programmed stealth to work.
---
It sounds like a simple fix, when I'm invisible, I can see me, but enemies can't. But the game engine was probably built "wrongly" in the first place to not allow such a thing to happen. It just can't go, "I can see me but the enemies can't"
---
So to fix it, it might require an entire overhaul of how line of sight works, stealth, models and how they interact with each other. Which is why NOTHING has been done about it since Fallout 4.
---
Imagine your water heater doesn't work, it sounds like a simple fix, just repair or replace the heater. But the engineer comes along and tells you, "sorry no, I need to tear your ENTIRE house down, because the problem requires a complete replacement of the entire electrical and plumbing of the house, which can't be done without tearing the house down"
---
Thanks for all the info! I can see what you mean by it looking like a half and half bloodied build. I think your edited  version is moreso what I'd like to aim for
---
Sometimes it can be. But doing so can make for interesting camps. My last one had a mine cart and three small sheds already there. Another one in the Mire has two train cars buried underground. And close to that one there was an open metal bunker with a farm and ruined house. Right now I have a cabin by the Whitespring. Things already being there *can* be difficult, like sometimes the floors won’t let you place things down, but a huge benefit is that since a structure is already there, you can save on a lot of camp budget. My camp right now still has probably about 1/10 of free budget, and I don’t have anything else to put down.
---
Anywhere man.. but guaranteed after free range event.
---
If it's useful ammo (.308, 5mm, 2mmEC, plasma) and you're on xbox one, I can take it off your hands. Otherwise, I'd say just drop it
---
So what's your idea for PA then?
---
I just keep em in my vendor. They usually sell. But I'm also parked right next to the Wayward, so I get tons of foot traffic near my vendors.
---
Nope, your not missing anything...there is currently no way to scrap them or sell them to a train vendor. 
---
You can try to sell them in your vendor, or just drop them around the map. If you are saving things like missiles and mini nukes, I would say just drop them now, as most people do not buy them or carry them, as it is much easier to just make them if needed for a quest/mission. 
---
I personally only keep a few 1000s of what I use on hand and the only ammo I store in my stash is alien blaster rounds, 100 syringer ammo, and 5-10 fusion/plasma cores. The rest is not worth is to me to keep since I do not use guns that take say 2mm, plasma, etc.
---
It's so stupid! DeathClaws are meant to be the titans of creature enemies. With Fallout 4 they have you killing one about 10 minutes into the game.  
---
Like you I get far more worried with Snallygasters and Wendigo. This would be fine but the way they treat DeathClaws are as a major threat.
---
I'm off Xbox for tonight, but I do have a few hundred .308, some plasma, probably still some 5mm.  I don't need the .308 since I upgraded my sniper rifle to .50 cal.  I just would feel so bad about dropping it.  Fallout 3, NV, and 4 gave me trained to always pick up all the ammo!
---
Shhhhh don't give them ideas!
---
Drop it.... But apparently an end reward for that boardgames comming out is a low ratio ammo converter.
---
generally if it's 44/38; just drop it. noone uses it, noone wants it.  
---
45/308/5.56/2mm? Sell that shit in your vendor. I easily sell out any time I put some in mine at 2cap a round.  
---
5mm/.50? Again, sell it, but I sell it at 1cap a round since it's alot easier to make/costs alot less per bullet than the others.  
---
Energy weapon stuff like fusion cells... I drop. they've never sold since nearly noone bothers with energy weapons.
---
Well if you can get it to work of course it would look really unique and different to most camps I imagine it looks really good and the budget is a big Plus for sure but idk how many people would do something like that building can already be very frustrating sometimes but I have seen a few builds like that and they look really amazing
---
Depends on the pistol I suppose. The Gauss pistol can be game breakingly o.p
---
Lol that's true! I used to have like 2,000 .38 rounds at the beginning of 76, but I didn't use any (cuz pipe pistols that take it suck in damage) and ended up dropping it at someone's camp, because nobody wanted to buy any (most common ammo) and I had no use for it
---
And this has just happened to me today... Yah...
---
I'll charge into a breeding den of deathclaws with a stick and a smile. The moment I hear a nutsack though i just bolt. I ain't dying again to DOT.
---
You have to set them up on your quick bar wheel and then use their specific icon/key bind to use them.
---
well, they are definitely the apex creatures in future games, but it is only a few years after the bombs. we have some fresh creatures now. cryptids and scorchbeasts very well should outclass them rn. personally if we were to give any creature a buff id like it to be the behemoth in the game. behemoths should actually be upgraded to raid boss level imo
---
Im down!
---
Wym AGAIN they still scare the shit outta me
---
I'm right next to the snake art south of whitesprings.  It's very nice.  The grass is short enough that my crops don't get lost, there's a little stream for my water purifier.  Plus there are lots of nice sentry bots, and I'm super close to the "robot mall"
---
Marsupial, eagle eyes, bird bones, speed demon, healing factor, carnivore/herbavore, grounded, scaly skin, herd mentality
---
Instakill attacks for the following enemies
---
Deathclaws, grab and stab
---
Assaultrons, stab
---
Scorchbeasts, pick and drop you from the air
---
Suicider, explosion
---
Behemoth, golf swing
---
Mirelurk queen, grab and acid vomit melt
---
Fog crawler, grab and stab
---
If your talking m a r K E t .7.6 then nothing has ever been wrong there and all the trades are easy to certify so not sure what economy tour talking about
---
Do these duped gifts produce legendary weapons amd armor ? How do they affect the economy ? Sorry I wasnt around for that christmas event.
---
I’ve actually been putting together a faction of sorts. Primarily anarchists who want to see governments stay dead. They are stockpiling weapons and ammunition and nuclear keycards for the return of the Brotherhood. We’ve been building camps to look like repurposed pre war military bases and such. I’ve even commissioned one of my friends to make some propaganda for me to drop into the subreddits. A little different than what you want, but I’ve been trying to build a little chaotic society but still primarily roleplay based.
---
That sounds awesome!
---
No and no. They give caps, plans, alcohol, and chems
---
The grind for gold is the worst. I just gave up and try to buy 300 at a time every week. Yeah, there's something missing. The other Fallouts had a lot more dialog and in depth stories. Plus, getting incomplete stuff like the SS armor and underarmor. That should have been corrected within a week but it's been over 2 months. By the time it's fixed (if it gets fixed) I'll probably be done with FO76. There was so much potential but it's like they don't get what the fans want. Numerous armor and weapon skins that we "don't" have to make, i.e., RR jetpack skin. It's not a skin, you have to make the whole jetpack. A large selection of outfits that coincides with Fallout lore. I don't know who is creating the outfits but most of the are plain terrible, imo. I want manly, rugged gear with BDUs, thigh holsters, weapons on hip, thigh or back. Sadly, in Fallout 4 the best armors came from private modders.
---
Another issue is most areas on the map are occupied by low level enemies. So there are only a few places to find a bunch of level appropriate enemies to help level up. Why travel West to kill level 5's and 10's that aren't a challenge. Once you clear an area there is no need to go back. The map is great but we need high level enemies all across the map.
---
That's gotta be what it was for sure then
---
Deathclaws are like puppies, you can stab them and they'll die.
---
Oh ok.
---
until you have a weapon that can one shot them, crouch and walk away
---
You can kill them in seconds, why are you afraid?
---
Nah, just another person bitching because they think people duping presents have an unfair advantage. They more than likely haven't been around long enough to know that the cap economy has always been worthless since day one.
---
oh noOoOO, did I hurt your feelings, downvote this too, explosive weapons are fucking stupid in PVP with Frog Legs.
---
They give a whole shit ton of junk, caps and plans making caps valueless
---
Yup most players it'll be handy, but the a very select few that have had ammo perks on since release and some ammo 0'd out meaning they have hundreds of thousands of rounds in inv. I Wana see how big those numbers get.
---
OMFG, this guy!  
---
Met him twice in the last week  
---
1: When I entered a random building, he was INSIDE IT and started attacking me at close quarters. I had nowhere near enough ammunition to tackle him so had to retreat.  
---
2: I fast travelled, then I spend a minute looking for a space to setup C.A.M.P and I hear this noise... Wait, I know that noise. Then I turn around and see this thing charging at me so I had to run because again... I wasn't armed for a long fight. I was just trying to build a new base.  
---
I plan on soon stockpiling my plasma cores and going on the hunt. Time to get that bastard.
---
Hey so we're super niche BoS RP, but I'd just like to point out that there are groups out there roleplaying. We even utilize traditional tabletop RPG style dice rolling and conflict resolution for many of the situations that the base game doesn't allow for and we use voice chat for everything  
---
BoS Operation: hOpe4FUTURE has been trying to fullfill the original idea of the game, where we are the NPCs, and have been roleplaying as vault dwellers that have taken up the banner of the fallen BoS in appalachia in an attempt to finalize the work they started.   
---
We even have a youtube channel (linked below) where we throw our adventures up to share with the community in hopes that more folks will come play our way, trying to fill the world with roleplaying encounters to join in on.  
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCttguHjTeFTTUQCGqbdbIFA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCttguHjTeFTTUQCGqbdbIFA)
---
I usually store my unneeded ammo in random containers for other players to find. Like a mail box, or luggage near the train stations.  I'm like a cheap santa Claus. Ha
---
This isn't a market forum.
---
Why did nobody care about any of this until like a month ago when someone just brought it up? Bandwagon sure is strong
---
Literally the only useful pistol though and only if you are a bloodied build. Honestly I stay away from bloodied just to keep the game interesting and challenging.
---
Considering you can get 1.4 k a day not counting awards and random trades from tour vendor caps have no value
---
Mercy is very unique in that its a grenade machinegun that uses **40mm ammo** instead of the normal 25mm nades.
---
Nah, whitesprings is still the number one for farming flux...you can get thousands of various flux in one trip if you place the bomb correctly
---
That is really creative!!! Where did you get concrete tires?  I like that!
---
Can you find the high radiation fluids, too. I can't find any of it.
---
That would be a great thing! You'd join Crater to destroy the more progressive and cooperation-oriented Blood Eagles (who would try to build an alliance with Foundation) as part of their wastelanders quest line. Sabotage Foundation afterwards and then be ready for the Vault raid - maybe steal supplies and blackmail (or force through threat) some settlers into joining the raid.
---
So there would be actually evil raiders you'd join for role play reasons... Instead of the snowflakes we got in Crater.
---
Gotcha
---
Play FalloutVR, theyll scare the shit outta you
---
But with presents you can get max in like 5 mins
---
Behemoths are strange because I never find them particularly threatening. Even in Fallout 3 but that's because they gave you a fatman... for some reason
---
And do what with those caps
---
Thanks for the info.  My camp builds are...questionable with regards to maintaining realistic physics lol.  So I thought maybe that could throw it off a little.  I will try that.
---
Next he's gonna tell us about this mythical bunker under whitesprings that can sell you drinks to give you specific mutations....
---
They should have universal armor skins for all armors like forest camo. That way you can mix armors and still match. And non-gold weapon skins for 10mm pistol, minigun, tommygun. A matte black or shiny black would do just fine. You have power armor skins in all colors but not armor skins...smh.
---
Look up how to make punji board stacks, you can just drop them next to these fuckers straight from the build menu and it’s instant death, lol.
---
What system are you on? 
---
PC here, US Mountain zone. Everything is normal.
---
Buy more junk and then some people go to third party sites for real world money
---
You can technically carry 1600 pounds...
---
The archery one is probably easier than finding a mothman wing.
---
Not that it's much use to you now, but I got mine during fasnacht. The endlessly respawning critters counted as enemies for the "kill 50 enemies" challenge, and bash attacks/kills still counted towards that total. The beauty of this is that bashing with a crossbow rapidly depletes its durability, so that also allowed me to get the "repair 3 crossbows" challenge too at the same time.
---
And thats how you get banned also I aint sellen no body any of my lead that shit goes fast
---
The funny thing is that in the Datamines. There are already 4 universal armor skins. They just haven't been released yet.
---
Western revolver is a good pistol too, with lucky rolls and the right setup
---
I was going to say Latino as well. Shoot, I don't care what race she is, we have to repopulate the world so let's get busy Sofy, lol.
---
I recommend to make a post on their own support forum. There is a bit giving canned replies called Narithi, ignore that and as long as people will keep commenting it will be on the top of the list
---
Duper whackamole was my favorite. It was like they were being trained to check their work through pain avoidance.
---
I'll never buy another Bethesda game until they 1. Publically acknowledge their customer support is shit and 2. Fix it.
---
 Things change, so we don't have to keep our promise, as Pete Hines would say.
---
Let your buddy know the vast majority of the people in the community are pretty chill. The toxic few are gonna toxic and there’s not much you can do about it. But here’s some tips: turn on pacifist mode, don’t pick locks that aren’t yours (if you’re wanted pacifist doesn’t matter), don’t fight in your own camp (especially if you have turrets, anyone hostile will agro your turrets making it easier to break stuff), if you hear a grenade pin click or a mine beep, it’s probably a nuka grenade or nuke mine, in which case you need to either move or take a radaway (the blast probably won’t hurt you but it does radiation damage which is purely environmental and pvp doesn’t need to be active for that to work).
---
Fallout 1st. Fallout 1st never changes.
---
you didnt do enough damage to her
---
You need to do a certain amount of damage on the SBQ to get loot, as opposed to other enemies you just need to tag and that's good enough. You would of got the event reward but no loot off the queen herself, unfortunately. I would think to give yourself a better chance, get yourself something like a high rate of fire weapon like a Gatling laser or plasma and just follow the queen around and unload.
---
Does anyone have a link to the patch? I don't play very often but am interested
---
I have an instigating one and it works decent against most things lower than 50 but if I’m doing stealth shots I can kill most things decently fast. I feel like there should be more options for pistols though only one mag fed pistol until the gauss pistol came and the rest are different forms of single action revolvers which come on you can’t give us one double action revolver or give me a 1911 or glock style pistol.
---
We are playing a game set in an apocalyptic world, we are the definition of masochists.
---
That being brought to light and our attention it does really sicken me that what is essentially a trademark of the game since its 1st version over 20 years ago is broken and they REFUSE
---
I’ve had this happen the last three times I ran Radiation Rumble on Xbox. 2 minutes left and instant dashboard. Not even disconnected or crashed. Straight to Xbox home screen. Only happened on RR tho.
---
I drop it in front of low level new players, along with a few rad aways and purified waters  - I don't need it and they appreciate it.
---
wtf dude, the whole "Greenbrier" thing was a major part of the game's marketing. Because of that, *everyone* has explored the Whitesprings (Fallout universe's equivalent) in its entirety.
---
I'm talking without penalty. Fast Travel weight.
---
Personally I’m using Adrenal Reaction, Bird Bones, Carnivore, Eagle Eyes, Marsupial and Speed Demon. That way I don’t have to use Class Freak and save 3 points for other perks.
---
The more likely explanation is that they were just trolling you.
---
Green is glowing, no? I had one jumpscare me once, I'm still not over it. Purple is 100% friend though.
---
Also have never gotten a Mothman wing myself, at least...I don't remember getting one. I should check that.
---
So basically I'm not gonna get loot if there are a bunch of badass DPSs that are going full bore on SBQ.  I don't have automatic weapons, I use sniper rifle and a super sledge.  I'll never do the kind of DPS someone with a gatling plasma will do.
---
Idk you have a really good point. I also think almost everything in the game is scary even tho I can wipe them all hella quick. I think it’s just the way they look makes me scared of them lmao
---
If you mean the sleeping spawn point I have no idea if it's consistent or not, and it only happened once. It was outside one of the sundew groves but I don't remember which one.
---
Most replies already addressed the issue, which is allowing the XP to go to lower levels, rather than just one shoting everything in sight.
---
Even in big high level events, I tend to do "courtesy" shots if there are sufficient players for Event success. By now I already know which weapons I have, do how much damage to each type of enemy. I use weapons that deal the most damage to the enemy without killing them, so the others can get XP as well.
---
Example would be Line in the Sand. If everyone just sort of just tagged the enemy, it would result in a lot more XP gained across all the players. But sometimes you get that one guy with explosive gatling that just blasts everything, and everyone else doesn't get any XP. 
---
Another etiquette I hope would get around is using the "Follow Me" Emote when Legendaries appear. I always tag a Legendary once then use the Emote to draw everyone in to get their share.
---
I feel your pain - there really should be a way to tag junk items to be excluded from scrap all.
---
Those floating testicles are no joke. I'm nearing level 100 and I feel my chest tighten into a knot of anxiety when a level 73 floating bastard shows up.
---
Imagine if the ammo vending machines bought ammo at 1/10th what they sell it at. Finally a use for nukes and missiles.
---
Saw Fallout 1st for what it is when it came out, and decided I would never touch it.
---
THIS
---
Why would everyone pick building? How does an INT boost help?
---
Yeah I thought I had seen all what was their once I got to the enclave.
---
There was a glitch where you could sell any thing to the vendors
---
Should still run class freak with those
---
This is amazing, are you for hire?
---
Yeah, but with those the downsides aren’t that bad because of Unyielding.
---
Sometimes roaming settler NPCs will show up at foundation and sit at the picnic table outside the Taylor's house, or mill about in the center of town. Sometimes they even have a dog! They can be killed and the essential settlers will just continue with their day, sometimes commenting on the dead bodies.
---
You don’t have to do the same damage as the others, you just have to do a 1000 damage, but her DR can make that difficult.  I have one gun I take to the SBQ specifically to do damage, (like not noticeable damage lol but apparently enough to get loot to drop).  So your damage won’t be compared to others insofar as rewards go, but just a threshold you must overcome.  I had many SBQ events when I was a lower level, (even at 82), where I didn’t get loot.  Some enemies require different load outs.  If the SBQ is dying within 1-2 minutes, (which I still have yet to see), then there was nothing you could do.  But if the fight goes on for 5-10 minutes then no one is using a OP weapon or at least not the whole fight.  So experiment with different perks, hit those criticals in VATS for sure, and keep at it.
---
Yes I’m sick of having to drop 12 mini nukes after a xp grind, especially when the game marks them at 6-12 caps a piece
---
Sure, how about we give Deathclaws the characteristics of the enemies we all fear
---
RadScorpion/Mole Rats: Ability to home in on you even when you are not visible. Once tagged, NEVER lose sight of you until you are dead. Ability to disappear and teleport right next to you no matter how fast/far you run
---
Floaters: Have no patrol area. Chase you to the ends of the map if need be. Ability to throw a massive explosive projectile at you that results in damage over time.
---
Mirelurk: Deal zero damage unless you hit it right in the face
---
With the presents you get both lead and caps so you can buy more lead and not have to grind for it. Most people make alt accounts amd sell stuff on that so if they get banned it's a so what type deal
---
you only need to do enough damage to her and you can do it with a sniper rifle (I did it with a non legendary crafted hunting rifle until I got ahold of a bloodied gauss rifle around lv80...)
---
Come to think of it, a lot of fallout staples have been neutered in 76, with example numero uno being the Fatman. What was once a feared god tier weapon of destruction is now barely fit to tickle a Mirelurk Queen. Even with my MIRV fat man I find myself barely making a dent with it on beefier enemies, I guess it’s an attempt at balance but with the device requiring a rare ammo type that weighs 6 pounds each making it something more than a way to give a good spread of mediocre damage is warranted.
---
People duping have no advantage? God damn some people are stupid..
---
One wasteland will make everything scale to your level, coming later this summer/autumn I believe
---
You can carry way more than that with weight reduction perks and gear.
---
Are you talking about the lag?  If so I have to say that my friend and I often play side by side...two playstations.  Mine is plugged into a LAN line and his has WiFi.  Extremely rare I have any lag, but he has it more often.  I don’t know if that has to do with their servers, but in my experience 9 times out of 10 it’s the internet on my end.
---
I give then to low level players
---
Because they weigh a ton. Bethesda did a good job on that aspect.
---
Apparently this is getting changed in a future patch.
---
Personally, I prefer things the way they are. I *like* being able to take a leisurely stroll through The Forest area, and know that nothing dangerous is going to jump me.
---
I've played other games where every enemy, everywhere, is leveled to your character, and it makes traveling anywhere an absolute chore. It also makes you feel like you're not making any sort of progression, because killing enemies will always cost you the same amount of ammo regardless of your - or their - level.
---
Use Final Word when you fight Queen. It's a sure drop and even with no heavy perks its great. Maybe spend 3 points in intelligence for Stabilized and you are really rocking like them other types.
---
The atoms alone justify the price your getting more than you would if you were just buying the atoms plus you get the server, the tent and the best thing is the scrap box, do I think those things should be free or part of the game for all of course does it bother me that I have to pay for it not really So a few cosmetics being late is not a deal breaker for me
---
A handmade based on an AK is EXACTLY the first thing what a survivor in the wasteland would make. What are you talking about?
---
I know right!? Fits into the pre-Wastelanders "no NPCs but robots" perfectly! Especially as the only reasoning against automated companions that I can think of (other than clogging up inclosed spaces if a full team all has companions) would be unbalancing gameplay - which the upcoming level scaling could easily factor in! 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
What I wouldn't do to have a Mr Handy, Assaultron or Protection follow me around!
---
Thanks, is 1000 damage the threshold?  I can do that, just thought I was being nice getting all the scorched and radrats and whatnot that were hitting the heavy DPSers.
---
Lol..yeh with 5.56 ammo.
---
INT gives you an XP boost for everything. It's more useful than the actual XP boost ones.
---
CAKE OR DEATH!
---
Huh. Good to know 😁
---
yep, got it. Thanks the person that linked it elsewhere
---
I feel like you’re gonna fall through my little wooden porch at that weight!
---
Well it's still not wrong...
---
If you're running bloody, you need every perk point you can get. Especially with the str loss with bird bones
---
I sort of ignore the initially Vault background of my character.  
---
The idea of my character was that his parents were civilians in the Brotherhood. A Scientist and Doctor, before the fall of the Brotherhood his goal was to become a Scribe like his parents.  
---
Unfortunately his teenage years were spent watching the Brotherhood go from one disaster to the next as they failed to hold back the scorch beasts. He has been spending the years since keeping a ridiculously low profile on the edge of Appalachia. He was Orphaned at the attack on Fort Defiance and didn't even run to Thunder Mountain in time.   
---
When he heard that Vault 76 had opened, he was in a panic. Part of him wanted to run but he couldn't live with the die of all those people dying again. So he packed what little possessions he had to continue the work of the Brotherhood with what little resources he has.  
---
Tried to go quite hard on the Roleplay, I prefer him using weapons that looked hand-made at first. The idea is that he's openly tried to avoid relying too much on scavenging in infested towns. His camps were always in easy to defend positions and were fortified to his best ability  
---
I managed to unlock a Field Scribe outfit at like level 15 (duck and weave practically) and that was my go-to outfit for awhile. At this point he's preparing to tackle the Scorch Beast Queen and finally avenge all the lives lost
---
Do you have FO1st? Did you put it into your stash box/junk box?
---
Far as I'm aware Vendor steal bug has been fixed, albeit there is a way but Its highly unlikely that it happened to you.
---
Beth isn't going to return your stuff, but if you'd like I can hook you up at some point. On work rotation so I won't be on till Monday.
---
I think 1000 damage is the threshold to get loot to drop.  Her DR is 300 I believe so you have to overcome that to be adding to that 1000 damage, but there are people a lot smarter than me on here that can detail how to do that with more intricacy.  Because I don’t think it’s as simple as a hit minus 300 equals the damage towards that 1000.  At level 82 though if you have a slugger build with that sledge you should definitely be able to do enough damage.  The criticals I think are very important as well...just to register large amounts of damage of course.
---
Are you guys PC?
---
A colonel gutsy shouldn't be scarier than a deathclaw nor should a mirelurk king
---
heyy i'm welsh too XD
---
So will that make it much harder to level up a new character then?  Because, for instance, when my friend started an alt we teamed up and went out to fight enemies way beyond his level.  He would just hit them a few times and I would kill them to help level his character up super fast.  Would have never ruined the game for someone like that, he just already had a main and really wanted to try a different build without switching everything around.  Leveled him incredibly fast.
---
PIPE..
---
lol bruh
---
Not when you’re going Commando. Strength only gives weight bonuses.
---
I use this ammo for trash mobs. Why waste 5.56 or 308 when a 38 or 10mm does the same with this low level enemies?
---
As a suggestion, consider trying out some of the weapons you don’t generally use, or improvising with each weapon you find until you break it, run out of bullets, or drop it and pick up another one.  As far as fun goes, it really is a lot more fun than you might think.  As far as xp...yeah, not so great.
---
You don’t even really get good legendaries from any of the enclave missions IMO. On my other characters everything I’ve gotten from them has been just been scrip and so far it’s looking the same way, but to each his own.
---
I like this idea.
---
Give a brief summary on what you call your camp etc. Yes, i definitely like this idea.
---
Don’t bomb my little blues bar in Morgantown!
---
Cool, thanks!
---
No, I mean for xp. When i say that I mean legendaries that I have given my alts that they can not use
---
Yeah, this is very true. The stim recipe without any cap perks is over 1k and you can find them pretty cheap in player vending machines.
---
They are not kids, they're grown adults
---
I'm running bloody commando. If your build is setup up correctly, you'll only have about three points in str to begin with.
---
In fact, why not let us have our Collectrons as companions (with a mobility upgrade of course)! Perhaps they could scavenge along the way, finding extra loot we wouldn't have otherwise found (specifying what kind of supplies we want would be great as well, of course). Would be a great Legendary Perk! 
---
I never realised how much I needed my Commie Collectron as a sidekick, liberating the proletariat of Appalachia one piece of scrap at a time.
---
Ohhhh I see. I get that
---
You forgot something very important.
---
Room to land near it means if the target is on an elevated position like a tree, fence or camp tent there is no room for her to land on that same plane and she won't.
---
Also the bunker is fine she can actually land on the damn bunker, fence crows should be thrown in the fissure after being plucked from their perches.
---
didnt watch the vid, the description fits the same problem i have across several chars.
---
i tried to not learn plans on purpose and keep notes/holotape on minimum (games and silotape only) on new chars.
---
once they reach rank 100ish they all have this delay, although on my main where i kept all notes/holotapes/plans the delay is much longer.
---
it might be related to inventory but its not the only thing causing this is my guess.
---
It's karma. I genuinely struggle to comprehend how a human being could be so remedial they decided to pay for fall out 1st and/or purchase atom's
---
I've done it 4 or 5 times now and have died each time because everyone stands on a bunker or tent and shoots the queen while she flies around while I'm out in the open hoping she lands and getting swarmed by all of the enemies. I have a Gatling Gun. I can't gun them down quick enough.
---
The real question we all want an answer to.
---
I think if you sell it to an NPC that’s ok, but if we bulk it to sell to each other it will hurt the economy for lower level players.  No matter your level you can always sell .50 or 5.56 bullets for 1 cap each in your vendor.  By that I mean it will always be bought.  I hear you on the .44 and the .38 but just put that at 0 and some player will come along that could use it.
---
I’m in full support of this character! I’m loving that story; full congratulations on building a beautiful story! 
---
Some of the best character stories come from outside the Vault, as the Vault is such a limit on backstory. If I ever meet your character, Ad Victoriam!
---
Will pay 10k caps
---
Ahhhh God I’m getting old.
---
No, that’s exactly what I want to see! Player-based factions have so much potential! Especially an Anarcho-F@cist government. What console do you play on? I have a character who may slightly fit into that kind of faction. I mean, he’s more Nazi than anything, but on the DL, he’s willing to play any part to get power. Especially anarchist.
---
While not long enough to be useful for anything but fast traveling, Rad Ant Lager will give more carry weight (+50), than party boy whiskey (+30)
---
Thanks for dying yesterday.  Sorry it took so long, and I don't know why I couldn't revive you when you drown.
---
Anyway, thanks again.
---
Ha! This is so true.  I see mini nukes in people’s vendors for 100 caps sometimes!  Like, why would I pay for that kind of weight?!?  I drop all my mini nukes and missiles unless, for whatever reason, I have a ton of storage at the moment.  Then I just list them for free to quickly clear the weight while hopefully making some players day out there.  Even at 0 it can be hard to get rid of mini nukes...a little easier with missiles, but not much.
---
I try to drop that kind of ammos around Wayward for low-mid level players. Stil not ideal for at least it does not take space in my stash waiting to be taken.
---
Yo, you guys looking for more members..? I’m actually completely down for that idea. It’s nice to hear that the role playing aspect still lives on in amazing, creative members like yourselves. You know you’ve just earned yourself a subscriber. 
---
Also, as a long time fan of the Fallout series, I’m very excited to see this kind of creative work! It looks great!
---
PS4, except it’s not fascist in its current form. The 1st Liberation becomes much more “roving mongols” vibe around the 2277 mark. Basically reprogramming sentry bots, taking over nuclear silos and what not to turn against the Brotherhood and NCR primarily. Though currently they are probably the pro-worker remnants of Appalachia that got radicalized through drugs, rads and what not
---
u/eggfruitsoup
---
I'd be okay with that system if there was one of two things: 
---
- a time of day when it applies, like night time or in 8 hour (in-game) time frames.
---
- an ability to control when it affects you, whether it be in the settings or a "pheromone" that attracts higher/your level enemies.
---
See sub rule 10
---
Weight reduction doesnt count because they make you fill that number more slowly, not actually add to your weight.
---
Doh! was jus after the plan for my wife thats all my bad.
---
I'll add that wdit in the morning. Good eye! I'm hoping we can go above 800 for being able to carry an entire STASH anywhere.
---
With all the reduction perks slotted, that would be an effective carry capacity of up to 7200 lbs. Or 9 stashes.
---
Oh I see someone is new to online gaming. You let people put up a text on map like that it’s gonna be mostly racist misogynistic nazi shit. You VASTLY overestimate the... quality... of people online.
---
Aye, PS4! If you’re ever down to bring in a new member, the username is chaoticarcane! I have another character that likely will fit in more with that description. Her name is D’Val-In, and she is just full on chaotic evil 😂 Drugs, rads, murder, cannibalism, etc. Maybe you’ll have to show me more to see just how well she’d fit in.
---
Dump it
---
Keep in mind, people can disagree with you, AND use those same points, and not be delusional fanboys. 
---
This isn't a CDPR sub, after all. 
---
That is the risk you take when you pay up front for 'promised' features. Yes, they need to actually give y'all what you paid for, no one's defending that, or at least come out and say they've changed what will be offered. (Refunding might be a bit rough, as you were given the service you paid for, just not the promised additions. That's a bit of a legal gray area.)
---
Legally, they're in the clear because of their wording. No where did they say any time-frame. Morally, fuck 'em.
---
I do pretty well with a .38 suppressed auto pipe (non legendary) on an AR build.
---
I mainly use it for exploring lower level areas, like senenic or lore hunting. But I was taking on lvl 62 ferals at lvl 25 and clearing areas. 
---
I mainly use it when I'm low on all my other ammo types  but a few times I've gone to buy .38 from players just to help em unload it.
---
You can always get rid of ammo in your vending machines for 1 cap.
---
Saw this coming a mile away and I recommend seeking a refund, false advertising
---
Add poison damage from the kings, and the armor ignoring abilities of mr gutsy and they would be *scary*
---
Yeah, it should be able to search for and mark meat-piles and robot piles that we can loot after a battle, legendary piles it should mark with a star icon.
---
No it's really sad, you should get help rather than trying to elevate yourself by ruining a video game for other people. None of them made your current situation what it is, you are the only constant in your own life.
---
Well I’ll be honest, haven’t really got the faction off the ground since I’m waiting on that sweet propaganda to roll out but definitely. We don’t really have a set uniform but I make insurgent outfits, with wraparound goggles and surgical masks for everyone when they join if they want to use those. If you want I can dm you the lore me and my Xbox friends made it pretty much covers the Liberation becoming the Radiant Dawn later on and trying to obliterate the Capital Wasteland
---
"$14 a month is pretty steep for the stuff we do get"
---
Not that it's neither here nor there but I pay $14 for a nitrado ark server and all I get is the server, no perks or bonuses.
---
I just set challenges fir myself
---
I've played a Vault Dweller in 3 games now. It's a kinda boring backstory at this point.   
---
The annoying thing recently is I got a really good Vampiric Gattling Plasma gun. The thing is absolutely amazing at taking down anything... but I also have a normal Gatling gun and i'm like  
---
"This gun is practically better in every way, but this one fits with the idea of my character building his guns out of scrap"
---
I'm worried my camp and pet are going to get wrecked when this comes. I have no turrets or budget for them, assuming those will level up too, which might be a bold assumption. I regularly have to kill a number of enemies every time I load in, or someone else loads in to shop.
---
I'm level 203 and I live in the forest since a gang of level 68 muties or ghouls can easily kick my ass if I'm not careful. I don't have a horrible build or weapons either! I just don't have god roll stuff.
---
But a lot of people said ESO got easier with the One Tamriel (sp?) update, so maybe it won't be bad at all.
---
They can already do that with letter sets, or their name. Also the 76 player base mostly nice… mostly
---
Most likely yes, on a trading sub. Which this is not.
---
You should go on F76 market for trading
---
It's ridiculous really, you should get the full reward if you deal 1000 damage throughout the event not just to the queen as taking out the mobs is a big help.
---
Bullshit! Everyone who was here since the start will know about it.
---
The vendors were added in an early patch..
---
Not sure why anyone don’t know about it, you have to go in there for a quest
---
Beth needs to give us the PA crabwalk.. call it the zoidberg shuffle.
---
Legit tho I'd like an option to see the enter animation from first person. Getting in and then seeing the hud boot up.
---
I'd also like a longer entrance and exit when not in combat, and a maybe a quick ejection when in combat thatll throw you back a few feet.
---
I play with the camera quite a bit, maybe you’ll find one of mine you like. Here are a few of my favorites. 
---
https://imgur.com/a/7RcMDLE
---
Either way I hope you return with a link to your work, I’d like to see it!
---
Yeah, my Xbox gamer tag is ChaosTheCat if you want to add that as well. I play Fallout 76 on PS4, but I’m willing to buy it again for Xbox. I have enough of a reason to, and enough money. I’ll just have to grind back up to my normal levels, and I’m not buying Fallout 1st again 😅
---
See, I don't get this idea. 
---
Deathclaws were jokes until Fallout 4. Where fighting one unarmored was a quick way to suicide. 
---
Granted, they're jokes again here, but such is the problem of an MMO based game.
---
So a practice intentionally restricting your enjoyment in order to reinforce daily logins and keep up player numbers for the company is not anti-consumer? All right, friend
---
I saw a post where someone claimed that a deposit in a nuke zone will continue to spawn scorched and hence give you loads of that. Or you can bring a bloat fly syringer and spawn those guys.
---
Wendigos, bizarrely, are made into total jokes with any melee weapon. Just block their swipe, and they'll fall into this hour long recovery animation, where you can wail on them. When they start charging up a scream, power attack them. 
---
Those 63 turd ghouls on the other hand...
---
We don’t need special help. It just makes the game more fun to not have to worry about scrap. Honestly everything besides that is just a perk.
---
I mean they do do atom shop sales they just don't tell you that item on sale is on sale because of fallout 1st is which is why everyone says they haven't done them but they other 3 things they haven't done.
---
Oh god please no
---
What quest in particular? Cos I most certainty have done all the main quests and I pre ordered the game. I just wasn’t aware of the vendors as I stopped playing because lack of content
---
Im not sure if party boy boosts it or not, but now im interested to find out.
---
If you pre-order a game, or get a year long subscriptions.. You are an idiot.
---
Weight reduction does not count because it makes your weight more effective, but does not actually change your weight. Let's assume you're carrying only Nuclear Keycards, because they wrigh 1 no matter what and can't be reduced. How many can you hold?
---
If we get into weight reduction, we would have to calculate based on the lightest possible item (i think that would be 5mm ammo at under 0.001 weight), making your effective carry weight like 7.4×10⁵.
---
Would implementing something like Collectron companions even be that hard? The bare minimum assets and voice lines are already in FO76 (and all you'd really need wouldn't be much), and FO4 Automatron's mechanics I'd guess wouldn't be too challenging to port over to FO76 seeing as they use the same engine.
---
Now I know next to nothing about coding (let alone the Creation Engine) so I could be totally wrong about this, and there are more pressing matters that need to be addressed - but it seems completely possible to me, seeing how much (to my understanding) FO76 borrowed/copied from FO4 already (not saying that's inherently a bad thing in of itself, just that what I'm proposing doesn't seem that radically different to what's already been accomplished).
---
Any advice from someone who knows coding and/or the Creation Engine (particularly Fallout's coding) on the actual feasibility of what I've proposed would be much appreciated.
---
Absolutely. It’s the hardest choices. That Gatling Plasma is TOP TIER, but the Gatling Gun and the character arc... 
---
But I agree with the “I’ve played 3 Vault dwellers at this point”. Fallout 4’s was unique, but it’s my least favorite out of all Fallout games. I think even Fallout 2, with being the grandchild of the character of the first Fallout, had a better character arc involved with the backstory. I dunno. I just prefer my characters to be of the wastes, like you with your current character.
---
I’ve been tempted to buy fallout 1st but I’ve been dissuaded by seeing unsatisfied players, tho that scrapbox and portable tent be real tempting. And my Xbox counterparts seem to be trying to make basically Minutemen with the name “Nuclear Patriots” I think it’s blasphemy but hey they seem prosperous
---
Difference though to pay the price of those letters against a camp budget for letters no one reads where as a public message everyone who looks at your camp on the map sees. It would be troll catnip to leave a big ol toxic shit as their advertisement to the libs they wanna gas chamber. 
---
And I dunno what player base you talk experience but almost every single person I’ve talked on mic to has been screaming homophobic shit and attacking while trying to goad me with insults to attack back. It’s a fun game but still plagued by the same shitbags as every other online experience.
---
You have to collect Hollotapes inside the whitespring
---
If you’re level 203 and are struggling with max level super mutants. It’s not your gear it’s your build. PM me and I’ll help u if you like
---
Yeah it'll make it harder to power level people like that, but it will make doing it less boring for everyone involved
---
If you're both fighting the same enemy (aside from boss fights I believe) you'll see a level 68 super mutants and they'll see a level 15, with appropriate XP/item rewards
---
So you'll actually be earning rewards for your level while you help them earn rewards for their level
---
There's also the public teams coming, that should help with leveling, with a team of 4 set to do events, everyone gets +100% XP from events
---
I appreciate this comment so much. I wonder how many people truly understand it hahaha
---
I was never really a fan of the Minutemen backstory. Cool concept, poor execution. Maybe Nuclear Patriots could come around and be better. 
---
On Fallout 1st, I’m not dissatisfied, I’ll be honest. I bought the year long subscription, and for $100, it’s not the worst deal in the world. I think what truly makes the deal worth it is the monthly amount of atom. Like, you can get 1100 for like $10 on the store, but for $100, you can get 1280 x 12, PLUS awesome armor, a scrap box that’s SUPER handy, and the survival tent has saved my ass on more than one occasion. If you have the money, I say it’s definitely worth it. I hardly use the private server, but it’s also had its use.
---
Honestly I think all PA animations need a rework except the falling impact one,  I hate the way the legs move in the third person movement animations and I think it looks goofy and takes away from the feeling of PA overall.  
---
I really can’t 3rd person PA because of it and I wish that there was a bit more love put into those animations..
---
you cant destroy camps to nothing anymore? Plus fatmans are trash in 76. Same with 10mills and pipe weapons. rip.
---
It’s worth noting that if a game has a ton of people complaining about it, then those people must not be actively playing it.  I mean, if they are actually continuing to play it, then they must like it a lot considering they play it despite the complaints they have...because naturally no one would continue to play a game they dislike unless it’s some sort of masochistic thing.  
---
Ergo, when you hear a ton of people complaining about a game they won’t stop playing, that translates into a lot of noise for the valid complaints when a little noise will do.
---
To answer your question personally, though, if you got burnt out after Wastelanders, I would wait to come back for new content.  Worse thing in the world you can do is get burnt out in a setting you once loved.  The best time you see a video that showcases something new which makes you feel like, “oh wow that looks like it could be cool!  I’d like to try that,” ...that’s the time to come back.   
---
IMHO
---
I don't have access to that beverage yet, so I don't know if it would overwrite the Pepperoni Roll or Whiskey. I assume Whiskey because alcohol, but who knows what the spaghetti code says?
---
Doesn't a pocketed chest hold 15?
---
Ps4 player here, i think you are having issues other then the game itself because i can run it perfectly fine.
---
The Atoms are definitely the most appealing factor in my mind, the private server could be nice when I just want to hop on do my daily quests then hop off but there’s something enjoyable about seeing others on and playing
---
Does it? I don't remember. I'll check and make the corrections in the morning.
---
Really disliked the character arc in Fallout 4, like with Nuka World I just laughed at the voice they made your character use when trying to be a raiding evil guy.  
---
Sorry dude, you've spent the last 30 hours talking like a suburban everyday-nice guy. We all know that you're just trying to sound cool.  
---
It's why I liked the Courier, other than my occupation there is nothing known about my past. Other than that starting scene every game could be played a different way.  
---
The Sole Survivor on the other hand is given a background, motive, family and voice which at that point... why am I even playing? How can I roleplay my own character when I am handcuffed to very particular story points about this child that I apparently am meant to care about?
---
This is the prime reason I hate when games like this come out on console, it ruins it for the pc players due to the limitations consoles have. Like I don't know why anyone with a brain would choose to play fo3/nv/4 or Elder scrolls games on a console over pc for the single player ones, you lose out on mods, better graphics, better performance, modder made bug fixes, reshade and so many other things. I mean if all they HAVE is a console thats different, but if they got a pc? Upgrade that thing over bothering with a console, it'll be worth it in the long run due to just the massive amount of things you can do on a pc besides just play games.
---
After spending an hour trying to get my camp spawn just right, and still not coming close,  the mats are 100% necessary.  I have still encountered either really bad spawns or "grief" spawns (one person had the glass dome atom shop item and kept it empty with a locked door and forced the spawn inside it). I do know that the current system sets the spawn in a general area, not a set spot, so it makes grief spawns very hard to do - and I appreciate that... but there has to be a way to give us more control over spawns without catering to griefers/trappers.    
---
Perhaps if we had a distanced visual of the spawn zone when manipulating the camp object, as well as a way to change the direction the person faces... so if you grab the camp module in build mode you see a green circle representing the spawn radius off in the distance that moves as you move the module around.. perhaps whatever direction the lamp on the module faces determines which direction people spawning in will initially face?   This seems more than doable in the current engine and doesn't even require a special item.
---
Absolutely. It’s convenient to have if I want it, but I much prefer the online aspect, even if it means my precious workshops are at risk of being dominated by a douche with a Two-Shot Explosive Gatling Plasma from before the update. Had that happened on too many occasions 😔
---
It's like this with every game. Further away from starting areas you are, emptier they will get. First impressions matter.
---
So, pure stats T-65 is the best, Followed by stranger heart, Than T-51b.
---
If you are asking if it is worth it, It depends on your build and as you don't use PA I would not advise it. It takes nearly a month of gold and is only better if you use it all the time
---
&gt; A lot of users paid the yearly option because it made more sense  financially and for the big atom payout. A lot of those users probably  would not have had paid if had they known 9 months later crucial rewards  would still be missing. 
---
You would be right if Bethesda was a company of integrity who delivered on their promises in the past. However; it is not surprising given Bethesda's [track record on the game](https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2018/11/21/it-sure-is-interesting-to-rewatch-that-fallout-76-todd-howard-e3-reveal-now/). If the evidence suggests that you can't trust a company, why would you spend $117? It beggars belief.
---
It's not my build, TBH builds aren't complicated in this. Get the appropriate weapon perks, stuff to supplement your style, go HAM. I just like to play the suboptimal shit like pistols and crossbows. I'm not struggling 1 on 1 but when surrounded by 68 ghouls or Mr. Gutsies. I assume most people do too.
---
The problem isn't killing I guess, just that things die slower, so I really hope I'm not going to lose Mr. Slothy Boi when this all goes down.
---
That always bug out and stand still
---
Tru, but i would assume whiskey too tho bc i vaguely remember it working with radstag
---
Yes! And after it throws us, while we're still in the air and if there is concrete in out inventory, we should craft and drop bricks. Big, roadblock sized concrete bricks. That's how much we should be scared to face a deathclaw.
---
Yea, I thought end game was meh, until I realized that Tadpole and Possum were not the only pioneer scout tanks...
---
/s
---
I get fallout 1st for one reason: The scrap box. It also could be worse, it could be ESO where every update requires you to buy the new thing, or sub to have access to all dlc content. if you don't? well your cut out from the new stuff, and most of the older stuff they added without shelling out money for it.  The game has many DLC only dungeons, that you have to buy the dlc to access or sub to Eso+ to get into it.
---
Cant wait , finally a reason to go visit the west side . The few places high lvls have to farm gear are getting booring
---
Good to know!
---
didn't know thus happened with them since i usually one shot them with a bloodied ss gauntlet. learn something new everyday !
---
Even so. With the correct build u should be one shotting and avoiding 80% of incoming attacks and mitigating a huge amount of the 20% that gets through.
---
Awesome, thank you. I'll look into that more.
---
Only thing caps has been able to buy is mid tier gear, the best gear has always been trade only
---
You get atoms monthly at a value price, everything else is a nice perk.
---
Only server outage maybe but dont imply they were not shit servers with every problem under the sun as you and many others seem to be hinting at.
---
I love this post.  Doesn’t matter whether you were the first person or the last person to discover it, finding something new is always exciting.  
---
I actually think it took a lot more skill than the rest of us had to avoid this “mall” for all this time.  It’s the kind of thing that seems a detriment at first, but once you look more closely it took quite a bit of talent.  I bet you’ve never stepped on a mine in the Wasteland...just naturally tiptoeing around.  Hope to see you out in the wasteland!
---
I'm not interested in Bloodied builds.
---
I agree. I’ve had countless arguments with friends who joined the fan base after Fallout 4 as to why it’s the worst IN MY OPINION. I never want to say it’s absolutely the worst, because there are many who enjoy it, but it is no New Vegas. I agree on the point the Courier is probably the absolute best narrator to have. In Fallout 1, your character is a Vault Dweller; in Fallout 2, you’re the grand-child of the Fallout 1’s character; in Fallout 3, you’re born and raised in Vault 101, and you have a dad (Liam Neeson will forever be my dad ❤️). What they all have in common is they have connections. In New Vegas, the best connection you have is the dude in the DLC (I can’t remember his name at this moment). You have no family, no past, no motive other than revenge that we see play out. It truly is the best role-playing experience in Fallout in my opinion.
---
The scrap box is nice though and the survival tent. Once you play with those once you can never play without them again. They are that useful.
---
I'm just disappointed that when I went Deathclaw Island there weren't any Deathclaws
---
Ok dude. I never mentioned bloodied. I’ve offered to help u but your happy. So gl
---
But as long as people pay for unfinished and broken games and its subscriptions the industry will keep offering this crap.
---
Why shouldn't they? People obviously want it for whatever reason
---
Ok fellas calm down here. I know the NCR isn’t around yet. I just like the faction... I know you were perhaps just fucking with me, but allow me to explain WHY I like the NCR. And no. It’s not because it’s the “generic hero type” lmfao. The NCR is pretty dirty, just like every other faction. Not sure what the “high horse“ about a video game faction is about but okay  
---
I really liked both Aradesh and Tandi from the original games. They’re were some of my favorite characters because they were just good people. Another thing? Obviously pre-war America wasn’t nearly as “democratic” as we’d think. NCR citizens pay taxes, yes, but they also get protection and the ability to vote. That’s pretty huge in a post apocalypse society. Especially protection. 
---
Does it really mimic pre war america?? You sure?
---
 The NCR is not without fault. They definitely have their fair share of problems like all of the factions in the fallout world, but there are great people in the NCR. Tandi, chief Hanlon, Cass as well. Tons more, that just want to help people out. 
---
It’s hard to argue that the NCR is the best bet as far as factions go. Why? Because they actually CAN vote. And even if they have garbage people in power now, the citizens CAN vote and their vote DOES matter. So all of those complaining NCR citizens will vote for who’s right for them.
---
The legion are literally the worst pick. House is only in it for House, Yes Man and the Courier are horrible picks for the future of the Mojave because of the fact that neither have any fucking idea what they’re doing, as General oliver reminds us at the end of the battle of hover dam.
---
The brotherhood will forever stay xenophobic and I LIKE that about them because that’s how they were written. 
---
My favorite post apocalypse option is the minutemen in fallout 4. Essentially forming a council of all major settlements. But that doesn’t exist in fallout NV.
---
The NCR is cool because it’s a struggling group. Spread way too thin, filled with good and bad. I like a lot of characters for the NCR and what they stand for. Just good people. Some not so great, obviously. They’ve suffered a lot, just like most of the other people out in the wasteland. The above poster is right because they’re so interesting BECAUSE of their flaws. Also the “legend” of the NCR veteran Rangers is super cool. “Chasing ghosts in Baja”, “chew nails and spit napalm”. They’re some of the most feared entities in the Mojave. That’s pretty cool.
---
Think what you will, it’s a video game faction. But for my money and my morality, theyre the best bet for the Mojave
---
Well yeah..... It's Watoga... *The City Of The Future*
---
Yeah, I don't need the help but thanks.
---
I'll take on a deatchlaw before a diseased tick any day...
---
can try to track down Grahm, or try the vendors at Whitespring, It might be in one of the all-in-one plan schematics, like Plan: Advanced Power Whatever
---
Yes I think it will be a much better system, and I am excited about it.  Time to power level up an alt if you want is now it sounds like, but I am definitely looking forward to this as you won’t have to be a high level to join your friends.
---
Thank you, I will try that right now
---
I like the one on deatthclaw island, you can aggro it then swim across the river and it can't follow you and you can snipe it from across the river getting sneak attacks every shot till it dies.
---
and even that motivation revenge, depends if you personally want to care.  
---
Fallout 4 was accessible but that's because roleplay elements were obviously sacrificed. The background I almost feel like is put in as an excuse to limit the story
---
LVL 215 here, I run a bloodied unyielding build but will put on excavator PA when going through Whitesprings still, just less of a hassle that way.
---
What you need is the Advanced Power Connectors plan and you can buy it from the Watoga or Free States vendors.
---
Just checked and it is 15 but if you make it deep pocketed it's 10.
---
I am not sure I understand the question.  You can just make stairs which go up to a second floor you will make.
---
Those Floaters have WAY to much frigging damage resistance and no actual weak points anywhere on them. I'd also run into a den of deathclaws long before I'd run into a pack of floaters willingly.
---
From what I’ve experienced, you only don’t get the atoms that you have on the Bethesda launcher. Characters and stuff still stays
---
Yeah exactly :) I'm looking forward to it too
---
Say what you will and like who you want! That’s the fun of getting invested in video game factions. But not sure it’s cool to suggest other people are unintelligent and “can’t comprehend” because they like something different. That’s just straight up fuckin stupid man
---
In the Bethesda age Fallout's, there only scary in New Vegas.
---
Sorry if I wasn't too clear, there are 3 open spots (1x3) where the extractor is. I want 2 of those spots to be "2nd floor" floors, as opposed to just filling them in with foundations, the 3rd I would like a set of stairs going down, to be able to access the extractor.
---
This said they DO give you a full power armor suit AND a minigun to fight it with which makes it miles easier, try to fight that same deathclaw rushing the main story without the power armor and gatling gun, and see how ya do, it'd rip you to shreads probably in 2 hits even on normal.
---
Ahem
---
Nuclear winter
---
What this guy said! I love the first two fallout games to death and NV felt like a true sequel! Mind you, I love all the fallout games for different reasons
---
Just thinking about it, home defense might be a lot more important if I have a level 68 shooting at my wall constantly instead of a level 1 scorched lol.
---
I wish my encounter today was like this I own a gun store in 76 and I just found two new guns and i was putting them up then this guy comes in with a battle axe and attack and kills me then he destroys one of my gun tracks and steals my fucking fat man it took me 3 hours to find i get on voice chat and tell him to give it back now or I will destroy his base then the asshole leaves! It took me 3 hours to find the fatman!!
---
Also mammalogist wasn’t too bad
---
I think so personally because it’s a wasted asset otherwise right?
---
Did you just start playing?
---
Maaaaa birthday!
---
 Couldn’t have worded it better. I hope to see you too in the wasteland
---
Not possible without placing stairs on foundation. Sorry. But that’s definitely something Bethesda should make possible
---
I believe it will cost some caps to switch between entire load outs though right?  I may have heard that wrong though.
---
Incorrect. Count to 3 and jump.still very spam able. If they wanted a real nerf make it cost half ap to jump. Shouldn't be in game anyway.
---
“Yeah, you make a game so beautiful, you have to chop something. All gamers rave about graphics, you hardly hear anyone talk about story, right? So why not just, I dunno, cut that?”
---
Probably some Bethesda intern
---
Once I see that beam is 70% charged (You can tell its charge level by looking at it) I run like a chicken fearing the butcher and hide behind the nearest thing they can't shoot thru. Even in power armor I refuse to tank that beam. Assaultrons are honestly much more deadly in fo76 compared to fallout 4, in fallout 4 they weren't really any stronger defense wise than a protectron, so 1-3 shots and they'd go down. In fo76 thou? Assaultrons and Sentry bots are TANKY mofo's like they should be. If I See either I actually stop and check the terrain and figure out a plan how to kill it. As unless your running some super op build like bloodied or junkies, its going to take a while to kill that thing.
---
Oh I did that and you didn’t have to go through the mall section as I remember the holotapes where just outside I mustn’t of noticed all the vendors.
---
Private server for my bombs bud! I don't like the idea of catching peoples homes etc and making it too hard for new peeps as it's part of the early quests.
---
Ughhh not what I wanted to hear.. i came close to having it dialed in, but one of my foundations would need to be removed, not something I'm really willing to compromise on. Thanks for the response. =(
---
Remove Frog Legs. Period.
---
Frog Legs is the most broken perk ever and doesn't belong whatsoever. You're going to get a ton of trolls of the post as the always do.
---
I understand, hence the "effective" and "up to" parts. Wasn't aware that it had weird effects on the weight of 5mm ammo though. Just wanted to add to your potential stash statement since you do in fact have the potential to carry far more.
---
No reason to play this game if not from the story. I'll just finish Wastelanders then unninstall it 'till the next big update. They never bothered with endgame.
---
Could give a deathclaw a poison breath attack? Kinda like the mirelurk hunters have, also make them more tankier and you got something nightmarish.
---
I haven’t played 76 in a while what are the things that are stronger than a deathclaw
---
Thats due to the way DR works in fo76, and the fact they gave many things super high explosive resistance on top.
---
Yeah I got plenty of Rad fluid off the ghoul packs. Plus u can start the cargobot event, and others too. I think there's a junkyard workshop too that'd mean a few kills during defense. Honestly, I can't talk it up enough for solo farming.
---
I still remember being probed from the old zeta expansions. Anything is possible 😂
---
Characters are the same across both launchers. The only thing that doesn't transfer are your atoms and your fallout 1st subscription.
---
Very true lol I'm used to that from living in the cranberry bog
---
I can't believe I forgot to mention my favourite thing about it
---
Since they scale to our level, events like uranium fever will actually give us usable legendaries lol, for example, the lvl 35 B2525 .45 SMG I got a couple weeks ago would be lvl 50, that was an annoying drop lmao
---
You could survive the scorchbeast one IF you have a jetpack.
---
It’s all good, I’m over 50 now, I just like my little patch of earth near Mumma Dolces
---
There is one, and its a "leader" type one too, it spawns from a nest on the island, you have to walk close enough to it for it to come out of its hole. Assuming someone hasn't killed it recently that is.
---
It's more the ghouls I want. I can only speak for myself and I found more ghouls throughout Morgantown and surrounds than WS. I've nuked both, and MT gave me shit tons of stable by the end. Maybe I did WS wrong I dunno.
---
It doesn’t sound like you are interested in a solution, which I don’t blame you for at all...sounds frustrating.  So I don’t mean to push you in a direction you don’t wish to go.  But, I was just wondering if you were able to log in to Bethesda.net account and if you were able to verify your email address.  I thought that could be the problem in some way as I had to verify my email in order for it to work once even after already having had it verified.
---
Enola Walker (non-spoiler version): Do I mean nothing to you?
---
I'm quite low level and only went to retrieve an egg for the fairground guy. So I just thought it was scripted
---
Berkeley is not functionning at all even before the server problems (On ps4).
---
I tried to check the validity of the claims you made, but the word "increased" doesn't even appear in the source material 
---
Don't make us hunt for the evidence for the point you're trying to make.
---
Oh wow that would have been fantastic!  Still great actually, but level 50 would have been true legend.
---
So what to do with old quest holos, notes? Drop them? Kinda hard for me to do that, but with a little persuasion I could haha
---
"Sure, it's a roleplay game. Story isn't needed"
---
You every see like notes on Far Harbour how they mentioned it was important to show how your actions have consequences?
---
Yes Todd, that was the time to start caring about actions having consequences in a open-world RPG...
---
Yeah, I have an issue with them doing that also. Not like the Power Armour breaks down right after and needs to be repaired.
---
Hahaha I just like the faction. Well aware they aren’t around yet. Thanks for the reminder 🌝🌝🌝
---
That is because you are too overencumbered. The game only lets you carry your max weight plus 1500 pounds. 
---
You can still sell things to vendors and use the legendary machines. But yes, anything else you drop, etc. will disappear. 
---
My recommendation would be to drop what you don’t care about until you get to a level you can move. Other then that there is not much you can do. 
---
It was implemented a long time ago to keep dupers from duping.
---
PC, UK. It's Only during events. I can be farming scorched in the south east, clearing westek, scavening for armor; all fine.
---
Join an event; can almost guarantee now I'll get dropped and end up just wasting loads of ammo, time and get no reward.
---
I dont kno if its still possible but if u can build a foundation low enough to where the top of stairs comes to the same height as your other foundations u can build floors off of those stairs that will kind of clip (they wont snap) over the foundations without giving the “cant build bc intersecting objects” nonsense, but if they fixed it then it wont work. But even if it works that lower foundation and stair will have to stay bc the floors a technically only attached to that.
---
Too bad rhe only good dining items that don't spoil are Fasnahct Donuts, Canned Coffee, and Canned Stew.  Everthing else is booze.
---
Depends on how much you try to stretch the term. It's a score system, you don't spend score to get anything.  Linear progression.
---
IIRC Party Boy was changed to specify that it only affects Pre-War alcohol some time after moonshining was introduced. So I’m pretty sure it is intentional.
---
Also mods....I wanted them
---
People. No, but I do believe that it will come back when old code gets overwritten and the raid opens back up. The. They jusy roll with it because it just works
---
Yeah i ended up getting a foundation that low, but i can't get them under the extractor due to "intersecting objects" thing. I think its either clipping theb extractor or the node itself, but either way that option does not look viable.
---
then gather supplies (kindling, etc.) or repair devices - all i'm saying there are things you can do to avoid relying on handouts...
---
Did you even read the first comment i made?
---
I figure we won't see the Screaming Eagle skin for sometime since it's animations look totally unacceptable in their current state. Since they need to reuse the Handmade Rifle animations for it there are [noticeable clipping issues](https://youtu.be/hKFfxNjp9wA?t=10) when you reload.
---
Similarly there aren't any ironsights for the weapon yet since the AR platform's irons are in a radically different position than the AK. So Bethesda are gonna need to figure this one out before they introduce it to the ATX Shop.
---
Its scripted to spawn when you walk near the nest on quest or not. ^^
---
" I have seen that many people have asked for it " - Been here since launch of the game and this is the first time i ever seen someone ask for 10 mm sub skins.
---
I don't see how they would make extra camp budget work, you set up your camp in private world but then go to a public world to play then want to add something to the camp but you're past budget on the public space and have to go to private each time to add stuff?
---
Plus you get access to a private world, granted you can only invite a limited number of people but you get to harvest anything and everything which you would have a hard time doing on publoc and paying for a private server on other games is usually around that price as well.
---
I agree that they should deliver on what they said but they are terrible with their coding and those features would probably be broken as well as well as abused.
---
Yep. What a damn shame. They really could have made it look neat.
---
I like how she starts out with a thick accent and loses it almost completely
---
This is neither here nor there, (I support your request btw, as I love the weapon skins too), but I feel compelled to inquire at what point something goes from forgotten to “very forgotten”?
---
As a wise man said before,   
---
"It's just works"
---
What platform?
---
I would be happy with being able to build private world only additional camps, leaving my public camp as is. 
---
No need to worry about cross server pollution if all the additional stuff is flagged as private only.
---
Level 315. I love my little cottage in the forest. Nice, quiet, peaceful.
---
I too dread coming across a hoard of something like 5 supermutants in the mire, all with mini guns (and I've had it happen).
---
I play a full health split-build. I can sneak almost anywhere, and use rifles (Fixer &amp; handmade) most of the time. But when necessary, I'll dawn power armor (Excavator), swap perk cards (perk loadout manager on PC), and equip my .50 cal (explosive suppressors) and fight toe-to-toe against anything. I do die once in a while, but it's very rare.
---
No, I don't one-shot most higher level enemies, but I do enjoy myself.
---
When you forget that you forgot something?
---
The game is just registering any movement you make as a minor change in landscape for the time being.  It’s likely no one else can drop anything either on your server! Lol
---
Not everyone who pvps is part of that campaign. In fact if you were on a console it most certainly wasn’t anyone from that group.
---
If you go the the spring stay at the resort not anywhere else
---
PS4 btw
---
I would decorate all the workshops like my C.A.M.P!
---
ive been having the same problem on the the regulary ps4  character corruption and system slow down. fast travaling  can take up to two or three min. I've deleted the game three time and re installed it and seems to fix the corrupted data for a time, but the loading times are still very long
---
Saw a guy giving away thousands of items away for free, instantly got to 1200 pounds.
---
So don't forget to forget you forgot me
---
Honestly why would have really spiced up this region for me is having the various sundew groves take up more of this region, with the marked location acting as “islands” in the sea of mutated sundew trees.
---
With the hidden cost of losing additional carry weight
---
French decent I'd guess. Possibly French Father and African American mother.
---
I don't think the gun gets much use, in general.
---
I mean, I *tried* to main a 10mm SMG (spec'd into Commando), I really did. But the iron sights on it are just ass, and apparently there's no way to change/upgrade them.
---
Ended up switching to a Handmade.
---
What you should be able to do is:
---
1. lower the outside bricks so that part of the extractor would end up being just above the 2nd floor.
---
2. Have stairs going up to a third floor off of a brick on the 2nd floor, perhaps off to one side, and then have stairs going down from the 3rd floor to the 2nd floor at the start of the open area.
---
3. Place floor pieces across all three squares.
---
What you should end up with is part of the extractor poking out just above the 2nd floor and you should be able to access the extractor inventory.  
---
I know that this works for water purifiers but I've never tried it on extractors.
---
I have Fallout 1st and I rarely play on private worlds unless I’m farming for glowing mass/hrf which is only like once a month or two.
---
Im on xbox could  l get  some help  my username is swagpotato256
---
The bulging ball sacs they call their heads actually give quite the crit as I’ve recently discovered
---
People really want those rare outfits.
---
Sure, just message me
---
Finish enclave quest line , go to the head office and download the prototype schematics from the terminal.
---
I have it also, though to be honest with the Atomic stores its unlikely they'll expand the customisation of those Private Servers. Its just going to remain a private place to quest with friends for quite awhile
---
Thank you where is the head office
---
Yea it is not a very good weapon.. It lacks mods to make it useful. Like suppressor.
---
you guys are paying $14 a month??? i have to pay $25 but to be fair i live in australia
---
I think 3rd person animations in general need a massive rework since characters seem extremely robotic.
---
The worst issue in my opinion is that there isn't some sort automatic system that lowers a player's weapon in 3rd and optionally in 1st person that triggers based on combat state.
---
So you end up with a bunch of idiots all pointing guns in every direction aiming at loot containers or world objects. This combined with the lack of a "pick-up item animation" makes the whole affair sort of immersion breaking.
---
I really wish they'd add a lowered weapons system that dynamically activates based on whether or not you're in \[CAUTION\] or \[DANGER\]. It would really clean-up some of these 3rd person interactions at reduce visual clutter on screen when looting, especially with very large weapons like the Gauss Rifle or Gauss Minigun.
---
I think the discounts were changed to getting items for free each month, they were initially going to charge us for the 1st stuff in the atom shop
---
Yeah, unfortunately. However, if you’re popular enough, you might sell out of everything before it spoils! And if you have all the right perks. I make sure to have the “spoils 90% slower” or whatever perks equipped. It really makes a difference. 
---
But like I said, popular is more of the deciding factor, and that’s the hard part in a game not dedicated to role playing elements.
---
😂 Yeah, good point! A little late on that one. Let’s pray Elder Scrolls VI doesn’t fall to the same fate
---
They give you the ability to create a deer skull mount for your camp
---
I'm gonna be honest. These sort of strange backwards connections you've suggested are probably the reason why stuff like the Waterwheel stopped spinning or my Backwoods Bungalow walls just randomly lost all collision.

Would carnivore mutation double the the STR benefit to +6?
---
Not for $100 a year they're not
---
OP, you left out "caveat emptor - buyer beware".
---
Good luck with getting some traction with this. I really mean it. I have mixed feelings about your situation.
---
I mean firstly you were dumb enough to pay a massive amount upfront with no guarantee that any of the things they said they would add that they would and didn't push them to commit to a timeframe to release these features. 
---
&gt; Than fallout 1st pricing should reflect some perks aren't available yet, as well as **their initial advertisement**. $14 is pretty steep for the stuff we get now. 
---
Should? How or why? What you're paying for is what you currently are getting. They clearly state in that summary graphic of what you get with your subscription. If you paid for something you thought wasn't worth it but you felt all the future planned stuff was, that's entirely on you, not Bethesda.
---
Of all the things you've listed, based on the link you provided, the only thing you can probably catch Bethesda out on is the Atomic Shop discounts. The wording very strongly implies that you'll get this exclusive discounts upfront and ongoing 
---
"As a Fallout 1st member, you’ll have access to exclusive discounts in the Atomic Shop, so not only are you getting bonus Atoms every month, you’ll get discounts on some sweet items to spend those Atoms on. ". 
---
None of this text implies that it's a future plan. Any reasonable person would thing you'd get the discount upfront and ongoing every month.
---
All that private world stuff is clearly worded as future content and they gave zero indication of when that'd happen. NOTHING in the wording establishes any expectation of how soon these private world benefits will come, just their intention to do so.
---
I hope your country has good consumer laws or your post gets serious traction. 
---
At the very least this should be a life lesson to either be happy with paying for what you get now, irrespective of future plans or don't be a chump and spend the money upfront expecting the value to work its way in after the fact. That's just dumb af.
---
I’m sorry but screenshots of the fact that it was on the fallout first page and not in a blog post about there hopes for the further of the program cause this is sounding like those tinfoil hate evil Bethesda corp bs all over again.
---
The fact that you get more Atom than you can buy for the price of a years sub kinda ends your argument everything after that is just added value your perspective of what your entitled to get with your sub is wack.
---
Unpopular opinion: camps are stupid.  I really don't understand people who obsesse over their goddamn camps. I am speaking as someone who spent a lot ot time settlment buildin in Fallout 4.  In Fallout  4 you could build an entire small town on an island. 
---
How can anyone give a fuck about the stupid camp system in this game after that?
---
FO1st looked like a cash grab from the outset, I've yet to see anything from Methesda to change my mind.
---
Do you know how to get to the military wing? Before you head up that last set of stairs I believe it’s straight across from where you enter the area at. Looking for red modus terminals
---
Ok. I never claimed it. I beat it 4 months ago, can I still get it

Location.
---
This is going to seem like a dumb question but for the sake of being thorough, how do you know its corrupt data?
---
Is this the new content with the BOS? As in, new quests and characters or just minor changes?
---
Yeah once you go up the stairs into the room where you can initiate searches for nuke keycards, codes, etc, there is a room off to the right with multiple workbenches, armory vendors, and a red set of terminals that are the “archives”. On those terminals one of the archived links is the schematics for the armor.
---
IIRC it's one of the red terminal computers in the the armory in the bunker. The schematics for the armor should be in there.
---
Sorry to hear about your rough patch. -ehug-
---

And you'd likely score them for 5k is what they seem to go for now every time I see them sell.

Also please fix the iron sights and a suppresssor, thanks.

---
Replace 'bug reports' with 'Fallout 1st rewards', same shit different day for them
---
The game kicks me and says this game has corrupted data please delete and reinstall
---
I agree. How the heck do I have water purifiers but can't take a shower?!
---
10mm submachine gun has at least one skin. The Free States skin, which I have on mine. I think it looks pretty slick, too.
---
Hunt legendary top tier enemy types in the bog or mire as quickly as possible and cross your fingers. Best done with a non bloodied melee build with high END/AGI, since at the end of the day, nothing will speed your combat up more than the ability to sprint and leap endlessly.
---
(Also, you don't need to buy bullets and you have big muscles to carry things.)
---
Slot in White Knight so you don't need to waste time farming junk to repair your armor.
---
Then cross your fingers and pray.
---
I've stopped playing since completing my adventure (at a little over level 100) and was fully equipped to my satisfaction. I could play with my HUD off without worrying about dying, with a weapon that one shots most enemies that are not the biggest of bois. One armor piece was purchased from a player vendor, and the chest is Secret Service (maybe like 30 rolls before I got one that I liked), but this replaced another very good 3 star chest piece. If I didn't spend so many caps on plans for my camp I probably could have purchased a full kit from vendors. So even if you don't get natural drops, farming should get you enough caps to get you there.
---
Luck is a huge factor, but efficient and fast farming is key.
---
Bad drops turn into scrip which turns into more rolls. For armor it's probably best to save scrip and craft a single piece of SS armor until you get one you like, then move onto the next. I wouldn't risk buying legendary armor from the purveyor, too many bad armor possibilities.
---
Weapons are the hardest. But I found many other B+/A-  weapons along the way as well that I sold off for cheap to some lucky folks to hold them over until they get their A+ dream.
---
Not just me thats noticed the sudden surge in these posts after that first one then mentioning this
---
Dude just the Jetpack alone is worth it.
---
Just look up iron and lead ore spots and loot them with excavator, the breach and clear event location near hornwright has a good vein that easily gives 90+ ore.
---
If you need lots of acid, wait for the queen of the hunt daily quest, hunt the locations and log off when you kill a cryptic, don’t extract the sample.
---
Oh. Thought it would be something cool and not you know... the millionth mount i’ve seen so far.
---
Could give a second camp that only places down in a private world, so you have 2 camos while in private and you 1 main while in public
---
I swapped marine chest for SS chest. I like it. Seems extremely durable. I repaired to 200% to verify repair bug was fixed (it is). That was over 2 weeks ago, and it's still at 160%. Waiting on deep pockets before crafting any limbs though.
---
According to the roadmap, scaling is incoming this year.  We just arent aware to what degree enemies will scale
---
Have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling?
---
Oh yeah, I go to the armory often and only bothered noticing those red terminals once. To learn the prototype plans. Never noticed them when I’m just shopping right there next to me
---
I agree
---
I have 2 characters, one isn't very good at damage vs queen. But is great for keeping mobs off the damage dealers.
---
The others is good at melting her and more time focus on her the better then clearing mobs.
---
Both should be rewarded the same for carrying their share of the fight.
---
But I just swap to my dps when doing queens sadly.
---
Both are valuable to the fight
---
Are you using steam or .net? If you are using steam, just validate files without having to reinstall.
---
The problem is weekly would be worse.
---
Firstly, Bethesda will never do it because they want you to logon daily to give them more chances to tempt you into buying stuff from the atomic shop. That's a max of 7 opportunities per week vs 1 for weeklies.
---
Secondly, you'd have massive server load spikes on the weekends when most people will likely be free to play and dead servers for the rest of the week. Makes for a poor gameplay experience. Better to spread that load out for 1 hour per day than 7 hours all on 1 day.
---
I mean the recent outages have sucked but they're anomalies. They don't happen often enough were you lose out on maxing your dailies.
---
I doubt vault 94 but maybe someother vault with new rewards
---
I just played for the last few hours and had no issues. Everything seemed great.
---
Sorry, i couldn't hear you over the sound of my level 5 blody black powder pistol, speed demon, adrenal reaction, max rads, and the sound of level 76 deathclaws in agonizing pain followed by gurgling death noises.
---
You give a developer money based on nothing but some promises they made. It's no different than pre-ordering and you only have yourself to blame.
---
Give stupid developers money, win stupid prizes.
---
Haha well unfortunately not! They do add a nice touch to your displays though when you stick them on the front
---
New Vegas deathclaws were something else. Only the very best braved quarry junction
---
If you care about the characters and don't mind spending the money for a steam copy, then you should be able to so long as you login using the same account as you did with the Bethesda launcher version.
---
If you want the free steam copy too, I believe that sadly passed and I'd be VERY surprised if that was ever brought back.
---
Once you finish defending the water pipe, you gotta talk to Bones, the dude with the gas mask in the shack. Then, you'll get your rep.
---
Gatling Plasma needs one too... 
---
I hope it get some love when BoS returns.
---
&gt;Were you hoping we would forget these previously advertised perks bethesda and you would sweep it under the rug?
---
They never address these threads
---
You could team up with some friends that can share weight reducing perks until you sort out your inventory. Equipping weapon weight reducing armor should help as well. If you just have too much stuff still, start by destroying the least valuable items first.
---
I love the handmade. Thinking of going back to it, but working on my bows too. Loved mine as an auto rifle too, just sick of farming ammo. Recently switched back to pistols for that sweet Gauss pistol. It sucks for VATS and is honestly not great because the charge time defeats the extra damage it does--but from stealth it's a monster. It's frustrating to me because I've read something on this sub about how regular damage is calculated and that really the weapons I use aren't weaker, they're just *not broken*. The OP stuff is just calculating damage wrong, but who knows if it'll be fixed. I imagine that might make some players upset if they even do.
---
I'm cool with not one-hitting enemies, but I don't feel as powerful as I want. I should just go melee. *I really wish I could do a full respec*, ugh.
---
There is to my knowledge a vendor steal bug...
---
However that being said apparently it only works if you have glitched way over camp build limit and if the person goes to your camp soon after you load in the server and they can get to the vendors fast.
---
I don't know the specifics or if there are more factors  or if it still works so the chances of you being robbed  is pretty slim.
---
Hard to say. They may reuse the assets elsewhere but I don't know if they'll just bring back the raid whole cloth. 
---
It'd be nice to have more end game options but I wasn't happy with how poorly 94 ran.
---
sure did - that's why i'm mentioning alternatives to shooting! and clearly the OP suggests that people do not enjoy that you are not pulling your weight one way or another, so maybe step up...
---
The war on  Bethesda bullshit fits the classic pattern of the PVP crowd.  It's always the same thing. They use duping, exploits, and all around sleazy tactics, which make balance changes and nerfing 100 percent guaranteed. Then they lash out in anger over when nerfs and balance changes happen- balance changes that they made necessary with their own actions. 
---
The most recent example is a goon squad with legacy weapons have some lower level douche with a mole miner gauntlet go around swatting people.  Someone gets pissed and guns him down quickly, which marks the entire team hostile (which was the whole point). Then the assholes with legacy weapons slaughter everybody. 
---
Now they are pissed off that someone shooting back doesn't make entire teams targets.  Well no it doesn't, and this change was made necessary by their  own douchebaggery.
---
Some new things called floaters got added with wastelanders. They normally accompany super mutants and they can be a real pain to deal sometimes.
---
No thx, i'm fine playing the game like i prefer.
---
Apparently asking for a game that has a subscription service to actually work is heresy 🤔
---
It looks like you're trying to lift your knees as high as you can like you're trying to get in a work while you're walking.
---
For my tastes, you move too quickly in power armour given that it's meant to be a hulking tank. I wouldn't mind if you could get some speed with PA but would rather more expect it to be more like with larger and more powerful bounds with your step and less roadrunner with your legs moving faster than you'd expect something that heavy to move.
---
Thats not a thing... that's a rumour there is no top secret bunker controlled by a shady government shadow group called the enclave.
---
Don't spread lies.

&gt;you have probably never heard of them,

Then they are not famous &amp; you lied to us

If that don't work uninstall and reinstall the game

I'm not against PvP though my only real issue in fo76 is that the regular game modes pvp setup is beyond crap hit some one in there camp over and over again no penalty... That's already bs at least flag the hostile player so my turrets can run em off. not enough reward to fight a criminal player...even more bs it is honestly not worth the caps to go after a wanted player.  If the game had a more flushed out pvp system for the normal world then maybe i would make a character with the mind set to fight other players.   Though i doubt that will happen any time soon...
---
Carnivore/Herbivore dont increase buffs from food, only the amount of food you get from it otherwise every melee build would be carnivores
---
I thought it always used the lowest version of stimpack available when you hit the quick stim button.  That's how it works for me on PC.  I always stim with the quick key and I've never had it use my normal or super stims, always the diluted ones.
---
For soloing Encryptid I have to stash all the diluted and regulars so that the button automatically uses supers.
---
Fair enough, thanks!
---
Ah, ok, going to do that from now on!
---
I can see that!
---
People downvoting you obviously don’t get the reference.
---
I don’t know about you but I trip over three stars like cotton candy.

Here is where they discussed it in greater detail and state that it’s coming with patch 20.

---
Again, here we go again.  I've seen this thread many times over now.  And the answer is always the same.  
---
Sorry to have to inform you again on perhaps the most obvious solution (cancelling your subscription). That's hardly being a fanboy, in fact, I'm actually not a fanboy of Bethesda because I am constantly a detractor of theirs with their handling of Fallout 76.  
---
I tell people if they want to make a difference, they should cancel their Fallout 1st subscription, because if you know you haven't gotten a good deal, it makes perfect sense to not give them another dime. 
---
PLUS, you can probably go back many months ago to find the many, many detractors when Fallout 1st was announced and people were warning others to not support it because Bethesda had (and still has) a bad track record, and there would be no guarantee everything in Fallout 1st would be given to you.  
---
You chose to buy into a subscription without a dated guarantee of when you'd get your content despite many of the warning signs, and you did it anyway.  And now people act like they're shocked at Bethesda failing to add them within a reasonable time frame like many of the other features on a growing list Bethesda still hasn't added into the game.
---
Yes, Bethesda definitely deserves some of the blame for reneging on their words and not providing you content, but that's the case for a lot of things even outside Fallout 1st.  And you guys are actively supporting a developer by giving them money, which itself is a silent approval of whatever they're doing no matter what you personally think.  
---
If you keep giving them money, they have no motivation to change what they're doing, so STOP IT and cancel the subscriptions already if you don't like where things are headed.
---
For a lot of ppl that bought the game, we don’t have a case. We went by the articles that were available at release or pre release for the beta.
---
The case is just art to entice someone to buy the game so it will be a snippet of what is available!
---
PvP was described by Todd and others during discussions so your flat out wrong about that sorry...
---
It is supposed to be a wasteland so why cant people behave like they want. That is literally how it was described “you can help others, or not”.
---
All mmo’s have an aspect of PvP!
---
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.
---
Noticed the same thing tonight on PC. At one point I fast traveled and the loading screen lasted 6 minutes. When I loaded in, all the npcs heads were only loaded in, no bodies. Game has been real goofy the last few days.
---
They're actually mods for the bows. Use the weapon workbench.
---
Sorry you can’t handle other players. Simple answer for you snowflake, go and play another game that doesn’t have other players in it!
---
Thats like taking the cars out of GTA, kind of defeats what the game was sold as!
---
If it keeps happening as you say the only theroy I have is the ps4 disc drive is suffering from a hardware issue. You'll get the same info if you google ps4 game keeps corrupting.
---
This may not fix it but is worth a try and will likely what sony support will have you do..
---
Backup your ps4 via usb for any locally saved data you don't want to loose (google how to do this) also things like your fallout character are safe it is stored on bethesdas end and not local to your system.
---
After this boot into safe mode an initialize the ps4 this will reinstall they system software (google how to do this)
---
If you do this and then reinstall your game and it keeps happening it is almost certainly a physical issue with your ps4 disc drive it could be failing in some manner.
---
You could also contact sony support but in my experience they will do 3 things. Half ass troubleshooting and brush you off, brush you off and tell you to contact the game developer, or tell you the hard drive is failing and you are out of warranty.
---
Disclaimer: I have a lot of experience with electronic devices and computers. The advice is given is opinion based on this experience but without personally examining it I don't know for certain and I take no responsibility if things do not go as planned if you troubleshoot on your own. so do your own research on the steps I suggested before doing them.
---
You all knew Bethesda lies. You still bought a paid subscription to a failed game meant to milk money from a once great franchise. 
---
No sympathy here!
---
Ah, thanks!
---
They're mods for the bow, so weapon workbench.
---
This confused the hell out of me as well. Other than Ultracite arrows, you don't craft the individual types as separate munitions - you're altering what kind of projectiles your bow fires. I. E. Two bows with two different Ammo types draw on the same pool of arrows.
---
Ok explain the mechanism of taking a workshop? Fundamental gameplay function.......
---
And thats NOT PvP right?????
---
Much appreciated!

The company has consistently fucked over it's customers continues to fuck over it customers.

*This deal is getting worse all the time!”
---
Remember if you haven't played for so long you could have some valuable legacy weapons, especially certain explosive weapons
---
I get what you're saying, but at least with weight reduction effects on your armour, perks, etc. they are permanent and predictable.  However, the use of foods, chems, and alcohol to boost your strength is temporary.  In addition, for unyielding to take full effect you need to be bloodied (25% health).
---
So, you are better off investing in weight reduction, at least when first starting out, because it will be more effective and useful.
---
Now, I get that the theme of your post is about max strength (and how it translates to carry weight) and not about how practical it is for daily use.  It is cool that you can get your strength that high.  
---
One question, if you have a melee weapon equipped with +1 strength, does that add to your carry weight?  or is it just used for the weapon damage calculation?
---
Shielded enclave underarmor gives +3 str
---
The features currently omitted were clearly stated as future plans rather than suggesting they were promised upon release of Fallout 1st.
---
There is a clear distinction.
---
What is weird is it's not like FO76 had an history of bait n switch nor had repeatedly been late on its promises nor if the studio was clearly outstaffed and grossly incompetent when it comes to game feature that don't involve the atomic shop.
---
I truly wonder what could have make them promise you marvels and wonders for that modic sum. *insert mr krab meme here*
---
damn, didnt think that was such a serious problem. i'll try it thanks
---
&gt; will continue to evolve with new features
---
But hey, people keep buying it, so GG Bethesda.
---
Shoot it, sell it or give it away. Can't do much else with it.
---
they can do no wrong I love this game plasma caster is so fun!
---
NUTSACK! 😂
---
Omg that is perfect
---
I made a house in the middle of the river near the Nuka Cola factory. There's a dock that leads you to the entrance and the dock also has a path that leads to the workstation area. I also used the canoe floating in the water by setting up my dock next to it which makes it look like it's my boat
---
awesome. thanks :)
---
Crappy armor system and placing them as a roadblock to Vegas overinflated Deathclaws in that game, only in Tactics they were anywhere close to that level of imbalanced.
---
Here is a unicycle, you will ride wherever you go
---
I think it is not really meant to be a reward per say, just a place holder for an *hours played* timer. They wanted to put one somewhere so they did this.
---
I'd imagine it was beyond their wildest dreams anyone would play this long, or the game was only meant to be a fill in game until the next project releases.
---
Or it's a middle finger *in joke* to the player base.
---
Max rep with raiders and you can use your gold to buy ammo machine from robot inside The Crator core. Makes 200 5.56 per hour. I too like commando, but it does use more ammo, so I'll stick with semi-auto instead. For now at least. By alternating between 2 rifles using different ammo types, I can keep both well feed. Ammo machine for handmade and I find enough .45 for the fixer. Just have to make .50 cal nowadays.
---
Why and how?
---
Isn't the entire game?
---
I'm with you there
---
Stop paying for things you aren't getting.  A very hard concept, I know, but by continuing to pay the -only- message you can send them reads, "I'm fine with this."
---
There's a glitch with Unyielding, there's a way to get it to count twice, doubling the effect.
---
Nope. You are stuck with invisible sights with chameleon effects.
---
 If they float their camp in the air they get extra points
---
Yeah I can kill a sentry bot super quick but the gustys and assaultrons turn my ass to grass as they rev up they're lawnmower
---
&gt;I take no responsibility if things do not go as planned
---
I have already sent a pack of attack dogs to your home to wee on your welcome mat, I hold you personally responsible for my shitty life 😡
---
Because when the Queen does not have a place to land she won't.
---
Giving so much money to these useless devs is worse...
---
Ah, I see! Yeah, thas annoying :(
---
Check device for over heating, placement i.e not sitting on carpet, aim room fan at device. Blow out with canned air once unplugged.
---
Holy shit guys stop paying for it lmao. 
---
They beat deliver on their original promises though. Like permanent 1st membership for those who have put up with all this shit. Personally I refused to pay for a game *I already paid full price for*.
---
It’s okay to take a break
---
It’s a belief that if the queen is aggrod to a person on the fence or on their tent will cause the queen to bug more and stay flying ... I cannot confirm or deny I hear it often enough though I just sit on the ground
---
My handmade makes me hard 😘
---
The SBQ will not land if the player she is agro'ing is floating, ie sitting on a fence or a tent. it's similar to how if you jump on an object a chasing ghoul or mole rat will run half a mile away. The AI gets confused. In fact, i believe dragons in Skyrim acted the same way. 
---
This is fairly common knowledge, players continue to do this, however.
---
I want new paintings so bad. I've been trying to make my CAMP somewhat of an homage to the Haunted Mansion at Disney, but there are so few good options.
---
Never did I hate a region as much as Cranberry Bog in a Bethesda game, it is easily their worst work. And the fact that it has the most endgamee challenges and quests baffles me every day. It has no positive sides while the invisible trenches drive me crazy without a jetpack as I refuse to use marsupial. The only bearable place in it is Watoga.
---
I got it twice during the Beckett Watoga Underground mission. Very annoying, had to play through that mission 3 times...
---
It would have to stop at a certain lvl. What lvl? Ive senn a lvl 3000+ player. Im lvl 330 on my main. What about the lvl 2 - 30 that stepped into your area you entered first, if your spawning in lvl 3000 scorched beast. Most would be obliterated.....
---
You should try play a berzerkers builds. Thats challaging.
---
It's not a fix by any means but merely a workaround I've come to do to counter this, I aim down my sight when I'm not invisible and place the tiniest piece of blutack over where the crosshairs are
---
Me traumatised by the fo4 deathclaw on survival mode
---
You know there is a problem when the SBQ which is endgame boss and wiped out the entire Appalachian population is not slightly scary. 
---
In my opinion all endgame boss should deal at least 3x the current damage which guarantee a one hit kill for low health and low resistance build and make stimpak meaningful but have half the health pool to compensate the difficulty.
---
At the current state of the game, SBQ fight is just boring and a group of floaters can put up a much more difficult fight than the queen.
---
I’m sorry but if you actually buy fallout first you are so delusional it’s literally £100 a year for having your own server on fallout 76
---
It's very easy to confirm, with a small group with everyone on the ground, she will land, often. When you ave a larger group, with people everywhere, she does not.
---
“Yeah, this game is a good time waster, but it’s nothing special. I’ve clocked in a few hours every now and then, and it’s honestly pretty mediocre.”
---
&gt;3000 hours played
---
I'm only level 270 can I have it please....
---
Even high level enemies never tend to be too difficult, but I'm not really playing Fallout for a challenge, so I don't mind. I find having the West be less dangerous gives it a more relaxed feel, which goes well with the scenery.
---
Lol no
---
Yeah, they are angry for giving more benefits for those using a subscription and then they are angry for them not receiving more benefits...  people always bash bethesda for whatever reason they find, they bashed them for donating 1 mil for Corona, they bash them for anything they do or say
---
It's such an awesome idea, and Watoga is cool, but it's just so much wasted space. They need to fill it with more.
---
😭

I did not know it. But I always stand on ground.
---
Lol, hmmm?
---
Not sure if you opened your eyes or are beth. Hmmmmm?
---
I stopped playing for almost half a year and Fasnacht was what brought me back in. You might just need a breakm
---
I have that pick on my loading screen ,love it
---
Deff not, I pay the monthly myself as I often get bored and cancel it for a few months and come back when a new patch hits. Like my fo 1st and been cancelled for about a lmonth now, once the season patch hits which is supposedly june 30th I'll resub and make a char and do the season stuff, then i'll prob quit till the next season starts.
---
**Vault 666** with a satanic theme, some weird Vault Tech devil worshiping experiment as a tribute to our real life world leaders and their devil cult baby eating secret societies.
---
**Doom** meets Fallout.
---
**Fear** meets Fallout.
---
Neither can PS4's or Xboxes and some PC's.
---
9 months in and nuking on a private server still results in every enemy already being dead.
---
I think it's even worse when everyone is standing on the cabin in Encryptid and not activating pylons.
---
Should of been 76 atoms 😅
---
Actually no you don’t need to get it every day. 
---
You CAN get that much each day. Nothing is going to change if you miss a day.
---
That’s what you don’t get. The gold and scrip aren’t going to run out.
---
"Turd ghouls" Hahahaha.
---
Yea I tried that and only craft the same one you can place in your camp. Kinda sucks only one but sure they are going to make more later on. Thanks
---
I think pocketed raider chest had more capacity than the other chests
---
Um i need to know your secret.
---
Oh get bent with you’re grammar crap. People make mistakes. Yeah I did it on purpose. I mean really if that’s the response it means you have nothing logical to reply because you know your wrong. Did it again.
---
And yet I've been in numerous fights with people on bunkers, tents and fences and the SBQ has landed multiple times. At other times in open field fight its been aerial staggers interrupting the landing animation that causes the problems. There is simply no single reason she stays airborne and its simplistic to blame as such.
---
A youtuber made a video like a week or 2 ago and every post since is just a copy and paste of his video. It's like they see it, think they're the only one who did, post it here like it's their own and rake in the karma of disgruntled fallout 1st owners.
---
Gotta bank off that trend
---
Nah, having the west side just be lower levels is very enjoyable for me. It costs too damn much too spool up my gauss minigun for anything other than an event. I enjoy the enemies being lower in those areas  cause I can whip out a piece of shit weapon to quickly dispatch them. I am vehemently against One Wastelands just like I was for One Tamriel....I am a firm believer in leveled zones in RPGs.
---
No one denies there are other bugs and glitches with her. But not floating is an easy way to avoid a known issue.
---
I'm constantly averaging 500-530 with a full set unyelding, bloodied build, deep pockets, 5 mutations.  
---
In PA i can carry around 370.
---
The only thing ruining the game is the people who complain about every single fuckin' thing, no matter how big or small. Bunch of sissies, man. Sit back, relax and enjoy.
---
Fallout 76 is the REAL. DEAL.
---
Trust me, I would know. 
---
#I AM the REAL. DEAL.
---
..It might even be rigged from the start..
---
Could you,  would you appreciate getting 76 atoms or 5000 atoms for putting nearly a year of your life in front of a screen killing super mutants? 
---
Shit, by then PS6 will be out.
---
Same with Camp Tales during the search/fetch phases. People on cabin roofs not helping, or hanging around the fire making delivering Kindling much slower.
---
I found it in the robotics location when you have to find a new body for polly in the wayward questline
---
That's nothing new
---
Oh, I'm not surprised. One, it's reddit. Two, that movie came out before most of them were born.
---
This! I have often noticed things on sale for me which is not for sale for my non-first friends.
---
Truth is, The deal was rigged from the start.
---
It really sucks how many weapons are practically unusable
---
Out in the Combat Zone. A few bets, a few drinks, a WHOLE lotta jokes.
---
Current most legit playtime is like 3500 hours or something around that. Guy literally doesn't do anything else.
---
Even if it is 100% meant just to be a time played placeholder, there's still no reason to have such a dick kick of a reward.
---
I mean they gave some mom a bunch of swag because she had 1100 hours in Fallout 4. In 76 they give you a literal quarter for nearly 7x as much playtime. It's not bull, it's just gross.
---
Some people never
---
Supposedly it will always be directly north of wherever the CAMP machine is placed. The distance is around 5 floor tiles
---
Food build
---
76hrs then 7600hrs - it's a bit silly really, especially as there no 760hr reward. I wonder if someone got the decimal point in the wrong place? 
---
Don't know why they didn't give maybe 10 atoms every 76hrs as a reward for continuous play. Hardly a game breaker as many people are managing 20-30 free atoms daily anyway (and 50 available for the hardcore/lucky players).
---
Ah well, I've given up trying to fathom everything FO76, it's a game so I just smile/groan and move on.
---
i am at 640 atm missing weapon strength and 2 pieces of +1 str, got agi versions. With bloodied weapon i can have all weight reduction perks in str and still oneshot squishies and kill wendigo colossus in 10 seconds
---
me 700lvl+ - Can you guys get off the roof, she won't land because of a bug if you stand on it
---
seven different &lt;50lvl players - oH MY goD yoU hiGh LEvELS Are RUINIng The GaMe!!!!!!!!!! sTop tElLing Us HOw tO pLaY!!!!!
---
I'm completely tired of the new players
---
DR/ER have less and less value after 350, so the wothiness of SS armor is quite discutable (and frankly not worth of a so called end game armor). Chances are that, at the level you get the SS armor you already have enough DR/ER on your atcual armor set and it won't make any difference.
---
Worse, in order to obtain SS armor pieces with good legendary effects, you have to rely on an extremely tedious time gated RNG grind. Chances are you will never get the pieces you want with the exact legendary effects you wish in any reasonable time. All in all, you're better off with a good matched 2\* set you have bought or traded for than hoping to achieve the same set with RNG crafting of the SS armor. Don't waste your time with it.
---
Anyone who paid for a year up front deserves it, hope this is your wake-up call.
---
cheers mate rebuilding the database seems to have worked
---
Exactly the same thing happened a few weeks ago
---
I play the game, you know, I just don't cry when my toys are broken... my 3years old child does that (but he is 3 years old ;) )
---
I'm certainly not happy as a Fallout 1st user...I was really getting it because of the private world perks. Other then stuff like Fachnaut, I don't join public servers. I like playing alone where I know I'll be the first one to a place and reap all the benefits, where nukes won't launch, where I can take a workshop without having to worry about some level 500+ coming along and one shotting me because he gets his rocks off like that.
---
I don't think I got my money's worth...and I think they all fucked us over.
---
There's also a framed desktop version in watoga underground on your way to the Claw. I've accidently scrapped it like 5 times.
---
It's based on the position of your Camp module and testing has confirmed this, several squares N-NE of its position is a good guide..Exact landing spot seem to vary though according to local terrain. Also I've noticed that just occasionally I will drop in a different spot, still in the general are but most definitely not exactly the same. Maybe there's a bit of leeway involved, or perhaps its avoiding the mobile Collectron, Ally or other variables.
---
True - Assaultrons are the only enemy in this game that make me stop &amp; think, "Is it worth it?"
---
Glad it worked.
---
Its not serious.
---
Simple quick version. The files were a mess the ps4 was struggling to make sense of them. Rebuilding the database tells the ps4 to refile everything in a  way that it makes the best sense of.
---
Reinstall does something similar but for just that game not the whole system.
---
I think they had to leave most of it "empty" and flat so scorched beast fights can work. They fatties need open space to land.
---
Also free fast travel if that was the case.
---
Ahhhhh, I do love Robot Chicken
---
Was somewhat surprised and disappointed that this wasn't included with fo 1st. Part of the reason I subbed for it, spent ages building a workshop and next time I login it's gone... As you say, it *was* advertised. 
---
Niw I've gotten used to the scrapbox and can't envision playing without it. The scrapbox shouldn't be a paid for feature, it should have been a patch, a feature of the core game.
---
Beth just grab you by the balls wherever they can. Fallout is becoming the game/world I hate to love.
---
I would have included that, but it seems that Fallout's servers are running with Windows NT 4.0
---
Still, the the difficulty made it fun.
---
Yeah your right bud.  I'm not trying to be a pain but it just doesn't make any sense.  10 atoms every 76 hours is a great idea.
---
Workshop mechanic is not good, it need major improvements. It's just a briefing ground.
---
Man my friend hyped up the Bog big time for me.  I played solo for about a month before getting to a level where I could enter the Bog, and I was so nervous and excited, and....
---
Fuck I hate the Bog.  I fucking hate it, and won't go unless I absolutely have to for a quest or nuke.  It's bland, and jesus I hate those trenches so much.  It's obnoxious to traverse, and there's so many clipping errors there it's insane.  I have gotten stuck and unable to move a least five or six times, maybe more.  Had to like, kill myself or log out/reload.  
---
*FUCK* I hate the Cranberry Bog.
---
Yeah I add that because it wouldn't be the first time I've given a opinion on cause of a problem and someone decided "hey I can fix this with my little to no knowledge" then they screw it up and try and blame me instead of the stupidity they pulled.
---
Like I said "hey use option 7 of safe mode" then 2 hours later I'm getting angry messages all his saved games and screenshots and videos are gone and it's "my fault" i didn't warn him.
---
My reply is intended as a way to point to a likely cause and a starting ground to carry out his own research and problem solving.
---
Okay, so do those *do* anything?  I've  yet to find a quest, or craftable item, or any reason at all for the mutated sundew groves, and yet there's what....four or five groves?  WHY?
---
oh my god! you will you bullion them tomorrow, stop crying.
---
Ammo cannot be 0’d out, it weighs the player down even if a tenth of the amount.
---
If you're talking about v9 I agree, however if you're talking about the tents then I call bullshit, lvl 350
---
So forget good or bad IS IT PVP, YES OR NO?
---
Its better than 20 😅 we are talking about Bethesda. We should appreciate that we get anything atall lol.
---
One of my favorite loading screens is a shot I took where I stumbled upon a Sheepsquatch and a Mirelurk queen having a knock-down, drag-out fight.  It was fun.  I watched until they were both low health, killed em both, and looted the bodies.
---
I doubt it.  The raid ran so poorly the first several weeks I consider it a personal failing that I wasted so much of my time banging my head against a wall to complete it then.  smfh.  Video games are supposed to be fun and it was like... 25% fun?
---
Yep.  That is definitely an unpopular opinion.
---
Just try to stop bethesda from throwing bug grenades on your new server.
---
If it was anything worthwhile, there şiterally would be people keeping their game open for months AFK. Bitcoin production contributes enough to global warming.
---
there should be like some random scorched strapped with explosives that has a chance to appear at a scorchbeast queen event and just ignore the players and continously go ham on the queen when she lands, at least until the explosives detonate
---
Yeah but there was also a community vibe. People were trading. Some people were dropping ammo and odds and ends. Peoppe started whipping out different outfits.
---
They still got for 200-400 pretty often but I have seen a lot of vendors with 2000-4000+ prices.
---
If your after serums try r/market76 those posts usually get replied to pretty fast
---
I had to instruct a low level group to get off the fence &amp; roof at SBQ last night. Amazingly they all did, she landed, we eventually killed her and some of them thanked me for letting them know. They sounded like younger Eastern European players - very polite.
---
Besides being places for random encounters and adding some visual variety to the Cranberry Bog nothing really. While I do like the idea, sundews mutating into something large and tree-like, in general there was a missed opportunity for some mutated carnivorous plant enemies in this region.
---
I ended up picking Aqua Girl and staying still till last 2 players instead of dealing with that non-sense.
---
"Then we have an opportunity with something like Far Harbor. Like: okay, how many different ways can it end—let's give them some more choice. So it's not just a one-off, meaning Fallout 4 comes out and then we forget about it—it's an ongoing thing. The feedback we get is really, really helpful."
---
Todd Howard, Bethesda director - PC Gamer
---
On PC, the most common price for serums is 600-700 caps. Not that horrid price, but it still more then it was once.
---
Found many SBQ events with three or more tents floating, each with a high level 500+ player on top, a team farming? Why not on FO1st?
---
I've just dropped another nuke around Sparse Sunset Grove and can confirm the same thing is happening again for me. The best workaround seems to be quitting at a survival tent or landmark in the blast zone and then rejoining the server (private). Fast travelling back and forth still seems to work at times too, but not qute as well.
---
How to make them scary for real 
---
Make them 1.5 times bigger 
---
Make them 40% resistant to legendary weapons 
---
Improve there damage output by 40%
---
Give them 50% amor penetration 
---
Give them a speed buf by 35%
---
Give them a a +30 spawning with a legendary status 
---
Reduce there footsteps sounds with 40% 
---
Givether roars a 70% shellshock  to players
---
Please read our wiki page on this subject

---
It's also in the stair well of the blood eagles camp next to Berkeley springs
---
So you're comparing the thousands of people that play fallout 76 to the millions of people who play video games?
---
Bing bing bing hit the jackpot.
---
I came here to recommend a inu piece of masking tape or painters tape. Use the melee cross hair for reference I believe.
---
The only thing i want is a dedicated server software, i can run and modify by myself.   
---
Instead of getting ripped off by an overpriced subscription service.   
---
But since this is bethesda, this would never happen.
---
&gt;they gave some mom a bunch of swag
---
Virtue signaling, advertising, nothing to do with the game timer.
---
On PS4 you can find serums around 400-1000 caps. 400-500 seem to be the average I see. I’ve picked some up for 250 before though. Good luck and keep hunting. I wouldn’t shell out 10000 for one.
---
Bad idea to reward keeping a game open even when not playing it on principle, popularity of the game has nothing to do with it.
---
One simply cannot hide away the power of such a group of Chads on a private server
---
Yep, I'm finding the younger players to be relatively chilled in this game. It's a shame that some grown adults behave in such a prickish way.
---
Your mum so fat, she [this post].
---
I meant I agree with you, I was making a sarcastic smile in agreement while typing, but you missed it.
---
My bad, you are right. Totally forgot the dailies were available right from the get go and the rep bar as well.  I just sort of ignored them until I finished because the rep boost is nice but they didn't give treasury notes until after the raid.
---
Link for submit a ticket since you had trouble finding jt.

https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10
---
Sir/ma’am I humbly present my upvote.
---
They should have added negative 76 to help pay for the party decorations and the cake.
---
Lol sry man ✈ this isn't even that frustrating to me I just wanted to hear the thoughts of other wastelanders.
---
I dunno, the ones in quarry junction clapped my cheeks
---
same here
---
So... My friend is a shotgunner and we finally figured out what's happening. If you cripple all the limbs of a robot they will always explode as a last resort. No matter how much health they have. Usually though, they have zero health so it seems like they're just randomly exploding...
---
Why would they do anything if they already have your money. They are not an indie developers so stop supporting this shit and vote with your wallet.
---
34878 is just a general code stating the game crashed, if I remember correctly. You've done about all you can aside from a factory reset. I do think the game runs better on a better internet connection, can you wire your system to the modem? 
---
Other myths related to ps4 crashing this game include cluttered friends list and notifications.
---
Also the servers and all of Beth net, including other games, has been unstable for two whole days now.
---
Me to, interesting question tbh.
---
&gt;DeathClaws are meant to be the titans of creature enemies
---
Isn't that supposed to be the Behemoths? They drop deathclaw parts implying they hunt them... easily.
---
Pretty silly view of it. 
---
When you leave the cinema are you the first to leave or do others leave first? bandwagon!
---
When you go shopping, do you walk into the store or queue 2m apart? Bandwagon!
---
When the UK joined the war effort after France got steamrolled... Yup, that's the bandwagon!
---
Or perhaps it's possible that people did care and when it was brought up as you say a month or so ago, it gave those people a platform to raise the issue? Just a thought.
---
embrace the rads.  love the mutations.  just soak them up until you have them all.
---
Eh I see high (300+) and low level players standing on tents, fences, and roofs. It’s the same kind of people that roof camp in PA at Encryptid and always turn up late to stuff like PP.
---
You can't hire a serial bed shitter to make your bed and then complain when he shits in it.
---
I always undress, drop my junk and prostrate myself on the ground in front of such manly manliness.
---
Take a break from the meta. Become a lemonade vendor &amp; don't default to meta at the first sign of trouble. I have a character I pull out now and then who just sells clothes for 1 credit. It's a very zen like existence where I travel around collecting clothes and food.
---
Stand on the tents for adds. Get on the ground when they're dead. Its not that fucking hard
---
It just doesn't feel fair to me.
---
I have explosive gatling plasma,laser and had a pvp tesla so i'm not just talking from the taker prospective. 
---
The only way to have a balanced pvp is to temporarily nerf damage and abilities and item usage. Basically turning contenders into fresh vault dwellers. Even then you'd still have the problem of facing teams(which will apparently "fixed" in patch 20).
---
When i bought the game in 2018 i though players would have been your worst nightmare,being on the lookout everytime and watching your back. Turns out my worst nightmare is levelling up everyday to try and get 10 atoms and a future 1 point for the legendary system.
---
I have remade a few characters mutations recently and not all use Class Freak so I use already known mutation sera to remove all negative effects for 1 hour.
---
I'm running low on the bulk sera I had collected and just noticed how the prices have elevated.
---
Games like this wouldn't exist without consoles.
---
Except those paints *don’t* work on all PA - most, though. Each paint has to be done for each item individually.
---
They would have to do paints for every weapon, which takes time and resources.
---
I think there should be a paint for every weapon and armour, just be aware that there is paints (make one for every item) and skins (changes the look to a single specific one which only works when things are basically the same).
---
Gener problem with a lot of games. Enemies have too much health and don't deal enough damage.
---
They probably need to be static, but even cardboard cutouts you can place behind a counter would be great (like they had at train stations to lead you to the Atomic Shop). Or something like Polly, an assaultron head where the skins would be different static mounts, a dressable mannequin with an assauntron head would be pretty dope.
---
Make 76 great again?
---
If I'm reading your comment right, you want Fallout 4 co op mode?
---
Honest question....Does standing on the bunker roof also mess it up the SBQ landing?
---
I think that's what everybody wanted originally
---
or adapt your sights/weapons to fit around the effect.  black powder weapons, for example, are visually distinct enough even when invisible that if you're rocking crack shot as well, you'll do fairly decent once you get used to it while ads.  you won't be able to really fine tune your aim, so i'd say shoot for the body vs head, but as long as you're not trying to hit a wendigo from half a mile away, it won't take much to get a good eye and feel for it.
---
i'd imagine other guns and other iron sights work the same way, for stealthy stuff i'd say just avoid anything that isn't an iron sight.  haven't used a scoped weapon, but i can't imagine they'd work any better than reflex sights.
---
You logging in every day doesn’t benefit their business and harm you as a consumer. It doesn’t force you to spend more money to gain something. Only time playing a game, which costs them money to run. It’s not anti consumer. Is Diablo anti consumer because you have to grind for gear?  Is DOTA anti consumer because you have to play a lot to climb ladders?
---
These arent anti consumer behaviors or practices. These  are basically core mechanics of most online games. You not liking the grind doesn’t automatically make it anti consumer.
---
The ultra majority of players is not on reddit,so nothing will change in any way,ever. 
---
Just wait till the colossus event. It's will be smoother from what i saw.
---
Amen. The pre planning of this game like this low cap limit (and script etc) and how vendors were implemented and all the issues with them, as well as the economy and how Bethesda lost control of it almost instantaneously is all ridiculously bad.
---
That's such a fantastic storyline!!
---
how many caps? i got one
---
You can download them anytime after you complete the enclave stuff
---
real advertisement is on www.falloutfirst.com tho, u been scammed
---
Finish reading the paragraph. Now read the link I added to my first reply
---
Serves you right for supporting that service!
---
That doesn't happen anymore in my experience. I may well be wrong.
---
from what i have seen, i would say no. would be nice if a full set of Chameleon armor allowed you to move while sneaking and remain cloaked though
---
I don't know if there's a particular reason, but I always seem to be the person aggroing her, and I make sure to stay on the ground, and away from the pack a bit. She doesn't seem to have a problem landing most of the time.
---
As for Encryptid, I take all the pylons, down a Quantum, mash stims, and take shots at the Sheep when I can. Everybody else is attacking it anyways, so if I have to take the hit, that's fine with me. If I get downed, I let the respawn timer run out so people can do as much damage as possible.
---
People are going to be stupid. Do what *you* can to mitigate the problem.
---
people be paying for mutations when u can get them for free ahahaha
---
Whatever,  it's perfectly fine if you understand what you are buying. The tent, the private server,  the stash are all great. The atoms are just a bonus IMO. 
---
I wouldn't pay for a year, but a month here or there isn't a big deal.
---
It’s the only thing we can do
---
You’ve made your last delivery kid. Sorry you got twisted up in this scene, from where you’re kneeling it must seem like an 18-carat run of bad luck. Truth is...This game was rigged from the start
---
More pieces make you more see through. The chamelean effect gets better the more pieces you have, however I don't believe it helps at all PvE.
---
We gotta remember that this engine is being forced to do A LOT of things it was NEVER meant to do, and most "features" are just jerryrigged onto it.
---
The most notable example is how the moving trains in Fallout are actually just NPCs wearing train hats
---
The Bog exists for you to fight the Queen that's basically it xD
---
And to get you trapped in random trenches Dx
---
You got what they advertised. You bought a year based on the promise of tomorrow, which isn't smart. If you don't like what you are currently getting why the hell wouldn't you wait until those things were added and then sub?
---
Deathclaws haven't been a threat in fallout 4 unless you were playing survival.
---
Yeah, how dare they do it on a public server and give others a chance to get loot! Fucking scum!
---
Not had players hit you for no apparent reason at vending machines or just out in the wastes? They are trying to proc reactive mutations to instigate PVP.
---
Lvls under 10 cant pvp . After that turn pacifist on . Don’t steal shit and dont start shit.
---
Yeah it's odd.  90 percent of the time I load in the same general area which is a spot the followers and scrap bot never even go to, and then that other 10 percent I will load in right next to my camp device.
---
I'm not saying I give a damn really, just wondering why an organized team who can down the queen in seconds play on public?
---
Is there an advantage to it... just wondering.
---
Yea not like i am firing at the sbq or anything and try to win the event
---
Why no carry weight? I have a full set of Shadowed deep pocketed heavy leather armor and I'm all but invisible, but have about 350 carry weight?
---
So punish those that excessively dupped stuff. I mean I get with the current buggy system if you accidentally dump once or twice. But if they have 2000 quantum somehow then suspend the account.
---
I've had my mutations proc, and it didn't initiate PvP.
---
Leecing nukes.
---
Downtime is fine, but daily anything in gaming just sucks. Missing a day isn't a big deal but with my work schedule I might not log in for 3-4 days and then have tons of free time the next 3-4 days. If games are going to have limits   I'd much rather they be weekly.
---
Next you'll be saying you've never met the drunken robo-brain called biv in morgantown
---
It is sad. Back in the day an online game was expected to contain a server version and now...
---
Aim, shoot, enemy dead.  Just like any other gun
---
Im more scared of a level 60 chared feral ghoul than any deathclaw
---
V true. It’s going to be very hard to keep up with daily grinds once work and uni start up again
---
I know it wouldnt happen but would be nice to see some rag doll mechanics when you hit something with it. Bit weird how something just got hit with a mini nuke or grenade round and just stood there like it's a summer breeze
---
But, The 7600 is only the first tier
---
/s (i hope)
---
Europe
---
You mean playing on Public? I don't understand.
---
Got you, maybe it was removed, I'll look into this, have always avoided those mutations.
---
Probably trying to run an exploit but failed.
---
I do both to be honest bait her into landing in the open area then run behind the fence when shes about to land so she just stands there and eats the lead, then it's back into the open again. I was thinking  of changing my nuke dropping bit so only the forest is not nuked, I know it's going to stop possible wendigo colossus spawning and probably more deaths but on the upbeat no roofs or buildings for low levels and bloody builds to hang around on menaing ahead hopefully lands more
---
i had no idea that was a bug. i only stood on the tents because of all the other enemies kept killing me
---
I hope someday we will see new mistresses, a new faction with new quests
---
You need to find the legendary bloodied strap on to compliment your outfit, especially the 3\* with swing speed and nocturnal effects.
---
Or the abilty to 'blueprint' whole workshops.
---
really? okay, i'll make this simple:
---
one shot everything - other players vent displeasure "people yell at me"
---
or do nothing - players post about "freeloaders", i.e. you 
---
therefore, you can help out in a manner that does not insta kill everything, for example repairing (which is to say, the third option you conveniently ignore), or just stop the pretense of caring if other players carry you and that you're fine with freeloading, playing as you prefer - just own it. 
---
at the very least, please drop the willful ignorance in your argument - you're only pulling the wool over your own eyes.
---
got all that? okay, time for down voting and ad hominem rebuttals ;-)
---
Why waste your own nuke cards and your time running the silos when you can just join one in a public server,  this is why they do it
---
Daily caps is just a wayt to try to hide that there is no real end game in this game , just like  the RNG minigame we go through to get our gear is to try to hide there is no actual progression. It sucks, but they never gonna change this , specially since their monetization model depends on those things.
---
I'm mean why does a couple of letter lights cost so much budget 🤔🤔
---
I took the opportunity to finally play a few missions in red dead 2
---
We're out of cake!
---
So my choice is *or death*?
---
This is a genuine question, I'm not at all trying to be a jerk... But what would you suggest for end game content?  I hear "lack of end game content" a lot on this sub.  To me, launching the nuke and killing the queen is decent end game content.  Is it because some people have become so OP that it's way too easy for them?
---
I would wait a day to see if it's some sort of server login issue. If that doesn't work you might need to uninstall and then reinstall the game.
---
High radiation fluids are such a pain in the ass to get, I just go deep in the nuke zones and kill everything and  I usually get a few. I would also like to know a more efficient way of getting all 3 crafting components
---
I was also hoping they’d keep the exclusive cosmetics unique.  On par with the Riot Armors.  The Atomic Camo we got this month is just so bad and there is more to be expected.  Even the tent skins were cooler.  The fact that I have to wait an entire month for something hopefully other than the Atomic Camo is what pisses me off.  An ugly skin quickly thrown together should not be the new Fallout 1st trend.
---
I dont know friend, people who stand on tents and fences dont bring down servers or player vending. I don't think it's a fair comparison. 
---
The Queen landing shouldn't be affected by people choosing to stand on an elevated platform instead of the ground. Hell I have myself have stood on the roof of my tent to avoid Mirelurk offspring because I become disease ridden endlessly. I dont believe in my own experience standing on a tent prevents her landing because I've fought her with friends on a private server and literally seen her land whilst doing so. 
---
V9 I think is a different story.
---
Heh last f2p weekend my wifes cousin and I started playing 76 and the first server we joined 3 fresh players joined up just to spam attacked new players for there starter junk.  So to avoid the griefing i picked up fallout 1st and stayed in private till i was able to afford materials and shop at bot vendors. Pacifist mode doesn't help vs toxic griefing nor does constant server hopping. So joy to a rough 15 bucks a month to avoid toxic jerks.  I am over level 50 now and i have had folks as early as lv5 and easily folks over lv50 toxicly grief for no other reason then they could... At least the nice players make it so worth playing in public worlds.    I wish you better luck OP in warding off those toxic players.
---
Not that I have seen. Again its a pathing issue. Flying was ducktaped onto the engine with skyrim dragons. There is evidence that scorchbeasts are basically copy pasted dragons. Evidence includes identical glitches both suffer from. Scripts were just apparently copy-pasted. The AI still needs to track the player on the ground regardless of type. As soon as they cant, it goes haywire. Since ground npc's can still walk to you while on the bunker i don't think it would preclude a landing. 
---
This is not a solution to every bug with the queen, just a way to avoid a known one.
---
Assaultorn dominaters scare the crap outta me and I’m nearly 200 ( sorry for any mis-spellings
---
New boss idea
---
Name: Reapers Claw
---
Its 1.5x the size of a normal deathclaw, heals radiation damage (like ghouls), double resistances, and is 2x as fast as a standard deathclaw.
---
Found in hevily iradiated areas within a nuke zone(nuke an already iradiated area or launch two nukes apon each other).
---
It is hostile to every creature, even other bosses(targets players first).
---
Chance to give the "Reaper's Curse", an effect that causes deathclaws to do 10% more damage, lasts for one in game day.
---
Has blood red eyes and a black scaley hide, glows a dim red in darkness. Its claws are shaped like scythes.
---
Prohibits fast travel while in combat with it and it also will chase you until you leave the nuke zone.
---
Open to suggestions
---
A big complaint about 4 was voiced protagonist which we don’t have in 76. I’ve played with a lot of people who like 76 better for that reason alone.
---
Yeah, I do like the private server for farming mats. Nice to go there and have all the junk to myself, not having all the good stuff already picked over clean. But yeah, FO1st overall disappointing.
---
That was my favorite storyline out of the whole game so far. That last part where their holding each other is brutal😢 also I find the dead mistresses all over the map and it hurts my soul
---
 es, with five pieces when the enemies have detected you, if you duck you become undetected again, which does not happen with one piece. i have a friend who uses a set of five pieces in his stealh command bulds
---
I just unsubscribed it after these perks are not available
---
They really just need to add a first logo to the item on sale tbh
---
Wait aren’t I friends with you
---
Got you now, makes sense.
---
You’ll find them eventually, I sprung and bought the ones from Whitespring bunker for 4 or 5k and today I found multiple vendors with serums under 500, their out there
---
Yeah I really don’t understand lol. They have more than enough revenue to fix the problems but never bother until the problems are huge.
---
I only found out about this at lvl 105
---
I have to tell you, that is awesome! At first IDK it was the tire walls, lol. Your description didn't click. But, excellent job! 🤘
---
I guess you could always stop picking up ammo that you don’t use.
---
I'm level 50 something and took out both deathclaw in the bunker buster cave within seconds with a plasma caster
---
Creative!
---
I know right! Glowing mass and hardened mass isnt too bad but the game is pretty stingy
---
Wouldn't be the case if they had a survival server and adventure had very little if any pvp. This game was a pvp survival game when released and has evolved into fallout 4 and a half. Which is great bit it has left a large player Base with a somewhat different game
---
While I agree with the title, you're lack of formatting makes the text unreadable for me. On mobile
---
What kind of ammo? What level and console? I'm a heavy gunner, so I'm equipped to make heaps of ammo on PS4. I need a forklift for all the UC .50 Cal and UC 2mm EC I carry around
---
There isn't really an efficient way of getting any of the ingredients. Best way to get them, including the High Radiation Fluids is to just nuke an area known to have tons of enemies, like Whitesprings. 
---
Which ingredient you get is just down to RNG unfortunately.
---
I dont know what the deal is lately.  Every single SBQ I've been to in the last week has just been people non stop unloading on her while she is in the air staggering her over and over with her hardly ever landing.
---
I would say it's new players who don't know better but it's almost always level 150+ players doing it with gattling lasers and plasmas.  I just sit there and watch them burn through 20 cores wondering what they are thinking lol.
---
Been there many, many times.  Solutions are to sell off goods or scrap them.  Bad part is that if you get injured, thirsty, or hungry, you can't take any meds, food, or water.
---
I would also like this and the option to enable motion blur as I cannot seem to find this. Unfortunately, without motion blur it can give me headaches fairly quickly. I know, I know...
---
Odd bless you.
---
I think this is the only storyline I've finished. It's a shame they don't roll out new missions for the Order of Mysteries since they obviously put time into developing it. It's a nice detour from Raider/Settler/BoS stuff.
---
Welcome back to life. depression SUCKS. i wish you all the strength you need.
---
What's a good pricing for treasure maps? I just priced mine for 9c each. A dude came buy and bought every single one. I guess 9c was pretty cheap... What would you demand for a map?
---
That's a nice story 👍
---
They were not “advertised”. They did not say they were coming 9 months ago. These posts are exhausting.
---
Yeah, we definitely need a female with personality of Beckett
---
Reward farmers.
---
Deserved. Don't buy Bethesda's shit.
---
&gt;giving money to bethesda
---
now you know not to make that mistake ever again
---
Jump into any nuke zone you can find....unfortunately that’s the best way. Kill stuff and hope for a good drop.
---
I do not have a link handy (on mobile), but there was a denial of service attack that actual affected several companies.   Not just Bethesda.
---
That’s a little weird dude, I advise you to put in a ticket and speak to them through that way. You’ll get intouch with them directly that way.
---
I’m more scared of a lvl 50 mr gutsy things are a pain in the ass, can put a deathclaw down with 1 shot from my bloodied Gauss Shotgun
---
Agree on that to, for me an age thing and less than perfect eye sight.
---
I can do them fairly quickly on my rifleman build, things like pick/hacking past the reactor for example. I'd be interested in any tips you have to make it faster.
---
yep I agree. Now they just die to little ants
---
If you want I can explain a really good throwable build! I've been using a bow/ sheepsquatch shard build
---
Isn’t the shielded enclave under armor give +3 strength?
---
Thanks, encouraging, I will just keep searching, I am of course going to try crafting some but I'm not a nuke launcher or SBQ farmer.
---
Marigold pavilion is the best, just server hop and you can bump your rep a bit for raiders and settlers
---
If they are so important to the game experience they should be in the game by default. 
---
You are paying the price of a full indie game every month to play the same game but more comfortably? I mean it's your money... but still...
---
My friend told me that if your subscription expires you’re still able to use the tent is this TRUE?
---
While that does sound like a fantastic idea. The only issue is that when they clock onto where you are, they will all start shooting you at once. Your HP will drop so incredibly fast lol
---
Thanks for the info. Felt kinda guilty for being on the bunker roof:)
---
I think it would be more viable if melee perks counted towards it, maybe not the damage ones.
---
Read the news.
---

---
Its also happening in America.
---
Turd ghouls!!! I've been trying to think of a word to describe them other than them ugly fat bastards but this is so much more PG. Thanks man.
---
I think that would be part of the fun of it, it would be a rare or somewhat rare encounter, but it would be an actual challenge. very rarely do you run into a player that can't hold their own in a virtually any fight. Having something extreme like that would it be a really fun and humbling experience for a lot of people I think. and that's coming from a guy that uses a Bloodied build lol!
---
Impressive my friend!
---
Plans aren’t account wide because some people enjoy recollecting things on a new character and atom store purchases cost money. So imagine them saying they wouldn’t allow us to use our cash bought purchases on all our characters ? Would be flames coming from the building lol. 
---
On the build side, there’s only one way to switch builds and that’s leveling up gaining more exp. I’m level 170 ish and it didn’t take me long to get from 100-150. I think they’re working on a way to fully respec your character and get all points back, which allows you to then re-establish a whole build from scratch on any character but sadly that’s not the case at the moment. 
---
What platform are you on?
---
Do feed the people for canned meat stew, get a couple scorchbeast brains and cook them, get well rested, eat the listed food and farm west tek server hopping. Each run should get you atleast half an exp bar and with almost any instigating weapon shouldn't be hard to one shot muties and it takes about 15-20 minutes. I do this with my Bloodied build and with a full set of uny armor (not hard to find check player vendors even wood works) I lvl up every run lvl. 198 ish. It's really not hard to lvl up I came back to the game at lvl. 70 with almost no legendaries and a very messy build hit 130 with a full build in a week. Seriously there are methods to quickly lvl if you look them up and I'm sure if you post and ask for help many players would be willing to boost or deck you out in better gear
---
I always load in facing my perimeter wall or on the other side of it.
---
My favourite quest, I really hope the mistresses get a resurgence
---
Haha, then no prep needed!
---
I thought the same at first and erased most of Holotapes and Notes before taking videos. System slowdown happens only when opening stash, bending machine and crafting.  Public event notices make it worse when it pops.
---
Well there are perk cards that allow you to see exactly where your throwable is going to hit, as well as allow you to throw them further. Matching that with multiple throwable objects such as the sheepsquatch shard that does poison damage, or grenades that have an explosive area of effect, or even Molotov cocktails which can burn enemies overtime while also having splash damage you can get a very long range build that can be used with multiple different attack strategies.
---
All I can say is giving Bethesda money up front for work they haven't done is like loaning money to a crackhead who promises anything, anything, just gimme that $20
---
It would be fun, don't get me wrong. But you'd be dying repeatidly until you finally wittle the numbers down lol. Unless other players join you. They could probably manage it as an event that activates when a certain number of people are in the area. At least that way the attention of the giant mob is split and not focused on 1 person
---
Hate Gutsy's they are literally my mortal enemy... They do more damage than anything to me 🤔
---
I am on pc. I guess I wait a bit then until they give a proper respec system. I just couldn't immagine anyone out there actually WANTED to collect all plans again. I know why atom shop need to be account wide, but the argument people are using for why plans are character based, is because they come fresh out of the vault and it's logical reason they don't know any plans. That's why I am saying that argument isn't valid as long as the atom shop exist.
---
Going to third person if you're not using a scoped weapon will put the crosshairs on your screen so you want me to put tape all over your monitor.
---
ty for answer!
---
Bloodied strap on? Huh...
---
I think assuming that they're spread out over enough of the surface area you would be able to take out enough of them that you wouldn't get instantly killed unless you ran straight to the middle of the crowd. It would be a situation where you actually have to use real combat skills like using the terrain for cover and using chems and stimpacks in fights which most people haven't had to do with their max level God roll armor and weapons. Not to mention the satisfaction of killing five or six enemies with a single grenade which, let's be honest, no one really uses unless they're getting it out of their inventory.
---
Seen it in the billions on one account. 
---
But regardless, they haven't done anything to them so far. I would be all in favor of them getting a perma-ban if it was an insanely high amount. Just can't see Bethesda being able to have a change that big in the economy without those specific players abusing it even further. Having still seen players with 50,000-2,000,000,000 aid/drinks/misc whatever, it's going to keep being a thing.
---
That’s just sad.
---
The melee stealth perk would be cool if it counted for throwing. You could even repurpose bashing or offer a new legendary to do with throwing weapons.
---
I like the idea of a perk or something to make grenades explode on contact like molotovs, grenades are pretty bad with a timer.
---
Ah, clear. Thanks for the reply!
---
if you want something that didn't It's relatively quickly instead of throwing grenades I would recommend swapping them out for landmines. Throwing the max limit will cause the oldest landmine to detonate instantly, allowing you to basically create controlled and timed explosives. That and the dynamites and dynamite bundles from the raider questline are extremely quick to detonate
---
I have herbivore and munch melons all day long on Xbox and I've never contracted a disease from it.
---
Np hope it helps! Also check out the site nukes &amp; dragons to preplan your build it's awesome!
---
What happened to Gatorclaws?
---
It is the battlezone.  It is supposed to be barren and full of mean things.
---
Flamers do a good job of killing floaters.
---
Yeah, I'm down for taking all the pylons if nobody else wants to touch them but it would be nice if anyone would at least make an effort to keep her attention off of me so the pylons can stay active.  If not then I might as well just solo the damn thing.  There have been a good couple times I don't even get a tag on it, just trying to keep it vulnerable
---
Them and assaultrons
---
To be fair, unless you invest in explosive perks, grenades just don't do enough damage to warrent having in your inventory. 
---
Gotta admit, I didn't think of the surface area they'd cover. I was thinking of a car park with 50 mobs in with guns. But now I'm also wondering if the game engine could even handle that much going on in 1 location. I've had the game crash while just doing Scorched Earth in the past. While the game is a lot more stable now than what it was before, I'm not so sure it can handle a proper horde with 40+ mobs.
---
Alot of work just to have better explosions.
---
I like the dynamite but it needs to be tied to something other than throwing.
---
My vats + grenade launcher is much better.
---
I want grenades + something, like I'm suggesting melee weapon perks.
---
It’s that damn armor piercing. I swear they ignore 90% of my DR. If those existed pre war why even bother developing more power armor? Just drop a dozen Mr Gutsys into China and the war is over in a week.
---
shit like this makes me wonder why i still pay for f1 and still play this joke of a game &amp; company 😂 no matter what they do in the future will change my mind how much of a joke they are completely tarnished their brand &amp; name for years to come should’ve just stopped at fallout 4 when they had the chance
---
As long as I get close to an assaultron quickly. I don't worry to much... It's when you are at distance if find them more dangerous
---
On top of already paying for a 60 dollar game.
---
So I buy the game on Steam and then have the option to log into my bethesda account?
---
We'd stand on the ground if you melee kids did your job and took care of the trash mobs like you're supposed to... Just saying
---
&gt; As a Fallout 1st member, you’ll have access to exclusive discounts in the Atomic Shop, so not only are you getting bonus Atoms every month, you’ll get discounts on some sweet items to spend those Atoms on.
---
Since they give first members free skins at 100% discount, i believe that qualifies as the exclusive discount - only first members get that free.
---
Everything else was a planed action with no set time frame, thus not being in any violation, since it does say clearly what you do get
---
We need bigger deathclaws. If we had a giant variant that bad more health and speed this would add more variety and make it more scary
---
Possibly not 40-plus mobs, but definitely something on par with what you would get from one violent night or the scorched Queen fight. While performance might not be at 100% without a massive scorchbeast flying around I think they came could handle it as well as it handles most events. I think another good way to balance it would it be to only have one horde active per some measurement of time, say an hour. And of course grenades are just an example.
---
Unfortunately I just don't see them adding any legendary effects for throwable weapons as they just simply not that popular. you could try to talk to Bethesda about adding a new legendary perk card to increase throwable damage or possibly have a chance for throwable weapons to do critical Hits or something.
---
I've seen a post like this every month this year so far, they're usually just down voted into oblivion!
---
Probably thinking how nice it is to take down a queen without using a single stimpak
---
From the things you‘ll get from Fallout 1st, I think it would be worth about $7-$9. But definitely not $14.
---
Imagine doing the sbq event. If I wanted to waste 6k ammo to get a 1 star junkie’s pipe pistol and another useless ultracite plan, I’d try to do Encrypted with randoms and then head to the purveyor.
---
I’m in the UM. If you ever wanna get on 76 &amp; need some help, I’m higher-ish level. I’m not the best player by far but I’ve got an OK load out &amp; don’t mind being a bit of a body guard while you do missions. Though I’m sure there are some 300+ levels that would also be able to help :) Glad you came back!
---
I think the main reason they haven't given us the fast travel mats is that people will 100% use them to instakill you in their trap bases.
---
I agree with you about learning plans&amp;recepies makes system slow. It looks like bending machine is another cause that makes it worth. I removed all items from machine and it become much better but not solved.
---
Ah was about to say I can team up and help you level up but sadly I’m on console. 
---
I enjoy recollecting the plans on characters as does a lot of people I talk to or know that play the game. It’s a sense of collect them all while casually playing. Going to a vendor you haven’t been to selling stuff then finding that plan you’ve been searching for. 
---
I’m all for giving people the option but I know a decent sized group would want to keep it separate so giving the choice would be more of a fit option than completely locking it account wide.
---
There is a mod for Fallout 4, I forget the name. I think it was a weather mod. But it added the ability to have Feral Ghoul hordes during radstorms. That would be a great thing to add. Doesn't need to be 1 huge horde, but multiple waves per person in the storm until it passes
---
For locations with interiors, an option should pop up that gives you the option of "Exterior" and "Interior". Then you pick which you want to fast travel to.
---
I don't understand the lore behind them. All other creatures seem plausibly science based off mutations but then you have these aliens that somehow levitate and have magical powers.
---
I feel this and I really wish I wouldn't have paid for the whole year up front.. But 3 months in, can't refund.
---
So..Guess I'll just learn to accept being lied to, and then be told it wasn't lie, rinse and repeat.
---
That could be a really cool way to implement it! Rad storms are virtually unnoticeable if you've got radiation reduction perks or armor, but if it made ghouls come out of the woodwork that would definitely be a fun challenge. Look at already see people noticing the green clouds in the distance and fast traveling in that direction
---
the red one is the rare one
---
Yea, that's my point
---
There's a lot of S-tier equipment for Support builds being sold cheaply in vendors, too (I've found a vampire's explosive +reload speed pump action, ts +limb damage 90% weight lmgs, suppressor's swing speed +AGI shishkebabs, ect, all being sold for under 1k while 1* bloodied pipe pistols were listed at 7k+ in the same camp :-/). The market's pretty good for non-DPS focused characters
---
I find it mostly annoying to just see venders filled with dozens of the same mounted head plans. 
---
If I do find a vender with different plans usually buy then all up even if I don’t need them, and just let those mounted head plans rot.
---
Don’t forget about Rad Ant Lager (Biv recipe drink), +50 carry weight rather than just the +30 from Whiskey.
---
What day does the atomic shop update?
---
Or should we say, [Saturnite knives on cutting boards?](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Sierra_Madre_Casino_%26_Resort_terminal_entries#These_Knives.21)
---
...i think thats what we were all expecting really. im curious to what *you* think fo76 is suppose to be? tbh, this whole fo4 co-op thing isnt going too smoothly, not the way Bethy is doing it.
---
150k is the xp required to lvl up at about lvl 940. 
---
At lvl 106 it is just 16k.
---
At what point do you think, "maybe its an issue on my end?"
---
because thats what it most of the time is ...
---
This is why I quit 76 and uninstalled it when I heard about Fallout first. Nothing can redeem this game in my eyes. Bethesda seems to only care about making money and this game is not up to par with what I have come to expect or enjoy from them. I have not bothered with Wastelanders. Idc if I get hate. I have loved every ES and FO game until 76. It completely missed the mark. If you play it and enjoy it, good for you. Those of who don't are still entitled to their opinions too.
---
You got what you paid for. That's all. You are not entitled to promised future features, those are not part of the service. Nowhere does it say you are gettibg them if you pay. This is completely on you, period.
---
I like the bog, because it has some locations that make for good base building spots.  Like the highway with the tunnels under it.  I have my base up top and turned the tunnel under it into a subterranean farm.
---
the sbq normally lands when her wings are crippled. shes been bugged and immune to crippling since wastelanders but shes not immune to staggers that interrupt her landing animation. this is the real reason she is constantly flying around, not the fence squatters.
---
heres the report from LadyDevann thats 2 months old now... lol

Aside from the free items, there actually is some exclusive discounted stuff. Bethesda simply fails to communicate it correctly. The items are nothing special though, but they never claimed otherwise. I don't have the subscription, since I got burned pretty well when buying the game on release, but when people post the atom shop updates on reddit, I can often spot an item that is not offered to me (since obviously it is an exclusive deal).
---
One time I had reached the cap limit and didn't really need anything, so I went to some low levels camp and bought every last thing in all the machines and then dropped it all in a bag for him.
---
But that would make the game a bit better, and more convenient to play. Why would anyone want that? We should remove fast travel, and limit carry weight to 30 lbs. Also, no repairing armor and guns, they break and they're done. You must also use the bathroom and bathe. Eating food, also requires a good 5 minutes, and cooking food is real time....
---
/s ... unplayable doesn't even begin to describe zhat fresh hell
---
(Bethesda takes notes)
---
as someone who has been paying for it, waiting for some of the features to come, im greatly displeased with my less than pleasing content from it.
---
for ESO we get farm more for roughly the same price AND more housing space.
---
currently the 3 main perks of fallout first are monthly atoms, tent and scrap box.
---
the private servers are pretty lame atm and the cosmetics are all either just recolours or just awful and spaced appart
---
I can't upvote this enough.
---
I concur with this.
---
Supposedly they are FEV mutated flatworms, create internal  gas enough to put in pockets and 'float'.
---
Day of the Brahmin
---
Anything different would be great.
---
I've played almost every single day since release until 2 weeks ago because there is just absolutely nothing for me to do anymore. 
---
 I've been playing a non existent endgame for the last year.  I have a stash packed full of God rolled weapons and armor, every side quest /main quest finished,  got all my scout badges, got all 3 tnt keys, max rep with both factions, perfected my build, got all allies, have every peice of loot the queen drops, defeated the colossus,  I have almost every single plan in the game, ect...
---
I'm tapped out.  Canceled my 1st subscription since I've had since it was launched. Absolutely no desire to log in anymore. That's sad because I absolutely love this game.
---
Forest and Pink are quite rare, I think Forest more so than Pink. Greens and Browns the lowest. Not considering whites or dirty/weathered. Those are too plentiful.
---
Blue and yellow are also rare, I just forget if they are as rare as forest, or closer to pink rarity.
---
Red is by far the rarest.
---
Hey I’m on the fence for FO First. Scrap box sounds nice, as does tent. Persistent workshops on private worlds however - that would make me pull the trigger. Atomic shop discounts may as well - but really depends. Most atomic shop stuff is ridiculous and I prefer things like the free states packs.
---
Also I’m on the fence BECAUSE I keep seeing how FO First stuff isn’t being delivered.
---
The suit and helmet are separate pieces.
---
I didn't go there until I was probably close to level 50 because I thought it was full of ghouls.
---
Welcome back to the wasteland!
---
Another Welsh person here! 😁
---
This. If you are on PC and don't already have this mod oh, you should get it. It's fantastic. The only problem is there is a dependency that has to be updated each time the game gets a new update. Totally worth the trouble though.
---
it comes without a helmet anyway.. the helmet is an extra piece you need to craft. 
---
i use Enclave Scout Helm with my stealth suit.. so im sure your fabulous hair will be fine.
---
I was pretty much in the same boat as you, but I started my own chapter of the free states with a few friends and I've been slowly expanding it with players I meet in the wasteland. While there's no real in the game content it's always possible to make your own fun with what you have. Plus running through the wasteland in full free states kit with a bunch of your buddies is always fun.
---
It happens on multiple terminals for me. The only commonality is they don't require hacking.
---
That would require blueprints to not break entirely due to stupid little things, such as a light that it allowed you to place floating just slightly. Or at least the ability to place them and remove items that could not be placed and put into storage, rather than having to scrap and completely rebuild.
---
What I wanted? Well let me explain it by saying that I haven't played it since last year, even with the wastelanders. I'm finishing up AC: Odyssey, Rage 2 and Prey before I get back into 76, this time in steam.
---
*yes*
---
They are separate pieces not sure how it would effect the stealth if you don't wear the helmet the helmet also protects against air bore toxic particles
---
Idk about that. I hope not. Because you already earned your perks, and it's just a QOL feature that allow you to equip the cards you want in a clic instead of one by one.
---
The 2 hands damage perk cards,incisor and martial artist.
---
Deffinetly more event bosses like the SBQ, possibly a prestige like system, so we can become legendary. I personally think faction wars, allowing players to do events to level up thier factions. Allowing pvp to take objectives for your faction, maybe building up faction bases other people can attack. Factions wars seems like best case scenario for everyone, weather they like building pve or pvp, or building. At the very least, we need more event bosses, 1 or 2 event bosses a few op players can destory in seconds isnt great. It also takes the fun out of being op, if you can wipe a SBQ solo, you dont have much to worry about. Maybe raid on the schorched beasts nest, like underground. A war of ambition, constant queens and schorched beasts, as well as scorched enemies. New giant schorched mega deathclaw that rip through armour like it's a tin can, and require a strategy to kill. Idk just an idea
---
Same, I actually just farm some of the workshops, low on ammo? Go on a private server at the start of a day off, take over the munitions factory, take over the junkyard and x other workshop and just spend the day clearing out places inbetween defend quests.
---
I use mothman goggles with the chinese stealth suit,even in nuke zones.
---
Stop giving money to this people and let them sink
---
Im that one melee build taking care of the adds on my own while everyone else is sipping tea looking at the sky from the top of the tents... &lt;&lt;
---
I agree silos and queen are very good end game. (I also agree with the part about it being easy, the fact we have nukacrypt takes out a significant part of the challenge imo) 
---
What I don’t agree with is time gating end game content, such as obtaining gold bullion. (Also legendary script). It’s just fake endgame where you log in do dailies ( most of which are very unexciting) and log out as what else is there to do? 
---
Having the raid back would also really help imo, I never got to play it because I dropped the game and only came back for  wastelanders to give it another chance. 
---
The problem is a balance with fixing bugs and exploits which seem to happen often or actually getting content made. I don’t know what size the team is on the game but to me it seems small. 
---
There are certain parts of the game they could expand upon for raid like content too like the burrows which currently is useless? Also I don’t agree with what you have to do to spawn a wendigo colossus, it should have been a quest line like encryptid not just dropped in the game.
---
FT problem seems another problem to me. Can you change system language to English and try what happens?
---
This is season 1. BoS is in season 3.
---
And it's greedy people over pricing things in the trading groups that ruin the economy, not the dupers!
---
Just figured out recently you always load in facing the direction of when you first placed the camp. You always spawn north of the camp which you can be moved around, but the direction your facing on load in can only be changed by starting over.
---
Me too
---
Everything gets stored
---
The patch notes? Won't be up until it goes live. But checkout the last couple inside the vaults for info.
---
Yesterday, a lvl 30 guy came to my shop, bought all and every ammo (like 10k 5mm, and 5k others, total 20k caps), then dropped 50 from eatch type of beer, whisky, 25 nukeshine...
---
Well, the whisky got torned to grape mentats, the beer is always handy for a junkies, and the nukashine... well, my customers wont be thirsty if they use the bowl.
---
Agree with snapples it's NOT sitting on fences or tents  it's the inability to cripple that keeps her from landing.
---
I have lv 300+ players who refuse to get off!
---
It does yes!
---
every item gets moved into the stored section, either by blueprints, or single items. sometimes the blueprints do not work but you can break them apart to get back the single stored items.
---
Haven't you heard? Junkies is good now!
---
Yeah I feel ya, I got 6k atoms right now and gaining more and more everyday.  
---
I'm looking forward to ATX update every week to buy something that I find really cool but get disappointed every time. Last time I liked the stuff that was in there was when the Log Cabin Bundle was purchasable.  
---
But other than that though the Atomic shop updated makes Tuesdays really special to me :D
---
Glad I never partook in this scam. So many other services I could put my monthly payments towards.
---
I’m a junkies build, but a 1 star pipe pistol is worthless.
---
I have a 1 star bloodied pipe pistol that I turned into a rifle, it wreaks everything! Pipe pistols/rifles are great as it saves the condition/ammo of your better stuff!
---
Ah so what will this bring?
---
If it's a legacy there will be people who will want it just for collection sake even if its a crap one star. 
---
Of course everyone getting awarded the same legacy for completing an event would make it much less valuable.
---
I’d rather just use a fixer if I was a rifle build, but I’m a heavy PA build that was screwed over due to PA being left behind, but I’m glad you could get a use out of a 1 star bloodied pipe rifle.
---
Looks amazing man! Nice job🔥
---
Thanks, iv pretty much had the same location just changed my camp, fancy a change
---
Pretty sure it’s fo1st only and will come next month with update 20. No promises, though.
---
The first 3 I no still arnt in the game but you do get discounts they are just not labeled as such but theese fo1st "discounts" are items that go on sale that only fo1st members can see.  I have tested this with my wife cuz I have 1st she does not
---
and where are you getting this mythical *fuel* to power said flamer from?
---
I don't have a legendary Fixer yet, but I do have a BE Handmade, the Pipe is a day to day weapon as it is still overkill on 90% of the map! Save the handmade for real threats!
---
This is the first article to announce it. There are some changes though since this article but it will give you an understanding of what is coming.
---
Broadsider is just broken, it promises 1k damage, I get 2 damage...
---
Pretty sad how duper friendly this sub seems to be.
---
Cheers.
---
The Fatman is outclassed by PISTOLS!
---
Instantly? It took 3 months before Bloodied took over, those 3 months who cottened on early could get some real cheap BE deals!
---
Or from the perspective of someone who has 50+ keycards and drops bombs all day.  I have a team, we play on public to trade and we do silo runs non stop from server to server.  Sometimes the queen just doesn't want.  So I get height and freeze her while my team does the heavy work.
---
Sometimes as I drop my nuke, other random a are telling me to get off my tent that I have placed just so I can not be attacked while I do my freeze magic.
---
I have met alot of groups that operate like that.
---
Why does standing on a fence in one event ruin a game for you? Dupers ruin the economy and make it impossible for players like me to buy the endgame weapons I need.
---
seriously, wtf did they come from? i hadnt played in awhile and ran across a few. i mean i won, supressor perk with a suppressor big gun keeps things manageable but after the fight i had to remind myself i was playing *fallout*, wtf is magical elemental damage? ice? srsly? the staff just mining game assets and forcing them wherever? they cheapen the vibe...
---
Oof well I guess we haven't really gotten anything good with fallout 1st, but still it would be nice to be a new weapon.
---
Two shot strap on?
---
It used to be a player trading place before vending was out. Was also where people would leave unwanted stuff for others.
---
Good Times.
---
Yeah I was just amazed by how fast people were trying to give new characters duped gifts. Both times I had just left the vault.
---
No problem! Yeah it also never gave me the option to ask for help until I threw myself off the cliff. Glad we got it though. Thanks for the awesome gun, I was able to get my first assultron kill with it!
---
I here this complaint all the time and in my experience standing raised off the ground literally has no affect on her landing I have soloed SBQ from on top of my tent and only time I got off was when she landed... as long as people are contributing why do you care
---
I m a PS4 player, and yes I m agree with u. WTH is wrong wif the one that wearing X01 or even T65 stand on fences and tents? They didn’t know that SBQ won’t land by doing that?
---
Hah, imagine thinking paying for anything extra in FO76 would actually provide returns! They have proven to us that they're half assing the game.
---
but assaultrons are *supposed* to wreck you. they are the robotic deathclaws. hearing that fucking face laser charge up but not *seeing* that fucking face laser charging is supposed to fill you with dread. those AA Maj Gutsys are broken. two or three of them can chew a squad up (do AWOL Armaments if you want to push it to the limit).
---
Common: Brown, Green

---
Class action lawsuit them
---
..can you imagine, looking through your sights or scope and being unable to hold it even close to still because you have to really go pee!
---
Everything’s overpriced because dupers can have max caps whenever they want.
---
You rang?
---
Technically true but effectively ya with bandolier you can carry hundreds of thousands of rounds of let's say 5mm or . 50
---
Also for a while it was bugged and rounded down... That was a thing apparently.
---
Yet Dupers are usually the only ones selling for reasonable prices anymore!
---
Might help to list your system and available playing times.
---
Minninuke minigun ? This sounds fun haha
---
creature enemies. like mutated animals. behemoths are "titan class" supermutants. sentries/assaultrons are titan class robots. named npcs are titan class humans. glowing ones are titan class ghouls. giant roboscorpion is titan class scorpion. so on and so forth...
---
They charge the laser before shooting you? I get blasted as soon as they they see me.
---
Even if they just make them prowl the wastes in groups it would boost their damage/scary potential.
---
F#$k sake it worked for yau guai, that 4 combo special random spawn is f#$king terrifying
---
Dont lumb bloodied biulds into this I garantee my bloodied cammando kill 10x the adds and way more damage too queen than what let me guess for PA heazy biuld
---
Not fun at all
---
Yes that is a good idea thank you :)
---
I’m on xbox and I’m in the uk time and I’m on for another 2 hours from now
---
Of course it sounds fun.. unless someone uses it in pvp.
---
as with any new idea, you have to first ask, could these servers handle it..?
---
Strong back  perk,  pa with calibrated shocks
---
I remember when i first ever played fallout i started on 3 i saw a deathclaw for the first time and fast traveled away hoping it would disappear i use to be so afraid of them now i see one and i just walk up to it and kill it they aren't scary anymore so yeah i agree
---
As well as they can handle anything else.
---
It's forgotten because it's underwhelming and out dpsed by a pipe rifle!
---
dammit! you beat me to it! Bethesda, send me back to Big MT! the best fun in fallout canon!
---
Go to lake Eloise, then you will know fear. I clocked 9 of those floaty bas#$rds there once, high level too
---
Weasel!
---
If you have stable flux and have any mutations serums learned make 2-3 serums and sell them with hard bargain and it should easily max your caps and if you need, ive got a few extra mutations serum plans
---
100%- why is PvP even in this game? NW should be it, and overland should have a total lockout of PvP except for perhaps one dedicated arena. Though I'd prefer just a total lockout of it. Hence, outside of vending I won't even bother playing in public servers.
---
Its working fine for me on xbox
---
you unlock it when you beat waste landers main quest line, its another currency
---
The problem i have wirh this is most times I launch a nuke either nothing spawns or players kill everything before I get a good chance.
---
Deal with it
---
It charges up?? Every time I encounter them they spam that laser with no charge or cool down and sometimes that laser is just firing perminantly far or close
---
Nuke zones last a while, just fast travel away and back a few times to keep the mobs spawning....
---
ticks are unusually dangerous. same with the instaboring diseased molerats. if an enemy isnt threatening enough, Bethesda just makes it diseased and/or move faster than the character model can properly demonstrate (looking at you slippy slidey ghouls)
---
I’m down, but I have to warn you, I’m pretty hard to take down
---
Can you imagine looking through your scope and actually 'seeing' anything because your scope looks further than the game can render 😂
---
Sometimes, all we can do is smile at ourselves.  Sho many things to find, do, etc.  🙃
---
There are a couple ways but here’s probably the easiest: Build a wall, build a flamethrower trap, destroy the wall with the trap, then put the vending machine wherever inside the wall, then repair the wall.
---
And also, why does under level 200 matter? A level 55 can have the same perk cards as a level 700
---
Foundation is the place the BOS will make their new headquarter and the settlers are just a secret operation to build it up. you witnessed a shipment of frames for the future recruits...
---
K it's about focus tighting up you build, basicly you want to pick a dammage (in this case melee) , but is it unarmed 2 handed etc then are you going bloodied or junkies (the 2 biggest meta dammage setups) or just full health etc etc
---
You then you defense perks and then what qol perk you have to have in trade off.
---
I suggest go looking at angry turtle on yt he makes good build vids with breakdowns on Why he's picks everything and how it all works together.
---
I bought a gold camo for the revolver thinking I could use it on all guns. Not sure if I read it wrong or if it was intentionally misleading
---
it happened on middle game session tho, I was going to repair my stuff and notice that the adhesive had 0 on it, and some players prior to that had made some buys, we really need a list of sell items.
---
Yay, dw I’m just testing my weapons, my hopes are not up :) and is it ok if we don’t use any kind of invisibility thing like stealth boys :)
---
It will freeze your game on a white screen and cause you to crash
---
I just woke up, gona do that post there, thanks
---
Marsupial mutation ( i don't know if it's the right term, i'm french) and jet pack on your PA
---
well... in fo4 they did a proper charge. in fo76 its whatever honestly. if you can spot them before they see you, sometimes theyll just be walking around already charged up. and that laser can sustain beam for as long as its wants. getting fired on for a solid 45 secs is kinda whack.  fo76 saltytrons are defintely not balanced.
---
Sure, I don’t mind Either way
---
STOP. GIVING. THEM. MONEY.
---
Make sure the fissure site is nuked, the ordinary one, pick up ultracite vein, 5 to 6 scorched will spawn per pick, total 24-30 scorched u can farm
---
honestly even as a first player a option for all people to be able to just reload last workshop when they claim it would be awesome as I'd love to see what everyone would end up building
---
If one of those crispy ghouls even looks at me funny I'd instantly combust
---
Have you seen the videos. It crashes servers and damages players devices from overheating, at least forces people off the server.
---
No player should have such control over the game.
---
Don't die between the time you finish Scorched Earth and make it to a stashbox
---
I got the send your companions to the hotel to wait and you lose them forever bug.
---
Rosy coloured nostalgia glasses. They all forget the bloody mess it was at launch. I remember IGNs review was sub-titled "Can a game be great if it breaks every ten minutes"
---
The answer may come as a shock, but not dieing helps with keeping your Flux
---
that would be fantastic if i could nab one of those. what's your gt?
---
A bit strong langue wise, likely to upset the mods, but I agree with everything you said.
---
no, I don't have fo1, I just brought the game this month, and in the state he is isn't worth buying the fo1, so they are not gonna give me back they at least acknowledge the problem?
---
Cause bethesda was like hm this important material that you litterly have to do into a nuke to get here if you die you lose it so don’t die
---
That's exactly what i did but i formed a small Brotherhood of Steel Roleplay/Milsim-lite chapter.
---
It's better then doing the same things all the time plus it's actually extremely fun/exciting.
---
Ok my gt is Lorenz024 il be on in like 2 mins
---
wellcome, to the WHITESPRING :D it once used to be a major hub of player trading. i remember coming into the crafting area and finding dozens of paper bags with dropped loot. 
---
the whitespring mall should offer rentable slots for playervendors!
---
such a cycle grants pleasure but also pain in many
---
oh, thanks, I'm far from finish the main mission yet
---
I agree but I can see where problems could arise from the 1st 3 points on your list regarding camps and workshops. 
---
For camps if you switched to an adventure world you would probably lose the extra budget and build area if they could only allow that feature on private words due to the way the servers currently work , so now you have complaints about missing camp items missing or not being able to set a camp as it takes up a larger area on adventure worlds.  
---
And with persistent workshops, you would lose them as soon as you entered an adventure world so you would be stuck on private worlds forever or lose all your work 
---
So they would have to somehow only allow your character to enter an adventure world without all these features active so you wouldn't lose out  
---
Until they could sort out these problems i understand why they haven't released these extra features. 
---
I'm hoping the instanced interiors will help bring some of these about by helping manage camp budgets However i would still like what they talked about in the Fallout 1st info but am happy to wait as  £99 for the yearly sub isn't bad. when you consider that 1000 atoms cost £7.99 (7.99 x 12 = 95.88)  we are then getting a stash box and the current private worlds for £4.12 a year excluding the atoms.
---
wait, so flowers actually give a decent amount of caps?
---
I mean I'm not canceling my first over this but at same time I'd like to see more then a few costume pieces I never use and a few emotes I mostly use as a joke when bored waiting on team mates - but the cheaper atoms and private worlds would keep me coming back
---
and before the people come in saying OHH HOW CAN YOU - because I can - because just as I respect the view points posted by the creator of this post and I understand the annoyance and disappointment of it I purchased based off what I was getting today and only what was in today if I didn't like the offer I wouldn't have taken it - now I'm not saying everyone did that I'm just saying that is how I buy things - I saw cheaper atoms and that was the only reason I purchased the 100$ pack since I got around 250ish dollars in atoms - everything else is a bonus to me and yes I do look forward to them adding these features and hope these posts will speed them up
---
they're mutant flatworms and they've been around since fo1
---
I’ll be on in around 2-3 hours, it’s “Pinappi” what your gt?
---
It's a shame you had to turn to the Brotherhood, but at least you're having a good time with it!
---
playing on my alt i can relate. started him 1,5 years after release the game has this sense of wonder again...
---
That's the problem. If I'm on a private server nothing respawns. If I'm in a public server stuff only reapawns if a new player enters the area.
---
When in stealth ;) dont doubt the damage but I've got both type of characters and bloodied commando definitely doesnt kill 10x the adds as a heavy pa user, well that and when that angler gets you with acid you ain't killing nothing just spamming stimpack lol
---
it's supposed to but it doesn't 
---
at least it doesn't go through walls anymore
---
hm, that sounds too good to be true lmao
---
what do you need to craft one?
---
Does it work with anywhere theres ore?
---
Go on YouTube and type in “captainnoob” queen tested gauss shotgun” that should give you a good insight as to why your shotgun isn’t one shotting everything because if it can kill the queen solo then your build isn’t right for that weapon.
---
They've been around for like half an year now" Of course there's gonna be a strong language. Can't believe those devs decided to just sit there and pretend like nothing's ever happened hoping people would just forget
---
U on my world?
---
One of the more stupid gameplay decisions. 
---
You can go overweight with the rewards, walk back towards Watoga Station - and die near the red bridge barely a hundred yards short losing your hard earned stable flux...and only the flux! The V76 respawn is merely the icing on the cake.
---
use a scope. the sight changes when you aim and you dont have to guess where your weapon might pointing at.
---
what does this event have you do?
---
I feel it makes more sense to just sub for a month at a time when you need it.
---
Thats my way to go for encrypted too.
---
After I hit the imposter once I focus on gutsys and eyebombs with a Tesla and grab a few xp on top
---
"seeing and peeing"...that's my mantra for the day. 'nuff said.
---
As long as they’re shooting and doing adequate damage who cares?
---
i've been finding explosive shotguns like crazy, but for some reason no one wants to buy any ://
---
Better than dozens of Chinese Sword, always at 0 condition and almost worthless as scrap.
---
Here’s a trick I learned...just log off from you private world and log back in again, it will force respawns.
---
sounds like a Rose-hacked Raider Collectron...
---
just bones mountains of bones and i live in the middle of nowhere
---
North-East
---
Just finishing my 2 daily quests, I’ll join shortly
---
it is just a plain collectron
---
Ok 👍
---
so... steal from the poor, kill the residents, and sell to the rich. got it!
---
I have a secluded, mountainside steel bunker, only 3x2 beyond all enemy spawns. Me and my astronaut play holotape games whilst the world crumbles outside. ATHENA turns up talking shit about birds from time to time... But for real I love building small and high in the more untainted areas. Respect to tiny Camp livin'.
---
You go to Grafton dam, kill a few super mutants and look for mad dog Malone inside the dam. You just gotta take him down and you get the 120. The enemies in the area I believe are usually locked between lvls 10-25 or so
---
i had to look it up. you are mafk right! i mean, they look wildly different now but i surely did forget about them. thinking about how they were then and how they are now, makes sense. they were rarely push overs but also had a crew too. that means centaurs arent too far... i can practically hear their wet heavy slapping sounds of locomotion...
---
jeez, what a madman. i aspire to be like you
---
I at this point know where everything is and can do it blind because I am so used to having to do Camp Tales alone. ._.
---
I will try that next time I launch a nuke.
---
I wish they'd rotate the Fallout 1st exclusive items more, the camo sucks. It'd be nice to get the armor that I missed out on due to being a newer player
---
Bringing more of those items back alongside new ones like that shitty camo would be more incentive to get people to sub again, if my First was out I sure as hell wouldn't renew just for those paints. I'm never going to use them
---
True or hit you from a metric f#$k distance away
---
I have tested it with a friend and every piece added made the body outline more blurred. By piece 5 your outline was smooth and barely detectable; however, for it to work best us shadowed armor with muffled legs. Along with all the sneak cards, you should be able to get by pretty easy.
---
just whitnessed some \*\*\*\*\* at the lighthouse nuking toads with something mixed from a minigun, a broadsider and a cryolator if i have seen right. sreened and reported. period. from a technical POV it should be no big problem to erase items with certain properties from the related database, but i fear the game did not work that way and the deletion of such items is much more complicated.
---
If you paid for that your are a fucking idot and deserve to be scammed what the actual fuck did you think was going to happen why would ever buy a game that is then found to be broken to the point where it is almost unplayable and then gets updates that fuck things up more then adds scummy overpriced micro transactions when they promised not then after all that you pay a subscription for a year that is over a hundred dollars and act all shocked when they don't deviled like there was no track record them not delivering with almost every other aspect of the game even if they gave everything the promised you would still be paying over a hundred dollars for a subscription for a game you already bought this company is scummy but they wouldn't do it if it didn't work and you are a fucking idot for supporting them
---
Awesome.
---
My group areno tech-raiders or looking to cause trouble if that's what you referring, I'll admit there definitely are horribly toxic Brotherhood chapters that are borderline crazy/a bit odd. But my group (Fully Xbox) is all about helping likeminded people and to help rebuild civilization, we follow the ideology set fourth by Elder Roger Maxson. 
---
Although admittedly my group has gameplay limitation factors in place so my group can keep things immersive/as lore friendly as possible while at the same time creating our own story/path along the way. Even got our own Codex document written up (Goggle Documents)
---
Unlike some of the other Brotherhood splinter groups we actually compensate anyone who willingly gives us any advanced technology. (We don't scam/steal anything) We're i guess you can say kinda like the Responders minus the full on charity. But at least this way its fair/no hassle. It's a good way to get likeminded people involved, so far it's been working in our favor.
---
A long time ago, right after we got Fallout 1st, a friend kept crashing out of the Private World. Every time he rejoined, everything spawned again. It happened so quick we barely killed the first mob before we got hit with new spawns.
---
hm, so those robots really want those straight jackets huh. what do you think they're stocking up for?
---
you still in need?
---
hey yes i am!
---
I agree with this with a minor exception. For the standard heavy gunner, the plasma caster is useless because of low ROF and difficulty hitting target (slow moving projectile, terrible sight), BUT there are specialized heavy builds that utilize sneak, high AP pool, and vats/vats crit. If you use this in VATS and are specced for vats, the projectile homes in on the target. For those who have the AP to use a lot of vats, have good sneak ability (especially with the 2.5x sneak attack multiplier ability), a plasma caster with a good roll can be devastating. 
---
I respecced my vats stealth rifleman into a heavy gunner PA tank, but in the period where I still had vats skills I was using my plasma caster a ton. I have a 3* Bloodied 25/25 plasma caster, and I was able to put out close to 6k damage per shot from sneak. That thing one-shotted level 80 scorchbeasts from 200 meters away. It's a shame I can't trade the weapon between characters, because I would love to build a build around that weapon.
---
To further expand, these East Coast floaters evolved naturally once they were exposed to FEV and radiation. The West Coast floaters were mutated by scientists during initial FEV experimentation. They stopped because they moved on to other species.
---
For these features you will have to subscribe to Fallout Firster
---
None other!
---
You ever play nuclear winter? There’s a 10mm skin I love that can be unlocked by leveling in NW, the hot rod shark paint.
---
&gt; $14 is pretty steep for the stuff we get now.
---
Sorry but it is not steep for what we get now, for me a month it's **£12**, and I get **1650** atoms, if I were to get these atoms just buying them normally, I'd have to get the **1000 bundle (£8)** and the **500 bundle (4)**, which is **£12** and not even **1650 atoms**, and on top of that we get a private world, scrap box, a tent and the occasional free item.
---
Saying it's not already good value is simply untrue.
---
GreenFlame361, it might show up as Duffo
---
although, i'll be on around 6-7 pm est, as i have a wedding to go to :))
---
This would be awesome. I've always wondered how you can have nukes, tons of electrical options for CAMPs and the like, but the motorcycles and cars remain rusting.
---
oh, so super easy. how long do you think it takes to complete? and how often does it show up?
---
thats for the pistol not the smg
---
Aah gotcha
---
I did Morgantown for the first time today. I can say it was a delight for enemy spawns and I got packs of glowing fatties. By the time I cleared the town, the airport had respawned... Then the town respawned.... Then the airport.... Then the airport cargobot event (5x waves of Scorched dropping radiation fluids). Before I knew it the clouds cleared, I'd done TWO HOURS in there and came out with a shit ton of stable flux. Some people love WS, but I can say if you're not having great luck give Morgantown a crack as WS didn't do a lot for me mobs wise.
---
I'll have the chicken then please.
---
Wait till One Appalachia.
---
I swear by my pretty floral bonnet that I will end you.
---
ok...give me a few minutes "LifeInAnalog"

My free states group is exclusively PS4, and we tend to take advantage of all of the available weapons, armor, and technology in the game. After all, the free states are all survivalist and revolutionaries, hard to survive when you've got Hang-Ups about using faction based tech lol. We're all pretty laid-back with a very loosely based command structure. Hard to find members though, people's knee jerk reaction is to join one of the big guilds! (And yeah those guys do tend to get a bit weird)
---
Thanks. What's the best way to get mutations you want?
---
There was some YouTube vid a few weeks ago that talked about this and it got a lot of views so people just copy and paste his talking points for karma. If they don’t like 1st just unsubscribe lol
---
You want gauss shotgun... buffed? I'm hundo percent you are doing something wrong
---
This is just a part of why I love my Bloody Unarmed build.
---
A single hit on her is enough for me to get loot from her. Only ever get screwed over when she dies without ever landing at all, which I have only seen once or twice in over 500 hours of playtime.
---
The load explodes for additional affection.
---
You can get around 500-600 in PA. Escavator armour and calibrated shocks.
---
Long shot, but do Gauss weapons get affected by the grounded mutation? Which could explain why you regular combat shotgun seems more powerful.
---
Yikes dude
---
Do you have a father winter mask
---
Still broken
---
That is anecdotal evidence.
---
Loading in. Where would u like to go?
---
Anywhere uty :)
---
And with this change I expect I will lose my wife as player 2.  She is not very good at the game but likes the atmosphere and camp building.  She likes plinking with her crossbow.  With this one Gabriel her level 52 self will be constantly smashed anywhere she goes.  When we play together we stay West of the divide because she can kill stuff there.  When every fight becomes a bullet sponge I expect that will be the end for her.
---
Waaaaa. I learned nothing from the MULTIPLE times Bethesda has fucked over it's customers leading up to now at EVERY.FUCKING.TURN. OP, shut up you whiny bitch...you deserve it.
---
which may very well destroy the game. leveled enemies never go well with RPGs. If everything dies with the same number of hits, why bother leveling?
---
Big one is displays and vendors id imagine, most of these things have to have a “location“ and when you have your kick ass 3 star thingamajig in the display on your private world then where is it in a public world? (dumped back in to my inventory upon joining? Will it go back to its display in private?) they are really trying (IMO) to not introduce any new duping features, im sure something like larger private servers invites all types of mischief for dupers who mess with the location mechanics. Probably why they kept shutting down the displays and vendors.
---
hey dude i just got it finished. Thanks so much though!
---
Im at wss atm but I really don’t mind where we go :)
---
read the plans as soon as purchased
---
I am saying i can Solo every event these days.
---
I just can not stand "Freeloaders"
---
They actually ruined the Campfire Tales event for me.
---
If i do it on my own it is a piece of piss.
---
If you do it with "Freeloaders" squatting during the event it gets a bit tricky.
---
The game AI presumes there are x amount of players present.
---
 i was dealing with a mob intended for 3 high levels and the fire went out.
---
Now it had just been me present the event would have been easy.
---
no probs :)
---
I'm gonna say, aliens. Seems to make about as much sense.
---
What level did they pop out as? Sounds pretty good place now I think about it many ghouls
---
Fo1st was, is and will be just a SCAM! nothing else.
---
Okay ill come to u
---
I used to fear them, now I snipe the legs off them and laugh..... Unless they get to close then I scream.
---
Ree bots in ash heap are beefy
---
Do ya want me to pay ya after or somethin?
---
real hero right here for the nom twitter users, thank you
---
Carry with you a pepperoni roll (+30 weight) or ribeye steak (+20 weight), I also dash for one of the many tents before looting SBQ to dump flux.
---
That is the decent thing to do.
---
My gripe isn't with low levels squatting the event.They rarely ever do this.
---
Bless them,they mostly get stuck in.
---
My gripe is with high levels who can not be arsed contributing in an event when there are no low levels,they,squat it out.Whilst you have to deal with more Mobs,The game AI presumes there are x amount present,you get x amount of Mobs.
---
In Faschnacht it was endemic.
---
Campfire tales is easily done solo
---
Even though what you say is all true, I still like the answer: 
---
 "you don't have to pay each month, you can cancel your subscription"
---
Micro-transactions and this type of subscription should disappear because they are bullshit, some more than others and this is one of the most, offering services that should be included for free.
---
You could say that everyone is free to do what they want with their money and you would be right, but these subscriptions exist because people like you pay for them. I guess this is not really related to the post so I give you my upvote and I say again that you are right.
---
Well, people tried to settle your area, but some robot always kills them, and takes pieces of them away for some reason.
---
Well, the fact that it is junk allows us to stuff unlimited amounts into our scrap box, so that's good.
---
The shielded Enclave underarmor is the best for strength, giving a + 3 to the stat. In addition, the next update adds the secret service underarmor, which will give a + 4.
---
I got an ally rescue quest that sent me to the floaters.  How they managed to tie the guy up is truly mind boggling.
---
Had to argue with any of that.
---
Also the Arktos Pharma backpack skin if you do the optional thing and shut down the event
---
Was a great quest for a low level player and after really handy to leave your camp near there and use the workshops inside the secret lair.
---
900 pounds of bones hundreds of skulls
---
Seriously. A lot of posts here essentially are: "I am not getting nor have ever gotten the thing I paid for; I better keep paying."

---
I know your trying to test weapons, so I’m not going to be cheap and use a Tesla lol
---
I'm pretty sure there is a magazine that boosts carry weight as well
---
While I can’t say I know anything about the thing landing or not...
---
On PC, it’s much more obnoxious when someone is spamming orbital strikes to the point your screen whites out. From a Minigun. *And doing no damage, somehow, despite having a hacked weapon.*
---
If you're getting 40-60s everywhere, it could be the Vsync Bug. Go to Nvidia Control Panel, choose Fallout 76 under 3D settings, and force Vsync to be "OFF". Then choose Fullscreen mode in the game.
---
Your frame rate should now be always above 80s
---
Yes thank you :) is there a way to award karma on this sub? And thanks for the tests, my gun passed 😂
---
mostly depends if you are in power armor or not, height of deployment and if it was dropped or launched.
---
Lol, bethesda is always lying.
---
Generally surviving by camping is better than teamplay for xp
---
&gt;and discounts on atom shop items
---
Every time this topic comes up, I always make the same point, it always gets upvoted and OP never addresses it meaningfully. They gave us 100% discounts on items every single month. This is a much more generous version of what they initially offered, and harping on this specific point seems disingenuous or deranged. They not only delivered, they delivered in a way which is better than we could have expected.
---
Not that I know of lolz and I’m curious. Lay into me with that laser, and I want to see if auto Stim alone will keep me alive lol
---
Fallout 4 babiefied deathclaws, in fallout 3 and vegas? i'd stop and plan before i attempt a death claw, fallout 1 and 2? if i aint in power armor or have a plasma gun im not even attempting a fight.
---
fallout 4 and 76? i'll press his tummy to hear him roar
---
the floaters :)
---
Amazing! I will invest in autostim
---
The sound floaters make is the worst. Creepy and terrifying
---
I would trade my life for that laser! Very nice sir!
---
I’ll can show you my build if you like. I don’t actually use any auto Stim armor, just the born survivor perk at 3 first aid at 3, and field surgeon at 2
---
they updated fire damage to no longer factor into energy resist, now you need fire resist in order to reduce damage from them. those crispy bois are the biggest threat in the game so far, and i love it
---
I shall invest in that then! Tysm, I love pvp and I always want to get better, thanks again :)
---
I've got fireproof perk on but the acid ones do hurt if im stupid enough to just sit in their acid.
---
What special is born survivor in and what special is the rest in?
---
I say this everytime something like this comes up: it would be nice, but consoles are struggling with speed demon. How could those handle something like this?
---
No problem at all ! What kind of laser are you using atm? And born survivor is in agility, first aid is in intelligence, and field surgeon is in charisma
---
Thanks :) and my laser is a ve :)
---
5-10 minutes not even, just gotta kill the few super mutants in the front area, and then usually I take the stairs in the back to go up and mad dog is almost always in the second room. Pretty easy and idk I see it pop up at least every 15-30 minutes or so. If not easy caps is making a water farm of industrial water purifiers and just selling the water to vendors for 4-5 caps or so each until you empty out the 1400 daily cap limit
---
I think i am being misunderstood.
---
I am not gripping at gamers being courteous to lower levels.
---
I am griping because i was just about to complete camp fire Tales solo
---
When with a couple of minutes to go 2 high level players  joined squatted,did nothing.I ended up dealing with a huge mob,including a Scorpion and the fire went out.
---
That event is easily done solo.
---
If 3 players are there,the Mob will be for 3 players not 1
---
However i have noticed this is happening a lot.
---
Path to enlightenment another that Freeloaders squat in.
---
Again the game AI adjusts the Mob size,you end up dealing with more Mobs attacking the Side Hub etc.
---
You do it solo ,you kill the 3 scorched near the inner Hub that will spawn before you light the fire.Then just kill the Ghouls coming over the Bridge.
---
I have done these events dozens of times so i lknow what i am talking about.
---
So many settlers...
---
Beth needs to break "immersion" and just make explosive ammo 0.1 weight per mininuke/missile/grenade. No one is going carry around ammo or use weapons with such low damage to weight ratios
---
This.
---
Simple and to the point.
---
Outside of power armor and dropped from the sky from the average height that a scorchbeast typical flies.
---
so so many
---
I hope they don't do that, will become like eso, too easy and the lvls from 0-50 only to gimp yourself, just stupid.
---
Demo expert boosts the new gauss weapons damage greatly. They’re all explosive, and the gauss shotty is dealing ballistic damage instead of energy, try using ballistic bock and see your damage increase.
---
at the marked fissure sites on the map, kill all scorched, mine ONE ultracite ore (only ultracite works), scorched respawn after a few seconds.
---
shoot every scorched with the bloatfly syringer, then kill them after, a glowing bloatfly will spawn from dead enemy that has another chance to drop hardened or radiated fluid.
---
or just nuke and do queen over and over :)
---
Fo1st may be the reason? That tent and private server looks a lot more useful all of a sudden in instances like this to players. Just a guess
---
I think it’s bs it’s a junk item, killing the queen can take a lot of time and resources. Sure you can just “not die” until you get to a stash box, but when you get swarmed by enemies and all the people who you took the queen down with are suddenly nowhere to be seen you can’t help it if you die—and then someone swoops in and takes your shit. I don’t even use flux, and I’m not mad at people for taking my stuff cause hey the game lets you do it. But it’d be cool if they moved it to miscellaneous.
---
This is why I love my stealth build, sneak up on em and 1 shot them!
---
LOL it's $22 AUD a month for this scam here, Yet still no major improvements for the game and the subscription. totally agree.
---
Chinese Stealth Armor is where's it's at if you want to go sneaky
---
Oh right.
---
There's some WV day items in the atom shop, I've been loving the bear mascot mask!
---
I mean, the game was clearly a money grab from the start. It came out buggy, I’ll-conceived, and virtually unplayable. Why are you surprised?
---
They keep throwing things into the Atom Shop but don't provide extra space to build them. I imagine they will figure out how to monetize larger CAMPS.... Oh wait! Weren't FO1st supposed to get that lol.
---
Ohhhh, random question but could you shoot a bloatfly with the syringer to make them keep spawning?
---
Doesn't effect the stealth at all. Helmet is just cosmetic.
---
I've only just done the quest where you first meet her. Do you get to have any interactions with her later on? I actually really enjoyed  travelling with her in that cave!
---
If you don't like the game, that is a fair reason to quit playing it. If you quit because you "heard about" Bethesda adding a subscription service that adds a handful of features plus atoms then that is just kind of silly. Other than debatably the Scrap Box which people had been living without for up to a year prior, it's not like there is any DLC or essential gameplay content locked behind it. The cost of a Monthly 1st Subscription is equal to that of even being able to play some other online games.
---
Me tooo
---
hmmmm I still have "OH SHIT" moments when I stumble across them at lower levels, even at higher levels when I don't see one coming and hear a roar right near me I still freak out (before promptly turning it into a thin veneer all over the surrounding area)
---
It definitely has become more prevalent since Faschnacht.
---
I think it was Faschnacht that some first figured you get the Treasury Bonds by just being present at events.
---
I have seen it at all events.
---
No big deal usually,but events like Campfire Tales involve a bit more team work.Gathering Kindling,whilst others deal with Hordes.
---
As the others mentioned, when you playlce your new camp it will be blank but the old full buildings will be stored as a blueprint. You can dismantle the blueprint into its stored components. I dont move often but after a small while it is fun to change the scene. Just recently i build a pirate ship out on the east river
---
depending on the size, you could break a few bones.. or if it had a big meal you could end up buried alive on a direct hit. mostly assuming their contents are what you typically find in the pre-landed piles. (Bones, Guns, other heavy stuff typically not classified as food)
---
[here’s my build to a T](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1cb75c8&amp;d=s00pg2ph2pp2pi2eh2es0eo2em1ek1ck0ce0c72i12ib1a82a12a02s72la2l71lt2&amp;m=51c2fe8b3&amp;am=1a2738-1a2738-1a2538-1a2538-1a2738&amp;wp=w6w6&amp;wm=1b28-1b2534&amp;ad=3409a&amp;n=TSE%20Peffs%20)
---
I found that at 400, folks would treat me like a wholesaler, and just buy out my inventory. 
---
One reason is flux is harder to come by. Before First, you’d see flux for sale all the time because of weight issues. Now, I never see flux for sale (each serum requires a stable flux).
---
That's neat you went to the same university! How true to life is the campus/buildings layout? I mean I'm assuming campus IRL has more than 3 buildings but did they do it justice?
---
I have put it in my Stash for now.
---
I made my first decent SS Chest Piece. Unyielding. I think that was like 10th time lucky.
---
The one with my jet pack has fall damage though.
---
Lol, I guess. I end up selling at least 20 regular and super stimpacks to robot vendors every time I play for a little while.  The game hands the things out like candy compared to cores.
---
I just had it happen again after posting this too.  Had people on mic complaining about her not landing....the same people who wouldn't stop shooting her with their gattling lasers.  Took like 15 damn minutes to finish
---
I'll check it out :)
---
It's your fault for still paying. You're going to keep paying even if nothing changes so why are you whining ?
---
This stupid ass game is going to die soon anyway.
---
Can you explain what you mean by console struggling with speed demon? I’m not aware of this as an issue.
---
I use the same method to put work benches inside of stash boxes that look like tables
---
I'm guilty af, but I'm also new to NW and didn't realize not teaming was an option... Although I think I get points and stuff for being on a team if I'm not mistaken.
---
Tbf, there's been several times where I was the last surviving member of the team and was able to get like 2nd or 3rd place door the team because someone wiped out everyone else when they were grouped closely together
---
This is sad, because I've only done it a couple times, but once I'm there and start it, a few others always show up to help!
---
That feeling you get when you cash your Scrip  Mrmghhhhhhhhhhhh gives you a  Missile Launcher,Broadsider,Fatman, on the bounce.
---
I keep getting my arse handed to me by the Super Mutants at Lewisberg, so I feel like I'm never going to hold that title. :(
---
Running with it often causes textures or sometimes even structures not to load properly. This can also happen without speed demon, but it gives a nice bonus to chance of it happening.
---
Bethesda:
---
As a Fallout 1st member, you’ll have access to exclusive discounts in the Atomic Shop, so not only are you getting bonus Atoms every month, you’ll get discounts on some sweet items to spend those Atoms on.
---
Me:
---
Mmmmhmmmm
---
i found some level 60 power armor randomly and i’m only level 24
---
Slocum Joe, some can show up near Vaultec agricultural facility and sometimes in a camp close do the Duchess.
---
The fasnacht one brings me candy, treats, booze and royal jelly that o can make total jelly taffy with.
---
yes, originally. but later in development they changed it to foundation. im guessing to space the raiders and settler's main bases farther apart.
---
No it isn’t
---
mine just brings me the bodies of the innocent
---
WelL now I’m jelly
---
&gt; i believe dragons in Skyrim acted the same way.
---
Skyrim had a shout that would instantly cause any dragon to land.
---
Maybe FO76 needs something similar, especially for melee players. Just thinking out loud...
---
Have you any idea what the SS under Armour gives ?
---
hundreds of bodies
---
I’m sure there’s something they could just drop but I’m
---
amazed at how players refuse to give up anything in a game when the game has an endless supply of everything. 
---
I mean seriously. There’s always going to be an infinite supply of junk in the game. And ammo.
---
Out of 5 games, if you camp until last 4 squads, youll be doing better than if you go out looking to fight regularly bc the chance of dying in the fights is much higher. 
---
Die instantly or sit in a bush? *Generally * was a key word
---
Tasty bodies?
---
just bones only bones
---
Blue suitcase at Whitespring or Watoga and the cash register at The Purveyor is where a stash unwanted things
---
Do you make stock from the bones? Tasty stock?
---
Right, but that’s not the same as staying with your team and actually playing the game. If you bush camp and people catch you, because it’s easy to find you’d shrub scrubs, then you will get even less xp than people who kill shit creatures included.
---
It makes no sense to me that deep pocketed would ever decrease, rather than increase carry weight.
---
Hence the name "Deep Pockets".
---
Last night was my first time doing SBQ, as a new player I think we have a tendoncy to follow the herd. I however do better damage with my shotgun, it gets nice V. A. T. S CRITS (The legendary I have) and also because its what I tuned my perks for. I have no problem taking level 60s out in one or two shots. So I ran my ass on her every time she landed and just kept firing as much as possible. I didn't stay on the bunker like most of the group. I wanted her dead and I wanted to help anyway I could. If what I did was all wrong please by all means I would love some tips on how to better handle the fight and be more use not a hindrance.
---
How much you want for him?
---
Imagine that a game that relies on farming the same 5 events 10,000 times ends up with people event hopping???  Say it ain't so.
---
Youre right, sitting in a bush ISNT the same as working with your team.
---
if he doesn't turn you into bone shards as he does to anything that threatens him he's FREE
---
&gt;	But can we boost it more? YOU BET WE CAN!
---
🤣 love this phrase
---
Thanks sm :) ur carry weight must be so low 😂
---
Nor does it net you better rewards.
---
Tuesday
---
I am expecting it to be more limited, but would be happy if they just copied the mod.  Game changer.
---
no i can't do i don't know
---
She doesn't.  Being on a building or fence makes no difference.  I've had her take upwards of 5 minutes to land when fighting her on a private server.   Her AI is just really stupid and because you can't cripple her you can't force her down right now.
---
I never state that the paints work on all PA, just that any weapons/armor paints should be made that way. I am aware if the specific difference of paints vs skins, but they are still essentially the same thing. 
---
Time and resources are needed to make anything in this game, that's quite literally how the game is made. If unpaid modders can do it, surely a paid professional team can accomplish it too.
---
Sadly not and it feels like a missed opportunity to me.
---
It ideally should give near equal rewards. Consistent  150xp is the same at the end as 50 cp + 250xp + 50 + 250.
---
Why are the floaters so fucking beefy though
---
Does that apply to the gauss rifle as well?  That might be one reason why my gun is so weak.
---
I gotcha. I’ve experienced that before  when sprinting.
---
Think of all the junk you could carry
---
Like the rest of FO76, the major landmarks and buildings are given lots of attention to detail, but the layout of things is not overly realistic. 
---
The main building for VTU is modeled off of Woodburn Hall, and is instantly recognizeable. Plus there is a light rail system (PRT or Personal Rapid Transit) that was installed back in the 1970s) and part of it does extend to a downtown station (i.e. past the downtown campus proper), which you can see in the game. But otherwise it's kind of jumbled. Morgantown is very vertical as it's all hills. There are many buildings on the downtown campus plus there is the Evansdale campus (for things like Engineering and Performing Arts) as well as the Medical campus. Hence the PRT.

---
Same is true for the main map, where things are squished, missing, or even in the wrong area by cardinal direction. Which is understandable given the translation into a video game, but it actually means sometimes I think "Oh I'll go to this part of the state" in the game but realize I've been jogging the wrong way because I was using the map in my head of the real life places :p
---

---
They are dangerous and I really hope they stay that way. Game needs more danger.
---
No doubt  there will be players  walking around the Wastelands with a House on their back,spending every playing minute keeping their carry capacity at optimum maximum level.Shudder the thought of throwing anything.
---
In a real post apocalyptic World we will see this Players dragging Shopping carts full of Plastic Bottles up the road.
---
Right but for you to consistently get that reward you need to stay in the game for upwards of 18 minutes. I however can get that in about five minutes of killing people. Not to mention if I stay to the end of the game I get well over 1000.
---
I've seen her not land with everyone on the ground and land with pretty much everyone on top of something.  I've never really seen solid evidence for or against it so really have no clue.
---
A few days ago a bunch of people were on the fence and she wasn't landing. Some guy finally got on mic to bitch that everyone needs to get down or she will never land.  Not even 5 seconds after he finished his sentence she landed with nobody having moved an inch.  The timing of it was perfect and hilarious.
---
So basically you want it all.
---
Not needed 
---
I run 3 perception in my PA HG build 😂
---
Assuming you get a good game is highly circumstantial.
---
I've never been able to make it in time to start so I didn't even know there was anything before killing waves of bugs and wolves.
---
It is part of the game hence why it’s there. Hop servers or turn on pacifist on.
---
Yeah this is just a level 30/40 Angler though. 
---
I run a "jack-of-all trades" build (automatic/rifles/shotguns/heavy ballistics while in pa) , but I expected a Gauss shotgun to be an easy like for like replacement.
---
I guess configuring a new perk loadout just for Gauss shotguns will give me something to do.
---
Skeet Shooter seems like the most relevant perk though.
---
Not for me. Or anyone who tries to get good
---
Using Ryzen 7 on a 2070 Super myself at 2560x1440 144hz on High and get about 62-72 FPS on average.
---
Their very own bullshit buggy client/server logic allowed duping, nothing to do with hacks.
---
Yes you can do this, but it gets to be a pain in the butt switching back and forth from the stringer to another weapon. Would work best if you had some one else with you, one person shoot with a stringer and the other person shoot regular weapon to kill bloatfly after you’ve shot it with the stringer.
---
Or finally a reason to use the cushioned leg armor mod!
---
This is how they did it:
---
“*WHAAAAAAAAA*!”
---
I expect so, after all the "Gaussshot is The Litt!!!" comments.
---
I hope so.
---
You forgot 3 with strange in numbers herd mentality
---
No, it wouldn't.  Because A: it weighs a lot and B: being Junk means it fits in the Scrapbox.
---
It's rare to be at an SBQ battle after 1st where someone doesn't set up a TENT.  Even if you don't have 1st, you shouldn't have to hoof it all the way back to Watoga Station.
---
Well now I need a Rose-like collectron... I love her paint job. Would definitely spend atoms on a collection or PA skin to match her.
---
Your first sugestion is something i strongly agree  but instead of  legendary effect maybe  could be added to the list of legendary perk's  has for the  child of atom, it would be really really nice that it become true damage has 90% of the ennemy is  immune to rad...
---
also i see fun build down there so il share my own alternate build when not doing bloodied
---
I still have to name it but im thinking of that guy doing the flex tape ads
---
Flaming + bleeding bar Chainsaw with a power armor having emergency protocol  its already plenty of fun and i tried various perk so far what i like is glow sight/adrenal reaction/nerd rage/bloodie mess, Sadly the chainsaw doesn't gain anything form almost all the other perks D: (the rad  melee perk does work on player but it aint my cup of tea)
---
Anyways on paper it make the chainsaw do  5 balistic and 20 flame damage (flame not energy) which make it surprisingly good since almost noting has  flame resistance in the game! its decent damage its not bloodied stuff but hey what works work. 
---
on a side note, i did try to mix  plague walker with the chainsaw...if one day they make the sickness not curable  it could be a fun mixture to run at enemy and literally be a  melee aoe  tank for a team
---
p.s : im 100% gonna try the chainsaw with the legendary perk - ''take one for the team'' that extra 40% might make it better hopefully :D
---
Well g 4 u. For me the game is a buggy mess that doesnt work most of the time so ill take it slow until someone Gshotguns me half a block down the road
---
Thanks!
---
Thanks I did remove Grounded, *just* for the shotgun, just in case. I think I need to amp up my "Shotty" in one of my builds.

It’s same thing as in GTA. As soon as you pass level 120 you never ever unlock anything else. Legendary perks are coming but still after level 300 nothing. They should make a “prestige” level maybe where you can reset your whole character back to level 1 but you can keep everything you’ve earned you’re just set back to level 1. It would make getting low level stuff worth it too.
---
I started playing old school runescape again and it's mind boggling how much content you get with membership, thousands of new items and weapons, like 4 times the map size.
---
Fallout first; you get a box
---
Well that’s because you just sit in a bush maybe if you respect your perks out of shotguns or try something else that works for you you’ll have better success.
---
I think it will be slightly better than other games that have it because sure it would take a 15 and a 50 each 10 shots (example number) to kill a supermutant or something with a non-legendary weapon
---
But the level 50 is a lot more likely to have a weapon and gear that increases their damage enough that it only takes a couple hits (not counting people's alts that they give a tonne of stuff to)
---
Thanks! Gonna test with demo and skeet! 👍
---
People keep bringing up that these free items are the 'discounts' Bethesda spoke of, but if you only make an item available to a certain subset of users for a particular price, that's not a discount, that's an exclusive item. Someone needs to be paying full price for said item for this 'discount' to have value. 
---
And to be honest, who wants a discount on a recolor of the same armor, or that Taco Bell diarrhea camo armor?
---
I'd much rather all that have been scrapped. Instead, have the Original Ranger armor, and a 25% discount on bundles/items here and there.
---
In my experience, heavy weapons and vats don't get along well, barring a few notable points, mostly due to ap cost.
---
On my Junkie Pa Heavy, I basically never use vats unless I'm doing some defense event and a ghoul is getting too close the goal.  Then I may consider tapping vats on my gatling gun.  But for general use, not important, and concentrated fire becomes a waste of perks.  Rock 3 perception for lockpicking and call it a day.
---
Much of the problem is the theme. If you don't like red rocket or mothman stuff you have been out of luck all month.
---
They need a little better variety imo
---
Well when selling at your vending machine, especially with weapons/armor, its going to have be something halfway decent for a good sale. Shotguns arent as widely used, and unless you have a "magic" shotgun chances are no one wants to buy them. Then there's the weapon level, if it's not level 45/50 it's less likely to be sold. I sell all my low level and  legendaries for cheap amounts so that players can exchange them for scrip. 
---
Most stuff in a vending machine that sells quickly is on the cheaper side. When you go to sell something remember that what you're really selling is convenience, the ability to get said item without any work involved. When setting prices, consider not.just what you want to make from it, but also what you would be willing to pay.
---
Hell yea that would be cool too
---
Oo, forgot about Herd Mentality
---
Perhaps, but in exchange, they heightened the glossy reflections considerably, which makes everything look like liquid metal when it rains.  That's a lot more ugly, imo.
---
I do wish the areas still had minimum levels, for example nothing below like 35 in the mire but they scale up if you're higher
---
Nothing yet
---
I dont sit in a bush is the thing. It just seems my armor is quite shit no matter what gun i go against. And ontop of that no matter what perks i run the game has some way to fuck me but thats just nw
---
It’s about 240-250
---
I’m still surprised after so many post saying fallout 1st sucks and the only thing that’s worth is that scrap box, people still buy it
---
Rad ant lager is my best friend lol
---
This would be really cool as part of scorched earth. Imagine fighting your way through an army of scorched with swarms of weaker smaller scorched beasts swirling above you as your group attempts to draw out the queen.
---
Technically if you did the glitch for double the unyielding effects you can get 40 from armor as it doubles the effects of everything. However that’s not always going to be a guaranteed method
---
Do you play on PS4? If so you can join me and I will help you.
---
I honestly don't feel bad. Everything Bethesda did before that and you thought it was a good idea to pay for a year upfront and trust this one was going to be different?
---
Don't reward them for shitty behavior. When you do they will just keep doing it.
---
they also updated the chainsaw to have fire damage (flamer mod) opposed to energy unlike the  other flame weapon we currently have
---
.44 never sells. being playin since beta and nobody ever bought a single 44 round from my vending machine. and I try selling it for 1 cap each. that being said:
---
10mm and shotgun sells are hard to sell, even at 1 cap it takes months for someone to buy them.
---
plasma cartdriges, fusion cells, cryo cells sells every once in a while, but it sells relatively easy.I aleays price them 1 cap
---
5mm, 308, .50 sells just like water in tbe desert. at 1 cap each I sell those everyday.
---
I never tried selling 38, 45 and 556 because I use them (curtently at 5k 38, 95k 556 and 170k 45)
---
Have not tried with the gauss rifle yet, you can check by simply equipping the perk even at level
---
1, you will see your weapon damage increase if it works.
---
“*When you die... can I harvest... YOU... for bone shards*!?”
---
Sounds good, but I don't want to include glitches. I want this post to be as accurate for as long as possible, so if it gets patched...
---
Craft yourself a combat rifle with a .38 receiver for low level area’s/enemies. I do 60+ damage with mine. 
---
That way I conserve my .45 and 5.56 for the tougher ones.
---
They should add some kind of free junk box, I can't even imagine myself playing the game without it. Players without it must be spending tons of time micro-managing their inventory.  
---
15 euro (!) for what we get doesn't cut it. They should, at the very least, add some exclusive deals. That's something they can do RIGHT NOW.
---
Which one?
---
I've never noticed a change in anything when I do that event vs when others join and do it with me. 
---
Weird.
---
I do but atm im out of town dm me and ill play when i get back
---
It's pretty annoying having to take the hack and lock cards on and off. Maybe once you hit 50 you can hack/lock any without having the cards actually taking up slots, as long as you've bought them. As far as leveling after 50, they are adding legendary perks which will help resolve this issue. You spend perk points on cards, scrap those cards to get points which you can use to buy legendary perks, as far as I know anyway.
---
Oh ok well I’ll be on!
---
Items
---
So you want characters to be completely maxed out at 15 in all SPECIALs by level 295?
---
That’s not a great idea. It means there’s no need to have any build designs or plans. Your character will be great at everything and insanely overpowered for PVE. 
---
I can support a respec option, but this is just a flawed idea. 
---
Your wanting a single-player over-powered experience. The recommend FO4 with some mods. 
---
This is a multi-player game. There have to be limitations that create variety.
---
Obviously 😂
---
Darn, OK thank you. It is a missed opportunity, they wrote her with a great personality for the Fallout universe!
---
Who?
---
For this particular FO76 event I believe you have misdirected your aggression. The problem isn't really about how other players engage the target or from where, it is how BGS designed the AI mechanics. Opinions about how to "trick" the target to do something that appear to give you an advantage abound, that is basic human nature, but it is almost impossible to develop a concrete understanding of how this game works while playing it. Only the developers of the AI can say for sure and as far as I know they aren't talking.
---
The hacking and lockpick perks are not stackable because each one is level-gated. If they were stackable you'd be able to get all 3 at the level of the lowest one.
---
It’s a drink, you learn from Bev, it adds +50 carry weight for a period of time lol
---
No, learning to play well, getting kills, and placing high is much better.
---
&gt;I have altered the deal, pray I do not alter it further.

Look me up, I will help you Fatman cryptids to get your wing. It's easy when you know how, Queen of the Hunt quest.
---
I do heavy gunner aswell as comando so ima have to keep strength
---
Tru tru, I too hate having to switch out cards and then forget to set the original equipped cards. Can't wait for that update to come.
---
It increases your Strength, therefor your carry weight. I used to carry Black Diamond just for the 3 pounds of net carry weight it gave me when I was a Rifles build. Now I'm an Unarmed Bloodied build (permanently at 19% health)
---
While I get what you mean about predictability, this post is just about getting that carry weight number as big as possible.
---
Everything about this game engine is kind of dated and really doesn't look that great.
---
Circumstances are always variable. Even bush camping is vatiable but the less moving parts the better.
---
That is very nuce

Taste of humans eh?, would you like a white wine?

Couple bundles of moth man stuff and the usual other random skins and apparel items pale rider is getting vaulted so if you wanted that it’s your last chance

I earn more EXP and level way faster being a better player than I ever did by camping bushes, there’s literally a number tied to this to prove it lol

June 30th is the release date for patch 20 per  [Jeff Gardner ](https://twitter.com/jg93/status/1273957170900619264?s=21)
---
And you said you don’t event see “secret service armor” as an optioned greeted out in the armor workbench correct?
---
Exactly. And then level 7 characters would be posting rank 3 locks. That doesn’t feel balanced.

Thank you. Dont have Twitter so I miss all of that.
---
Ok thank you
---
No problem!
---
Drop something...eat something...do chems...blah blah blah... 
---
Yes there's ways to temp add carry weight but thats so not the point is it? And what happens when it's your 3rd SBQ on the trot and you've already eaten in to supplies? And I'm not dropping anything for the Vultures who call themselves other players in this game - you want it, you earn it or pay for it (I make exceptions for single figure noobs).
---
I think I've had all lockpick perk cards on for 3 days because I keep forgetting to switch back.
---
Actually I found with my melee bloodied build I take these floaters out with a single hit. Using the UNSTOPPABLE MONSTER, that I got during the time when they we had challenges in the survival moden
---
Great points except for making it longer to enter, it's already pretty long when you enter and exit a lot for crafting.
---
Scrip is the only way to roll for certain legendaries, and at 150 per day it takes weeks to get good rolls. Saying scrip isn't going to run out is basically saying you are going to roll for the same legendary forever, which is an absurd prospect.
---
that's sounds good,I would like couse I still can get in a challenge if I wanna, like now exploring some times I found enemies lvl 58 that I can kill easy wile other lvl 30 I need to run and run fast, is always a surprise and I like it.
---
Yeah, same here. I don't remember how many Atoms I spent on that damn thing, and honestly I don't *want* to know; it would only piss me off.
---
Radstag Meat increases carry weight by 20 pounds and should stack with Pepperoni Roll.
---
I agree, inevitable.
---
You can link your steam account on [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) at any time.

I mean, flatwoods monster
---
I fucking haaaaaate glossy textures. It’s probably one of the worst things from this generation of games and it will age extremely poorly.
---
Well considering there was a 5% drop chance for rare masks, I'd hazard a guess that around 5% of those masks were rare masks..
---
About 5
---
I've gone through a phase of building houses and am currently in a 'compound building' phase.
---
I'm playing with walling off the camp perimeter with defences, leaving an entrance. Then using the pre-built structures within the walls.
---
I like testing and making some blueprints in the workshops. Saves tearing stuff up and using my own mats in my camp.
---
It was deleted, thought it would😊
---
I said what I said. It's on my back burner. I'll circle back to it when I can.
---
What do you mean about 5 ?
---
What is it that you all dont understand? Obiously killing 3 people and winning is better than sitting in a bush BUT bushes are a reliable source of a static xp
---
Man stopping playing fo76 was the best decision I made. Which sucks cause it's an awesome game. But posts like this validate in my mind I made the right choice
---
Bloom shouldn't exist as an effect. I've never heard of anyone liking it ever, until now.
---
That would explain it then, price hike to prevent flipping.
---
I have been lucky and found a seller with all Mutation sera at 300 caps. I've enough to change up a build at least.
---
Not 9 months overdue considering they said these things would be coming in the future with no specified release date. But persistent workshops would be one thing I hope comes sooner.
---
Currently I have 2 accounts on GTA.  One at Rank 457 and my original at Rank 354.  The only thing you gain through Rank is Health.  Which it caps at Rank 220 I think.
---
Good deal. On my main I waste around 400 cryo, but it goes fast that way. I don't think it matters either with the tents or fence.
---
You cant go by that. Not every event ended with all bots alive. It would be nice to know the amount of completions with all bots alive along with rare masks dropped so the data mining can be checked along with actual drop rates.
---
From the wiki there are 2 choices:
---
Grognak #9: +10 carry weight
---
Scouts life #3: +10 carry weight
---
It caps at 100
---
I agree! And while their at it they should make wendigos ghouls! That way we can do extra damage to them!
---
Everything in the game is intrinsically free, remove caps and vendors then and all will be good.
---
idk anything about your question but i just wanted to ask if this event was suppose to feel absurdly hard? I just got back into the game for the first time since after launch, i’m lvl 80, heavy gun power armor build, there was about 4 or 5 of us there (all randoms i think) and we got the thing to like 10% health before time ran out. We all died probably 5+ times each. It felt like the hardest thing i’ve ever done in this game by far lol
---
Easily vats and gun fun bloodied 25 handmade 3 dead in less than second
---
What is it that you didn’t understand? 
---
I said that improving your skill and engaging was BETTER, not that bush camping wasn’t viable. Additionally, you will have *more fun* engaging, which is kind of the purpose of playing games, not to alt/tab or watch Netflix on your phone while you wait for a timer to tick. The game is grindy enough, why make it worse?
---
What about exvator power armor it gives an inventory boost ?
---
I do try not to.
---
Thanks, I'll try and remember.
---
it makes me sad to see every post pointing out missing or false advertised content from 1st or ATX in general always need a huge wall of text to complain the common go-to arguments against the system in general.   
---
Is this what Reddit should be? pointing out a huge problem which is illegal in most Countrys only hears "muuh don't buy it, idiot"?
---
It looks bad in some games, but there’s something about it in fallout 76 that I like. It also looks nice in the Witcher 3
---
Texted todd, he said, "it just works" and "buy more atoms"
---
me too...just think of all the snarky dialogue you'd hear..
---
the only thing that's make me panic is automatic weapons, they suck your hp so fast, as a melee some times I hit 2-5 times and I can hear the damage sound/enemies get incapacitated but don't get any damage on it and he start blasting that thing on me I really run from them O.O

---
I agree 100%. I enjoy playing in a private server much more than public but as a 1st member the benefits are lacking big time. If you compare subscription services for other MMOs there are perks that entice you to stay such as more slots in the AH, increase in currency amount, more accessibility to legendary currency, etc. With 1st I get a private server, stash box and re-skinned tents. Sure I get Atoms but after a while there's nothing worth buying.
---
I can make you a whole set

Afk grinding in a mode that doesnt matter except for rewards FOR SURVIVAL isnt all that fun to me. I played maybe 2 a day and im just going for sprinkle camo and thats it. Idgaf about hellfire or the other nonsense. Im level 40 so like 5 ish more levels and im done with the mode.

Sorry, but if nothing in the atomic shop has interested you yet I highly doubt anything will.
---
I worries me that there may be a dearth of capable devs in BGS Austin, and they literally are unable to fix this issue without borking something else.
---
Lol. Omg you guys are hilarious. You’re so focused on one aspect of the game. And of course the reason is that’s all you have left to do. I get it. You’ve done it all and now are stuck on a treadmill of doing the same things over and over. 
---
Because you want to. Not because you have to. What cracks me up is that once you get what you want. You still won’t have anything more to do than this. 
---
Lol. Your upset you can’t get things faster in a game where you’ve already done everything.
---
I’m sure this is where you’ll make some case about how you haven’t or whatever.
---
Because it keeps players returning. If you could get full secret service gear with full mods in a few days thats not much of an end game grind. As much as I hate the cap, it does give you something to aim towards
---
Dang bummer
---
If most involved have done one previously it usually goes pretty smoothly. If everyone is running around like headless chickens shooting robots and not grabbing pylons, not so much.
---
I think they made them for bloodied who don't pay attention. Most of them are one shot in vats while running, full health.
---
Sorry
---
Not only that, but it eats AP way too fast, and It has way too much recoil to be useful.
---
at least the last point isn't a hoax, it's just bad advertised. 
---
as a First member you get some discounts which others wont get, the problem is you can't see which is a 1st discount or just a discount in general.
---
I checked the ATX content for several weeks with my main account which has 1st and my mule without it. sometimes 1st have several items in discount, the other week then nothing (or i already unlocked it).
---
The weightless scrap box is a few perks on it own

Because like most of the game grenades they are simply terrible - standard, specials, Gold Bullion Floaters.... Beyond the odd plasma variant I don't bother and use most grenades as currency.

I'm enjoying this thread immensely, just so you know.

If you're on xbox I can craft and mod you a full set, not around for a few days though
---
I fucking hate when people don’t know how to run it! Now I understand new players to it but when lvl 200+’s can’t figure it out...come on.
---
I quit because the game, because it was such a buggy mess, that I couldn't enjoy it. Every patch would bring at least a week's worth of lag and stuttering. I could even walk my character a few feet in the game without it taking 5 minutes. I couldn't particpate in limited time events like meat week over it. The Fallout 1st bs was just the final straw.
---
I’m on PS4 sorry
---
Very cool

I'm glad you enjoy it

I was claiming empty pylons when available, it just felt like i was getting MELTED. I literally went thru all but 3 of my 50+ stimpacks i had, and all my psychobuff/med-x i had on me 😭 i just couldn’t keep my health up. It felt like everytime he focused me (which felt like the entire time i was dead) i would get staggered and then melted with lasers in one blast even if i had a stimpack going
---
Right there, I saw what you did.
---
Aye, the objectives are clearly stated as well.
---
he says and i quote "when you die I'll harvest you for bone shards"
---
Heartaches by the number, troubles by the score...
---
Well one is a quest item I know big shock the other is a crafting item
---
because that's what a nuke does, it kills everyone...
---
you want them to respawn? then leave the area, reconnect to the server - boom all spawns!
---
The best way to do it is to avoid drawing the imposters attention, if you are also tanking the damage from one or more pylons and then it hits you with the beam you melt fast.
---
I find that being sneaky helps a shit ton running encryptid.
---
For full health you need all 5 pieces. What's nice about chameleon is with the right set, you can run your agility really low and put perk points in better slots.
---
Yeah, level 40 Gulpers and Mirelurk Kings are WAAAAY tougher than level 80 deathclaws.  It's really messed up.  Like everything else in this game.
---
Weird thing is it works on super mutants they say
---
Well, that IS false advertisement. The broblem is that when you bought it those perks werent included in the description of the service. In the US you could probably start a law suit (is that how u spell that?)
---
Doing that now that I’m stronger. I’m overly nervous I’m going to loose it all by mistakenly taking rad away since I’m only level one on Starched Genes.
---
It's stealth but bad stealth.
---
Are you running into the path the imposter leaves and catching fire maybe? Staggared by a nearby exploding bot? Sometimes they explode for me but with no flame animation.
---
Death + Fast Travel = issues on multiple events, or even during general gameplay. It's not a new thing and its been through cycles of betyer/worse - atm it's terrible and simple jumps from A to B can take multiple attempts. PTS feedback suggests it been modified and works far better but Patch 20 + time will be the only proof.
---
I see lots of staggers and think "???' sometimes it's hidden enemies (tics and other small ground dwellers are the worst culprits), other times the result of a health knock due to disease, but sometimes you will not spot anything.
---
They are protected by his spirit...
---
Why did I laugh at this so much
---
I’m on ps4. I’ll check in a few min and see if I can build you a set.
---
With the legendary parks. Its going to take a few hundred or thousand levels to max out all the perks.
---
You're using a combat rifle
---
How about a perk point every 76 levels?  That would reward long-time players without breaking the game..... and be on brand.
---
Irrelevant, they let you carry more weight.  It's how I regularly have more than 3k weight on me and can still run and fast travel.
---
what weapon should I use

---
If you’re set right, you don’t even need Power Armor.
---
It's not that they don't know how to do it... They just don't want to take the pylons. It's the reason I usually skip the event. I'll show up and grab a pylon but nobody else will reciprocate. I'm a bloodied build so I can only handle one at a time, but everyone else just tracks the IS waiting for somebody else to do the hard part. Everybody is so paranoid they won't get their tag on the damn thing...
---
They should make a deathclaw boss if you nuke deathclaw island
---
Ok thx my psn is the same as on here
---
Don't worry, bethesda will ruin the whole game just to appease you and 2 other people who want this, when all you gotta do is explore while leveling instead of after powerleveling.
---
They could even make it so that there are level 50+ servers where everything is scaled and kept the leveling servers the same, but no, let's just throw it all out.
---
id kind of rather make it so legendary power armors can be crafted (but not traded) in the same sense as the new Gauss weapons. but you need to know the standard plan for it to craft a legendary version
---
So based on your other comments it is clear you don't have a dedicated build so you wont draw out its max damage. I see this a lot especially from people who've only played fo4, id recommend you try nukes and dragons to plan out a vats shotgunner build
---
Yeah I grab 1-3 when I’m there. Hell even with my low lvls lol

---
Handmade, best DPS
---
Not the point of the post. It makes thr number more efficient rather than making the carry weight actuslly bigger. The goal is to get the carry weight as big as possible, not be the most efficient with the number possible. Besides, you can still have all the weight reduction here anyway, so it's not like you have to oick one or the other.
---
I found one in that forest near FS Prime
---
It will depend what effects the armor has on them, but I see marine pieces for sale in vendors for upwords of a few hundred caps each, that's with high charisma and hard bargain though.
---
The Fixer and handmade do better damage.
---
Junkies isn't as desirable as bloodied but still probably gonna cost a bit
---
Also have you checked out other junkies rifle builds to see if they have anything different that might make a difference?
---
Also what about mutations? ALSO ALSO do you have the right addictions?
---
Oh btw I won’t be on for about an hour as I’m currently busy doing a update
---
You have your build saved somewhere? Let’s see it
---
Most of fallout 76 is “Missed Opportunity” /cry
---
I've used some on super mutants before and they started fighting each other but I only crafted like 3 do no further experiments. Maybe that's what I'll do today?
---
That would be great since I have only tried 1 grenade and it just did not work.
---
Fast Firing Heavy Weapons will eat though the AP and recoil badly making any VATS advantage pretty pointless. It can work on the Gatling Gun, and to a lesser extend the 50 cal, as you can pop one or two rounds at a target, but the Miniguns high rate of fire works against it - you'll fire off a lot more ammo but may well get fewer hits at less damage per round. In this instance VAT perks like Concentrated Fire are wasted.
---
There is no official proof of this as far as I know, just people repeating what they heard. I've noticed no affect either.
---
I think PA will get a big boost wen the Brotherhood storyline drops.
---
Try de mama Murphy's challenge...
---
I’ll be on in about An hour just updated system software
---
Not by enough to overtake the weight from Backpack, Deep Pocketed, and Unyielding +1 Strength armor. I believe maximum Power Armor gives is around 130, but do correct me if im wrong
---
Well isnt that the problem and yeah we should complain?  The tent and box are nice. But people can complain. And honestly the more that complain the more likely someone will listen. It might fall on deaf ears but its a chance
---
Who is this rare vendor at Charleston I should know about.... and how do I get in on this flux?

The wife goes into work at 3 today (Eastern time) so I'll hop on and go look for some canisters and then look for enemies to test them on. Any recommendations?
---
They're both carry weight from food, so they overwrite one another.
---
Reminds me of Bungie, when they screwed me over. I bought Destiny 2, and played on my laptop a lot when at work (Dont judge, I merely monitor shit, got a lot of free time on my hands). Suddenly, after an update it no longer worked. 
---
I contacted Bungie and asked what the hell was up. They said they could not help. I should just connect to an external monitor.
---
1 day later, they changed their system requirements and added (Might not work on laptop GPU's).

That was a pretty scumbag thing to do, even if they fixed it later on. But I simply quit playing and have not touched it since. 
---
Bethesda is basicly pulling the same shit here.
---
Only thing that should be done here, is a class action lawsuit for false advertising against Bethesda.
---
The Mothman works in mysterious ways....
---
I wear grenader perk to increase my blast radius but since humans did not gone insane on my try I am not sure this perk works with hallucigen grenades...
---
If your gauss is taking 5-10 shots then you're doing something realllllly wrong (i one shot most things blah blah etc)
---
watch/read some guides. Drop strong back, bandolier and travelling pharmacy. Stop picking up every thing. Start carrying the bare minimum. 15-20 stims. A few boosters. Take the ammo you need for the job. Tag the harder to find bits of junk so you'll know what to pick up. Have a good clear out. Keep up 30-50 of common junk and a bit more of the more uncommon.  If you're gonna use the gauss you may as well go ALL in
---
also make an alt and get someone to help you shift stuff you don't wanna lose on to it.
---
And especially Bethesda should do this because the community has much more skills in terms of bugfixing than they have themselves.  They really could restore a bit of their bad reputation if they would do this.   
---
I remember when Fallout 4 came out, it was only playable after installing some patches the community provided from nexusmods.
---
I run grenadier and demolition expert on a commando build so hopefully I can get some people. Maybe I'll take demo off so I can see the effects more. Do they do any actually damage?
---
No only 1 magazine buff at a time
---
Every enemy needs a buff in fallout. The player base has become powerful but with nothing to use are poweres on.
---
Put floor down. Put Vending machine down. Put wall with window down.
---
They have no life force because they eat lead.
---
And neither did the last Mothman I encountered, although that may have been because I beat him to death with a barbed walking stick.
---
Happy birthday, West Virginia!  I got you a gift!  A detonated nuclear bomb!
---
You monster.
---
;)
---
It was good for SBQ combined with one gun army, you could cripple the wings so quickly and keep her on the ground. Now though they still havent fixed the flappy bat immunity to cripple.
---
I died an had the respawn glitch as well. I’ve had it happen about 5 times the last 2 months on bigger events. For me it happened when I died right as the boss was about to be killed. So I’d see him die and couldn’t respawn. Which is so stupid. It’s pathetic the glitch is still in the game
---
Time for your sonjaculation ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Honestly your lock picking and hacking should be purely based on level. It’s so ridiculous to have to slot cards.
---
Like, hold on, let me purposely waste 3-6 slots for something that usually leads to subpar rewards.
---
Once in a blue moon do I bother to open something that I go, “Hey, glad I picked/hacked that!”
---
Grenade has 2 psychial damage
---
Keep hoarding those levels until you get ready to specialize in a certain build. When I started wanting to try a bloodied build, I needed like 35 or 40 level ups to change my special stats around. Which was fine cause I had around 30 to reallocate my stats and try the build right away.
---
Why not both? I'd like the Random variant so people would get that Scavenged Look going on. Of course if you have Atom Shop skins you can make your set look uniform. Just the Randomness adds flair to the game in my humble opinion
---
I agree.
---
I really enjoy the game. But I simply just won't pay it. $13 bucks a month is way too steep for a game recieving as few content updates as this does. The quality of life improvements should be incentive to get you to pay so they can continue to develop and release content. This feels like I'm basically paying $13 a month because they don't offer any way in game to expand your scrap. WoW for example. You buy more bank tabs and buy bigger bags. Not that WoW is a perfect game, but that's just an example of what I'd rather see. Maybe find plans to build bigger scrap boxes. I think its dumb that I can place a dumpster in my camp and it's just the same as a regular ole scrap box. It's a freaking dumpster! It should be like Mary Poppins bottomless bag of scrap!
---
What everyone asking for PA legendaries or crazy buffs doesn't seem to understand ,is that it would completely make every other armor obsolete. PA has innate damage and rad resistance that far outclass any armor(yes even secret service,no constest). 
---
The only good buffs to PA would be poison protection and an increase to like base 400 carry weight(500 with cali shocks)
---
In your pip, not the camp icon on the map.
---
So don't really need to worry about it then
---
Messin with sheepsquash
---
"Dumped back into stash" codewise it never leaves your stash, that's also why you can take things directly from displays.
---
I've found a blue and red asylum outfit last night. You saying these are worth something?
---
Glad to know I'm not the only one still using the Unstoppable Monster. That thing really is a beast weapon. Walloped a legendary scorched beast in a few hits yesterday with it, always feels good.
---
You lose all other buffs in PA?
---
Definitely worth it. I don’t know why people are are complaining about ammo but all it takes is lead and steel to craft which is extremely common and easy to get from junk and ores. Even the ultracite 2mmEC is cheap. Some lead, steel, crimson flux and ultracite. Crimson flux and ultracite can be farmed every time you do a SBQ run.
---
This gun shouldn’t be used to take out trash mobs. It’s more of a gun intended as a reserve for high HP monsters.
---
The point is that by continuing to pay after they consistently put out subpar products and services they have no reason to improve. If you’ve paid any attention to the state of 76 since launch, especially since 1st was announced, you should understand that the message you’re telling the devs is you are 100% satisfied with the bugged trash can they call a game. They don’t hear you asking for bug fixes and quality of life, they hear you buying stupid cosmetics &amp; scrap boxes.
---
Absolutely love that dlc. Had a character that made the sink his home base just so I could hang out with that toaster and book chute some more
---
Put SBQ's 70% damage reduction magic effect as a Deathclaw race trait.
---
Sturdy only.
---
Is it the place where there were like 5 or 6 boat fly spawns?
---
Ha! Thats exactly what I thought!
---
True but it was a fun challenge and going back later in the game with an explosive round Anti material rifle was so satisfying
---
Grab her an instigating crossbow if you can find one, or a rifle if she's cool with switching
---
With my instigating pipe bolt action I hit 1600 in sneak even without Crit bonus and 1 hit all the basic enemies
---
If she does want to do bigger fights eventually set her up with junkies/AA Commando, because the perks are easily interchangeable for bigger fights
---
That title...
---
I found it! Some of the areas are decent size too
---
When you spawn in at charleston. Run down the tracks. Then past the station on the right and the partially roo-inned building on the left. And keep running across the red bridge. Stop at the end of the bridge for a few seconds then head back across the bridge. Something should spawn at that building. 
---
It could be a man scared of a chicken. it could be an eyeboy walking it's pack of dogs/rats. it could be some level 5 super mutants. Or a Mothman. 
---
Or a Vendor Bot Responder who sells a couple of rare outfits and plans
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vendor_bot_Responder_(random_encounter)
---
If you swap to a different character and go back to it it can have different  items BUT only if someone keeps it there. If nobody is there is just goes away. It might be a few minutes based on observations of other randmo encounters. It seems like as long as someone is there it will stay indefinitely. So far 3 hours is the longest i've done.
---
Fallout parodies itself
---
I’ve found if you watch the rotating item, it’s choppy, but when it spins smoothly then you’ll be able to set the price and have it accept in.  It just needs a second
---
can I have tea with that?  Oh your out of cake? uhhhhh.. chicken, please!,
---
You guys need to learn how to reply to the same comment.
---
_The presidential debate happens here!_
---
Well yeah, you're the mayor now!
---
I end up doing that way more than I would like to. I can dish out some serious hurt to the imposter so I’m better suited to that, but if no one else is taking a pylon I’ll go for it myself, even though I’m really not built for it at all.
---
Long before mate.
---
Did you do the mayor's quest? During it, the assistant says the robots shouldn't be hostile to you any more since you're the mayor now. I dont know how long that lasts though
---
Crimson flux and ultracite are relatively common and cheap to get though. And for most high leveled monsters (lvl 80 legendary scorchbeast) it take some 10-20 bullets to kill (a second or two).
---
To be honest, my biggest frustration with the system is Gunpowder being in MISC instead of JUNK. And not being able to drop keys. They always respawn anyway.
---
I discovered this the hard way after noticing I have over 30 Hornwright Alpha and Beta keys (not stacked, but singles of each) in MISC from some Ash Heap event I came across a lot during the Moleminer pail event. \*&amp;$@
---
I mean I did say seedy...
---
heya Mayor agentpix
---
Really? I don't recall doing that quest. Up until wastlanders all the bots still attacked me.
---
No.. not they're not. I'll give you 500 caps for them both. 
---
I kid i kid.
---
Blue can go for about 3k. 
---
You cannot sell red for caps as cap limit is 30k and it's worth easily double that. EASILY! I mean you could take caps and split them across 4 or 5 characters. You could trade that for some sexy guns/armour. Or wear it. I want mine to wear.
---
If they gave it a suppressor it would instantly become extremely popular. It has a solid base damage and very high fire rate. Problem is everyone is a stealth commando now so they don’t bother with it. It’s a very solid gun but that’s why it’s not popular.
---
I still want it
---
Except heavy guns can do that easily with no vats needed so no difference at all :) endgame wise you pretty much demolish anything just boils down to vats or no vats with what play style you want. I love the feel of the heavy gun but totally agree with pa bing a bit hit or miss. It feels pretty limited sometimes with carrying weight where if I was on normal armour you could can pretty much carry whatever with all the perks on armour.
---
I think I’d rather see what the end up doing with Legendary Perks since they are currently re-working them before deciding if any additional SPECIAL points are needed.
---
Oooof bad shout going for the annual fee!
---
Don’t get fooled by the ‘generosity’. Before Beth nerfed gifts so there’s no more scrips, dupers didn’t just walk around hand out thousands of free gifts. Don’t get me wrong it’s still a nice thing for them to do for new players, but it only happened after they could no longer get scrips out of them.
---
I've only ever found 6 in a bunch. This is a threat to my safety.
---
...I'm bringing the shootgun.
---
Dont skip convo lines.
---
Interesting. I'll try the discord trading. Might be able to bag myself a explosive fixer. Woohoo
---
Probably because the humans don't have the script that makes them frenzy, since they were added after the grenades.
---
I have built entire cities in FO4, the fact that noone ever saw them (save for some posts i made) never made the endeavor "pointless" to me, i build for the sake of building, so a larger camp area and budget would be a massive draw for me, the fact that this is not the case, is part of the reason i don't sub personally.
---
That’s true someone normally does have a fo1st tent up, someone still had to get it though. I’m not saying it’s some kind of tactic they’re using to get more people to sign up, just that it is another incentive for people to get it. Even if it wasn’t their intention, in situations like this it is infinitely more useful
---
datamines say heavy
---
random redditors say sturdy
---
but only mothman knows the real weight
---
Only for Raider chest pieces does Pocketed give 15. For all other armor types it correctly adds 5.
---
What lvl. 35 or 45?   Not sure what mods I have for it so I was going to build and find out.
---
45 if that’s okay
---
Ask Regs....
---
I would put my money on this. Such a Bethesda thing to do
---
Does it work with friendly fire?
---
Haha yeah,  explain that “mutation”
---
That mirelurk king noise gets me.
---
All C.A.M.P. NPC's need like a 5 minute cooldown between random dialog plays.
---
Winning is nice, does it happen regularly? No.
---
I prefer consistent XP gain versus trying to play Rambo with these pitiful PvP conditions. 
---
I see no reason to queue solo:
---
That’s 3 more guys against you.
---
If on the off hand chance the guys I autofill with are good then I benefit. If they’re lucky, I benefit.
---
So camp it is 🙂
---
Make sure to put out the Pepperoni Rolls and Mountain Dew for the Mothman tonight!
---
How long does the pepperoni roll last? I’ve been carrying one around for a while and didn’t realize it added carry weight
---
Not worth. Heavy weapons are not meant to be used in VATS. Keep Per at 3 for lockpicking swap and run glowsight 3
---
You’d look like Joe Dirt after the septic tank scene lmao “I got the poo on me!!”
---
I have a number of perk loadouts, which I pretty much put together using Nukes and Dragons. I guess I mostly veer towards the ease of using a shotgun for my roaming around, exploring, doing dailies. I have other loadouts for fixing, crafting, being in power armour etc..
---
For max damage (SBQ fights mostly) I go to my minigun, LMG and 50cal, I have perks associated with that for that loadout. So I don't actually want MAX damage from my shotgun I want something I can use to make my day to day less of stress/struggle (level 199 by the by), I still need to have perks allocated for carrying stuff, for hacking, picklocks, gathering etc etc. The point of that loadout is not to have to switch it out everytime I have to fight something.
---
My main issue is that I expected a Gauss shotgun would actually be at least an improvement on my current  combat shotgun, maybe 1-2 shots on a Yai Guai rather than the 2-4 it takes me now, instead now with the Gauss it takes me 5-7, getting killed in the process.
---
I also shouldn't have to resort to a freaking Bloodied Shotgunner build (as directed upthread) in order to make the Gauss usable, I don't care for the glass cannon builds, there is more than one way of playing this game. I mean I know it's a popular style, but it can't be the only viable one.
---
In any case I've just finished testing with skeet with explosive added onto my roaming profile and they hardly made a difference to how my Gauss damages, skeet definitely helped with hits though 100%. If only the damage was better.
---
Next option is to keep re-crafting until maybe the roll gets better?
---
Bethesda has stated in the PTS forums that it lacks an armor type in regards to legendary perks.
---
This is again completely false I have had Sbq land right on top of v9 inside the fence area and seen her land a glitch right through my tent so... placement of tents also has no affect on her landing either
---
idk.... its built really good. but...poor sofia :/
---
Pretty sure this got reverted recently. At least, they removed the new fire damage from the flamer.
---
As a 1st user I really just want to see our Camp budget increased. I mean I have a modest camp, nothing huge and my budget is always near or maxed out. The moment you try to add some decorations or items to personalize things a bit...BAM, it's exceeded. I mean why keep buying things in the Atom Shop if I can't even place them well without having to remove yet another item in the shop I previously purchased. They are going to have to do something soon if they hope to keep selling stuff. No one is going to keep buying stuff they can't place.
---
I think the Cranberry Bog has its appeal.  I like about it is that it feels a bit richer in terms of wild life and battles.  It feels like a warzone a bit more than even the Savage Divide because of the abundance of Scorchbeasts.
---
I personally feel the weakest region by far is the Toxic Valley.  I don't know how much has changed with Wastelanders, but I'm wiling to bet it's still woefully underused and overall just kinda wasted potential.  Even the environment of the Toxic Valley just looks really rough, and ugly from a design perspective.  Ash Heap is a similar environment, but Ash Heap manages to look appealing because it looks like hell on earth at times and just like a desolate wasteland in the same vein as Fallout 3 or something.  Toxic Valley is just like a barren landscape without many remarkable landmarks, it's like if the Capital Wasteland only had 2 or 3 interesting locations in total.
---
This is the problem with making purchases at the gold bullion purchasing area a lot of these things are nondescriptive and not as well thought out as I thought they should be considering the amount of experience Bethesda now has with this game, as we do too. it appears as though each department does its own thing without the proper collaboration to implement these changes. if my change is going in a different direction than yours no it's not going to work.
---
If you can't find a mothman for verification (they can be elusive mofos) I'd trust the datamine info.
---
Definitely want the fast travel mat! Games would be  fun too, I'd like the darts board to work properly. Maybe have it work like dross toss where you grab darts from the board then grenade throw the darts at the board. If it popped up with your score and if you beat the camp owners score? Even better
---
Ohhhh riiiight, is that really a thing?
---
I use a anti armor gauss shot gun with limb damage I literally one shot every thing here a tip from a veteran player to a sound like only couple hundred hour player shotguns do insane damage and accuracy in vats pair it with gun fu and grim reapers spree you'll out damage all of tour heavies,
---
If you place it over the forest when you target the scorched queen you can get a collosus to spawn in there. After killing the queen just head to the forest every 15 minutes or so and see if one spawns. That's all I do now.
---
She gets what she deserves!
---
The eldirtch horror in lucky hole mine has eaten there souls
---
Old guy in overalls and patrolman sunglasses
---
Ok, thank you so much!
---
I hate mirelurk king the most
---
Not ture I have solod the queen from on top of my tent and the only time I got down was when she landed so explained how something that's not ture is common knowledge
---
Did not skip anything
---
Increased camp area should be just as easy as adding crap to the shop. If it's not then the code truly is a mess.
---
Yeah, I spent like two hours server hopping at marigold pavilion. This grind is insane.
---
Cheers for the answer.
---
&gt;To mitigate the dumbass missfire I just jump before I enter VATS. For some reason this is always a 100% hit. 
---
I'll have to try this. Oddly enough, I have to jump before some vendor bots are able to trade, so I wonder if that bug is related somehow.
---
That's what I did. I honestly stopped looting anything but legendary since my stash is so full.
---
I remember running for my life absolutely terrified every time I'd encounter a Deathclaw in the Capital Wasteland. And don't even get me started on that pack that hangs out in the quarry (or mine or whatever it was) in New Vegas. Fuck.
---
Yeah i used a bow an arrow on my 2nd char and they only took 3-4 shots each. They're so bad compared to Fallout 3 where I would actually run from them
---
It has to be account wide, since I assume you can spend Atoms to progress through it more quickly, and Atoms are account wide.
---
Drop all your notes, you dont need them
---
How do you do that? Just delete the blueprint?
---
No everyone on here and in game that says this are 100 percent wrong I have already commended on at least 5 of these post.
---
I have solod SBQ from on top of my tent and only time I get down is when she lands and have also see her land on top of v9 inside the fence. Its al just random AI code and as we all know it can be super glitchy being on the ground or raise has absolutely no correlation to her landing whatsoever
---
I don't have any. Displaying the vendor plans seams to be the issue.
---
What they need is “golden” perk points. After level 50 you start to get them every 5 levels. At level 55 you’d have one golden perk point, level 60, 2 etc. But the difference being golden perk points can be moved around at will. You can’t go over the normal levels, but you can respec any which way at any time for nothing. So say with 10 golden perk points you can move 10 points from luck to INT. Then from INT to STR. This will give higher level players a ton of flexibility and increase the grind. If I could go from commando to heavy to melee to pistol whenever I want, it’d be amazing. It gives me something to do and want to collect every good gun I could find...no more dumping crazy 2525 pistols.
---
Actually they advertised fallout 1st exclusive items AND sales on atom shop.
---
Too many people say this but dont end their subscription. I stopped caring. They'll only truly listen if YOU STOP PAYING THEM
---
Saying that. Shouldn't repair kits and scrap boxes be account wide as they require atoms to purchase.
---
Ah, limb damage, the *magic* words so to speak. 
---
I'm still not sure about whether the magic effects are real, but something that I'll need to test!
---
I love this thread. We should get a percent off all atom store items across the board. We should get (everyone should) a higher storage capacity! Hell double it. How hard is it to change that number in the code.  Easy as typing this message. Just do it. And give us some more 1st loot. Maybe a Vault 1 outfits and some other skins. Maybe a vault door for our CAMPs. Maybe some other stuff that says,”these guys are serious and we should show our appreciation.”  
---
It doesn’t have to be game breaking. But if we got those things more people would be like, “I want 1st so I can store double or have that item!” 
---
Love us like we love you Bethesda! We are your fans!
---
Could be like horses in ESO can deploy and dismount pretty quickly. Though with a bike you can't give it its own so like a horse but it would be really cool alternative to fast travel and you could run into people on the roads more often and just do like a bunny hop to get over the broken parts in the road. Customise gears and tires for speed and off road options and a few basic paints you can learn from plans and a ton of atomic shop skins would be awesome
---
https://tenor.com/MJ9U.gif
---
It just works, Belizarius. It just works.
---
I just vats legs and call it a day since nothing can kill you if it can't walk
---
Yes it’s been stated as such.
---
Yeah the leg parts of the animations really weird me out.  Main reason I made the post, I wanted to debate using T51-b on one of my characters but seeing the animation turned me off from it.
---
Yeah and I get downvoted for poking fun at the quote “16x the detail!”
---
This
---
Its permanent.
---
Yeah hopefully not.. I think it was a pittance...like less than a travel fee just so people would not switch take a shot, switch, take a shot, switch take a shot and make it too taxing on the whole system.  Honestly I have no great source or even remember where I heard it...just on some video so I wouldn’t give it much thought.  I made the comment myself thinking if people responded saying yes then I must have heard it right, (or possibly), and if like you they had not heard it then I was probably wrong or heard the wrong thing.
---
I think there’s a mining hat as well. Slightly different than mining helmet
---
Very good answer! I love the logic!
---
Today I learned
---
One would assume consumables, bullion, scrip earned will be on the character. Atom store skins will be account wide. 
---
But i guess we will find out.
---
My next project is going to be a movie theater. I'm hoping to figure out a way of having levels of seats that aren't a full wall's height apart, and to have Beckett in a ticket booth. Feel free to use that idea if ya want? Best of luck either way. 👍
---
I know theres an old timey mining helmet, but it cant be modified.
---
They were pretty freaking scary when i was lower level
---
I suppose with Wastelanders I get that. But in the original release we didn't have dialogue at all. People just talked *at* us and it was really weird. Is that honestly better than having a voiced protagonist?
---
That's a genuine question, because I'm not sure. I personally think it's a bit worse, but I'm interested in what others think.
---
Getting buffed to 10% with patch 20 iirc
---
Some rewards aren't just skins. They are camp items.
---
Just tried to to SBQ and I don't know who wasn't shooting at her I turned up late thought they'd already got her down one health bar, hope had to pull out the bloodied lmg just to put a dent in her 3 mins left and her health regenerated ..... Nope sorry I'm out not wasting any more ammo either she was tanked up or none else was shooting her
---
I'm not sure what you're talking about. I shit my pants when I decide to fuck with a deathclaw and it comes to run my fade even though I don't think it'll notice.
---
The flamethrower trick works for way more than this too. Can’t put that roof piece there because it says the half wall is in the way? Destroy the half wall with the flamethrower, place the roof, repair all. Same for merging objects.
---
&gt; wet heavy slapping sounds
---
Why you gotta say it like that.
---
I'm on console but I feel you are right. I think FPS was dropped slightly to fix bugs.
---
I am pretty sure it's other people ruining the game. I feel very strongly that Fallout was meant to be single player, all you other people with your own goals are terribly confusing to me.
---
I've found about 9 forest and 12 blue and no reds, gives you an idea lol
---
I don't know if you're aware of magic/broken weapons, there's a few discussions on here around them, but if all the raving about how great the Gauss Shotgun is, is just the magic shotgun effect, then that makes a lot of sense, and means I really don't have a problem.
---
Back to the reroll. :)
---
The worst is when you take all the pylons and the three or four other people don't even attack the imposter, they just focus on the adds. If I'm taking the pylons and there are other players there, they better at least kill her quickly. I don't enjoy soloing the event with other people not helping at all but getting the rewards.
---
*She's
---
Buy plans. There's hundreds of them. I try not to let myself get to far above 20k caps
---
I just keep spending mine on plans and recipes I don't know yet, serums etc 
---
I still have shit loads to buy until I can make everything in the game. Understand what you mean about not much to do, just events and dailies really.
---
To be honest ive got about 900 hours in with shotguns and ive only found them useful if they had bonus limb damage or explosive but both of those suck outside of vats
---
"From a design standpoint" it is trivial to allow you to have a seperate camp on a private server.
---
That and the new lighting that came with Wastelanders as well.
---
I have 4 established characters. Main is nearly level 300, the 3 alts are all somewhere between lvl 110 and 150. Trick is to make a new build or gimmick and try and switch up your playstyle. Currently playing on my melee berserker build, since I was getting bored of my bloody commando.
---
I have a bloody explosive and it has 260 damage plus explosive effect
---
215, 75 and 45, but I will probably only play with 215 one, because rep grind is not something I am planning to do again.
---
Yup, but it is pretty nice. 
---
Lighting of sorts: the Secret Service Helmet flashlight! Wow! It's amazing! No more grungy green half lit glow from the pipboy light. Feels like a true almost LED torch.
---
I'm on medication and in therapy, boo boo. 👍
---
Is there a reason you have commando? I didn't think it stacked with heavy weapons? Other than that I like the build. 
---
When I get my hands on a sensible JUnkie handmade I'll be doing the same, armor wise I suppose you can either stick with Uny stuff and low healt, roll SS or go vanguards are probably your options.
---
commenting to follow this post. i have been wondering the same thing.
---
I have 2 so far. The first build from hell, and the correction build just in case
---
Okay, so it's not just me then.
---
Mole Rat Chunks give +1 Strength too
---
I have 3 toons.. 2 are over lvl 100 the other is a freshie under lvl50
---
Not that I’m disagreeing at all, but the Scrapbox more than doubled my storage when I signed up for 1st and moved my junk over. It’s a little annoying you can’t put bulked stuff in but it’s literally limitless.
---
Do you scrip weapons as well?  Buy serum plans.  Shop at other vendors.  Do the encyptied event.  It is true there isnt alot of cap sinks in game but there are something to get rid of caps on.
---
Serum recipes, all the plans, etc. But yeah there's a lot that needs to be revamped with this game. Some people don't play as long as they want because they hit max caps, etc, so quickly.
---
I would be very surprised if it doesn't come back in some form. It shouldn't be too hard to take it and make it a rotating dungeon that one to four players can do. I doubt we'll ever see raids again though. Bethesda seems to be keen on taking the lowest common denominator approach to content and people flock to the easy stuff like Uranium Fever or Fashnacht and won't touch stuff like Project Paradise or Uranium Fever with a ten foot pole.
---
I mean I’ve seen the queen and sheep go down quick, but never in one shot. And buying the card for a nuke? You know you can get those for free, right?
---
Trickle That Shit Down Yo
---
The queen lands if I'm/someone else is standing on the fence or on a Fallout Worst tent every time; she doesn't seem to land if staggered during her landing animation. There are always people up high and she always intermittently lands.
---
Yeah that is what they said.
---
I agree. Nearly every time it hits, it's repeatable in very specific spots and/or direction. FPS tanks and system fans go nuts.
---
They were really scary in FO3. There is nothing in 76 that’s worth hiding from. Another beast was the cazador in New Vegas right when you try to leave spawn.
---
Just because you’re unhappy with your checkout lanes at Walmart doesn’t mean you’re going to shop at Target.
---
They have suuuuuuuuch a huge opportunity for this. Keep the weak as shit deathclaws, but give then lore! 
---
They're pre war experimenta, so why not add some new deathclaw variants? The quest could start by you investigating dead Claws, as they've been turning up dead a lot more often. It could all revolve around a sort of conservation effort, with the WV Claws being a capable apex predator that keeps the ecosystem in near balance, but new, more dangerous variants have to be hunted down and killed before they destroy ours. 
---
Even better, Fallout 4 showed us Deathclaws aren't just mindless killing machines, but they are likely sentient (before anyone questions that, look up sentience. I was using the wrong definition for YEARS, and I'm a zoology student) and one becomes none hostile when you return its egg. You could end the quest by obtaining either an allied Deathclaw to defend your CAMP, or a baby runt to act as a pet.
---
As for the variants, that could be a load of fun. Maybe even the Sheepsquach is actually a prototype using a different combination of animals. Also would allow the reuse of the gatorclaws, wooly Deathclaws, maybe even a flying one that looks like a mid stage between them and Scorchbeasts.
---
I had one, I’ll have to check later, I’m at work. I think I got it by killing a vengeful moth man.
---
Forgot to change it to Glow sight
---
Just finished this one successfully for the first time. Chinese stealth build so I was able to run all three pylons for long enough to allow the others to take out the Squatch. Burned through about 15 stimpacks. Got a few good shots on it in the process but was dead upon the victory and when i was finally able to spawn back there was no Squatch body to collect from. Thought I hit it enough but guess not. Still nice to finally compete the challenge.
---
Question I have is in regards to being the pylon dummy and trying to withstand the massive health drain. Can you perk this down to a less damaging  amount or is that part set? Would be good to know heading into the next one.
---
It looks great, for sure. Just gonna have to enjoy this one with low frames I suppose. First world problems, I know.
---
You get them from hostile Mothman enemies.
---
I've found that you have to be very fast when looting hostile Mothman enemies. If you looting them whilst they are in their dying animation, before the turn to an ash/goo pile, then you can get wings. I'm not sure if that's just random number generation or what though.
---
It really is. Honestly I’d probably pay a monthly fee just for the box.
---
Oh how many times my buddies and I have said that while playing this game 😂😂
---
Ah, that makes more sense yeah.
---
Mutation serums, power armor plans like calibrated shocks and emergency protocol, gold bullion weapons n armors
---
U can try to play different build, use different weapons, play in different styles
---
Y’all betta enjoy it before they bring back the cazadors. Anyone with fallout NV experience knows wtf these were
---
just the one i started with last June. i did make another character at one point thinking i would restart and pay more attention to perk allocation, but i changed my mind and stuck with my girl, Rosie.
---
I have my main, 3 mules and one Green Arrow to character I just started
---
I don't intend to go crazy getting stuff my any alts I make, I'd rather put my profits towards making my main more powerful
---
The new split in the Wastelanders story is the only thing I've found that made me want to make an alt, but I have a feeling there will be more stuff like that
---
The other stuff you mentioned is manageable
---
If you make a throwaway alt and do the mistress of mystery quest on it, after you finish you can get the equipment transferred to your main character
---
For the unwanted perks, they will be used in the new legendary perk system, you basically trade unwanted cards to level up your legendary perk cards
---
I have only one. I’m 137. I totally understand the appeal of more than one character, but I like the long haul.
---
I'd love to have a daily challenge that involves clearing out a giant deathclaw den that scales to level. My bloody mole miner gauntlet one shots them as is, so some challenge would be nice.
---
Don't leave them in your vendors, or block your vendors off. Even powered off, they can still sell items.
---
Junkie go vanguard
---
Can you please post pics of this when you do? If it stick in your mind PM them to me if possible. Great idea.
---
The only enemy I avoided in every edition of Fallout, still can hear that buzzing sound. You could just never justify a fight with them.
---
I run a double stack of naked and afraid for a stealth build
---
Yeah I feel similarly. I'm all dressed up with these godly weapons and armor, with nowhere to go.
---
I can’t find mothman a anywhere
---
I usually just stand and do Thumbs down or Angry emote to guys sitting on the bunker and endlessly firing and staggering the SBQ, so she doesn't land, but after maybe 10 minutes she finally lands I start to shot. And guys are 100+ lvl... Jezz... So much ammo and time wasting. I don't mind wasting 500-1000 5mm on her every time, when she lands, but the time I have to waste, because of such ppl... I tried to do stupidly the same thing they do, but then that's 2000-4000 5mm rounds wasted on the event and that is just stupid, when it can be done faster and more ammo efficient if you just don't stagger her and stand in the open.
---
Ever though about being along side a railroad track? Maybe make a Responders Station?
---
One character at level 73 from early in games life. Came back after wastelanders and started again to experience all the best content progressively, am now level 156. 
---
I’m currently running out of things to do myself honestly. I mean there’s lots of small goals and things to do if you’re into it, but with no real quests/missions to do I understand why people get bored later on as I feel I’ll reach that point pretty soon. 
---
Currently I spend my time farming mats and doing daily stuff, grinding for the bullion items and doing silo runs/encryptid/paradise for plans I want. 
---
It’s entertaining to me so far but it’s no replacement for actual in game goals and new quests etc. I was hoping I would be able to hold out longer before completing everything but with lockdown I’ve had more time and ground harder. 
---
I was hoping update 20 would add more but it’s looking like a lot of content is gonna be held back compared to what I expected, so it may be a case of putting the game down and moving on for a while. 
---
I understand why some people are happy just logging in and wandering and creating their own goals, but there’s definitely a long term deficit in real content, which I always find odd in games such as this where the long term players are broadly speaking the payers and contributors yet are left just creating their own content longer term for all their effort.
---
Help low level players.
---
I've been trying out different characters. One is level 100, which is a Bow/Crossbow build. The others I've tried so far is Power Armour/Heavy Weapons, and my third is an Unarmed build.
---
I'll be trying out Shotgun, Rifle and One handed melee builds next.
---
You may want to contact Bethesda because you said that a lot of you paid the years options which was $99.  That would be a little more than $8/month but went on to intimate that you have paid over $14/ month as if you paid monthly.  I realize this is not your point, but just stick to being honest about your personal experience and your argument will be much more effective.  Otherwise people can feel like the whole thing is exaggerated.  As I read back my post sounds super bitchy lol.  I don’t mean it that way, I just don’t know how else to word it.  
---
We have gotten discounts through being given more atoms than paid for, and some free items on the atomic shop, etc...  
---
I think we definitely have more space to build in a private world as no one else’s camp is in that world so you can pretty much build anywhere unrestricted. But you make a good point about camp size as I don’t think that has increased.  Not sure if they said that was coming year one but I will look that up because you are right about that.
---
Either way i don’t think people believe that those who complain are entitled per say.  There is always valid constructive criticism, etc...  some of us have just been around a long time, long enough to know when we turn on the TV and they are advertising, “the last knife we’ll ever buy,” that it’s doubtful that’s true...but it looks like a decent knife.  I wish it were different but you are talking about advertising that has been this way since the 1960s.  Best thing for Bethesda to do in the future is be super careful about how they word things and not tell anyone about things they are “thinking” about doing or saying things like “we may get” or “we are looking forward to” or “we want to,” etc...  for folks like me I like that because it is exciting and I hear about a possibility in my mind, not a promise.  Even if I paid for it, like buying any subscription, I am paying for what exists now.  It may or may not change, so I have to consider that.  If it is not worth it to me before that change I will hold out until I see that change in action and can buy my year then.
---
Dude ima be real I think it’s just where you need. Sounds weird but when I “teleport” I end up at The places I need the most. My heart desires some places and I end up there. Whether it’s with my boys for Alone at a party. My heart travels me when I’m “teleporting”.
---
It depends as if you can get a steady scourse of copper then Ivwould say yes, but if not I would say no
---
understandable.. though main reason why id want to be able to craft them too is so we can also get ones from the other PA sets. like T65 and Strangler heart
---
Same, was a great way to stock up on acid.
---
You can burn through 5k ammo withing 2-3 hours if you're fighting high PvP mobs and doing nuke zones frequently. As long as you have a decent affinity for grabbing lead items though you should be able to sustain your usage.
---
I'm just over in the corner in Ultracet power armor like, "hah, energy damage"
---
It’s Atomic Shop only. Luckily for you, since the Fourth is only a few weeks away, it’ll probably be put back in the shop on Tuesday or something.
---
No ammo place will produce 2mm
---
Try sneaking into cultist camps at night. There's a chance you'll find them worshipping a Mothman
---
I’ve been wanting that too. Think it was Atom shop buy a while ago.  It’d make awesome part of a 4th of July bundle.
---
if copper is the only issue then I guess i’ll have a look around to see if I can produce it at the rate i make lead and steal for ammo. Do you know if the armco ammunition plant makes 2mm EC’s relatively fast or not?
---
Do you know of some mothman camps
---
What is this quest how do I do it
---
Am I delusional for saying nobody **should** have brought that shit since the beginning
---
if the pre-made blueprint is in the stored section it will give you an option to break it apart/delete it. doing so with custom made blueprints will just delete them, since they are plans for custom camp builds
---
Re-release, you can bet on it.
---
\*cough\**Skyrim and GTA V*\*cought\*
---
Remaster and optimization, not likely. Unless it's lighting and higher res textures. That's as far as Bethesda remasters.
---
Would perks need to change?
---
I hope with the leveling update they make deathclaws and scorchbeasts harder and mirelurk hunters, and every fucking bug easier
---
Ah thanks, kinda sucks that the munition plant is gunna be mostly useless when i get it but also good to know I can use one of the cool new gauss weapons without ammo troubles.
---
thanks for the help wastelander!
---
You posted this 4 times
---
Buy a mutation serum recipie from modus
---
they are around 22k full price, 17k w/ hard bargain3, grape mentats, an a CHR boosting alcohol.
---
Go to Solomon's Pond for all your copper needs. And the ammo machine doesn't produce 2mm
---
He means the card for the imposter event
---
I highly suggest excavator pa and hitting lucky hole mine once a day for that 1k lead
---
So according to another thread:
---
*The magic shotgun perks are: Instigating, Junkies OR most with Limb Damage, +33 VATS or Bashing damage. This only works in vats. One shot kills in vats though.*
---
My two combat shotguns *do* have one of those effects each, so it may be that I'm using broken/magic weapons, and expecting a Gauss non-magic weapon to compare. 
---
Which it can't. 
---
I think the same effects apply to Gauss Shotguns, I've just got a dud roll.
---
Persistent workshops exist on private if you log back on within about 10-15 minutes...at least they always have for me.  Longer than that and you may get a new private world.  When you log back in you will not see your workshop...it will look as if you do not have it.  Travel there or just wait and you will see it.  Takes longer to load than most anything else I have noticed.
---
ah ok, thanks for the info!
---
And a reduced trigger range. Could be at far side of my base and gramps starts giving off about the communists
---
Hayleeeeee can you heaaaarrr meeeee
---
fck you automod, the post was fine.
---
That's literally what it means....
---
is there anywhere i can go for the acid to smelt up the lead after the run?
---
I used the one in The Mire. A place called Moth-Home.
---
She's just not that into you bro.
---
It's even worse with events like Uranium Fever and One Violent Night. The legendaries are usually killed before I even see them on my screen most of the time. Definitely bums me out when people aren't considerate of others.
---
More than likely a dud roll ive got a bunch of those
---
Theres the secret service helmet. It cant be customized but has a bright torch
---
It's me, the real hayleeland.
---
I have a secret to tell you.
---
There will be absolutely zero consequence in your life to missing a little but of gold and scrip.
---
Crazy right?!
---
Id suggest taking over hemlock holes I think thats the settlement name. It builds acid up pretty fast.
---
I have 3 at the moment. My main is a junkies heavy gunner, but right now I'm mostly playing with my new berserker commando. I've got a level 2 mule rolling armor for the berserker right now, but eventually I plan to turn her into a vampire vanguard build.
---
Well they are fucking you out of the thing you already bought. Probs some laws that protect you from businesses doing this to you
---
Whatever you say mister marketing degree
---
Standing on stuff has nothing to do with it....
---
oh alright, thanks again for the help. i’m off to continue my heavy weapon adventure.
---
Not to mention that the only Fallout first content we have gotten is one outift and a million skins for it, a few tent skins and a few ugly armor skins. I got better stuff for free linking my twitch account to my Bethesda account.
---
Huh. Too bad theres no proof about this being a thing. Just did sbq on a private, all 8 of us were on top of tents, landed more times than ive ever seen
---
That's perfect. Now I gotta do the missions to unlock it.
---
Tanagra town crickets, average between 25-90 acid a run depending, and you can server hop it. Also if you can be bothered there’s a load of snallygasters at the abandoned train yard in cranberry bog, and a couple more spawn just south of hemlock holes. A round trip can net you a tidy sum and if you revisit whilst going about your business or server hopping you can get all you need for days in a few hours.
---
The event is very buggy, one problem I always notice is my health bar never properly displays my health. Only the health bar that's next to my name when in a team will display it. The problem with this event is the players. I often find players becoming a conduit for the pylon and dying in like 10 seconds. Which makes me wonder why you would try and tank the pylon when we all know it's just going to waste the precious time. Personally I can do this event with 1 other player. Only problem I run into when trying to solo it, is the imposter will constantly stagger me causing me not to be able to shoot. Very hard event but very rewarding in terms of loot potential. If anyone ever wants help with this event just message me!
---
I have my main 298 heavy vampire build and a 75 pick up whatever commando.  I found a nice DCG for junkies that I plan to use on my third alt but once I start playing my main I'm usually to lazy to switch over.
---
I'd probably ditch Nerd Rage, but that's because I run a high health junkies heavy.
---
I have doubts, perhaps a blood and tissue sample is in order
---
Bethesda engaging in false advertising? Who'd have thought! :o
---
Fuckin way she goes bud
---
The FO 1st price is a fucking joke anyway. World of Warcraft is practically the same price and it has AT LEAST 10x the amount of content. Why they charge so much is beyond me, but people seem to buy it so..
---
Thats exactly the problem...
---
so i could do this while using acid extractors at a claimed hemlock holes and net myself a ton of acid? brilliant! guess i’ll stick up on a lot so i don’t have to go out and farm it often then.
---
I approve this message.
---
Very occasionally I will log into the private server and take workshops to farm. Very rarely since they still crash and you can lost everything
---
The Cult of the Mothman make me wonder if Mothman represents RNG, and the cult is us.
---
Praise be the RNG.  
---
Holy RNG, take me.  
---
The divine Roll... I can see it.
---
The clean version is sold at the tadpole vending machine
---
I'd love to have Frederick come back (I don't think his fate is ever revealed) to try to rebuild the Order as a new menace looms over Appalachia that neither the settlers or raiders can handle. 
---
Maybe some military deserters with power armour and robots who extort and brutalise the newcomers to Appalachia under the guise of being the remaining US government. A good excuse to bring out the Voice of Set too! 
---
Of course, there has to be unique hammy comic book dialogue option and Cryptos giving out radiant quests. I was always a little surprised it didn't.
---
&gt; and discounts on atom shop items
---
For the thousandth time, **discounts are there**, they’re just not obvious enough nor displayed as a F1st discount.
---
I recently transitioned to the Gauss Minigun. It is much much much easier to keep ammo if you Prime it. You can produce alot more, especially if you have ammosmith and super duper.
---
It’s a hit and miss, sometimes i got lucky and run into two in one night, sometimes all I encounter is bugs and robots. But it’s still fun compared to other mobs. I actually like the randomness of the encounters. OG Grove is the easiest for battle, the thing is so tall it always gets blocked/stuck behind trees, you can mow it down super fast. Same with the crater north of train elevator, it would walk around in the crater but won’t jump up or chase you, all you have to do is shooting down from the crater edge using some explosive heavy gun. The tougher one is to the west of US disposal site, the location is flat so it can actually chase you. It feels more like a real boss fight. I still chase the encounters whenever there’s a nuke zone.
---
Yeah just beware of PVP at the workshop. I’ve only took it over a handful of times public and it’s always been contested by PVP’ers with bloodied explosive gear. You can make more than enough just visiting the other places. I sell mass ammo in my vendors and it gets cleared out endlessly, but when I was running a .50 cal I could easily keep up with ammo demands doing queen fights etc without too much effort and sticking around 20k ammo crafted topped up as needed.
---
After over 5200 gold on ss armor and only 2 AP refresh uny pieces I can it's gonna be a long haul. I'm fine with just uny until then but there is no easy way to it. We're gonna have to be patient.
---
Well I do have a shrine and a church to him with some special punch in it, hopefully his holiness with bless me soon
---
good lol that's what you get for enabling bethesda to exclude broke/poor people from parts of the game that make the gameplay loop significantly more fun.
---
SS? what's that? I'm new here and I'm doing exactly the same but I already have the chest Regen thing I got it as a reward from some event is a one star but helps a lot, currently I'm at lvl 25 and mate how do you cope with broken gear so often?
---
Haha i know this pain.. Now amplify it by reading about the diminishing returns of DR/ER and realise why well-rolled non-SS armor pieces sell for such ridiculously high amounts. And then wonder why people are specifically going after certain armor types, like Scout or Raider. And then wonder why some are specifically looking for Light or Sturdy armor, instead of Heavy. And then wonder if it is because of legendary perks, and get confused cos they all appear to have the same bonus for matching sets. And then wonder if you actually really know anything at all about this game 😭🔫
---
Yeah, the amount of gold needed for everything I wanted was crazy, maxed out both groups a couple days ago so now I need even more gold to get more stuff too lol
---
Secret service armor, from wastelanders update
---
Kinda reminds me of how people bought the Titanfall making of package on Steam for a buck and expected it to be the game 'Titanfall' even though simple reading could've helped them to know what they're buying. Similar to here where people claim "Features were advertised!" even though its clearly shown that those are only plans for the future and no promise or ETA were given.
---
I'll happily share, if I ever pull the trigger. Problem is, I couldn't figure out how to get leveling that I wanted. I took a workshop just to have an area to test out what could be done, but gave up after a couple of hours. I'd also have to decide which of my characters camps to move (all of which I really like), or creating a new character (back to plan hunting 😖).
---
Yeah I decided to just go for the look and the legendary effects and anything else I no longer care about xD my current armor is such a mismatch to get just Uny ap that anything matching would be an upgrade haha
---
Scrapping beeswax also produces acid
---
So I think I remember reading something about that.  They took it off line because of an exploit with that one.  The rest should work.
---
Why do you regret bruh, hope you didn’t scrip your original set prior to SS?
---
Yup the allure of being able to craft the legendary item you want has definitely worn off since the RNG to get good rolls is so terrible.
---
I want samples of your blood and tissue too. Maybe you're really hayleeland in hiding. Any one of us could be hayleeland. Now I'm paranoid
---
I know that struggle. The main floors may be too large to properly get the seats but maybe if you built it into a hill?
---
There was a bug, visual, if you bought anything the balance showed correctly again.
---
No still have my set, just planning to replace as I go. But it's just taking so long with like no reward for my actions still. Like I'm not hard into 76, came back after wastrlanders after I got bored before. A lot more to the game than last time I was into it, but idk if it's worth the time investment
---
Fun fact mats will set a spawn point for your workshops ...it’s to prevent griefing in you camp and will never be changed from what it is now
---
Yah considering what i read in the patch notes i dont believe that its bugged i think they changed there minds after the fact
---
Glad you agree 👍
---
same here.  
---
just have to get close enough. fireproof helps but i always forget to equip it unless i'm hunting scorch bats.
---
It was my go-to weapon until earlier that day, when I found a very similar, but slightly higher rated version.  Glad you liked it.
---
If you need the favour returning sometime, just message me.
---
I started rolling for chests and told myself as long as I got a one star unyeilding I would be satisfied, it would work to replace the 2 star heavy BOS I have been using for a long time.
---
Rolled a one star unyeilding on the first try...was not satisfied lol.  I'm using it now but come on, seriously.
---
Thanks for the offer, but I've managed it now with Livid's help.
---
I approve your approval of the previous.
---
Now I'm picturing a Death law wearing a MAGA hat.  Thats scary. 
---
Make Appalachia Great Again!
---
I use a vampiric +50% limb damage combat shotgun and I can one hit kill Mr Gutsys with V.A.T.S.
---
5 , levels 358, 225, 207,185,&amp;164
---
Oh I’m doing the same, using the sets i put together before Wastelander and craft a few every now and then. There’s nothing to regret though, I’ve got other pieces that can be very useful such as Uny/WWR, Bolstering/AP, etc, and I’m keeping them just in case I try a different play style.
---
Ayo! Slut Dungeon! 
---
I'm not sure what it goes by now either. Like you said though, the layout isnt really true at all, which is fine since it's a video game. Sucks they couldn't have at least included Old Mountaineer field in between Woodburn and LSB.
---
Advertising something but not delivering on that advertisement is illegal it's called FALSE ADVERTISING. Those of us that paid for this should threaten a lawsuit that would probably get them off their asses.
---
https://youtu.be/P20cqyQs29c
---
&gt;biggest threat in the game
---
Mr. Gutsy would like a talk with you!
---
though seriously Gutsies, Assaultrons and floaters seem to be the most annoying enemies so far in the game
---
Me too! I keep going by the mansion hoping to see some new stuff but am always deeply disappointed.
---
A better love story than the notebook
---
Whoa, didn't realize how closely they modeled some of these sites
---
From the first announcement page: 
---
*"Private worlds will continue to evolve with new features such as expanded building areas, increased C.A.M.P. budgets and Workshop persistence. We’ve also received a lot of questions about playing Fallout 76 with mods and this, too, is something we’re excited to add to private worlds in the future."*
---
Evolve - develop gradually, especially from a simple to a more complex form.
---
Its been 9 months, no changes. At this point something should have "evolved".
---
 NO! I love talking shit to them as they are slaughtered at the hands of my mini gun after killing my NV courier one to many times!
---
Party Boy/Girl, Cola Perk and Nuka Dark, +6 Strength
---
There are 2 types of camp items. Atom store, which are account wide, and plan based which are character based. 
---
So the season rewards will one or the other. Hopefully the former.
---
That's exactly what I was thinking the only option would be. I'm scared to commit to the move. 🤣
---
Which was quickly ignored in favor of even more focus on GTAO.
---
Did you get the bunker tickets?if you didn't that makes sense I had to get them months in advance
---
Nerd rage and serendipity could change to another perks
---
High res textures would be awesome, as long as nothing else is broken.
---
Those are great pictures, thanks for sharing! Visiting West Virginia is on my bucket list thanks to this game.
---
Thank you! I'll give that a shot. Just junked most my haul. LoL
---
Its somehow a recurring meme from Bethesda to implement thousands of skins for unused weapons while giving next to none for many other weapons that get used by atleast some people
---
Well since the idea came from you I'll share what popped in my head. In the hills facing where the queen gets nuked. Make the screen wall a open square of those block lights (I did this facing the sunset over Watoga in a past build). Would be pretty cool as you could enjoy your popcorn as the bomb fell.
---
I feel you, one of my ap refresh is the chest which is great, but one limb is just a one star, I only have one poison resist, and most of my 3rd stars on the 3s are useless.
---
Hooooot
---
Lvl 200+ here buddy but when I see those little neon bubbly patches on the ground, l steer clear. Too much fight for not enough reward. And it's never just one, always seems to be three or more and they always gang up.
---
I only need one.
---
nah. the entire limb damage system is broken. if you watch closely there are several limb damage related bug affecting the game, for example right arms consistently break before any other armor because of npc targeting, and many weapons with bonus limb damage bug out and do a massive damage cascade. Bethesda really messed up limb damage.
---
Sounds good but still i want players to use normal weapons on death claws instead of overpowered guns
---
Hornwright keys, constant reminder to my impatience and not looking things up first. And the gunpowder is really annoying.
---
I really want to visit in the fall sometime! Such a beautiful area.
---
True enough, still doesn't pacify my annoyance at them no having a protected flag like some other less valuable Junk items.
---
You a dumb dense idiot dude
---
For Vendor bots, especially the one at the Whitespring Station, I have to hit R god knows how many times before the trade screen comes up. If I look to the left or the right of it before I hit R it works instantly.
---
The bugs in this game are just glorious.
---
Worked like a charm. Thanks!
---
I'd highly recommend it. I switched to junkies months ago from bloodied and I don't miss it at all. For amor you'll want van sent I guess if you're not using pa
---
That's awesome! Thanks. You did that all in a day trip?
---
There is protected junk?
---
Happy to help!
---
Limitbreaker, is that you?
---
Wow, this is really cool! I hadn’t realise how closely they modelled the interior of the Whitespring after the irl place.
---
Just two, second one is only level 22 and a mule more or less.
---
I just no longer bother with any of the grinding stuff, too demoralizing. I just play the game without worrying, works for me.
---
Its funny too how the laser mr gutsy is weak compared to the ballistic one. Even for them, laser weapons suck. Laser ones I can take on with a rolling pin but the ballistic ones, especially a group of them, I'll take the time to suit up in PA and bring out my heavy.
---
You have to prime it for it to be viable
---
“prime it”? you mean use it as the ultracite variant? doesn’t that cost flux?
---
Yeah but you get so much more ammo when you craft it and it does the most dmg
---
Ty
---
I appreciate the feedback.
---
Three main 110 170 270 and a couple of low in case I need them.
---
I'm using that perk. I've only noticed it work once.
---
Same. More often than not I say “Nope!” unless I’m feeling brave and have no important junk.
---
If they can’t give us at the very fucking least a mini-godzilla sized deathclaw then why the fuck did they make a Fallout mmo thing, bats?!
---
Awesome, congratulations. I’ve been holding off because the whole code breaking thing seems so overwhelming
---
I thought the end game was griefing other players?
---
I started after Wastelanders, only have the one and don't really see the need for a second right now. But I will make one eventually just so I can get the missing achievement, for siding with the Settlers in the heist
---
Power armor could use qol improvements and Legendary perks make the extra 42% damage reduced obsolete because there is a card that gives it's own damage reduction from ranged attacks
---
ok
---
Those subtitles come in really handy for spotting legendaries.
---
Haha, I like it. I'll take a look at the area when I'm on later. Thanks!
---
Slightly helpful that I learned is while she takes no damage you still hit her, so vampire weapons do still trigger
---
As an Eldritch Horror myself.....Nah, Interloper ain't got nothin' on me!
---
This was the solution, thank you very much !
---
I have 5 characters, respectively level 358, 140, 101, 61 and 20. I always play two of them on two separate accounts / consoles at the same time for various purposes.
---
Not....us
---
Its because they do this unique fire damage and nothing in game currently have this fire damaged resistance
---
the concept is great, and i’ll keep a note of that, but I don’t know if i’m up for getting that much stable crimson flux, especially with the rate that i’ve been told i’ll use the ammo at.
---
thanks for the advice tho! it’s going down with all the other notes.
---
If you need lots of cobalt flux, Morgantown is the place to nuke.
---
I remember by first encounter with a Charred Feral Ghoul as a lvl 23 and it 2-shot bitch slapped me into death with a heft dose of rads. It made me WANT to become higher level for no reason other than to kick that burnt motherfucker's ass for revenge, and lo and behold 40 levels later with a proper build, i love mowing Charred Ferals down, especially since they can still kick my ass so it still feels like an worthy challenge of spacing.
---
A few days ago, a newly made friend was struggling with the Savage Divide because the high level player traffic made everything lvl60+, so i guided him to where he needed to go as a bodyguard of sorts. It was kind of heartwarming.
---
*it just works*
---
You're welcome my friend.
---
That sucks. But why would you or anyone decide to spend money especially triple digit momey when it doesnt even offer the services it claims in the first place?
---
And poison ones as well they are deadly as they say in their name 🤣
---
I have 60% reduced weapon weight plus bear hands meaning my .50cal and miniguns weight laughable 0.5-2 lb. Then I have 90% reduced chem weight pack pack, ammo weight perk cards and 40% reduced ammo weight and I usually rock around 340 carryweight, and as soon as I step into power armor I hit like 650 or something and that means power armors are absolutely unusable junk. Not to mention my armor provides better DR and ER than any PA. (Though I need super low HP for +35 buffs to work, but I'm bloodied one hit built ATM so it's fine)   
---
I guess I should look into dumping 90% of my weapons, armor and ammo so I could try stealth suit but as sneak is anyways broken it's probably better to stick with mass hoarder bloodied built. I mean having 7 rifles, 20 heavy weapons and few pistols on me at all time is little ridiculous. Not to mention literally every clothing item in game. Then dozens of armor pieces.   
---
Previously food and cooking took huge amount of time and space on my gameplay, but now I only have light canned food and water. Not to mention luckily soon eating isn't needed at all. My normal game day was 1h hunting for food and cooking and 1h looting to fill my scrap box and then 1h doing some events. When updates come I can reduce play time to 1h (I mean it's already 2h as I quit using Fo1st because fuck Bethesda and their cashgrab lies about all benefits for Fo1st...)
---
Level 144 on PS4. I never really got around to getting a weapon that melts the Queen, so I have a FFR minigun that does ok. I just hate wasting ammo!
---
I hope so too. Because if they are character bound I will only focus on one character and probably never use the others ever again.
---
He obviously means the recall card, but there's nothing wrong with buying nuke cards. I'm a shotgun/melee build. I can't do shit to the Cargobot so I buy cards for reasonable prices
---
Alright, if you can keep up the flux it’s the best option
---
I don't think they make multiplayer online games that dont offer some kind of pay to enhance gameplay enjoyment options anymore?  
---
As for the rest of what you said, I don't think other games have scrape boxes you have to pay for unlimited storage in? Last I played like that was DCUO like 5+ years ago. You had to pay to use full storage...  
---
But hey, Thank you for the well thought out input and keeping it positive...
---
I really do, honestly.
---
https://www.pcgamer.com/how-to-unlock-your-framerate-in-fallout-76/
---
This may help, turn off vsync
---
The return of that vendor cash display but? Or was it never gone
---
Im tired of one shotting everything that snarls
---
I have thought about it, but I don't think it will get exactly what I want. I'm looking more for a Responders theme headquarters. Basically a main building for deployment along with two secondary buildings for medical and food.
---
This. 
---
Prime the gauss minigun. Better damage and better ammo per lead/steel ratio.
---
LOL! Could you imagine that as one of the SB/SBQ attacks?
---
it’s an amazing idea since i can get 108 rounds in a single craft, but I just don’t have the time to grind up that much crimson flux. i struggle getting the flux to build stuff like the shielding for my under armour and decon shower as is, let alone power armour mods.
---
It has almost as much defense then a PA.
---
It's cheaper monthly. And it makes the game actually playable.
---
We'll be that as it may.. It's a cheap and crappy way to keep people grinding. Content is king and that is not content. I mean they have so much lore and opportunity to make this king of all fallout. Sad really.
---
I would totally roleplay as a chef in a restaurant camp if food didn't expire and lose the Good With Salt perk effect when vendored.
---
Serve up a Seared Venison with Berries with a side of Cranberry Relish and a Blackberry Honey Crisp for dessert, courtesy of sou chef Faschnact Collectron. All washed down with a Rad Ant Lager. Give high level players who want food bonuses but can't be assed to cook due to not wanting to hunt for ingredients.
---
wat
---
That's just an alien, no two ways about it. Probably one that was injured in a crash, and modified its suit to be mobile again.
---
I usually go on a shopping spree to buy up any 50 cal available from other players’ vending machines. Sometimes I will buy plans. I definitely fast travel freely.
---
Side note ... Are your vending machines safely scrapped/stored or just powered off? People can still buy from vending machines without power. Electricity only advertises your camp on the map, doesn’t control sales.
---
Just buy the flux from someone off a market thread or discord. 
---
It’s anywhere from 150-200 for crimson, but that’s super worth it since 1 crimson crafts you like 100 rounds w/ ammosMoth and no super duper proc.  
---
It’s actually cheaper given the steel and lead you will save so you can sell that (or make 5.56 to sell)
---
You sound poor and broke. 
---
So why aren't you out making money instead of playing 76?
---
I mean it could be a little hub with a main station being the HQ and the other buildings on the other side. Could even try to make a bridge walkway over the tracks. 🤷‍♂️
---
The first time my mirelurk king pet attacked something with that scream of theirs at my camp, I screamed loud enough to scare my husband and dumped coffee all over myself. Not my best day...
---
This is why I don't sell armor to the machine.  I just sell 3 x 3\* and 2 x 2\* weapons.  Then you don't have to math gymnastics to figure out how to get all your daily scrip.
---
how much is the crimson flux? I don’t make a lot of caps, but I do make them steadily enough for most expenses.
---
That's one of those "magic shotguns." I have a level 35 one, and it wrecks almost everything.
---
She cannot land on the bunker, so if no one is in the open, she won't land - 100% fact. Also please read again, I mentioned staggering and that is also clearly visible, because SBQ has specific landing animation that is uninterruptible by staggering.
---
Both these actions lead to ammo and time waste, nothing else. Fact.
---
Oooooo
---
Or they could have just let us host our own servers on our own hardware and ideally given us a modding API, which I’m pretty sure is what everyone wanted / expected out of “private servers”.
---
I stopped rolling for SS armor pieces in favor of just wearing any lvl 45-50 armor with Unyielding + other desired effects. The Heavy/Sturdy raider arms actually look super badass with fist weapons and you should have enough passive damage mitigation (Serendipity + Scaly Skin + Grounded + Ironclad 5) to not really have to worry about armor defenses.
---
Give me your shit to free up space simple ...
---
lmao that good old late stage capitalist mentality that if anyone takes any time to rest their body and mind and do something they enjoy, it's their fault they're broke. Sick shit really. Y'all know Fallout is at it's core a parody of those mind sets and late stage capitalist society?
---
Overall, I believe the stats are higher, but given the rng, it's more of a project over time to complete.  Youll probably roll several if not hundreds of pieces to get what you want.
---
If you've already got a good set, the only piece that you should strongly consider is the torso piece for the jet pack.  That's really about it for unique properties unless you want to complete the full set.
---
IMO it's very worth it especially for the jetpack! So fun! Also has the best defense of any non PA. For my main (bloodied rifleman) there wasn't much else worth getting with my bullion. Check the fallout wiki should have all stats including modded stats
---
What was the fallout version of the cave? Or was that just irl?
---
I thought the same until I got jumped by a 3* legendary glowing deathclaw that was level 91
---
Prime the minigun (as others have noted) for better ammo efficiency.  Buy the crimson from someone else online.  You won’t regret it. 
---
Bloodied w/o any meds and a slightly suboptimal perk setup I still shred the queen doing more than my bloodied 50cal per shot.  It may be one of the highest dps weapons in the game.  In terms of ammo, it wastes ammo very badly. I usually use 1k rounds per queen unless I go conservative on ammo or if the server has good dps. 
---
Finally: get a good backup weapon.  The plasma caster, 50 cal or Gatling gun all are great backups, especially the Gatling since it is super ammo efficient.
---
This.  Crimson flux is super common at Fissure Prime nuke zones.  Between the damage boost and common materials, priming the gun is a no brained to me.
---
The fast travel location you arrive at is based off where the actual CAMP box sits.  If you move the box and rotate it you can get it so fast travel drops you off pretty close to where you want it to drop you.
---
More tattoos and hairstyles be nice lol but i been Fallout 1st since the get-go and dont see the point except private worlds. And do we still get monthly Atoms cuz i dont notice if i get em or not
---
Reporting!  A force for good!
---
I know right they complain stuff is to hard to kill then they complain when people lile us one shot stuff by accident like seriously how was I supposed to know a max level enemy could take 2 bullets
---
Crimson flux is super common at Fissure Prime.  If you hop servers and find lingering nuke zones, you can easily make 100s pretty quickly.  It’s very sustainable.
---
thanks for the advice! guess i’ve got a lot to do next to the rep grind for the raiders and settlers, so i guess i’ll look for some place to buy that crimson.
---
Atleast when Meat Week was active there would also be a Primal Cuts event in the bog which brought some activity too
---
It was the first weapon ive actually primed. Been playing basically since launch with some breaks, i just hated crafting flux, i always found myself missing hardened mass. But i just started buying it. 🤣
---
I'm just thinking more for when legendary perks come out. Might as well get a full set so I can get even more bonuses. Since I don't want to give up my jetpack I need full ss
---
I pay for the scrap box and survival camp.  Everything else is just butter on top.   Not saying that those should or should not be paid features.   But there it is.
---
Great pics! Thanks for sharing. Wild how close the game is to real life.
---
Use r/fo76market or r/marketplace76
---
is there a way to get the hardened mass and high radiation fluids to stabilise it easy? probably the biggest problem i run into is that I don’t end up getting enough of those and can’t stabilise the flux before the zone is gone.
---
So after posting this I actually got obliterated by a level 225 in power armor with a Gatling laser for like 20 minutes but so far I’ve had a good experience with the game, I regret purchasing as much as I thought I would lol I’m on PS4 and I have no idea what Im really doing aside from murderizing things but would be down to team up, pm me for my psn 😁
---
Yeah.  It’s very easy to maintain ultracite ammo now, assuming you have a steady cash flow or farm nuke zones with a high DPS character.
---
If you are spending $100 to make a game you already bought playable dont you see an issue with the game? Why give them more money and only reinforced shitty games?
---
If you throw on green thumb too, shit. You could end up with more flux than you want. But no matter, that inert flux comes in handy too
---
150-200 caps per crimson in my experience. 
---
The best way to get caps (if you’re struggling) is sell a high value ammo or junk at a decent price to players (not bots).  
---
I sell excess 5.56 at 1c/round and my ammo machine at my camp makes about 200/hour not including any excess I can make from lead/steel I find.  Generally 5.56 and .45 are the most popular right now, but you can also sell the spare lead/steel separate.  You can also do your own nuke silos which generate 300 caps (1 for room clear, 200 for queen kill+ extra stuff) but solo silos isn’t for everyone.
---
This is why i’m looking forward to one wasteland and enemies scaling to our level. I will gladly get demolished by a group of deathclaws and be happy to go back to the drawing board and figure out how the hell i’m gonna navigate appalachia with a threat like that.
---
Agree with the above comments and did not use vats as a heavy gunner myself until one guy showed how powerful it is against the queen if you have a weapon with which it pays off to target limbs (mainly limb dmg LMG or gauss minigun). Also just on free roam one shotting enemies with a head shot (at least if you are bloodied build) is quite satisfying. So to sum up, not necessary but useful and only perk point is enough 👍🏻
---
You have a chance of TWO locations @ Charleston Train Station! Rather than running forward when you land there, about face, run up the small hill behind you and you will see a second red bridge. Run all the way over it (caution, as there are mobs to the right as you cross and possibly scorched or ferals at the end) Once you reach the end, turn around and you may encounter anything OP listed. 
---
HOWEVER: Sometimes mobs will spawn between you on the bridge and where you land when you fast travel to CTS. If afterr you crossed the bridge heading back to the station and see ONLY the pack brahmin that is usually with the Responder Bot...go back to the bridge but look UNDER it. Sometimes the vendor spawns beneath.
---
They also talk way after I am looting their exploded bits
---
yeah did that and slocum joes, worth it in the end cause the shotgun is nuts
---
Anti-flyer weapon mod for the harpoon gun, shoots nets instead of flechettes or harpoons. It just looks  like the only weapon with a large enough bore that could fit a damn net in it. Perhaps no damage but causes flying creatures to land for x seconds.
---
This advice helped me, thank you.
---
Knowledge is power: buy all the plans in the game and make your character capable of crafting and modding any weapon, armor, power armor in the game. When I reach max caps, I transfer caps to my mules, which allows me to bank a small fortune ready to be spent on things like wrapping paper, ornate pails, etc. during special events for a greater chance of getting rare drops.
---
Awesome!
---
woah the armco factory makes that much? damn, i’m currently selling shotgun shells and 5.56 rounds at my camp, but it’s mostly just ammo that i pick up on my travels.
---
Psst....  [https://nukacrypt.com/php/home.php](https://nukacrypt.com/php/home.php)
---
If you want to take your time that’s cool and I would recommend ...but you can just look up the code online FYI they are updated every week
---
If the groves were bigger and the zone had actually story beyond Ft. Defiance and Watoga, it could be a fun place.   But I will never base myself there.
---
Exactly!!!  It is No Man's Land.  There are tons of remnants and notes, important plants for recipes, notable large stuff that haunts various stands of trees and locations.  And the rifts in the ground all over.  At level 350ish it is my favourite zone.  There is a sadness and desolation mixed with a perverted wildness of scorched standing over ruined BoS territory that I love.
---
Literally the only 'annoying' ghoul is the lvl 62 Charred one. One who looks like he's been rolling around in chocolate for five months... and even then he's what.. three, four shots from most normal guns?  
---
Don't people know how to aim for the head? x.x
---
I have left so many mini-nukes and missiles in bags all over Appalachia... if only I could sell them.... can't even imagine them being useful like they were in Fallout 4.
---
Same. It’s a common misconception that’s getting repeated as fact. Which is about par for the course with complaint posts like this.
---
I think you're looking for r/fo4
---
I shoot legs now only way enemies feel tough now
---
You can help lower level players
---
Cool, thanks! I knew there was a guy posting codes but his last post was a year ago. I thought they stopped doing that.
---
I think once I get 3 lock picking and hacking I’ll try to go in blind
---
A few items here and there have garnered my interest. I typically wait until they are on sale or I miss them completely.
---
I’ve been doing the raider grind more, I just want the ammo machine. I’m not excited for the settler grind.
---
Well, camp budget  and camp space, I would not expect that soon. especially since they anounced instanced camp next winter, which indeed will cover those perks.
---
  
---
And about mods in private world... also...; well, they really have too much to fix before... Also I am afraid that gameplay mods will lock a character for a specific private world for good, and since they are developping public team, I am not sure they want us to stay private at all.
---
And yet somehow I'd be left looking at my inventory with 5lbs left being like "WHERE THE EFF ARE 100 MINI NUKES I MUST BE CARRYING..."
---
I also found out that those particle effects you find near them will make a floater noise now and again. Almost shat myself when I was looting a cabin after killing off 5 of them.
---
Since there’s a bunch of caves in the game, I figured I’d go into one. This one is called the Lost World Caverns, and was closest to maybe the Wendigo Cave in the game.
---
Last time I messed around with Blue Printing nothing worked right so I haven't bothered with it in well over a year.
---
Very detailed and looks fun! Only thing I'd recommend trying is dropping rank 2 or 3 of most gunslinger ranks as they only give 5% DAM compared to the 10% the first rank of each gives in favor of maxed adrenaline for a 60% DAM buff at 6 kills. Also seems fitting for a gunslinger IMO
---
&gt;they have you killing one about 10 minutes into the game
---
Minigun, Power Armor and Deathclaw. All within the first 10-15mins, so disappointing.
---
I took a 4 day road trip around WV.
---
Qol improvements are exactly the ones i said. Putting legendary effect would be too much.
---
The card you say has 3 issues casual players cannot overcome: it requires a full set of the same armor(which is hard to come by for most players),it's only for ranged attacks(PA is for all),and it currently requires 450 perk points to upgrade ,which is double of what the avarage lvl 200 have.
---
No, unfortunately not. We did get to walk up to the bunker door though. Not as thick as a vault door, but it was pretty cool!
---
&gt; as long as nothing else is broken.
---
This is Bethesda were talking about
---
Amazing
---
Yep, +3 Strength and +2 Perception.
---
What?
---
I think there is a YouTube channel that does a documentary on Daniel it’s insightful https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRIop1C6y41M4B0pE8RkQtJ5pppmmN9xy
---
Deathclaw.
---
You could always use Good With Salt to keep the raw flux from spoiling so quickly.  I have pretty high DPS characters, so I typically blast through nuke zone enemies quickly and collect a lot of materials.  Picking up ultracite ore will spawn small groups of Scorched, and there’s plenty of those around Fissure Prime.  I typically leave a blast with 20-30 of every material.
---
I use the gauss mini pretty sparingly, only against big bosses, so I feel like I have plenty of ammo and a growing stockpile of flux to make more.  I use an unprimed 50cal and primed plasma caster for killing normal enemies.  Using the gauss mini as a general purpose, everyday weapon is not sustainable....or necessary.
---
I only find two to three Workshops to be useful at any given time. Poseidon Energy Yard because I live in my Power Armor, Charleston Landfill for all of the junk extractors, and Hemlock Holes Maintenance for the rare occasion I start running low on Acid.
---
Xp isn't as difficult to get with exploits,  double xp and what not. Which people will use when they really want it.
---
They weren't stated as future plans whatsoever. They said private worlds will continue to evolve and listed the ways in which they'll be enhanced. Yes it's fair to not expect those features literally right away, within 6 months is pretty fair as some services do take time to expand, but it's now almost been a year and those features have literally been wiped from every other corner of F1st bethesda can find.
---
All enemies seem to easy with a Bloodied Build but only enemy i hate seeing are those cyclops laser beaming me from afar
---
alright, will keep that in mind then.
---
On a private what I do is drop my survival tent near whitesprings, drop the nuke, and then be back at my base when the nuke drops, then ft to WS.  After doing a loop through WS, I travel back to my base, drop off stuff, then quit to main menu and immediately rejoin the private world, then ft back to WS.
---
This resets the spawns consistently, I can do about 15 loops in 2 hours and wind up with over 100 of each material easily, plus tons of legendaries etc.
---
My family and I did the bunker and it was interesting. it’s full of modern servers and they say “companies keep their data here”, but we all know companies use cloud services. Modus lives.
---
Eh, it's easy to not be aware. It's not like folks go and look up drop rates for clothing unless they're looking for something. I had a hunters long coat for the longest time and had no idea people would jump for days on end to buy from that little bot. I've been playing on/off since beta and still don't have the camo or whitesprings jumpsuits.
---
Complaining is great and should be encouraged. But at the same time no one criticizing Bethesda should be paying them any further.
---
That is true, same as super mutants, dreadful timing in the game sometimes.
---
FYI for the sheepsquatch you can tag it with damage before it becomes vulnerable/people activate pylons so you still get loot. 
---
I know that’s not the topic of this thread exactly, but you can at least guarantee sheepbot loot.
---
Nah I can join you, I sold a forest camo jumpsuit I got as a reward from the feed the people event to the vendor for 11 caps. Tried it on my female character but didn’t like the look of it
---
You're trying a little to climb a glass wall...
---
I use private worlds as a way to collect more materials at a faster rate. All kinds of Nuka Cola spawn in special locations untouched, plants to make disease cures are abundant, and high junk areas are full for the taking. Once I clear everything out, I join a public world to reset it, then join my private world again, and it’s all back to raid through again. If they added persistent workshops in I know there is a high chance I would lose the main reason I use the private worlds since items would more than likely be persistent as well and not respawn.
---
How about no there such a pain the ass in all the games  especially in new Vegas kills you in three hits and there armoured bastards
---
A basic ass multiplayer survival crafting game doesn't deserve a sub period. The most it deserves is having flat server rental for cheaper like the rest of the games in this genre.
---
Yo dude I just learned if you have the cannibal perk equipped when you go the bed and breakfast you get dialogue options with the cannibals
---
My advice is just focus on rolling a good SS chest for the jet pack.
---
Arms and legs just go for scout or combat armor. They are easier to get and you can trade for them.
---
The extra DR the SS armor provides really doesn't make a difference. They is a huge diminishing returns past 300 Dr.
---
The grind so fucking real, don't fall for it. It will takes you ages to get full set of SS armor with the legendary effects you want and by that time unyieldying could be nerfed or even you lose interest in the game and start playing another one.
---
I know a guy that  duped over 2000 legendary modules and he rolled all of them and only got 3 pieces that he want so you get the idea.
---
Yeah man I'm not seeing it here I'm one that usually stands on the fence... It helps with not haveing to deal with the ground enamys and being able to focus on the SBQ... So what if you waste time and ammo this whole game is a time dump..... Also you can't kill something with out shooting at it... In the end if the SBQ dies.... Don't complain
---
I personally have to jetpack and a chest piece that gives me a stem at 20%. but that's it for now I'm not buying nothing till this new update comes out and the armors get classified and we know more of what's going on with the future of the game.
---
Depends. Considering the diminishing returns of DR/ER, I'd say that if you have armor with the legendary rolls that you want then it might be worth just going for the SS chest.. and *only* if you want the jetpack! Apart from that, then no. That's why well-rolled legendary armor trades for so much; the diminishing returns.
---
Yeah, green thumb is the way to go.  I always have leftover flux when I run out of stabilizing materials.  I’ll typically leave a bunch of extra flux in a train station suitcase, drink it, or sell it.
---
Please no we still have the stanley bug, it makes totally bugged the GA.
---
I have a Uny ap chest now so I'm good there, but the rest of an ss set I want for when legendary perks come out.
---
Ah yes the good old "but a youtuber said X so that's the ONLY reason everyone else is thinking or doing that thing" I hear those evil nasty youtubers talking about how legitimately shit the game was at launch are the sole reason why the game got bad reviews and got a bad reputation.
---
Never even heard of a forest camo jumpsuit, you're not talking about the enclave one right?
---
Well if people would stop duping, they might be able to focus on other things.
---
Brings new meaning to "till the cows came home"
---
I sold a responders fireman outfit to the flatwoods vendor bot for probably like 10 caps or something right when I started playing last year and had no idea.  Oh well lol.
---
I get that the stuff is rare and all that but I just don't understand some people's obsession with outfits.  People can do and chase whatever items they want.  Bloodied fixers and unyeilding sentinels armor...I understand that, but red dresses that don't do anything for your stats?? Lost on me lol
---
How do you un sub when you paid for a year subscription? How does that work? Serious question or do you think you can only buy sub 1 month at a time?
---
Well, if it makes you feel any better, imagine the happiness that you brought to those other people who bought them. I know it would have made my day if I was able to by the red asylum outfit for 100 caps.
---
Are you a fucking super mutant?
---
I really liked this quest line. Though I seem to have lost my Eye of RA
---
You can buy a month at a time
---
I have a dedicated MoM character. Only uses the regalia and weapons from the quest. It's actually not bad with the set bonus.
---
All depends on whether or not this game's engine can cooperate with the more modern equipment.
---
Back in beta/early release I got a tattered field jacket.  I was also perpetually at the 400 stash limit, so I either vendored or scrapped it, I forget which, but suffice to say it still nags at me!
---
Misery loves company!
---
The legendary perks do not count for matching set, just heavy, light or study.
---
I think scout and SS armor are both  sturdy but I am not sure.
---
Lol ain't that the damn sad truth.
---
That's what I'm currently looking for. Be doing this event more. I'm currently just checking tree house Village.
---
Any other ideas on how I can obtain jumpsuit?
---
The damage loss is pretty significant. 
---
Bloodied caps at 80%, adrenaline at 50% and nerd rage is &lt;I forget&gt;. 
---
You’ll oneshot most trash mobs probably and since you’re using HW the overall damage loss can just be ignored by holding down the trigger for a second or 2 longer. 
---
I have a bloodied rifles (now commando) and junkies rifle (noncommando) and the ammo efficiency is pretty significantly worse.  
---
The flip side is I don’t die to random poison shit.
---
It's rare
---
Knowing my luck. Some cunt just flipped them for a profit.
---
When you have a Fancy Pump Action shotgun nothing other than scorchbeast, legendary assaulttrons about two star, and a sheep squatch take more than one hit. One of the most simple broken weapons in the game and I love it.
---
Level 50*
---
 Getting the expensive plans from vendors and trying different weapon types always gives me something to aim for. Right now though Last of Us 2 has my focus ;)
---
Oof. Mega Savage.
---
Take an upvote this needs to be adressed
---
Don't feel bad, when I came back after 5 months or so, I was low on caps and sold my 2 shot explosive reduced weight tesla rifle for 10,000 caps.... Woops.
---
You literally just described the trap Bethesda is hoping you'll fall into lol you are aware the only reason the scrapbox is useful (which they said they could never expand because it would break the servers) is because Bethesda has made it so? Talk about creating a problem and selling you the solution.
---
I use chameleon on an armor not the mutation.. consequently I dont think about weightless very much...
---
Bethesda are the Ottawa Senators of the gaming world
---
With a MTX store. And overpriced one.
---
SS has 322 DR with full buttress mods.  So yea, Vanguard isn't that useful on it.
---
I don't like weightless or the chameleon mutation one bit.
---
Nope, according to the fallout wiki the forest camp jumpsuit has a small drop chance from the forbidden knowledge quest and other events i guess https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Forest+Camo+Jumpsuit
---
It require more upkeep and is less verisitile
---
Came in to say this. Fuck those things.
---
Technically yes
---
But it lets you turn in and lose scrip if you start clicking too fast and are close to max.  I know this because I did it this morning and got 11 scrip for my 3 star weapon.  Oops lol.
---
I always name my scrip something like !#+$ so that it shows up right at the top and I can spam the sell button.  Works great as long as you check how much scrip you have before doing it!
---
Well I'm out sure the ps5 is backwards compatible so
---
Damn it looks pretty cool, I wish it was an under armor tho :(
---
Not everyone wants the atoms though and lots of people don't even use them. It's not like the atom shop is bursting with quality content usually in most peoples view.
---
I saw a chameleon deathclaw by the pumpkin house but I don't know if they spawn there. You tame other creatures with a charisma perk you learn. I learned it around level 45 I believe
---
Ya right?
---
limbs:
---
pro: best dr 40 40 40 standart beats all other armor, additional mod gives it ripping 53 53 53, cost of crafting low, great rolls possible
---
con: no ultralight mod for additional ap :/, grind for gold and leg modules
---
torso:
---
pro: really good dr, mods available, jetpack is fun but kills u a lot (!)
---
con: not really anything unless you got fully modded metal armor torso and dont care about rads or energy damage.
---
if you have a uny, better ap/stealth, weapon reduction or similar scout piece its obviously worth keeping it
---
Yeah. It must be the limb damage that causes it to one shot. I bought a quad explosive cb shotgun and it wont even one shot most things.
---
wrong game buckaroo
---
There should be a confirm trade screen when you trade for less than the value, once again, like every other Bethesda Fallout game
---
👍🏻 thanks
---
I have the perk but I have server hopped for tamed for nearly 1000 times and never once seen a chameleon deathclaw
---
I’m sure you could probably check the trade groups and try to buy one off someone. If not try events and hope you get lucky. Only seen one so far in my many hours of play.
---
Mmm. He could have used the trick to upgrade pets,but he may still be at low level,hence it didn't turn into the glowing 91 version.
---
So your argument is that because the company prices it's MTX currency at X price, them giving you that currency at a reduced price, keeping in mind they control all the pricing, is a good value? You realize the MTX currency HAS no actual value outside of what Bethesda sets right? 
---
That is a CLASSIC mobile gaming MTX technique. You make something quite expensive, and then you offer the player a sale or reduced price or value pack or whatever so the player feels like they're getting a good deal and are more inclined to purchase it. Human psychology 101. It's disgusting.
---
Shhhh
---
To my mind there’s not enough ‘bric-a-brac’ to fill out one, big building. If the designer is meticulous they can *kind* of get round this. The thanksgiving shelf helps a lot, though over-reliance on it ends up looking comical. If you have no such luck, though, you’ll end up with a home featuring empty shelves and empty bookcases. Far easier to disguise these shortcomings if you limit yourself to smaller buildings.
---
Lvl 70 ... your the new player keep your stuff
---
That’s possible, he was only level 73
---
I always put Beckett in the garb of mysteries
---
Floaters are cake, I use my medics pump shot gun and one shot almost everything in the game. If you get a pump shotgun that doesn't have two or explosive and you're a vast stealth build, UAE IT, IT'S OP
---
Didn't they take out all the stuff to get excited about? I thought they delayed legendary perk cards and the colossal problem event? So some minor bug fixes that will create all new bugs?
---
congratulations.
---
mountains forever free? well its a motto:)
---
Does that glitch only work for the session or does it stay?
---
It is sad just enjoying a playstyle makes us pariah but when it comes down people are just as hateful and derogatory towards anything they won't, don't, or cant understand.
---
And those words by Todd were just pretty words to entice you to play the game, as were a lot of other things. Go to a dedicated PVP game you knob.
---
Maybe. I have an explosive instigating pump with rw that does the same thing
---
I have scrapped 2 hunters long coats in the past because I get a bit trigger happy when it comes to scrapping but now I rename stuff I don't want to lose that being said I nearly always scrap outfits rare or not just because I already have what I want ( yet another hunters long coat lol ) .
---
Ty very much
---
This one hits home. I'm sorry for your loss.
---
If powering your vendors and enclosing them with walls, what should one do? Store vendors?
---
Don't do it! Suicide by jumping is not the answer! Use another method that doesn't damage your organs! Other people need them you know.
---
They all have sonething in common. Going right through your armor
---
Pretty much is because there is no end game.
---
It's also like how they complain about having done everything in the game to death, and the only thing they have left is to grind out scrip and gold to get the last few things, so why can't Bethestupid remove the limits so they can get it faster.
---
Then what are you going to do?
---
Yea kinda figured lol, still looks good.
---
And the fact u can’t have a discussion without devolving to insults just proves that you don’t understand the issue because of you immaturity...
---
Enjoy being toxic kid...
---
&gt;rolling around in chocolate for five months
---
This sounds like what your pandemic plans are...
---
Oh and tanks for agreeing with me about the original pvp advertising!
---
Yes and yes, both can be done in the settings menu. Just go snoop around a bit. Think subtitles are in visual and the other should be HUD
---
They’re planning to in the ‘One Appalachia’ update
---
I used to run with weightless armor until I got the Chinese Stealth Armor. Never went back. The CSS is vastly superior.
---
These days, I don't care about armor sets at all anymore and often go out w/o anything other than a rad suit when needed. I still rely on the chameleon mutation though.
---
Yeah an Underarmor would be nice, right now I have protective brotherhood Underarmor until they make secret service Underarmor moddable.
---
They nailed the floaters in wastelanders
---
What you just described are future plans. AKA, plans for things to be implemented down the road instead of right away.
---
They never stated any timeline at all. The only thing clear is that they weren't currently a part of the deal.
---
I'm not defending Bethesda or saying it's ok these things are still not being in the game. It was misleading and disappointing. Unfortunately, they covered their ass legally. This is the exact reason why I opted to hold off until those plans were currently a part of the package. Never give your money away based on something you might get down the road.
---
I know it took way less time to grind for the full ss set than what people where saying guess they didnt know about smily
---
Assaultrons are terrifying...
---
If your going to start that even you need to hrab one and at least bring 2 people that can take the others. Dont rely on the server to do the work for you
---
Ok so I love weightless. But there are better things.
---
As for the stealth suit I prefer that because I can use it in nukezones.
---
Or anything with damage over time effects
---
The gatling gun has no skins in the auto. Shop or anywhere else as far as I jave seen so far
---
Lots... Both would be trade only in my books.
---
chinese stealth armor works
---
chameleon with weightless armor is less stealthy than Chinese stealth armor
---
its a real niche imo
---
I would love black skin for the scout armor
---
Look at his lab,  while there’s no body that amount of gunfire can’t have left him with long to live.
---
I wish America had better consumer protection laws
---
Without going for a specialised build or taking advantage of stealth your only other options for boosting your damage is chems, magazines and bobbleheads.
---
I'm not sure why but the Cranberry Bog feels, to me at least, like it would be 110 degrees with 90% humidity, like a typical Houston day lol.
---
Those damage numbers in the thousands come from bloodied and junkies builds, since you can do a lot more with those builds. From what I know you've maxed out on damage for your play style.
---
But then how will they get you to log in another day? 
---
I swear, someone’s yearly bonus must be tied to daily log-ins.
---
Never pay in advance for a service unless it's feature complete.
---
wait for patch 20, when we get the ammo converter
---
Vats on the plasma caster is actually pretty good. I run conc fire 1 just to get headshots and it does great damage, one hitting everything except schorchbeasts basically. 
---
Does decent dps vs the queen as well.
---
I will try that out.
---
The BE pump is worth around 10k - 15k while the BFFR Flamer is worth around 15k - 20k. Assuming they're both 2*
---
Trade it, i got mine for 3 rare fasnacht masks
---
My thoughts on weightless armor is that its effect should also allow u to max out a berserkers weapon while still wearing armor so that way berserkers is at least viable for every day use
---
Seems a little privileged to me.
---
Oh gods no; I've been on a diet for two months xD
---
Personally I’d rather her not be involved at all anymore as I find her annoying to listen to. I’d rather see more events or fun quests like helping biv with his alcohol recipes.
---
Except that has nothing to do with it.
---
Staggering her will prevent her landing animation. It's the people in power armor using One Gun Army that prevent her from landing.
---
Is this being fixed or worked on? It's been 2 months.
---
Buy mutation recipes,gold bullion and any steel/acid to get rid of my caps
---
You know the rules &amp; so do I! - R.A
---
power armor and One Gun Army is the culprit
---
It's not true. She will still land.
---
This deal is getting worse all the time!
---
Yeah but an ark server is YOURS. You aren't restricted in any way such as building and you're free to mod and customize every aspect of it as you want. 
---
By comparison FO1sts "private worlds" are literally just the regular servers minus other players. That's it. Then all you're getting is some overpriced atoms with very little worth spending them on and a scrapbox that fixes a problem Bethesda literally created. 
---
Trust me renting a proper server is a VASTLY better deal.
---
It's weird but I don't find any enemy in game to feel dangerous or tanky. It's definitely too easy as a heavy PA build. Using PA with the medic mod it's basically impossible to die, even with the Excavator PA which is the worst by far. I think the game needs more danger, but at the same time I feel it's a problem of builds. Like all fallouts and elder scrolls before, some builds steamroll everything while some other builds have a difficult time.
---
Thanks for trying to help.
---
I've already checked the settings menu and can't see either options. There is General Subitles but it doesn't appear to affect all Holotapes, only some.
---
As for the metres, I don't see that option at all?
---
I dieted once gain like 100 lbs turns out human is real bad for you
---
https://www.reddit.com/user/plaguewiind/comments/hcpn39/is_secret_service_armor_really_the_best/
---
Congrats!
---
I still get lost at the start if I don't find a biometric card in the first couple if rooms I check! 😛
---
Deathclaws got common just as with power armor. When FO4 practically handed you a PA in Concord and let you fight a death claw. And it got progressively more common from there, Both PA and Deathclaws should be something you work up to, not handed to you.
---
Sadly doesn't work with friendly fire  and same apply to molotov i believe
---
The forest scout operative under armor and urban variant are both moddable under armours, the modus vendor pass the service entrance after you enter can sometimes sell either under Armour as well as the plans to mod it, the prices don't have taxes in that vendor for some reason
---
All the pieces of my gear are *** legendaries. One piece lowers the weight of my ammo, another lowers the weight of my junk (I think). I'll have to log on to list the rest.
---
I'm also carrying three different bolt action rifles due to no stash space. lol
---
Wrong. I've solo'd her more times than I can count. Tent, fence, doesn't matter.
---
Power armor and One Gun Army stagger her and interrupts the landing. I never use power armor and never have a problem with getting her to land.
---
Quitting over the game having a subscription fee is completely valid. And everyone should. A game like FO76 having a full priced sub service is extremely dangerous and if at all successful sets a bad example for other companies that will happily follow suit if it gives them more money. 
---
Subscription's should ONLY exist in full blown MMORPG's that take a ton of upkeep and are constantly adding in content and balancing.
---
Don't dwell on it.
---
I definitely ditched a couple of explosive energy weapons in the early days of smaller stashes and blissful ignorance!
---
You’ll want to min/max weapons for their purpose. 
---
Sniping/1shotting mobs ?  Use instagating. 
---
Oh shit, kill everything near me gun?  Furious or twoshot (mostly preference) 
---
Hard mob/ boss killer?  Anti armor or furious (would require testing). 
---
Or just go easy mode and do bloodied or junkies.
---
Fallout 76s code is so much spaghetti that if you just look at it wrong it dies
---
Gosh,  those are amazing.   The details they brought to the game are incredible.  Awesome share M8!
---
No shit but you can also buy a year at a time which lots of people do because it's cheaper. How do they unsub?
---
If you need canisters there are usually a few at the Bio-Vac place next to west tek. I’m curious to know what enemies they will work on if you do some testing. Please keep me posted.
---
i can’t do da sneaky with my build haha. You said tanking damage from the pylons; they hurt you??
---
I was honestly a bit disappointed with the Wastelanders missions. I really wanted them to bring npcs back and then some of them branch off and start up all those factions again. I wanted Responders and The Order of Mysteries to have actual people out in the world you can interact with, doing new missions. Missed opportunity if you ask me.
---
it’s** a robot
---
We're always looking for folks to join in, I'll PM you shortly!
---
Are you using Concentrated Fire?
---
Yes, the new weapons from wastelanders, but it is random and costs legendary modules
---
It does. It warns you that you will only get XX scrip because you will be maxed. Then you can chose to continue or not.
---
Ahhh... a fellow realist. Cheers!
---
As it stands, your idea would make material farming ideal on a private server. No competition and all the rewards.
---
That aside, I don't think that would make most people want to PVP, and would fuel griefers and their teams even more. Many probably wouldn't even collect materials or build up workshops, but just wait to pick a fight.
---
This isn’t directly related to how to improve your build specifically, but if you want to mix things up get a plasma flamer. It benefits from the rifleman perks and absolutely wrecks faces. Makes for a very useful close quarters weapon on a rifleman build. Very helpful against large ghoul mobs especially.
---
I just start and almost finish to collect full sets of weightless scout and wood armor. Just because I got a cool camo skin from the fallout 1st Abo for this 2 Typs of armor and I like to be invisible while standing. It's more some typ of fun armor in events for me.
---
Agreed.
---
It’s legacy, but a medium legacy if that makes you feel any better.  
---
It’s not like you traded a BE tesla or QE harpoon
---
MmmMmm fallout 76 toxicity. I was wondering when I’d see it today.
---
I traded to get the ones I have. Oddly, they manage to hold their value pretty well.
---
I am, but this boost is far beyond what that perk should be doing. It went from 76, to 140, to 200, or something like that.
---
Dropped them
---
Devz reap what they sew.
---
I'm logging on right now so I'll run over there and grab some
---
I believe that it is simply about in-game status and roleplay. It does not change the stats but it changes your mindset while you play that character, at least that is what outfits do for me.
---
So more Fallout 1st Bethesda might jump on this then haha
---
Weightless or cloaking should work with berserkers. And I only mention cloaking because it’s terribly useless so that would give it some reason to exist.
---
I think it’s an hour and a half. At least an hour. It’s great reallly. I get all excited when I see gulpers.
---
lol I suspect it’s being outsourced and there’s instructions lost in translation
---
no idea. i just shoot them and they die. not really paying attention where i shoot.
---
lol but it’s way much better now than launch
---
If they are character bound the entire seasons system uses a non starter for me.  I'll just ignore it.
---
It doesn’t reflect badly on them, just you.
---
Won’t the Deathclaw Steak and Pepperoni roll overwrite each other?
---
The rarity is about showing off that you have a cool thing and people that know it’s rarity would be jealous. 
---
Of course, I have more fun with stupid/obnoxious outfits, like my jet packed samurai with a spacesuit helmet.
---
The only thing I liked about the premium was the atoms of gives you, yet there’s absolutely *nothing* worth buying every week
---
The best option I’ve found is to craft the gun and try it out. Have fun with the ammo or give it away. It’s so plentiful and easy to craft.
---
Noted!
---
nope
---
I especially like how it will let you sell something if you’re at 1k scrip. 
---
It’s the ultimate stupid double standard.
---
Why would a bloodied build be unable to I e shot them if a full health build can?
---
I can hear the music while looking at the shops picture.
---
Yeah I’ve pretty much done that. I’d rather my handmade be furious but I haven’t been lucky enough to roll one or find one for sale. Anti armor is probably my fav. I’m a bonafide head popper so I love that AA
---
Yes. Those things were going to be implemented as 1st expanded and evolved....
---
So they're still not included.... They never gave a time frame for any of those things like expanded budget or persistent workshops. 
---
Unpopular opinion : Agreeing to give a company money for content/features/expansions without some target time periods? Then being pissed off when they aren't implemented as quickly as you'd like? 
---
That's just a shitty consumer decision. You see while your one year deal saved you some money? My month to month allowed me to continuously evaluate the value of 1st based on what was delivered and opt out if necessary. 
---
Because I'm not going to give any one a year's worth of payments for promises with no timeframe for delivery .... Just to save a few bucks..... 
---
Pro tip. Saving a few bucks vs freedom of choice? Easy decision.
---
Amazing photographs, thank you for sharing. I had no idea everything was so accurately modelled - right down to the shuttle bus livery and the rubbish bin design.
---
Try relying on your crits if you have high luck and looking for more legendary rifles. For example, I have an instigating gauss rifle that can for the most part one-shot everything with a sneak attack. 
---
Would you mind making and sharing your SPECIAL with, https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
The ridiculously small budget makes it a complete joke.
---
I was doing my red asylum research and found a thread from when the game was like a month old. And people were selling the red outfit for 1000 caps.
---
I sold a shotgun to someone i met on a youtube video and they got it for 7k. Apparently it's worth about 55k. I knew it was worth more than 7k but i just like nice quick sales. OH WELL!
---
PA has an additional hidden damage modifier though. 
---
So it is not that close.
---
ha. When Wastelanders came out, people were complaining that it was going to take 3 months to get their rep up with either side, and that was if they grinded reputation every day. So a total of 9 months or more for everything they wanted. 
---
I don't even play every day, and getting my rep up has been really easy. So easy, really. 
---
But I've also found that there's lots of little ways to get reputation outside of the dailies. But that involves actually going about the world, rather then just fast traveling everywhere. Wastelanders added a whole bunch of random encounters. 
---
But that's something I've always found with the grinders. They read what others do, then do just that. They don't  actually explore the game. I remember at the start people complaining about never having enough screws, gears and springs, because there weren't enough creatures dropping them, and that the respawn rate was too slow. Cause they simply didn't know what junk gave that, and where to find that junk.
---
You’re paying for stuff that was taken out of the base game and you’re surprised Bethesda are still managing to screw you over.
---
"scorch bats"
---
\*snicker\* Love it.
---
If your at max script it still let's you trade but if its the other way around and the vendor has 38 script left you can't trade a weapon worth 40 script for it
---
Indeed, we are only on the PC servers.
---
cheers dude :)
---
honey you need legendary power modules. you need to visit Mama Murmghr and buy legendary modules from her. 50scrip each. then you can craft the armor and that‘s what gives it legendary effects :)
---
No, because Deathclaw Wellington fortifies Strength, which is a different boost from Fortify Carry Weight.
---
Amazing pics. Thank you for sharing. I'd love to visit but don't think my significant other would appreciate it...
---
I second this.
---
awesome
---
I agree and disagree with your bloodied or junkies comment. I personally don’t like those play styles but I understand some people do, well most people because of dps, but I also feel like Bethesda made those the laziest builds yet they yield the most dps, making every other build almost unviable to a degree, or at least inferior to the bloody junkies build
---
Ah. That sucks, but I getcha.
---
Why would you pay for a year before knowing what you’re going to get?
---
You were getting scammed from the start, you just chose not to care.
---
Bloodied, junkies, vats, and stealth are the primary ways anyone can increase their damage.
---
Without them you're probably looking at/for an anti armor rifle with faster fire rate and damage while aiming.
---
u/BethesdaGameStudios_
---
Damn that’s unfortunate:/ I mean I guess not really. I’m avoiding hundreds of more hours grinding for specific legendaries that will literally only help me melt the queen.
---
Don't need this, but just wanted to say this is cool! Hero of the wasteland.
---
It's great having the weight reduction perks on .... Till you need to take them off I can't run with out travelling pharmacy or the chemist back pack on and power armour is a no go for me lol ever.
---
This small change would make pvp x10 better.
---
Dang, ok. Still, good add.
---
Given past performance, I'd say they probably don't know. Wild flailing (restarting ec2 instances, redeploying, etc) until things started working is where my bet is.
---
Doesnt stack with Deathclaw Wellington.
---
I was advised that they'd never make micro transactions that affect gameplay, and spent $200 for a helmet, but fuck me, I guess.
---
Noted! I’ve been looking for AA handmade or lever and I’ve been unlucky as ever.
---
Hmm. so i can just keep rank 1. I was kinda keeping it to quick Q + mouse 1 to get rid of annoying enemies. And time to time to crit tough enemies, like assaultrons. I removed it and thinking some other perks... thanks...
---
Where do they even hold billions?! That should be a re flag lmao
---
Isnt that Alcohol, so it wouldn't stack with Whiskey? Besides, we've found Rad Ant Lager adds 50 carry weight, so that's the go to rather than Party Boy's max of 30.
---
Sure, I will soon enough. Won’t be back on my Xbox till later today. Didn’t know I could that, thank you.
---
Thanks. Maybe i will get rank 1 and keep that. I do like getting some crit at weak points. I feel like any fast firing weapon dont do such critical damage unless the weak part is out in the open. Right? Fusion cores, combat inhibitors cannot be hit without VATS, am i correct?
---
Doesn't one spawn in the Wayward? Not the most efficient way to get them, but good in a pinch
---
Referring a friend! I was having trouble killing myself.
---
As in child cute or i want to bang her cute? Both are very different.
---
The thing is, he probably tamed it on that day, it dosnt matter what Deathclaw you tame, it always reverts back to the normal level 21 version after you log out and back in.
---
I did this for a long time until I stopped caring about scrip, now I just sell whatever and if I have a scrip or two I can't get oh well.
---
This game really just pushes you to the who cares points.
---
i find that LAN connection is WAY better for playing fallout 76, however because i am on PC, and my SSD drive is my main hard drive. Wifi tends to be spotty if you need constant connectivity (like with gaming)
---
Yeah I try to head shot everything for sure, I don’t sneak though.
---
Ratty Skirt is my go to outfit for cute, but that might just be personal preference.
---
You say that...
---
Yeah. It's hilarious to me how I become weaker in PA. My normal Strength is actually really close to the spot before you need to eat and drink to boost it.
---
The reason you lose it is because you aren't "equipping" your normal armor under the PA frame. Your PA pieces are equipped instead.
---
I don’t see how the expanded camps would work for people like me that play the same character on both public and private servers.   My camp needs to remain the same regardless of where I’m playing.  
---
The best thing about the private servers is that we return to same server if we return to the game within 5 minutes of crashing.  This game crashes frequently and nobody has been able to diagnose it.  So being able to return to the same server has allowed me to play the game for the most part.  The workshops are still mine when I return.
---
That’s not completely true, I have a scorched deathclaw and he stays that way, his name changes from time to time and he attacks my crops non stop
---
I stopped playing around meatcook and joined again around New Years... Needed money so I sold my TSE Gauss Rifle for 25k because I didn’t care for it... Did not know it was legacy at the time.
---
Because it's a lot cheaper? And most people unfortunately assume that they'll get everything with a service that's been advertised.
---
Either ones fine
---
Shhh no one must know.
---
I am sure someone will help you! I am on PC, I'll get you through that if you need me to! Sucks to be stuck.
---
Make sure you’re stocked up on Radaway to deal with all those ghouls
---
Just tested it on blood eagles at summersville and it worked. I targeted the two that stand in the intersection by the bus and one rushed me when I tossed it but the other got caught in the gas and killed the one that came after me then popped a few shots off at one on the roof before it wore off
---
Damn, that's rubbish. Give it something like double damage to ghouls ;)
---
Olivia killed Frederick when her cover got blown at the mansion. No coming back from that.

I have a junkies stealth rifleman/commando build and pretty much one shot every thing in the game. I've never understood why I would really need any more damage aside from sbq. I've always been tempted by bloodied, but the thought of managing my rads and stuff bores me.
---
Lol my weight is almost always within 10 pounds of the max for me. I'm carrying over 500 stimpaks, but I got the lighter chems backpack and a lighter aid armor piece.
---
Good to hear mate, thanks for enlightening us
---
5, But I only play on 2 really.
---
yes
---
One is on a rooftop, under a plank, and the other is in a Nuka vending machine at the bus stop. I've got some screenshots linked below.

Are you playing on 4K resolution? With your setup, you could run at 1440p with at least 60 fps.
---
The exact same thing happened to me. Sends you up, sends you down, then repeat. I eventually just ignored the arrows and explored and found them. Hijack will be immediately in front of you when you locate them, I’d say try the one floor they did not send you to. He was sitting at a desk or something similar and everyone else in the room was behind him on elevated walkways. You cannot back out if your conversation with him as it turns him hostile, so be sure you are medicated to be able to pass conversations ahead of time.
---
Possibly Uncanny Caverns?
---
Thanks for the replies everybody! Was really wondering for weeks now what else I could do with my BOS rifleman. I guess I just need to find some AA and furious rifles, which is what I’ve been doing anyway but I have the worst luck apparently.
---
Random encounter. 
---
We’ve sniffed the pipe.
---
the vendor bots dont seem that difficult because they already have the responder bot just change its pathing to stay near your camp
---
Pupe is life.
---
This is the way.
---
The scorched deathclaws are the only exceptions to that rule as far as I can tell. But I can confirm, every deathclaw I’ve ever gotten has always been a normal level 21 the next day.
---
Brilliant.....thanx for sharing :)
---
Dude. I you dont want to go junkies or bloodied, dont want to use vats, dont want to sneak, dont want exploding bullets... then you have more or less made it clear you dont want to increase your damage. Sorry man. Maye use some chems, like psychotats? I dunno. All of the above mentioned are very effective ways of increasing damage, so you should really give them a second chanse. 
---
Btw, if you use a dense modded chest and the fireproof perk the exploding bullets wont hurt you. And I never had any issues with guns breaking too fast.
---
im a bloody build with no understanding of power armor, i can activate a pylon but it wont help anyone and just kill me and waste someones stimpak
---
thank you for listening to my tedtalk
---
I think it’s a mixture of the two, the limb damage forced her to land, and bug or not, we can’t cripple her now, but also she seems to land more with people on the ground aggro’ing her and lands less with tents in certain areas.
---
That being said, my bloodied sneak build is dying if she sneezes on me and I do as much damage to her in the air as when she’s on the ground, so top of the fence all day for me as I won’t aggro her in sneak anyway.
---
If I’m on my junkie I’ll be all Jeff Goldblum in Jurassic Park.
---
But it simply isn’t the most efficient way to earn xp dispute what these bush campers think.
---
fallout new vegas had the scariest of deathclaws
---
I mean I get that Smiley looks like a skinny version of him, but this ain’t the right sub for that game.
---
Pipe is life
---
Ah I was on team Brody I think his name was ...idk why I just hated the order
---
This is exactly what I do.
---
Are you bloodied? As non bloodied i dont have a big problem with them. They are not rly a threat when you have full HP. Yes they deal some DMG which i think is elemental( so not energy, radiation or kinetic) but if you are running with more than 19%of HP they should not pose significant threat.
---
Nice. Thanks for sharing the pics. I can’t believe those interiors are accurate. Crazy colors lol
---
A pink tutu.
---
Time to suck up to Beth
---
If there was some kind of text chat I'd probly still be playing.
---
Wait so what do I do
---
It should stay. The issue is that you need to change camp location. And even powered,your pet could die from terrain generation. It's just not worth.
---
Tea and cake or death! Tea and cake or death! Little red cook book
---
I just shoot them once with my shotgun and they die.
---
Yeah not to diminish anyone but recent flow of topics where people Rage on floaters being op is from people running with very low HP(bloodied) who are Perfect target for floaters which attack with DMG not affected by Basic resistances).
---
More like "you wouldn't get **IT**..."
---
I find that one should sell armor and weapons separately. Weapon's scrip are multiples of 5 (5, 15 and 40) while armor's scrip is in multiples of 3 (3, 9 and 24). This is good because the total scrip pool is 150, wich is a multiple of 3 and 5. 
---
So, the only way to end up with left over scrip you can't get is of you sell weapons and armor at the same time.
---
until they rebalance weapons there is no point at all in competing in pvp for 99% of the playerbase, as that other 1% are completely unkillable and will instagib you.
---
The only way I could ever see it working is if each weapon got it's own specific damage rating vs players that was not effected by buffs and perks except the damage to players specific ones, then tune all weapons for pvp specifically, with some weapons being better against players and some better against world enemies.
---
Yo, this is beyond gorgeous. It’s truly a wastelander’s cozy getaway spot.
---
10/10 love it
---
I picked up the toy and nothing happened:(
---
You never seen Hentai before?
---
Just tell me both outfits
---
This is amazing
---
This community is awesome. YOU are awesome.

I spend my days looking for those pipes for...um health reasons...
---
What I think the moth man is doing or what he is in 76 is demon these other mothman are cultist prophets being used as host to an act his jurisdiction on others. The other option could be that the mothman original is hiding somewhere while meditating his astral form to different locations to project itself as a god to the mothman cultist.
---
This would be a very cool thing for Private Worlds too. To welcome your friends onto your server where the different workshops are built up ready to be shown off.
---
A few months subbed to try it out first is a lot cheaper lol. And buyers remorse isn’t refundable no matter what you pay for no matter what the product my dude. Anyway you’re either just going to keep your opinion no matter what I say so just keep doing what you’re doing I guess
---
I am just trying to support wastelander photography!
---
I’ve been scoping the same spot cause I thought it was a legendary spawn, I found a sheepsqautch but turns out it’s just a random event spawn
---
I usually sell whatever is heaviest
---
I get that thus is a nice thing to do but every time I do I kinda feel bad about it.  Honestly, early game is the only period you have things to chase, and it doesn't feel like a generally unrewarding grind.    
---
It's probably more fun to get that stuff yourself.
---
Now solo launch a nuke at the lowest level possible.
---
As I can tell the lowest xp way to get the 10 legendary kills is to do leader of the pack, and only kill 2 legendary wolves. Then server hop then kill 2 more.
---
As for the silo, I hope you put every level into agility and got a supressed weapon for those turrets.
---
You don’t have to win the majority of games to earn more xp than from bush camping. If you want to be the most efficient you will need to actually play the game, go for challenges, go for player and creature kills, and try to last as long as possible. When you say you like consistent xp you actually mean you like consistent slowly earned xp that is only efficient in terms of effort put in not the ability to earn as quick as possible.
---
Wish someone would milk me...have you tried joking a ERP group lol
---
Got the same hardware, no fps issues here (1920x1200). 
---
Go to documents/my games/fo76 and open Fallout76Prefs.ini with notepad (maybe make a backup first), search for the line 'iPresentInterval=1' and change it to 'iPresentInterval=0'. 
---
If you experience movement problems indoors - usually in PA - use the nvidia control panel and limit the max fps for FO76 to a little bit under your actual monitor frequency.
---
I’m currently buying all the plans. Don’t plan to put the .38 critical attachment on a combat rifle, but fuck it, let’s get em all. Only 3 more serum plans to get too. And then you stock up on junk/ammo.
---
Wow, crazy how i don't have to do that in a public server. I can't imagine trying to justify something being broken for 9 months. You're a joke.
---
Or you could use the scottish term "bawbag" haha
---
I’d recommend the black bear mascot for max cuteness, it’s hard to tell whether it’s a girl though
---
Get a troubleshooters shotgun with VATS. Instant robot death once they de cloak
---
I just started my 1st subscription and I’m pleased so far, mostly because of the $180 in free atoms per year. Now, if they don’t fulfill some of these promises soon, that subscription is going to be useless. As it stands, there isn’t more than $180 worth of items on the shop that I want/need.
---
Agree re the crit damage. Tbh do not know whether you can hit fusion cores without vats (never even though hitting them :D)
---
I wouldnt really classify that as girly
---
Your name and the context of this comment lmao
---
45 sec? It take 3secs to 2shot them with a gatling gun.
---
They absolutely destroy fusion cores brotha
---
Wait did you take a picture of the old insane asylum and were the tours available?
---
It made more sense not to buy it did you actually think Bethesda is going to give you a lot of free stuff because you paid for fallout 1st
---
I'm down to plans I don't want or that have no use to me.  I don't and will never wear power armor so those plans are worthless, and stuff like fatman and heavy robot arms plans that really serve no purpose.    
---
There are a few rare plans I don't have but they don't sell because the effort to get them isn't close to being worth 30k.
---
Well yeah I know those methods work lol I’m just not interested, it’s not my play style. I was just wondering what else I could do, and if there’s not much else than that answers my question. I play a specific way just like anyone else would. Since fo1 I’ve never used sneak or vats, just not my combat preference. I have thought about making some overdrive, I’ve never used it but it seems good. 
---
Exploding bullets shred my weapons I’m surprised you haven’t dealt with that because a lot of people do. I have gunsmith 5 and my guns would still break pretty fast. It’s just gimmicky to me, don’t really like it.
---
I 1 shot them all in the cilo's i sneak all the way even with a gatling gun.
---
It's funny my double shot railway makes them no match for me. Unless I see a flame floater in radiation ruble. Instant crash my game every time I kill one
---
these raiders don't have more quest at the moment. next step is to go visit the overseer in Sutton.
---
You’re right actually.
---
It's also cool as fuck
---
Yes it does. She will gas you if your in an area she cant land. She only landed for you cuz it was bugged. She generally wont land unless the target she's focused on is in an open area where she can. Also, staggering causes her to stop from landing.
---
But the biggest culprit is the limb damage bug.
---
Everything else didnt matter beofre cuz we could cripple her wings. 
---
Also, when you do cripple her wings, when will land in funky spot cuz she's coded to land at the next available spot after being crippled. Game bugs out alot
---
Only before lvl 50 or you have a weak/bloodied build
---
Ya but imagine you are the one staggering her in the air also
---
I’m all for them having a serious punch, but they are literally floating bags of gas.   Which means the bodies should be very light and thin skin.   It should only take one shot from anything to pop them.   I’m hitting the same flamer with several explosive rounds and he was still tanking it.   That is unbelievable.
---
Well, maybe we have different opinions on what's is too fast. Do you over repair them to 200%?
---
I think for you playstyle an AA25 handmade would be the best gun and it might help
---
And make them explode. (W3 intesifies).
---
Yep the chest piece+jetpack is the greatest addition to the game. I unlocked all the limbs but haven’t felt the urge to roll them yet.
---
Sounds like a class action lawsuit is on the way.
---
It is possible that I do sometimes, but I try to judge when I need to be hitting her in the air or not. The group I do fights with still get through the fights quickly regardless of that
---
You are missing the roasted radstag which increases carry weight by 20 I think
---
Uhm no? If a subscription service offers a year package it is quite literally cheaper than 6 months or something. Yes it's probably not a smart idea unless it's a complete service or know you'll use it a lot but when talking pure monetary amount a year is much cheaper. And I don't have an opinion...? It's a literal fact that paying for FO76 for a year is something like 36% cheaper than if you pay month to month I think it is. So of course lots of people purchase that thinking the service will be complete and they'll use it enough over the course of a year to justify it. 
---
And what do you mean keep doing what you're doing? I literally do not pay for FO76 all I'm doing is pointing out that lots of people probably have paid for a year long sub because it's the best value for money and therefore you can't exactly just cancel that sub. 
---
Not sure why this turned into a multi comment discussion it's extremely simple.
---
There’s so little to do with resources end game that it doesn’t bother me at all to massively undervalue things. I just hope it goes to someone who needs it.
---
Pipe is life. I dropped all my other notes. When you go to trade with me, all you will see is Pipe...
---
Good to know! Thank you :)
---
The hats are very common and aren't worth anything I'm sorry to say.
---
That is amazing
---
For what it's worth junkies doesn't feel like a playstyle in and of itself, separate from anything except bloodied. It's the "you want to make sure you have full hp and 0 rads" just as much as anti armor and instigating weapons do.
---
All junkies does is make a one time sacrifice of stats for damage, a trade of sorts. It doesn't have to be maintained and you don't have to play differently.
---
But that's just my perspective. As you said, you're choosing to go without crits, easy headshots, sneak damage, or low health damage.
---
Anti armor weapons will have diminishing returns when combined with anti armor perks, but are still worthwhile. It almost makes pistols more worthwhile than they usually are. 
---
Getting your hands on a legacy laser rifle would be good. The explosive beamsplitter would be helpful for damage.
---
If you're going without bloodied, sneak or vats, I think you're honestly in a situation where you should acknowledge that you're choosing to lack damage and try to capitalize on the benefits of high stats and high hp as well.
---
I don't know though.
---
Already have, I'm on the final exam for the fireman
---
psn: Owl_No
---
No, 1920x1080
---
Yeah I 200% every time. Without exploding bullets I repair my weapons every couple of days, and that’s me playing several hours a day going through hundreds of rounds each day on multiple weapons. With the exploding bullets I have to repair every several mobs or so. To me that’s fast, but to someone else maybe not idk. I also don’t spend a ton of time farming resources so I don’t like having to use them frequently except for ammo.
---
I'll go for a Heavy gunner with a plasma caster or a gatling laser !
---
No problem, just currios
---
I hate non persistent carry weight so I go by my permanent which is 395 and I love it. With bear arms and all my weight perks my stash has NOTHING on my pockets
---
Nope
---
Sweet, I'll try that...
---
Well you cant evade them simply by jumping up on any rock so that alone makes them more dangerous than a lot of beasts.
---
That's fuckin sick!
---
Rebalancing has to come to the game no matter what, doenst mean they cant innovate another area if the game to be better and keep more people playing.
---
Continue all the quests with the overseer.
---
You're talking about glowing blood, which is not used to create stable flux.  The flux materials: high radiation fluids, glowing mass, and hardened mass (along with raw flux) do not drop at Radiation Rumble.
---
By the way are you on PC?
---
You don't have to ever start an alt if you don't want to, I just started one because I wanted a new build
---
Considering you cannot play as a child in this game, what do you think?
---
Must purge
---
With the upcoming legendary perks you really don't want to start over. You can always respec to another build if you are bored by leveling. Making a new character means you will have to learn all the plans again, grind reputation, gold etc etc. Keep playing that one character. That's the wisest thing to do.
---
Really? Same level on my second character and still haven't completed my all my side quest
---
Cloaking would be vialble if it was all damage instead of just melee attacks that made u invisible, still not top tier but viable for sure
---
Where do they sell serum plans?
---
I'm level 150. Defo at end game grind. I've got all the cool shit I want.
---
But that camo jumpsuit man. I need it.
---
Its not a scam. Something has gotten lost somewhere. Go contact support or your bank.
---
I got jumped by 2 and an ice one, couldn't even run, one was freezing me while the other 2 melted my ass
---
That must violate some kind of trade law
---
Hey man I’m only level 76 and really could use some of that loot Yknow?
---
Sounds more like a Xbox issues, he can contact Xbox and I’m sure they’d sort it.
---
Bethesda doesn’t control the transactions or billing.
---
Well all sidequests that are listed. But not all challenges etc. That is to much...
---
I made multiple character to have multiple builds. It also allows you to acquire more caps, scrip, etc if you care to.
---
Gimme, gimme, gimme! My raider camp needs a Rose to be a thorn in everyone's sides.
---
You might wanna read the sub rules.
---
Thank you for flying Church of England, cake or death?
---
Something others here haven't mentioned is how notoriously buggy the effect can be, even Bethesda has acknowledged that.
---
There's a plethora of reasons the effect won't trigger **Chameleon**. And the "fixes* sometimes won't work because it's just glitched.
---
Great reply, thank you. I didn’t know that about junkies, I thought you had to be constantly taking chems? That just might make me reevaluate some things. I’m totally okay with lacking damage as far as sneak and vats because those things just don’t cater to my play style. Since Fallout 1 I’ve never used those advantages and I’ve been okay with that. I like aiming down my iron sights and using the environment to take cover as opposed to vats and sneaking.
---
Scanning for counter-revolutionary values... Results: several.
---
I fear I will run into the same problem that I am facing now. What to do with all this legendary stuff and perks when all is done? I get my bullion and daily reps. The atoms that are not to much of a pain. And there I sit...
---
Nurse outfit with bear hat
---
Nope I’m on the box
---
Yes, I am a stealth dude now, considering maybe a power armour build.
---
Medical Wing or Research Wing terminals with Modus. They also sell Berry Mentats recipes and others if you’re looking to make your own meds
---
Man I hate when those things get right up in my face and blind me. My preferred method of killing them right now is to stay safely hidden and snipe them.
---
That's actually not a bad idea
---
initially I only started a new character because I wanted a different build..
---
the 2nd new toon I started leveling is for use on the Public Test Servers when they are active.. since progress obviously doesnt carry over to standard servers
---
We all know Skyrim will be on the newer consoles, so it’s a safe bet that 76 will be too.
---
I've had some success with ghouls and a few critters. I think I made some gulpers fight? I don't remember anymore, fresh testing is long overdue. The problem is that all explosions are extremely delayed in this game, and their range is pretty small, and every weapon tends to have at least a few things broken with it, so it's very hard to tell what is a result of what
---
All companions?
---
They are running a bloodied build and use rads sometimes to keep their health low google low health bloodied build and be flooded with info
---
I guess they have bloodied builds. That means they deal more damage when they have low health. The rads prevent them from healing.
---
Certain higher level weapons do more damage the less health you have (Bloodied weapons) the rads are a way of making sure you can heal without going to far and reducing the amount of damage the weapons do.
---
I have one with faster fire rate and I forget the third star. I don’t use it often but I keep it around just because it’s awesome when I do.
---
Cool, thank you!
---
They need to make it so you can sleep with the deathclaws. For scientific reasons.
---
Mine too!! It just started today. I checked it after an hour of playing and he's loaded with bones and black titanium. Wtf
---
Basically there is a legendary effect you can get on a weapon called Bloodied and the effect requires that eh lower your health is, the higher your damage output is. This is one of the most useful legendary effect that can be found on a weapon
---
Wait what update to the secret service armor?
---
My build(whatever it is, haha) seems to be good for em.
---
I'll often come by a random person struggling to fight the 3 of em off, run in, melee them, and run away!
---
Hahaha
---
"Who was that mysterious stranger!!"
---
Is it because it’s unlocked and people come by and take the good stuff but leave the bones? Not that I would ever do such a thing...
---
Yes.
---
i made alts straight away for storage reasons back in the early days. 
---
i started playing on my 2nd when i decided to switch from melee to rifle and couldn't be bothered to respec my 1st. So my 1st which is now my alt is 119 and my 2nd which is now my main is now 195. 
---
I've also decided to get another alt to 50 (it's 30) as i am testing a theory. If it doesn't work then all i have wasted is my time and it'll go back to being a mule.
---
and my 4th is 31. I have no idea why i actually started levelling that one. 
---
I have like 790 hours all together. 
---
I have done barely any side quests on my 2nd account. I only finished the rose quest at level 119. So there's plenty of play left there. 
---
If my theory works for the 3rd account i may do the wastelanders stuff.
---
I think I understand why they didn’t go through with increased camp budget and size in private worlds because that would mean you’d have to rebuild your camp each time you swap between
---
I put the bear costume on Daguerre I think it's pretty funny to see her walk around in it.
---
GL
---
Thanks a lot 😁
---
Thanks everybody!
---
I second this, if you add gunfu, adrenaline, and a few crit points (you can sub for tormentor) you will see huge numbers.  You can make it so that every 3rd or so shot is perking a crit.  The bonus damage from adrenaline and crits can get really big.
---
Oh wow, imagine a wall of amps as your CAMP
---
Thanks a lot 🤣
---
Did you ever get banned, or are you still good?
---
Go Away!  
---
Just kidding. Most players here and in-game. are cool.
---
Weird how much intelligence do you have? Its weird bc I'm the same level and I haven't done all my sides
---
they cant play the game without being bloodied...
---
Well I cant send over items to other chars. Have max caps but never find anything good. I run the scripts gamble etc as time allows me.
---
That did the trick man. Thanks a bunch. Smooooooth frames!
---
I am considering something differnet and dont want to undo my current one.
---
did you go to school in the US?
---
I only take over Workshops to Farm Fusion Cores and it ends up draining my whole day of gaming because the damn thing gets attacked every 2 minutes.
---
Yeah, the hidden dr.
---
But PAs can not be legendaroes. This for that type of trade off. But I think PA is still far far behind.
---
I ahve 250 hours on my first. That is as a first timers so much time wasted.
---
Might be a atomic shop item from the past or future
---
Stalker atomshop set
---
🤣think I may have spoke to soon
---
ok.. do it
---
I always love seeing these posts, very impressive.
---
Thats one reason why i love the game. Welcome to the community
---
I have has the same experience. A level 400 came by and built me a fusion generator!
---
He’s Canadian
---
no why?
---
Sneaky build helps. They never see me before I murder them.
---
Wow! I live in KY and have always wanted to check out the Mothman town but hadnt realized there is so much more from the game. 
---
Could you share what route you took through WV?
---
Yeah i stumbled across a high levels base he welcomed me in and just kept dropping me loot lol
---
ahhh i see i will try
---
Where are groups of ghouls in this area?   I'm aware of the ones in the little military camp with all the tents, but not elsewhere.
---
I try to pass it on by giving low level players purified water :)
---
Yeah, it's part of the Satalker Set. It comes with the outfit Meg wears and a pair of goggles.
---
I don't really think the problem with pvp in 76 is incentive really. This game just doesn't really attract that many pvp players, and the ones it does attract are more on the griefer side. They recognized this and made wastelanders instead of pushing the pvp agenda. There are many other places to look for a fun, balanced, and active pvp community, but 76 just ain't it. Especially now.
---
It's easy to confirm that you're wrong. I've solo'd her dozens of times, and I stand on top of my tent the entire time.
---
The fences/tents thing is a myth.
---
Instigating with faster fire rate? Nice. If you ever get bored of it I'll happily buy it if you are on PC.
---
Yeah I run a bloodied stealth build as my main,  really effective
---
Just met these guys for the first time, goddamn yikes
---
Im so jealous! I live in Michigan and have been wanting to take a weekend Point Pleasant trip sometime for fun so bad.
---
Intelligence? 5, but it might be 9 on special due to my hellish mess of mutations and such.
---
It's so fugly too
---
-Reagan, probably
---
Just make a mule lol
---
It's not a bug. The entire premise of this post is wrong. She can and will land, regardless of where you're standing.
---
I mean, the power user perk makes mine last for days
---
To piggyback on this with a question: if I'm in an interior doing a quest where progress is only saved on exiting (according to the loadscreen tooltip), is progress saved if I fast travel out or do I need to use the door? I've been too paranoid to try so far.
---
thats amazing. thank you for sharing :)
---
Obviously haven't faced an assaultron dominator
---
there are other builds?
---
Oh? Does it work with the shishkebab? Please tell me they finally buffed it.
---
AMEN!!!!
---
Apparently punctuation and sentence structure is a scam also.

I saw someone had her in the NukaCola girl outfit and that is definitely my fav for her!
---
I started dropping ammo and unwanted stuff in front of my vending machines. Sometimes it's there when i come back, sometimes it's not
---
Don't get me wrong Wastelanders is great and was absolutely necessary for the game, but it *almost* appears as though Wastelanders was the only focus. New content is great but when existing content has issues and there are so many loose ends left untied, you can't pat yourself on the back.
---
These are fabulous and also: I know I will visit one day and it's going to be HELLA hard to not go through every container on the Greenbrier grounds lol. I imagine getting scolded by groundskeepers as I upturn a bunch of trash cans and try to picklock their tool boxes
---
It does! lots of players were using it to heal the bots during Fashnacht
---
I started at the vaukt then went south / south-east where I had lunch at a nice little place called the Wayward that recently opened. Poor menu but tons of booze.to choose from.
---
I do completely understand that there are other pvp games but some players genuinely enjoy a fight against each other on Fallout. I myself am about 80% pve and 20% pvp I enjoy breaking the norm and having a fight in the universe I love. Yes cod and battlefield and sadly fornite exist but it isn't Fallout.
---
This is insane
---
Some of the camps you see are awesome too, makes my little shack look like shit 🤣
---
Unbelievable! That puts my garage to shame. Well done man.
---
Great job! What system do you play on?
---
Anytime I’ve been down and around an area it should be I would check and see if it spawned. But I’ve never even seen one. Question is, is the loot worth the fight? Or would I be happier not having to fix and craft afterwards.
---
Trips me out seeing how accurate it is.
---
I feel like the acidic ones fuck me up way faster
---
I mean, you should state the platform first lol.
---
Yes!!!!!!!!!
---
No announcement that the features aren't coming doesn't mean they actually are coming. If I tell my roommates I'm going to go pick us up some lunch/dinner, but I don't attach a timetable to it, and I'm sitting around on my phone, maybe taking a long bathroom break, and it's been a couple hours since I said I was going to get us some food and you've seen no indication I'm actually getting ready to leave, you're right to be concerned. I didn't say "I changed my mind, I'm not going," but I'm not doing anything to actually show I was serious about it. You don't have it in writing, there's no contractual obligation or anything, but it's still not really a show of good faith on my part.
---
Be interesting to see if they glow in a targeting hud On a suit of PA
---
Your right on second
---
Enclave member? Can i have a X-01 power armor suit?
---
Sure.
---
Nice
---
Xbox sorry
---
&gt; 10-15 minutes
---
That's not really what most people would call "persistent" - especially if they're paying $100-150+ per year...
---
Ever fought a 3* legendary glowing mirelurk king?
---
Nope.
---
I'm at the "Meet your mentor in Lewsiburg" part and it doesnt let me continue. Not sure what im doing wrong.
---
Fantastically done!
---
I just put on fireproof in endurance and I put the asbestos mod on my combat armor chest piece (meaning I cant catch fire and have more energy resistance)
---
THOSE FUCKERS STILL KILL ME !
---
Or you can play nuclear winter since there is no balance in adventure pvp.
---
I get the the system will have down time and shit happens etc. But I feel a lack of explanation or compensation for it was the kick in the teeth. A quick X2/X3 XP weekend and an explanation would go a long way.
---
Sniff the Pipe! SNIFF it!
---
\^this
---
If I have scrap that I want to turn into scrip whatever weights me down more goes first
---
I love nuclear winter but there pvp in the single player that's different and fun in it's own right.
---
Except that in this situation we do have in writing from Bethesda that those features are intended to be delivered some time in the future. And at the end of the article, it literally specifies it could be years. That's plural, meaning more than 1 and it's not even been 1 year since FO1st launched.
---
You're comparing something you said to something that was put into writing.
---
you say that though but i hardly ever see blue hats.
---
Thanks fellow moose.
---
I'm a level 24. Tell that to the 510 that just came by to fuck my shit up at the top left workshop I took over for a daily challenge.
---
I've seen quite a few. The outfits are rarer and more desirable than the hats so noone buys the hats anyway really.
---
I got an ssd on my ps4 and the load time upgrade ain't worth the price, it's really minimal. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Oh yeah those workshops are a no go for me, I stupidly thought I could take one.. nah lol
---
Also, if you ever wanna take a look at my camp, I use the same name on ps4.
---
Oh I hadn’t even thought of that. If not, at the Raider food vendor perhaps, since she sells the plans.
---
Ur welcome fellow moose
---
Yeah once you have an addiction you have it unless you choose to remove it. So it has no maintenance and works better with tank killer than anti armor being on a gun in the first place.
---
The way your reply is worded it sounds like you're saying you preferred iron sights in fallout 1 even. Which was funny, but I get what you mean.
---
Unlike fallout games before it the sneak attack bonus from actually investing in stealth damage is minor, so I don't do anything to buff sneak, but if an enemy doesn't see me I'm happy to have double damage.
---
As someone who’s sole enjoyment of the game has been tracking down plans and building camps, persistent settlements would be a massive game changer for me. 
---
I like my camp too much to move it so the only time I get to build anything is when people let me make them a camp.
---
So, you are saying the damage numbers go up with subsequent shots, but the damage bar doesn't go down any quicker?
---
I find that for Uranium Fever and Violent Night it's much better to just get in a squad with some folk and VC so you can get some type of warning.
---
I actually want to do this cause I’m fallout 4 I loved using the red rocket stations for bases
---
That's actually the first time I had an issue. The instant I took it, a 510 shows up and just starts spamming bullets at the tiny box I built to hold a workbench. I closed the game before he could get the satisfaction of killing me.
---
Just need u/TheMangyMoose82 to stop by.
---
Hopefully
---
Love that they made a Deathclaw mask
---
Updoot for children of atom! May his light burn away your sins!
---
Did you have the supplies to craft them?
---
Yep. End game content is doing your dallies and giving away caps/gear to new players before logging out to play another game.
---
That’s what I was guessing
---
Make sure you stash your junk or the person who kills you might grab it when you die.
---
This makes me love the game even more. I cant play for a few days while I’m helping my parents move and these pics are making me want to play even worse!
---
Yes.  Just store your junk at camp and follow some high level players - they'll put you out of your misery and you lose nothing.  Some people remove their clothes so they look articularly vulnerable.  I know that sounds pervy but it works.
---
Yeah, each one adds a damage over time effect that stacks the more of them you hold.
---
Deep pocketed Pepperoni Roll. My new band name.
---
The log cabin is prebuilt. It messed with me too. The other stuff with the log cabin bundle is scattered throughout the camp building stuff
---
That's just buggy Bethesda, once you complete it's complete no matter where you go or what you do. Only thing sometimes it will lag and register, like being halfway across the map doing something else and it says ' event complete' 😶
---
Everyone gets discounts here and there. How could you tell that the ones you've seen were FO1st exclusive?
---
It's built by Michelin men😉
---
I always grab Straight jackets since at places like Eastern Regional  Penitentiary you can find tons of them in a few minutes, and they have a value of 200 caps, will usually get at at least 50 caps from each one.
---
I think recalibrating means it's still on cooldown. I believe you can only do the event every few hours.
---
As for the event itself, it just depends on the attendees. A lot of people haven't done it before, so it can be rough.
---
Aye. I'm up to about 60 hours and counting now trying to find a red and a forest
---
I don't think they can.
---
Okay I'll store my junk and let someone kill me, thank you for the responses
---
That means that there is a cooldown on that server for starting encryptid so you just served hop and you should be ok. Personally, I don’t like it when you have all the stealth builds just hiding while I activate all the pylons and then get beamed by the sheepsquatch. Sometimes I get lucky and we have people who actually know how to do the event. Other times, it’s just people with 2 brain cells who have no clue what they are doing. Hopefully they learn.
---
Where did you build this at?
---
I need it badly
---
I've got all outfits apart from red.
---
Nuka girl rocketsuit with safari Crocolossus backpack
---
Lucky hole?
---
You stay a pylon the entire time you're downed.
---
Thanks for sharing these! They look amazing!
---
Honestly I didn't think all these spots were real places
---
This game may have been rushed in a lot of areas, but analyzing West Virginia and recreating real places with detail and scaling them to the game was not one of those rushed areas.
---
Not those floaters. I have the same and was toasted by one with energy
---
The reason people say this is because it has been datamined that her landing requirements are a hittable target and a landable area. The crippling bug is definitely frustrating, but the game data shows denying her a target makes her less likely to land.
---
Louisville here, fellow Kentuckian :)
---
I only have the yellow because some nice random gave me it for free
---
That’s odd, my fe weapons stack correctly even after WL
---
Try to test this on a car if you have the time. Remove all your damage perks/buffs etc (so it doesn’t blow up immediately) and stay at the same range/position just shooting it once. Then shoot it again and see if the damage number changed
---
Damn, that's 20k right there.
---
Dammit. Sorry I wasn’t here earlier guys. 
---
Yeah that bandana came with the Stalker Outfit, wich is the Outfit Meg wears, if I remember correctly. It was in the Atomic Shop recently.
---
Pistols is totally it's own build, and not a strong one. No-sneak commando, (fully automatic rifles), has plenty of damage. Heavy guns also. Melee is pretty powerful and easy to buff. Shotguns are super buggy, including a current good bug that let's you slaughter anything. There really isn't a way to specialize in energy weapons. You would be specializing in either pistols, rifles or commando rifles- laser or plasma. Tesla is crap for endgame, just cheez pvp. If you go bloodied you can basically use any weapon class, to do top damage you definitely have to specialize.
---
That would be just as good as persistent for me. Take over the workshop, hit a few buttons and bam, there it is.
---
Your faction rating has nothing to do with the price of that plan or any, that’s just how much that plan costs! There aren’t many uses for caps in game so this is quite a good cap sink for players
---
I don’t think there’s a plan for The Dragon.
---
Ah ok, I'm with you now. Getting those 2 conditions mixed up.
---
It’s expensive no matter what. My charisma is 11 and it wants me to pay just under 9000
---
I know. It was kind of a thank you for keeping the responder vendor at charleston. 
---
I didn't get their name though as i was too busy going 'wat' 
---
Some thank you i tell you.
---
A couple of PSAs on the off chance someone reading doesn't know:
---
She's jumping into a pond so that in addition to achieving one of the main objectives of the Tadpole quest, folks can achieve an objective of the Swimming badge - one of the easier badges to complete. 
---
If AuntieKatie2's camp isn't available, a convenient place to do this is off a rope walkway outside the top accessible floor of the Charleston Herald building. There is a little creek to jump into.
---
Black powder but not dragon
---
when you make a game with only 2 maybe 3 really viable builds, then make the drops for those builds ultra-rare then make a game that allows this behavior, don't be surprised when it happens.
---
If it doesnt work you can always pmace a foundation in the water put the totem on top of it and then lower the foundation in the water so you cant see it
---
Just got the chest 30 modules later no unyielding..did roll a bolstering ap wwr so for now that's my piece.limbs are 3 unyielding scout pieces and 1 leather wwr arm.im not buying limbs not yet
---
Your friend is wrong or yanking your chain. Apart from some unknown glitch or voodoo, you can't get a schematic for it. You have to find them in the wild. Sorry.
---
Then..... stop paying????
---
im not saying i hate the game i love it btw
---
I have my main since day one and started thinking about my build at lvl 20. Nothing changed ever since ,beside a little tweak and a change of aspect.
---
My other 2 characters are just a gear mule and a ammo mule.
---
Lol yeah I meant for vats and sneak on the older fallouts I would take fast shot over targeted shots all day and now that they’re first person iron sights all the way. So does it matter how many addictions you have like does the damage stack with multiple addictions?
---
This has been an on again/off again problem with furious weapons generally, and no just furious explosive though that may be making the problem worse. Some claim it is just a visual glitch and others say it isn’t. Supposedly it was fixed a while ago but considering every time they do an update they bring back old glitches, god knows what’s actually happening.
---
I know there also used to be problems where instigating explosive weapons would not apply the instigating effect due to the fact that the explosive damage would be calculated first or something. Meaning that by the time it tested for the application of instigating, the target had already lost some health, so it wouldn’t apply. It’s possible something similar is happening with furious, where it is having some contradictory issue calculating the damage and one effect is interfering with the application of the other.
---
If NW was the first thing you logged into before AM it tends to bug. You know, it just works.
---
Hillary Clinton pantsuit.
---
Do people really believe that fences and tent standing is what stops the SBQ from landing?
---
Would these be the same people that think sleeping in a room with a fan on leads to suffocation?
---
Wasn't it No-Bark, from New Vegas who talked about the "Mole Men?" 
---
And yeah, assuming they could breed, and given 200ish years, yeah, they could have made it to the Mojave.
---
Although, that makes me wonder: Who'd win in a Fight between the Tunnelers and Mole Miners?
---
It looks friggin amazing man! Red rocket has always had such a deep place in my heart.i used to play fo4 all the time and on every save I would make my personal home red rocket.
---
I looked at the body of one, bethesda used a skeleton as the body
---
And Radiation Rumble is just a shitshow all around
---
But that writing probably isn't legally binding and isn't something that they're really accountable on. "Years" can mean literally whatever they want it to. And when you have that kind of latitude, it means you're not accountable. If they actually intend to make good on that promise then we need more than their word, because their word isn't worth very much. And if they don't intend to make good on the promise then they shouldn't have made it. I get it, there's parts of the development process that are best kept private. Trade secrets, whatever. But more communication is generally a good thing as long as you're not misleading people. And they're not communicating with us very well. They do give us long term content roadmaps, which is certainly good, but they can and should communicate more than that. *Especially* when this game is supposed to be such a social experience. This game lives and dies by its community, and devs should play an active role in that.
---
That makes my 9600 price sound less awful, but I am not at the point yet where I need to dump a bunch of caps.
---
Thanks for stopping by, moose.
---
you can buff you CHA with food too..
---
its not going help all that much relative to the prices.. but its something
---
my dude no, its really not, its a known bug that beth acknowledged and still ain't fixed.
---
When they accidentally removed the ability to damage her wings this causes explosive weaponry to stagger and reset her movement, she lands if you stop shooting her for a few secs so she can actually carry out the animation.
---
Same here.

These were taken about two weeks ago. I remember the month prior to that fallout 1st subscribers had access to the clean version of the mole outfit at a discount.
---
easiest solution, Scrap box. 
---
second easiest. throw away what you do not need, if you have 800 wood, dump 600 in the trash.
---
Make sure all your junk is scrapped before you put it in the box! Take it all out of the box, go to a workstation and press scrap all junk and put it back. It can save a ton if you didn’t know to do that
---
I've personally been to Camden Park when I was a little younger. They got a bit of it right, and then a bit of it wasnt. ( from my many experiences ) they could of based the park on its earlier years, that im sure. But regardless, its cool to see these placed brought into a game!
---
She can punch your face in quite happily if your on a tent or a fence
---
They aren't accountable to being with though, they never promised those features. They only stated that those are their intentions and it's what they are looking into adding. 
---
You people are upset because you feel cheated, but it's your own fault for not understanding what you've read.
---
You’re a legend!
---
Go to the Whitespring shops. Near the end of the row is one called Studio 78 or something. Buy plans to pimp out your camp with fancy furniture for 900 caps a pop.
---
Defo not getting a scrap box! But does bulking junk free up space?
---
Awesome! I remember getting ice cream in Harper's ferry as well when I took a trip out there. Game is a little off obviously but is still cool to see. Wish they would have at least added the old toilet paper cliff billboard
---
I’ve made sure to do that! Thanks for the tip though :)
---
Living large is the only way I feel rich in this game. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/J0tSi6x.jpg
---
make sure everything is completely broken down..
---
if it isnt a rare material or one youre constantly crafting with you dont need more than 50-100 of it.. I have no more than 25-50 of certain things I almost never use..
---
check your misc tab for unsmelted ores and gunpowder.. that shit creeps on ya..
---
That was exactly the point I was trying to make. Bloodied and junkies are pretty much the best options available since there damage is always on.
---
If it’s like everything else in the game this will change with daylight savings, the times seem to be based on a UTC of 00:00
---
Do you also lose XP if you cook food too fast?
---
No way to legitimately get it.
---
nope, it just lets you sell it. and consumes extra plastic.
---
I drive through west Virginia on my way to college, and part of the dribble takes me over the New River Gorge Bridge, it is really cool seeing it in game.
---
Have equipped ammo reduced cards (both ballistic and energy ammo) and have all ammo on you instead of in stash, also be sure you dont have any unnessecary Weight such as Drinks, food, granades, ore or junk that is not scraped first :)
---
As a fan of the fuzzy little verminoids as pets, I love your name!!!!
---
thanks a lot and don't say something like that 😁🤷
---
The far harbor diving suit would be awesome to have.
---
Oh my god, I also went this weekend.
---
Can I be an honorary member of moosegang? I can go by mangymoose69. I’ll give you guys some razorgrain and a few tin cans as a sign of appreciation 
---
Moosegang
---
Good idea, thanks!
---
Hey I think I've seen this camp lol
---
Persistent workshops and bigger camp sizes. IDK how they'll make the latter work while still being able to go to Public servers, but those are the two things they need the worst, imo. The former is/was a promised features of the paid service and it's just... missing.
---
When I had 1st, my husband and I frequented a private server just for workshops. We liked maintaining them while we did other stuff. Sure, we'd go public to sell/trade and complete a few events, but we really like the building aspect and workshops let you do that without PvP on a private server.
---
But it was all so temporary and that killed it for us. We unsubbed when Wastelanders came out and haven't even be tempted to resub.
---
Sounds like the underground camp glitch, see quite a few people doing them, some are pretty cool
---
&gt;been jogging the wrong way because I was using the map in my head of the real life places :p
---
I literally LOLed at this! I would probably do the same if they ever did a game in my area.
---
I'm just glad I can fast travel from buildings
---
To get rid of being wanted I leave something nice in my junk like a bulk copper or oil and go to white springs. I mic up remove my armor and walk through and ask for someone to take the bounty and take the junk I leave as it is a gift.  I always find someone who is willing.  I hate having that flag on me.
---
I might get rid of my ores... thank you!
---
Np 👍
---
So it’s the games fault people cheat...
---
you can smelt them in a chemistry bench..
---
Hmm, thanks none the less!
---
You must have because you didn’t even read that he’s Canadian, ya dipshit.
---
You're right, i took the time to perfect a build, why would I want to run something inferior? Because you don't like it?
---
The only time I take workshops is if it’s part of an atom challenge. 
---
Sneak in, kill the enemies, take the WS, then sneak out.  I rarely go back.
---
I'm not sure if you were looking for another answer.
---
That’s a good shout, I’ll try that out thanks
---
There is a cap on the discount. That plan is always expensive no matter what because it's rarer than the other plans.
---
What animal mutates into being able to fly by anti-gravity and shoot fire balls?
---
I like in point pleasant. We go moth man hunting and stuff of that variety. So much love to Bethesda for bringing us to the wasteland ❤️
---
So after a few tests it's like I say. First hit 37+17explo dmg and every consecutive hit still 37+17. I also test it at several enemies. No dmg stacking. Not even a visual bug because the health bar always drops constant without any boosts that are not visible.
---
Oh, well then I'm god, they pose me no threat.
---
*we're talking about those weird floaty ballsack monsters right? The ones that come in 3 different colors?
---
Stop by if you need some materials or ammo.
---
thank you! PS4 😁
---
Thank you 😁
---
Same. &gt;!They only took in girls, and turned away Brody (while taking in his companions, who were girls) to pretty much just die in the wasteland. It's kind of poetic justice that Brody ended up helping to wipe them out.!&lt;
---
&gt;!How many other boys did they turn away to die in the unforgiving wastes, for no reason other than being boys?!&lt;
---
Some 'heroes', I say.
---
I saw a Level 1308 last night on Xbox.. I was staring cause I didn't believe it.. sorry for staring if you read this 1308😁
---
*speaking Chinese*
---
Nice pics, but in the Woonburn Hall pic you incorrectly captioned the University as "VTU" for Virginia Tech University. The correct is "WVU" for West Virginia University.
---
I was being sarcastic homie, I’m on your side. The vast majority of the player base want 100% predictable gameplay with the only threat coming from AI enemies they can one shot. It’s dumb, it wasn’t the intent, and this game is supposed to be about post apocalyptic survival. So you know, hoarding useless junk, building pretty camps, and vending machines 🤣. Anything unpredictable or unkind in nature they want nothing to do with. No fight with players. Only kill queen, hoard, and bitch.
---
Yeah do that 😁 I love it too
---
Scavenger collectron would be under "resources" and the cabin should be under MISC.
---
Yea I saw something in the past about the IE bug. But it's also like you say. Every new update breaks something new, or sometimes also old updates lol
---
Can you do that event solo? I'm struggling to not get shreked by the squatch after I do the pylons.
---
Thanks a lot mate 🤣
---
Easily the best RR camp I've seen yet! Fuckin phenomenal dude! Bonus points for the great camera work
---
Thank you very much mate 😁✌️
---
my go-to is to stand perched on the pylon I activated
---
Honestly I hate the bears the most, because they will spam that maul attack that stuns you and keep beating you down.
---
It's a viable build, but depending on your playstyle, maybe not the best.
---
I never really noticed it,  until wastelanders
---
Sounds like a good idea because I hate having it as well because I'm doing dailies and just exploring looting so I rathee get killed when im ready for it. If that makes sense
---
you can see the location at 01:34min
---
Thanks mate
---
I took the workshop up by the fair, just to unlock the big walls.   Only scorched showed up to fight me.  I think I've only met one player being a jerk, and dozens being super nice.
---
People choose to cheat, simple as that. If people are so pathetic they can’t control themselves, that’s on them.
---
I’ve heard a strategy that involves becoming all the pylons then hiding in the cabin and placing a power armor chassis in the door.
---
longtime bloodied build, what I found works is to tag a pylon or two and hide (best spot is on the hut or better, a pylon) and alternate silenced rifle shots and diluted stims
---
Huh no shit. Might be an issue with ballistic explosives, my legacies work as of last night . Maybe there’s a new 250 dr while reloading-type bug that breaks primary effects? Either way that sucks man. But that’s just bethesda for ya
---
These pics are amazing! I  never would have thought the whitespring was just as tacky inside and lovely outside in real life!
---
I need an answer to this as well!
---
The firemans quest has nothing to do with the wastelanders raiders quest. An ounce of prevention is the quest you need to focus on down there, finish it, of you have, return to the overseer.
---
No problem. I was in the neighborhood anyway.
---
moreover, how about non ATX (or season) skins? they have plenty around as seen in the fo4 CC, it would be killer to have that kind of customization, with only the best/wildest (gold plating, donut shop as opposed to just polished metal/camo etc) in the time-sensitive paywalls
---
I just wonder if the rooms that are locked in the game are locked in real life... dying to find out
---
Ah dude good idea !! I will test if it's because of the 250 on my FE Handmade lol
---
That’s why I posted, I didn’t take them. I’m sick of duping. But a new player just starting out would have no idea.
---
I see, thanks :O)
---
So, I've probably bought a dozen things without even knowing they were only discounted because I had Fallout 1st. Would be hilarious if our CAMP budget/build area was also stealth-buffed without any announcement!
---
Doesnt stack with Pepperoni Roll because they're both food fortify carry weight.
---
Most people are cool, but then you get the bored lvl 200+ that just wants to ruin you just because they can
---
There's a limit on how many items you can rename, not 100% sure but think it's 50.
---
Hacked weapons are a thing. Keep an eye peeled for projectiles/sounds that don't match the held gun.
---
Cool idea
---
PIPE IS LIFE
---
Ooh, thanks for the clarification
---
Yeah u can always jump servers and re-equip the weapon to just to be sure. Happy to help
---
Yeah I just edited my post to reflect the correct error message.
---
I love fighting hordes of things. One of the few challenges left at the endgame
---
Got to do it via xbox website.
---
I canceled mine through the Microsoft subscription page online. I couldn't do it through Xbox.
---
who are you?
---
I had the same problem, you have to log in into your microsoft account and cancel it from there.
---
Same to you buddy, imagine crying about what builds other people use
---
I have a plasma grenade for 400caps if you want it.
---
A stack of 10 wood for 20 caps, maybe?
---
I just drop everything I don’t use, usually near a vendor.
---
Suicide is never the answer
---
lol
---
I hate the dam people that automatically kill the boss in uranium fever it pisses me off to the max
---
I used to work there as a teenager.
---
I'm a bloodied build, but i go troubleshooter armor set full health during this event.
---
It makes it easy, and i can even solo it holding the 3 pylons
---
He is guiding you to the spot where if you look at the ground you can interact with something (only have encountered the bass). 
---
You click on it to ply it which will bring you under the map.
---
They have got pay for those canvas bags somehow, after all the price of canvas has skyrocketed!
---
I don’t disagree, but it’s also the games fault for both driving the need and providing the solution.
---
Let’s be entirely honest here, the display case dupe method was in the gaming news for a few weeks with step by step instructions on game spy for a month before Beth officially acknowledged it.
---
The trap level up glitch was in the game for over a month before they fixed it.
---
The raiders rep glitch was there for three weeks.
---
All these things have in common?  At real ease of feature they bypass the grinding requirements.
---
You can’t tell me these things are not intentionally added or if not conveniently unacknowledged for a long time.
---
The only time Beth actually jump on shit is when it impacts other players directly like the inventory theft bug.
---
I don’t disagree it’s terrible and you can check my comment history here if actually help find glitches like this and report bugs, so I kinda know first hand just how many bugs are still in game.
---
Well I call them bugs but honestly I do believe some of them are entirely intentional.
---
The Bog, as with most late-game areas in Bethesda games suffers from what I tentatively call "Whiterun-itis". The earlier locations in open-world games get the most attention and detail put into them because more players will experience them before they put the game down. Late-game areas take time to get to, less people will likely get to them, therefore, why put in as much effort?
---
Only the ice ones do that!
---
the same reason these things exist in mobile games.  Proven to keep players coming back daily, without encouraging (even dissuading) longer marathon sessions.  
---
For some reason - maybe it correlates with higher mtx sales - high daily engagement is a meaningful metric for devs to show higher-ups.  
---
Anyway, what sucks on mobile games is massively shittier for "full featured" AAA titles.  Just my opinion, but I think it really sucks to put an entire modern/beautiful fallout experience behind all of this consumer squeezing/drip feed nonsense
---
Usually I disagree with complaints about fo1st, but you make some good points.  I’m reasonably happy with my private world, tent and stash, they’re great amenities, but the price tag does seem a little steep just for those.  The exclusive items have largely been lackluster and sparse.  I’m not a big builder, so camp budget increases aren’t too relevant, but I have been disappointed with the atx promises.  The atoms are nice, but I seem to remember being promised discounted pricing as a 1st member.
---
As the subscription stands now, I’d still pay $5-7  a month for what we have.  If additional amenities or an improvement to atx exclusives and pricing were added, I’d renew my yearly sub at the flat $100 I paid last year.
---
I haven’t had a reason yet myself. Especially for letters.
---
The body chef outfit is a relatively common drop from the meat week event which is coming up again soon i think
---
Well that's what nuclear winter is for in theory, it's why they scrapped survival, not enough PvE players care for PvP, so both type of players have their own mode. It's sadly a battle royale, but still
---
Ok it's because of the 250 bug.... But I thought they fixed it with wastelanders lol.
---
Really? That sucks, think he might have gotten it from the dev room? Maybe and hopefully it’ll be added in the next update.
---
Wouldn’t mind making some sort of baby big daddy cosplay from bioshock or something.
---
Sweet! I was born in Kentucky, ( ashland area ) me and my father would visit all the time. They tot the big dipper in the map along with the bumper cars and a few other rides. Just cool seeing this place remade. I remeber some crazy ride called the screaming eagle i beleive. Was a ferris wheel on steroids, the capsule u sat in would spine while the ferris wheel would spin !
---
By no legendary gear, do you mean like if I was a big guns build, a basic Minigun or .50 cal? I might come along, if it’s alright. Just PM me when, thanks a lot.
---
Nice! You scared me for a bit there haha. Good to know that still isn’t fixed
---
Yes just a basic .50 cal or mini
---
Oh, same. I've met more nice than not. But it only takes one really dickish person to put you off a bit.
---
Sure, but you can also mod each piece to be pocketed or deep-pocketed without affecting the legendary properties. This will greatly increase the carrying capacity.
---
And yeah - I wander about with way too many weapons too!
---
Don't have a full set of weightless yet, so the following are assumptions. If we're crouched when using both, the CSS is better hands down... in a nuke zone. But being able to walk/run should be better outside of one with a weightless set, and the tertiary effects might make up for it. I haven't used the stealth suit with a backpack user (shhh, I don't want to hear about the grind), but I'm assuming the backpack isn't active either.
---
I like the idea of an alternative armour set that literally weighs nothing with ultralight mods that you can roleplay with, or make use of situationally. So I'm kind of curious whether you'd say your "depending on your playstyle" phrase adequately encompasses that instant superman switch.
---
Thanks for sharing these!
---
I think The “duster” your talking about is probably the hunters long coat
---
My strength is 100.
---
Bruh I can never understand how people continue to sell stuff that high. I just throw my ammo in for 1 cap each. 💀
---
As someone who is truly terrified of the mothman this is both horrifying and mesmerising at the same time! Stunning pics
---
Hi all. Just know that there have been a bunch of people document the same pilgrimage. Search around and you'll see many more similar photos.
---
Wait. Whut. The Mothman is real?!?!?
---
There are additional items that pop up each week that non 1st members dont have in their atom shop and they are at a discounted price.  
---
I've seen this recently as a returning item my friend wanted showed up in the atom shop I sent them a screenshot but it wasn't in there for them.
---
That is so immature, I would buy it day 1.
---
Some have the computer kiosk to click onto to go under.  My base uses a bass.
---
Yes.  It’s a total game changer for events like Radiation Rumble and Project Paradise.
---
I’ve noticed bulking certain things does free up space. I also do it for everything so I know how much I have. Don’t need 12 bulk glass so I can sell them easily. I don’t bulk the plastic though. I just always make sure I pick up plastic. I make a fair amount from robot vendors off my bulked stuff.  🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Yea this would be dope, maybe change the Hunter/Hunted quest instead to an every other hour reward based on unique kills or time spent alive?
---
I’m on a scavenging mission for plastic right now, as I’ve realised it does free up space. Cheers for the tip :)
---
Ive got one of them on Xbox and the other on PS4......
---
Why do you keep calling it "script"?
---
That's fking awesome. Your base building skills are superb.
---
Zug zug !
---
I like the bog a lot.  Open and pretty, underscored with intermittent but guaranteed danger to all but the most prepared. (Easy to get acclimated to it, but it helps to remember any spot is filled with max level scorched, raiders, robots, mirelurk kings/queens, and you might be beset upon by as many as 3 SB's at once)  
---
I appreciate the open quiet areas you might find between the danger spots, to take a breath and soak in the area.  Most other areas don't have quite the same kind of views (save for cliffs, and even then it's all LoD)   
---
I also like how everything isn't tinted green (mire).  I think it manages to feel much less same-y after repeated trips than the other contrasting biomes (ash heap/toxic valley)
---
That said, more of it wouldn't hurt and I agree watoga feels pretty useless for such a cool light urban environment.  Larger plains of danger and more to do in the city, etc.
---
RMT and get some of the money back you’ve wasted on this game. Basically I just play to make real money now. The game is boring.
---
Those bobbleheads don't weigh much though
---
You can get the schematic for the black powder pistol and rifle from Whitespring I believe, but I believe everyone else is correct in saying there is no plan in game for The Dragon.
---
I think you're overestimating the amount of min maxers, I do see your point but I don't think it would be that bad
---
So your in groups of 3 and it’s whoever controls a workshop first? And what are the plan rewards, if you don’t mind me asking.
---
Wifi boosters have to be placed where the signal is still good for them to be effective which could be a problem you are having.
---
Although Ive never used those etherner over powerline things they just sound like a bad idea all around, you want any data wires to be away from higher voltages so being on the same wire just sounds like bad times.
---
SSD will be huge on load times, but if youre not replacing your main drive and plugging it in the USB youll likely be limited by the USB speed.
---
Troubleshooter armor and full health.
---
What’s going on Sunday? I haven’t heard anything
---
Or Bethesda could use his suggestion which wouldn't affect your experience
---
Did you get to see the vault full of gold?
---
Crossbow bolts too. Who buys them for 8 caps per bolt?
---
Roasted ant meat give plus 10 and I believe deathclaw stakes give 20
---
I’m on Xbox 😬
---
I've lost out on a ton of scrip because I wasn't paying attention and put legendaries into the machine. It does warn you but I'm used to ignoring those messages.
---
However I did this today and it actually stopped me. It said the vendor didn't have enough scrip.
---
So it seems you can give things away for **nothing** but not for **less scrip**.
---
Why not they already have piles of scorchbeast poop. So they just have to shrink it.
---
Apologies. I feel /fo76 has become a forum for bullying and essentially the pve community is far more toxic than the pvp players. Fundamentally because they don’t understand why they are killed and think its all unfair. That coupled with their abusive behaviour here makes them griefers themselves.
---
Cook up a whole bunch of scorchbeast steak with carnivore mutation or a bunch of Nuka quantum with the cola nut perk.  Add either to favorites and enjoy the heals.  Your bloody DPS should make quick work of the event.
---
I’ve heard the shielded mod for it is set to give +4 Strength and 2 other stats as well
---
Exactly
---
My main has her vendors on the surface in the shady shack and has her main camp underground next to middle mountain cabin if your on Xbox you can check it out gamer tag is same as Reddit name
---
That's cause the gun starts auto,  guns that start semi and change to auto use half the amount of ap.... Try the original sub machine gun that used 45s its terrible too
---
I just meant switching the names but sure
---
Wow! They did a really good job with representing these places in fallout world ! And I almost forgot, really good pictures !
---
I'd say almost everyone needs to know this, same thing with duped xmas plans.
---
Sometimes poop can come from a lootbag too, so maybe make one that looks like a butt
---
A fixer plan, a serum plan, a few dense armor plans and porably a smores plan if i find one more on my mules other than that I'll let people pick. Otherwise yes it will be whoever takes the workshop first and holds it for either specific time or we will do a stock count for deaths
---
Oh I see. I’ll keep that in mind next time thanks.
---
I read that as immanure.. oh dear
---
Never knew that, played the game for a while too.
---
I had one character for the first 6 months of playing, then I created a mule. Today I have all 5 characters, lowest is 100 highest 200. With fallout first it allows you to acquire massive amounts of stuff. I’m max caps on all, 500k 5.56, 1k each stable flux. Tons of good legendary weapons and armour. And if you get a good bloodied weapon on a high health character you can move it. The only downside is grinding things like the backpack for each character and also that secret service stuff cannot be traded. I log in to each character to do a few dailies then pick one randomly to play for a few hours.
---
Why not? Bethesda has always done well modeling real world places in their games
---
Thankfully, nobody nuked the RL Whitesprings while you were there.
---
Both Juice and Rifle seem like nice guys, but they both have their fair share of illegitimate items.
---
You mean the legendary enemies? UF doesn't have a boss in it.
---
Same, sadly I never got to try the UNSTOPPABLE MONSTER, as I never played survival, but I did get lucky enough to get a god roll on the wastelanders gauntlet, with the exact same legendary effects as the UNSTOPPABLE MONSTER.
---
Lol, I might try that.
---
Have you tried not undervolting?
---
Great photo. I gave my L50 outfit to the Commander and managed to find another Eye of Ra to complete it for her recently. Looks better on her to be honest...
---
I'm not surprised. People can say all the bad stuff they want about Bethesda, and they'd most likely be right, but actual modelling has always been their strong point. Every real world place in their games very closely resembles the real world one
---
Go to documents/my games/fo76 and  open Fallout76Prefs.ini with notepad (maybe make a backup first), search  for the line 'iPresentInterval=1' and change it to  'iPresentInterval=0'.
---
If you  experience movement problems indoors - usually in PA - use the nvidia control panel and limit the max fps for FO76 to a little bit under your  actual monitor frequency.
---
It is an in un-official celebration of the sheepsquach and imposter sheepsquach started by YouTuber AngryTurtle.  The idea is to outfit your character in the sheepsquach mascot outfit. Hopefully getting everyone on a server to show up at an public event in costume.. I know kind of dumb but I think fun.  And of course run the encrypted event and free range event too to celebrate all things sheepsquach!
---
That would help with the immersion, even if it was every few months, that mailbox in Foundation has to be fixed by now. At this point though the Fissure site should be always highly irradiated with hourly Queen fights or maybe finally close the fissure and make a new boss or move her to another fissure.
---
Yeah it’s usually the bass. Since it’s tall and the neck can stick out of the ground. You interact and play the instrument which moves you into the base under the ground.
---
I mean, not the fallout series, exactly.  They built structures that were certainly inspired by real life, but looks like they used construction plans to model WV.
---
That's awesome!!!!!!
---
I must have scripted 5 legacy explosive energy weapons back in the day. Just wasn’t my build.......
---
Thanks I'll try this
---
that’s cool 😎
---
Fallout 76 lets not lump all possible future and past titles in with it
---
I hope the establishments that 76 focus's so heavily on like the white springs embrace the fallout exposure like most of the places in Nevada and some in DC do.
---
I get excited when I see this because it means they don’t know what they’re doing and might have some treasures!  I got an UY/Cav/strength scout chest at a vendor like this for like 1k caps.
---
Omg bethesda should release that flower print chair in the atomic shop. Yes I WOULD pay for that 😆
---
No. In fact much of the junk doesn't weigh much, until you start hoarding everything.
---
I can't tell if this /s or woosh. Maybe wooshception on my part.
---
Oh that’s cool! I only have the mascot outfit, I guess that’ll have to do for me lol
---
Dupers, using their powers for good.
---
You can turn them in for unique rewards like a mascot outfit or a weaponized paddle ball
---
I play stealth and try take the pylons. Easy to keep hold of them when noone can see you to kill you so you can keep the squatch vulnerable! My problem is when it's a stand off because everyone else is waiting for someone else to do a pylon. Only time I've ever done it was stealth taking all 3 pylons myself because noone else would, spamming about 100 stims lol.
---
i think you can use them at camden park to buy rewards
---
Oh that’s disappointing
---
Idk if this is a bug but every single NPC vendor I've been to in the past couple days have been selling items at their base value with 0% taxes on them
---
You don’t. Give Todd your money
---
Don’t store: 
---
Food
---
Chems
---
Mini nukes
---
Missiles
---
Grenade rounds
---
Non legendary weapons or armor
---
Also check your misc tab and turn any ore into scrap by smelting.  Bulk excess scrap and sell it to a vendor bot.  Set up a vending machine and sell excess ammo for one cap each, people will buy it.  I sell all common plans / recipesfor zero caps; most other plans for 25 caps or less.  Plans can add up if you have tons!
---
If so, I've been waiting for the Spikehawk for my character for ages now. It's like they don't want me to spend Atoms?
---
What kind of rewards?
---
Why are you talking about yourself in 3rd person Todd?
---
This is the person you are talking about. 
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GbdW83ClUGY
---
well depends on how many you have
---
Personally, I think storing is safest. Or taking big ticket items out of the machines. I have seen some walled off vendors, but I don’t know if someone couldn’t find a way in if they really wanted.
---
I made the mistake of following an individual to his underground “lair” and it turned out to be a den of utter depravity.  Be careful.
---
You can remove mods from weapons you're not using and armor pieces can be modded to ultra-light if you've learned the plans
---
Could you like explain this glitch to me in a dm, I would love to conduct some dark magic voodoo if I can upgrade my useless ass pet shrimp
---
With Bethesda always assume incompetence first.
---
if you got 500 you can get one of the most tedious suits in the game but if you have 200 or 300 you can get one piece of that suit its the dirty mr fuzzy mascot outfit
---
r/ihadastroke
---
I remember when wastlanders came out I was running a vampires heavy build nothing in the game could touch me
---
I got thrown into the ring with the floaters in the raiders line and I basically dropped immediately. 
---
At high level they are ridiculously challenging in close quarters
---
I have the same problem, with a RTX 2060 Super OC card.
---
In some places (Whitespring, or Watoga where the landed vertibird parking, etc) my FPS drops im half.
---
Also, indoors (like the overseers house), if I turn around, its not continous...
---
Exactly in the same position as you. Level 120 and wondering whether to start another character because I've done all the quests etc. Got a nice Gatling plasma from someone's vendor yesterday and wondering about heavy guns. Either that or I might just start stacking up perk points so I can change on the fly when I want to switch it up.
---
Did u use it as internal or external? Does it matter?
---
I have been seeing the sbq land lately regardless of where people are.
---
Yes, CSS/W stealth seems similar and CSS has movement. Yes, CSS for nuke zone. 
---
*But being able to walk/run should be better outside of one with a weightless set, and the tertiary effects might make up for it.*
---
IDK what this means.
---
Backpacks **can** be use with a CSS. With my perks/mutations and an armor backpack I get DR/ER/Rad 280/290/1000. 
---
I always carry a CSS for radiation and an assortment of backpacks to tweak things, but I usually run with an unyielding set. It's just as stealthy, give or take, and gives me lots of Perception and Agility/AP for VATS. That's what I meant by playstyle.
---
Lost World Caverns is Uncanny Caverns in-game. I love Lost World; such an amazing place.
---
If lackadaisically bouncing a flaming spiked ball of death at enemies is boring then yea
---
and i dont know any other rewards i think the cheapest is probably some stuffed animals and or scrap then i think theres some other outfits but the mr fuzzy could probably get you 10-15 US dollars but im not sure because i dont really buy outfits but i know people want it or you could get quite a few caps maybe like 10000 max
---
To anyone's knowledge, is this possible on PC as well?
---
I have gone to my own camp and I load before the camp does, does this mean it can be replicated?
---
Thanx for the warning!
---
Bruh wut? The bowling ball bag is one of the best looking ones.
---
It’s your fault for being over budget, it’s the only way it’s possible.
---
You don’t save legendaries in rumble dude
---
yea im only interested in camp items like the mothman stuff but i dont need camp stuff im just going to put two circus trailers together and surrond with 500 gorillas or something
---
I list ammo at 3:1 because it draws people to my camp. Then I make bank selling the shit I actually want to sell, and successfully continue hoarding the ammo until I want to use it or sell it. Now and then I run into people desperate for ammo, and make bank off of them as well. Pretty good system tbh, particularly considering that I underprice everything else.
---
Ok, so I found the cabin building options, for walls and such, but where is the cabin itself supposed to be?
---
alright, thanks, I'll check it out, can I revert back to the standard servers again afterwards if I wish?
---
There is one on one chat on the Xbox which I relied on heavily before I learned  how the whole communicate-using-gestures things worked in the FO76 universe.
---
Don’t use building exploits and then it’s not possible.
---
Thank you!
---
Autocorrect my bad
---
Internal, ps4 is not engineered to support ssd speed, you probably get a 5% upgrade...it's pretty unnoticeable. 😐
---
That's not the only way, you are grossly misinformed.
---
I have the blue asylum worker hat
---
Except using resources for a bad idea does affect everyone’s experience.
---
I have 2 water purifiers a junk extractor and all my crafting benches. It has nothing to do with the budget glitch you're referring to, and since you're so well-versed in it perhaps you are the cheater?
---
I think I have a death claw gay limb in my collection. Only thing is, I’m XBOX and I won’t be online until 11
---
How about both.  Just do a straight double weekend.  Double reputation, double exp, double gold, double cap limit...
---
Ok, very good.
---
Ah, I didn't think it'd work together for some reason, but that sounds like a good combo. What I meant by effects was, having WWR or sneak, and especially AP regeneration.
---
 I've been using CSS in nukezones and have to do canned coffee runs to maintain my vats performance. Maybe I should just switch to a handmade and aim more, but CSS seems like it must have a hidden cost to it beyond that and not being able to use the pipboy effectively.
---
It’s part of the Vault raid prep questline for the Settlers.
---
Oh great one, inform me then. Has never happened to me and I got ton of visitors daily, you would think these people would steal from me if they could, no? But they can’t cause I’m not over budget.
---
They suck
---
It’s in the very last tab.
---
and i want for tattos and maybe body tattoos cause thatd be hot with like different colors or like face tats that arent from fallout 4 like add those but make them free but add special ones that stick for like 100 atoms or something character customization is key to everyones heart i mean look at the elder scrolls and fallout nexuses the most popular mods are character customization and maybe more specific body customization so i can create big tiddy mommy goth gf with big dumptruck and big milky
---
Part of wastelanders
---
Still haven't seen anyone post any proof of this actually happening. I've had my vendors running constantly since they came back online and nothing untoward has happened. Not gonna lie though, I do keep a keen eye on my weapon displays to make sure the weapons haven't been stolen.
---
I just tried Radiation Rumble for the first time yesterday. I say tried, because we sure as hell did not succeed. I think I'm better prepared for next time, but who knows.
---
Floating worms? Fuck it, Noah get the boat.
---
I'm trying to do a service to the community, and you are being toxic. I am well under budget and I don't appreciate your negativity.
---
I think it's one of the settler's quests, the one with the Army.
---
Did you wave a flag?
---
When it does that to me, I back out of vendor, go back in, then I can assign the price.  I find that is a little faster than the time spent trying over and over again, until it accepts it.
---
Being over camp budget only makes the exploit easier. Exploit is possible even if you are not over budget.
---
Then don’t set your prices to 0, people CANNOT steal from your vendor. If you are spamming buttons while you’re in the stash/vendor it can also put stuff up without your consent.
---
Those are just the selfish ones. I’m a stealth sniper, and I’ll still go to take the pylons every time.
---
Found a vendor with 40,000 of them earlier, 10 caps each.
---
I’d say you’re better off shopping player vendors for legendary versions. I do a fair amount of shopping, and see solid unarmed melee weapons all the time.
---
A cheap, but very serviceable weapon would be one star Instigating.
---
You can also try the purveyor; I’m routinely buying scrip below 5.
---
This is possible on pc too.
---
Oh right I forgot Bethesda never does that lol
---
It is possible even if you do not go over budget.
---
I honestly believe if it was possible people would have stolen from my camp as well, something doesn’t add up.
---
&gt; because the location was anoying
---
How so?
---
Awesome camp BTW
---
I looked there, what's it actually called?
---
I know two people that have had the same thing happen to them, and they are not over budget. My friend had 20 pieces of armor and 30 legendary weapons that were all cleaned out in under a minute. The player that stole everything was hopping the map faster than I'd seen anyone do before. I've heard of people with modded PlayStations that are able to load into a camp and steal from their stash regardless of their budget.
---
No. They fall under the same rules as the atomic shop times. Locked to that account. (Gold items are locked to that character I believe)
---
Thanks a lot 😁 there is a fissure site and scorch east is attacking my camp every fey minutes 🤷
---
There is no proof, I’ve had my vendors up since they fixed the dupe and have yet to have anything stolen.
---
Anytime!  Glad to help!
---
Charred Feral Ghouls are what make me close the piano and leave. They are vicious AF and take a lot to take down.
---
I'm sorry but you're wrong.
---
Can confirm. I’m a DC metro area native and I’m a little jealous that they nailed one state over so very well while we get Fallout 3 haha.
---
To be fair, this is the first time I’ve heard of this too. I never used the camp budget glitch, I have a lot of people visiting my camp every day, and never have anyone “steal” from me. And I have things in my stash that are expensive, too. Things people would *want* to take. So until there’s actual proof of what you’re claiming, it’s going to be very hard to believe you.
---
It is a drop at encrypted so maybe you will get it Sunday, personally I want the fixer plan but I just don't seem to have the luck to get it .. 0 out of probably 40
---
Unfortunately didn’t get a chance to visit. They do tours and events though. Might be a fun Halloween trip!
---
Sucks to be you. If your camp is so easy to steal from maybe I should come find you.
---
Nice. Good point.
---
You are a terrible person. I'm only trying to help you.
---
I'm not sure what you mean by wave a flag. I have not finished much of the settlers quests yet
---
It shouldn't only have 150 scrip in it to start
---
10 legendary modules = 500 scrip
---
daily limit on modules 10
---
scrip carry limit 1000
---
odds of crafting a  legendary useful for your build .0001
---
just do the damn math
---
It's almost like they don't want people playing the game.
---
Because it is not 100% guaranteed method. Apparently it works "sometimes". The easiest way for it to work is if you have shit ton of stuff in your camp (over the budget makes it easier) AND, this is important part.. You vendors are close to your camp spawn spot. So there are few variables that affect the chance the exploit could work on your camp. If your vendors are far from spawn spot you are pretty safe.
---
Among socialites, it must be very tasteful.
---
Source: I have a wealthy fashion designer as an in-law who adores this place.
---
I think it’s a blessing - think about it, you can’t just come in and get to ranking up like it’s nothing because of previous experience. You have to grind it out and establish new ways of playing it’s a good way to prevent boredom
---
I have family working for TSMC, the dye manufacturer that AMD uses on their 3900X chip... The motherboard manufacturers set the voltage to 1.5V and the dye is rated for 1.35V.... So unless you undervolt it you can expect 90C+ temps at high usage and a much shorter life span.
---
I have run Cinebench and Realbench, my scores are well above other 3900X users.
---
I can set the voltage to 1.35V and basically achieve the same score if I don't hit the thermal limit.
---
Sorry for wall of text but being an ex-Intel fanboy there were a lot of misconceptions to solve when I jumped to Ryzen, much less hand-holding by the motherboard.
---
What are building exploits and why are you getting downvoted?
---
Couldn’t find Vault 79. Maybe next trip 😂
---
gotcha so I will get there eventually probably. I just got Foundation to get inoculated and am doing side quests atm
---
thatd be cool if they added a celebration for us to party in and youd have to emote to get a sheepsquach to come out and then fight him and he would be like the level 100 legendary sheesquach like in the project paradise and you can get limited cosmetics and camp items and maybe like a free emote where you have to take a sheepsquach horn and craft a "sheepsquach horn" :) and you blow into it like a war horn and it could be like "fat snatch" event but more community related rather then hurry everyone kill the mega sloth before level 2000000 virginboi69 kills it for scrip or sells a level 12 bloodied wooden leg for 5000000 caps or 100 bucks on ebay
---
They also have better stealth detection than other humans like raiders, better than super mutants, better than colonel gutsys and robobrains. The only thing they don't have better stealth detection than are underground burrowers like radscorpions which apparently see right through stealth. So yeah, cultists have weird stats for sure.
---
So we should advocate for them to do that more? Or are you intentionally being foolish?
---
Can also destroy things you hide behind or in.
---
Don’t steal the telephones!
---
Lol, yeah I forgot my power armor at home. Would’ve been a problem 😂
---
Yes can happen on PC. Only happens if you've used an exploit to build over camp budget though.
---
Anyone on PC wanna celebrate sheepsquatch day?
---
“16 times the detail”
---
Well, half of what they mentiined in the op, while being guaranteed, remains a very short-timed buff which is a total pita to keep all the time. So yeah, without taking severe damage to your nerves you'll only keep about 40-50% of this and that's it.
---
I hate it. If the machine has 2 scrip and I have a 3 or a 5, lemme stuff it in. But oh you'll kindly tell me "Hey, you have 995 and this is worth 15, are you sure??"
---
There's always a first time for everything, especially in this game.
---
that is so fricking sexy yes please bethesda ill suck todds toes if he would allow a little more of that atomic shop money to go into the game and not his pocket
---
If you are after the plans, go to Pleasant Hills Cementary behind Lewisburg. There are 3 level 3 safes there with a good chance for weapon plans. Open them, if they dont have what you want don't remove anything from the safe, just hop servers and try again. Will take some time, so shopping at player vendors might be faster.
---
By the way, it’s West Virginia Day, IRL!
---
I've already submitted video to Bethesda of this happening, but unfortunately I cannot post that here because it violates the rules.
---
dang i wish you was on pc i have both and id guve them too you
---
Has other's said yeah it work and its  a massive game changer  i just imagine if the chainsaw could with the v fast it would have been so fucking good XD
---
Beautiful. Are you in game? Curious what it looks like it person! ign Ghostwheei    (last letter an i)
---
I'll be on in a couple min
---
Shoot, I can’t say I actually know the name...but I’m pretty sure that it’s just “log cabin” or something along those lines.
---
hope you get them tho
---
If they are just following the in game suggested pricing it doesn’t seem to discriminate legendaries from non, another time I got a furious ffr gat laser for like 600ish caps.  Sometimes it works in our favor, though I agree it’s annoying as heck to see ammo you want at an absurd price.
---
Seems legit
---
One would think that after 20 years of hair style mods being one of the most common and popular mods since Morrowind, they would abuse the crap out of that now that they have a pay system.
---
Yet... they only added like 2 in the Atom shop. That already existed in FO4. I don't know if they're just really dense, lazy, or both.
---
That is not true. Unconfirmed sources claim they move only forward. Unfortunately their ultimate love beyond reason of RNG makes a roll on 360 degree for direction.
---
Hearsay doesn't prove anything. I called bullshit on this when it was mentioned directly after the vending machines came back online, it did not go down well.  If I'm honest I haven't seen or read anything since that's changed my opinion. 
---
Also people modding playstations for the sole purpose of looting people's stashes, lol.  What about the people with stupidly powerful PC's, they must be making a killing.
---
Me too. I dump all my extra ammo in train stations near the stash box.
---
I do manage to average around 500 usually so it is a decent chunk you can have. The only parts I don’t have/use are +Strength on all my armor along with the 6am to 6pm Strength perk, any of the Strong Back perks, or any form of consumables. 
---
I have on odd occasions but over 600 carry weight but it’s almost never necessary. I usually run full weight reduction perks and a full set of weapon weight reduction. So if I REALLY need to haul shit I can carry almost 20k pounds worth of anything that can be weight reduced
---
He is most likely getting downvoted because camp budget exploits are not the only way the exploit can work.
---
I feel the same bro :(
---
Why would they duplicate handmades when we can just build them anytime we want?
---
I don’t care about being downvoted, building exploits are when you use certain tricks and camp objects to place as much as you want in your camp. Ignoring the budget limit
---
Add me and I’ll help you. I’m on now!
---
How do they were dupers
---
Scorchbeasts yes should outclass the deathclaws, but a snallygaster, moth man should be weak in comparison or even a Grafton monster should be similar in strength. Remember deathclaws aren’t a natural creature they were made by the us government to be killing machines, same as most cryptids. I do think the behemoths should outclass them too but deathclaws need a buff I encountered a few pre lvl 50 and they died too quick.
---
Haha, in Fallout 3 i always thought " i hope the real metro isn't as complicated as the in-game"
---
what system im on pc i think i have a bloodif deathclaw gauntlet
---
Lol I see these all over the place. I’ll start collecting them for you and let you know when I get a bunch of them then you can come grab them from me
---
i knew it, that player was robbing me, that adhesive wasn't just desapear like that,  an a lot of other things, how can they allow those players to even be playing atm
---
I went recently too, only saw Harper's Ferry and Point Pleasant tho
---
Again, I'm trying to inform people of what's happening. It was very stressful to see it happening to myself and my friends. If you want to be hateful, go to a protest. I'm being genuine and I dont want this to happen to anyone else.
---
Yea legendary enemies
---
Using camp budget exploits only make this exploit easier to work. It is not required.
---
both and also they are too busy filing todds crusty brain trying to unlock that skyrim dream he had
---
If I ever visit the Fort Defiance IRL first thing imma do is check if they have those asylum suits in the bathrooms 😂
---
Just use logic, go to restaurants, look for kitchens, that's where you'll find the most spatulas
---
Who did the what now?
---
Hey I just recently had some last minute plans come up and I’m wondering if you’ll be on around 8-9 EST?
---
Gonna try and find the thing I saw so I can show you lol
---
Thank you OP, very cool!
---
it happened to me yesterday I even post, and happened exactly how he describe a player was hiding on my camp with a stealth armor and crouch at front of my vending machine, a lot of junk desapeared.
---
yes i have to have that one perk that makes ammo like 90% lighter because im always carrying so much at least lemme scrap the ammo i have to make more of what im willing to keep that perk on like 5mm or .50 or 5.56
---
These pictures are amazing
---
Yeah that would suck lol
---
video or not real
---
cant see cant believe
---
they can't see it because they are Bugthesda's Simp
---
And they should throw you dealing massive damage kind of like a wendigos colossus scream but your just getting tossed away instead.
---
that person sucked a lot of paddle balls if you know what i meant ;)
---
Have to be honest, I think a lot of it is down to the game itself.
---
How are other games performing?
---
Do you mean Legendary Handmades? Because the Purveyor gives out Legendary Handmades like they are candy. I have 5 of them.
---
I would prefer the plans, to be honest. Ill definitely give it a shot, thankyou!
---
man i feel like i been there and i never put a foot in the states lmao
---
They must have tossed a lot of dross too...
---
Here is my fav quote from stackoverflow: "It works for me." Needless to say this has no real meaning. Not happened to you does not mean it cannot happen to others.
---
Ofc proof would be cool.
---
But with timestamp and userid they should easily verify it.
---
But on a side note, you never heard of players paying other players real money for legendaries? Some people were making 10000$+ from it
---
I'm talking about high value, god roll handmades. Bloodied, 25 faster fire, 25% less action point cost
---
The idea started on PC so help spread the word AngryTurtle, SHgames, InnovSurvivalist seem to be on board and I think have discord 🙂
---
i did that in real life lets just say 
---
cumcockballshit😔
---
Lmao gay limb? I am also on xbox, and in no hurry at all considering the grind for most of the things you want in this game.
---
maybe they mean evolve as in as slowly as biology's evolution that takes decades or centuries.
---
I can't be the only one that thought of this instantly.  
---

---
Many people usually suggest bulking stuff until you get down to 100 of most scrap, but if you don't have all the plans for gear yet and still want them, just craft and scrap a few weapons or armor that uses up the scrap you have well over 100 of. You won't get the extra caps like you would selling Bulk, but I'm still a noob and am missing many plans, so this helps!
---
I do have adrenaline maxed out I forgot to mention that, it’s a great card. Although I don’t have gunfu, I can’t even remember what that does.
---
Hey thanks!!! Gonna check their videos for it
---
Fuck, I can't sell .45 ammo for 1 cap per at the moment, nevermind 10 caps. There seems to be a lack of buyers.
---
Ah blue berry is blue. The added the effect to railway rifles back when survival mode was a thing because they didnt before
---
Thank you! This helped a lot in all outdoor areas, for my home near the golf course I get about 40 FPS now, 70-85 elsewhere. 
---
I can live with just the housing area being an issue
---
Betesda
---
Im on Xbox unfortunately. Probably wouldve been good to put that in the post, i apologize! A bloodied gauntlet would be sick. If only crossplay was a thing in FO76.
---
I have one on mine and they do glow.
---
This isn’t a controversial thing. Just look at TF2 and CS:GO. A golden frying pan, which is even more RNG than a good roll in 76, can go for $3k.
---
Huh, so I guess Explosive Railway Rifles are gonna stay. That's good, because I want to get one.
---
Exactly. I had hundreds of junk from every category stolen from me, but I had a really awesome player come along that witnessed the incident and gifted me some junk. I was ready to give up that day, but there are some excellent people in the fallout community. Be very watchful of anybody that is at your base and isn't appearing on your map. If they're crouching by your vending machines -- screenshot them or record them immediately and send it to Bethesda as I did. Unfortunately if you managed to get a video of them stealing your goods, you will not be refunded those legendary items junk or whatever it may be. I've taken one video and nearly 20 screenshots of different players using this method. If a player doesn't show up on your map they're preparing to rob you.
---
Start with AngryTurtle that is where I found out about it.
---
I'm always on the lookout for .45
---
I like bugthesda myself, fits better
---
Gotcha, thats what i was thinking i just didnt know if there was certain locations that had them. But hey, thanks for the information i appreciate it!
---
Are the pistol and rifle plans sold in the shops, or are they supposed to be lootable somewhere there? I would like both those plans for entertainment reasons :)
---
I did tours of both the insane asylum and the prison, and they still pop up in my nightmares from time to time.
---
I still laugh at the people for wasting their money
---
That's a glitch in general, not because of vampire's.
---
Same here, most of that ammo just sits around forever until I get tired of seeing it and dump it all in a train station suitcase or something.
---
and Bugthesda is slowly becoming like corporates portrayed in their game, such irony
---
What about Toddthesda?
---
3 pylon tanking the encripted event is the main issue I have with balancing my stash weight.
---
I hardly EVER use stims and colas (w/ cola nut) during normal play.  Maybe 1 or 2 over an hour of play tops, so I tend to accumulate them.  WIth Encryptid though, 3-tanking the pylons means I may blow through 20 stims and colas each fairly easily.    Makes it a pain in the rear to decide how many to stash (at 1 lb apiece).
---
The people that have no impact on you and are making an adult choice to spend their own money.
---
76 is one of the biggest fiascos in the video game world
---
Yup and I find it hilarious
---
I used to keep all my lead, steel and gunpowder in my stash. I don't bother anymore and just craft it all into ammo and carry it with me.
---
*Any players that have had Fallout 1st for at least 25 years now have a 20% increase in CAMP budget AND a 25% increase it CAMP size. Thanks for all the support
---
-Bethesda*
---
Ohh that kind of thing... Fools and their money are easily parted.
---
Such wasted opportunity to introduce a companion that is obsessed with them and not do anything with it.
---
I turned in exactly 150 today. So happy.
---
Remove scrip daily limit, reduce amount returned by each item by half (keep us playing).
---
*laughs in raider*
---
Hear, hear! I live in Huntington and seeing the mothman and esp. Camden Park and the pumpkin house in Fallout-verse is insane.
---
They are sold in one of the hunting shops. The bot’s name might be Flintlock or something like that. Just keep walking into the hunting shops with the Bear rugs and what not and you’ll find the vendor.
---
Great pictures. I was sad to see that Helvetia seems to be more run down than I expected. I didn't realize only a few dozen people actually live there. I went searching for any places to donate, and there is a local nonprofit group, Kultur Haus Helvetia, dedicated to restoring/preserving the buildings and supporting the community. Worth checking out. 
---

---
Sometimes Juicehead mixes Fallout 4 gameplay in with 76, could’ve been that.
---
Ohhhh the weight, the heavy heavy weight of necessary water! :)
---
Howardsoft
---
Ikr, I would feel like shit if I spent 500$ on a video game gun, straight up stupid tbh
---
Lard-asses in power armor blocking my shots tends to be more annoying.  They are usually the ones pumping heavy weapons damage into her so I suppose it is what it is.
---
Hey, bug bugs in game isn't as bad as using cheats or cheated weapons. Normally, companies try to deal with this just by bans. If a player is reported, they should also veryfy that player inventory and check if its ok or not and take some action.
---
Yup! But it's sells nicely to robots.....
---
I assumed most people would, given the love of The Fixer, but I've had 3500 bullets sitting in my vendor for the last 15 hours (over 2 days). I'm sure they'll go eventually, I'm in a low traffic area (far east mire) which is probably the main reason)
---
Friend of mine yesterday, he got a croc backpack plan and b ffr fixer from a guys vending. He said the guy logged before he could buy anything else.
---
I asked if the camp was way over budget, but he wasn't sure. No one is going to put those items in a machine on pc.
---
OH I passed by this house the other day! Very nice build! :)
---
I did not, I saw that he buy it some items and I could not see him on the map then I teleport to my camp ,I thought was a low lvl, did no saw no one there and all my adhesive was gone in that frame time he appeared crouched behind a chair close to the vendor, I turned off the machines as fast as I could and he ran away, if I knew about that bug I would had reported him. I mean common man robbing the junk of a new player how useless someone can be to do that.
---
The key to it being quick is the number of people taking pylons. When there’s a lot of players, there’s often multiple people grabbing them and it’s confusing. Ultimately it leads to them being down as people die. 
---
When just one person takes all 3 and hides, it’s easy to kill the imposter quickly because they pylons go up and stay up.
---
Have you looked on eBay? Lotsa stuff for sale on there.
---
God, floaters. You aren't paying attention and they spring up mid looting and after they're dead they explode and cover you in fire/acid and slow you down. Worse if a freezer slows you in said fire/acid while the rest wail on you.
---
There’s a lot more in common than I expected! Must have been hard walking around Helvetia without being able to jump on the roofs with marsupial.
---
Restart the game/console
---
It's under Mslc. Structures and its called Log Cabin
---
I remember back in World of Warcraft, someone dropped like 10 grand on someones account to get their character for their end-game gear. Like a day later Blizzard got wind of it and banned the sold account. Ouch.
---
The area around golf course seems to have quite some problems with textures, never put a camp there so I did not bother looking for other improvements/settings. Maybe someone else can help with that
---
Everyone else on here just said she wont land because of a bug now she only landed for me cuz of a bug?  Sounds like y'all have no idea what your talking about and just need somthing to complain about
---
Lmao I haven't personally searched for any legendaries for sale, but I imagine every site you can sell stuff on has a fallout76 legendary on it lol
---
prices should be low like super low like 1 and or 0 caps because i can go craft 5000000 10mm for some lead steel and perks with no loss or caps and your selling it for 10 jeez or going buy suggested prices on some fallout website like wooden armor for 10000 nobodys buying it why keep it in there i understand rare items being expensive like the dico ball or the winter man mask being 10000k but jeez armor is not worth anything unless you get a full set of perfect roll marine or scout armor nobodys buying it and ammo is worthless i cam make enough ammo to beat the game twice and kill the sbq 4 times nobody cares about your janky ass prices and also stop putting legendary pipe weapons for more than 10 caps because nobodies buying it unless its cheap i can get 3000 caps a day because my prices are low as shit and people do buying sprees at my vendors
---
Just like how i laugh at people who spent real money buying the legendary mask only for it to grt turned into a non legendary mask.
---
they allow the cheaters.. then they ban some of them for a little while.. then they allow the cheaters again..
---
Rinse &gt; Repeat
---
Lmaooo I bet the other guy who got 10K felt amazing
---
Which mask?
---
If it's happening so often, and you know you have to film it... Why aren't you filming it?
---
yea fr i hope you get the best melee weapon in the game because your awesome have a good day 👉👌
---
Or anywhere for that matter, those items are way more valuable than caps... I'm on ps4 and I would trade my right arm for that backpack lol. I love it!
---
as they say.. you cant fix stupid...
---
you should have becket in a prison cell or like one of the allies and rp they are your raider prisoner
---
they really do need to turn up the spawn re-rate on everything.imagine if you could never really clear out a place. either keep fighting or leave. sounds fun to me!
---
I'm a bloodied cammando and I can have all 3 pylons active just cant do anything but spam stims
---
I am from Wv and the models are great, the geography is real bad though.
---
I've seen posts that they used to ban accounts that shouted something they consider "rasist" using microphone, but at the same time letting cheaters play is so disgusting.
---
🔫 Stay back you savage!!
---
judging from what I see posted seems like people want 2 things..
---
easy and fast
---
but i can make him howardhard if you catch my drift ;);)
---
I just tanked 3 pylons in encrypted, blew through about 50 stims, and when I ran out, not a soul stepped in to try and assist.
---
There is a massive gap between shooting mobs and doing just about anything else in most games to most people, which is something WoW raids taught me some time ago.
---
It is they turn one of the buildings into a haunted house and do night tours of the asylum
---
I know... I'm still a lower level player too and I was super devastated when it happened to me. Thank you for sharing :)
---
Wait, so when I shoot enemies with my shotgun and see their health bar go down to a minute amount of health and then jump up to like 75% full that's a bug/glitch and not my internet?
---
I understand what your saying but what's the difference with spending say £10 on a legendary weapon on eBay and spending £10 on Atoms to doll up your camp? 
---
P.s I wouldn't touch eBay sellers with a barge pole
---
Weve got those it is called jail break and Collison course
---
Are you sure that the price you’re seeing is the actual base value listed after you buy it?  The listed value in a trade window is not the true base value; it’s the adjusted price.
---
Holy shit this is art!
---
Something else I just discovered about First while cancelling. The renewal charge was set to process on the 22nd but after cancelling the membership is good until the 24th. Seems odd.
---
Yep.
---
The one from the wastelanders quest.
---
What do you think is fertilising all those plants? 😅
---
I admit to being a casual without a mic who has systematically stumbled through various events ruining it for others.  I apologize.  I'm a slow learner.
---
Well I know this probably ain't the case but maybe the money that goes to atoms can be used to improve the game, where as just buying it off of another person isnt gonna have a positive effect on the game at all
---
Yup I just chalk it up to either they are hitting there bongs or being yelled at my mom and dad at least my personal experiance on xbox at least
---
Did you go to atom shop and re enable everything?
---
ok dont bully me but i have spent like 16 dollars getting legacies because i want them and never have caps
---
With the exception of legendaries and serums, I sell everything for 10 caps or less.  All ammo is 1 cap.
---
Wow, amazing pictures and I felt right in game  just missing my trusty The Fixer gun.
---
I seen fasnacht crazy guy mask for $10, 1000 adhesive for $7
---
No, it does go down faster, but seemingly exponentially faster instead of linearly.
---
No idea, I finished both questlines but never saw no mask
---
The underarmor is getting lining plans in either the next update or the one after.
---
Then your welcome to join my team we need a 4 cause he is having a guilt crisis at the moment
---
Gun fu auto switches your vats target and adds a damage boost for each level of the card.  It works nicely if you have concentrated fire (only one rank is needed there).
---
Some hard pipe hittin motherz
---
I have tried that. The most logical places for a quality spatula is toxic Larry's, and there are none there. Overseers kitchen, none. Morgantown high cafeteria, 0 Spatulas. What the hell were they cooking without Spatulas?
---
I won't bully you cuz 16$ ain't nowhere near as bad as spending hundreds of dollars
---
mmm ahah 😜😋🐖😏🤤🥴
---
Ok, so that is bizzare.
---
I have the individual pieces for contemporary walls and what not, the red drapes, etc, but not the log cabin..what the heck I know I specifically bought that bundle.
---
I always need. 45. My fixer is hungry!
---
that is the problem, most people just don't stop shooting her, so she doesn't land
---
FUCK I KNOW, forgot about that... In one of the bunkers there's a fucking closet with nothing in it and no purpose other than to kill you cause there is 4 turrets in it... it's literally a janitors closet, and they have for turrets guarding a broom. I have a few one hitters on robots, but the amount of shit in that mission is just annoying.
---
I know there's a few kitchens up in Grafton that I remember seeing spatulas in
---
Are there challenges for taking workshops from other players, or just claiming them in general?
---
I have not. Didn't know that was even a thing to be honest
---
They need legendary vending machines that reduce food spoilage,  reduce armor, weapon, ammo weight too for us folks who like RP.
---
yea i would never spend that much mostly because i dont got that kinda money and it is pretty "wak"
---
Thanks! I have a grill but no spatulas! How can I flip my meat, I ask you
---
Nothing to apologize for. We have all done this at some point. You learn from it and move on and when it seems like someone needs help in the same situation you offer it.
---
Thank you.
---
Floater hoards haunt my dreams...
---
Thank you very much 🤣🤷
---
I guess we found one of the cheaters.
---
Ok, yes I believe I know the shop you're talking about. I guess I saw the guns for sale there when I briefly checked, but didn't know the plans are there too. Thank you!!
---
Hmmm that's probably the case and I had so many Caps that it seemed like they were cheap
---
VTU for Vault-Tec University. As a mountaineer I came to comment the same thing but figured it out before typing.

Oh my god that bug has been there since day one of the beta :(

I just nuked both Harpers Ferry and Tangara Town in the same nuke and I only found 1 ultracite ore vein, this vein was also not reusable. I don't understand why it didn't work, and I don't understand why people keep mentioning Harpers Ferry, as I saw nothing special about the place.
---
I have some spare punctuation you could use: ..........,,,,,,,,,,
---
Uppercase letters are also in stock BTW: QWERTZUIOPASDFGHJKLYXCVBNM
---
&gt; Remove scrip daily limit
---
YES!
---
&gt;reduce amount returned by each item by half
---
No thanks. I will keep playing if I feel rewarded. Artificially prolonging or the feedback loop makes folks lose interest. I will continue to play if I enjoy the game, which I do, moreso when I feel it is worth my time.
---
No problem! Yeah I’m like 90% certain the plans are for sale there. If not then my apologies but I feel like I have seen them there multiple times.
---
Please familiarize yourself with the rules. You do know that the SECOND I post the players names that are guilty of this that they will be hunted down like dogs? Doxing players is wrong. So many things can happen, like sending a swat team to the players house, death threats, and worse. Do you honestly not understand the consequences ? There's a reason we don't post those things, so please read and understand the rules before you post. I'm not a YouTuber, I'm just an average person trying to play a game and keep my community informed.
---
Yea it's just not worth it to spend that much on a digital item you'll never touch and you could literally lose it easily from a bug or something
---
Damn they even got the trash cans on point within the game.
---
Film has been submitted to bethesda, if you did not happen to read.
---
anything that is even close to centrally located on the map is great.. everything not.. I dont bother with
---
I only even look at far flung bases if I need to be in its vicinity for some other reason...
---
Bethesda gets a LOT of shit for their bugs but they don't fuck around on getting their locations right.  I've said this on other posts but my best friend visited DC after playing fallout 3 and knew where everything in the National Mall was without a map or directions,  he joked that he was afraid he'd round a corner and come face to face with a Super Mutant.
---
Had to side with the bad guys during wayward quest.
---
Yeah, but for new players 3 caps for 0.35 weight isn't great, clothes are a better grab, but I didn't know that until I was like level 25.   0.1 weight for 1-50 caps. Now I pick up all the clothing I see lol.
---
That's a death claw mask at helvetia?
---
I see your predicament! We must put an end to this injustice!
---
Thanks so so much auntie!!❤️❤️❤️
---
dont tell the fortnite players about the accounts they buy of ebay for like 500 dolars tho that might screech and cry after their parents find out
---
that has to be forgiven a bit,  as a consolation they got the roads right at least.
---
Oh, I'll go anywhere when I'm in the mood to shop. If I'm close to my cap limit I'll go to all corners of the map if there's camps with what looks like it might be good stuff in their vendors.
---
A real lucky mucker!
---
I just hit up every camp, and only get annoyed if it’s just a floating base. But when I see that somebody actually put time into their house, I’m always impressed.
---
i turned off auto upper case and auto correct and im ranting so i do not care ;)
---
I guess I’ll start stocking .45 now! I didn’t know the fixer took 45, thought it would be 308. I guess that would be the upgraded receiver...
---
I’ll stay back, s’long as you pay up first.
---
Bethesda! Patch this shit yesterday! Toxic Larry is known to have owbed thousands of Legendary Spatulas! All I want is 1 Legendary two shot spatula, for when I have guests!
---
well... sure it's not ideal as it is now, but it's been a while like that and everybody should know better and should be able to make a correct count while selling stuff for scrip, honestly...
---
better gear and perks
---
I have hard bargain maxed so sell it for like 10 caps each. But yeah if they are a new player they probably don't have too many perks so I agree with you.
---
I have no problem with dupers, and frankly the few I have met have been extremely generous with giving me presents and such.
---
Those goddamn Grafton heathen bastards are hoarding all the spatulas?
---
Ballistics what?
---
I saw this in his vid too but it is only the red and white swim suit he usually wears with his tinfoil hat😔
---
Two shot explosive spatula, to given just the right amount of char on the mutt chops before being served!
---
That's what I tend to do aswell, me and my friend have our camps quite high up near Palace of the winding path way and the only reason we get any people coming here is cos there's 2 of us
---
It was a duper, how long after this did the server crash or performance come to a screeching halt?
---

Perks such as?
---
Ranch sauce
---
RMT scrubs never change
---
I’m not aware of challenges specific to taking WS from other players. There is one daily for taking a WS, and another daily for building certain things in a WS or CAMP.  
---
There are also account-based challenges that. Involve workshops. 
---
And there are account-based challenges for killing other players.
---
yeah but you dont get any loot if youre downed and dont do any damage
---
Who are you talking to
---
Ah dammit I posted the exact same link before seeing your comment.  You beat me to it.
---
Man I need to watch UHF again.

This goddamn big green guy walks into my site with a whole goddamn cow, but no fucking spat! How you gonna flip that shit? Probably a fucking shopping cart grill too, you know what those types are like
---
I feel as though there are two major types of players that play Fallout 76. Those expecting a similar experience to previous Bethesda Fallout games and those wanting more multiplayer orientated content.
---
So, their playstyles and expectations clash, and it results in frustrating experiences for both sets of players.
---
Personally, I'm fine with group content, as long as it's good. The problem is, I don't think there is any good group content in this game. I wasn't around for the Vault raid, so no idea what that was like either.
---
Can I scare you off with a strength speech check? Ha ha
---
10 caps is what I sell mine for lol... the event lasted so long people had plenty of time to collect majority of these masks before the end. Though it seemed to me that the uncommon masks dropped more often than the uncommon masks.
---
This is amazing!!!!
---
You can sell that note for 10k+ also
---
3 if yoir greedy
---
I'll travel to any camp that looks promising. I don't care about cap cost
---
there is no plan for the dragon.
---
I don't know about that particular issue but it does seem to be buggy on PS4 in general lately. I've had it glitch out a few times on me this past week; I'd pick an item to rename, click the rename button and it would immediately switch to a completely different named item and erase that items name.
---
A single cap at most.
---
My spouse and I knee-cap them the moment we see them... if there is enough room for time, fast buggers. If not, then it's instant Rad Worms! YAY!
---
So I’m the guy who brings The cryolator to the queen fight, and attempts to take as many of the pylons as I can and hide on the roof of the house. But I struggle to also get hits on the mob. No hits, no loot. The last time I did a queen fight, I jumped in late and froze her, and that was enough for everyone to kill her. I got no loot from her body, just event loot. That’s not fair. They need a better system to determine who participated and who didn’t.
---
Ones that fit the weapons you use and your play style.. With just decent gear and perks to match it you should be one shotting them easily by lvl 50.
---
If your using a shotgun, it will do that if you don’t use vats with it
---
I believe they removed explosive from energy weapons because the effect was irreparably bugged.
---
I'm picturing a limp-wristed gauntlet.
---
I nuked a camp selling masks for 1500 each
---
That’s ridiculous though? It’s every weapon but that’s one of the weapons that suffers from it
---
Yeah when was that in the store?
---
i would recommend a fast melee or a explose long range weapon cause if your full health speedbover and spam attack but if your bloodied or have bad strength go with explosive crippling limb weapons
---
You wouldn't believe how many trips I have to make to the whitespring sulfur fountain.
---
Damn lmao. They even got the trash cans to look the same
---
Hive Mind.
---
And great movie, hehe
---
Get a ghoul slayers gamma gun. Trust me. Just trust me it will kill them very fast ;)
---
i only go to places with weapons armor and plans if they dont have all three i go somewhere else
---
What platform is this happening on?
---
Oh definitely tunnels with that poison! However moleminers are definitely smarter utilizing tools and even molerats.
---
The only time I’ve seen people get banned for hacked guns is when they get put in popular YouTube videos or streams
---
Ahh actually this home is no longer there, I blew it up to start over. It's funny you should come across this thread because I just posted its replacement up on reddit hehe.
---
Yeah that would make a world of difference in itself. I like that idea.
---
Idk who thought limiting it to melee was a good idea in the first place. If you’re getting hit by melee attacks the enemy obvious knows where you are and is right on top of you. 1-2 seconds of invisibility isn’t gonna do much lol
---
No there are fallout veterans and fo4 players the two are not similar some people learned how to build characters to survive experiences like point lookout, the Pitt, broken steel, lonesome road, zion and the big empty then you have the fo4 players who downloaded the cheat terminal and played for hundred of hours in god mode one shooting things and expected to have the same experience.
---
Ghoul: \*looks at you\*
---
You: \*gets Rad Worms\*
---
I try to use my swingspeed instigating shish. Sometimes I can take them out in one shot, but if I don't they take me out in 2 quick swipes.
---
SNIFF IT NOW
---
How good were the legendaries? I’d doubt its duping, especially if it was trash legendaries.
---
Because accusing me of getting people "hunted down like dogs" you could have saved yourself all that typing and drama by just reading what I wrote. I didn't ask you to post the video, and at no point in that elongated shambles of text did you mention that you'd made a video and sent it to Bethesda. You've stated in a reply to me that you've sent it, excellent work.
---
Server crash≠duping
---
It happens with every weapon I use and I’m a bow/pistol build and same with my wife and she is a rifle build.
---
Well patch 20 is coming on the 30th. That's got seasons and public teams and probably more little changes to make it better. So new content is on its way!
---
I get scared off real easily if a nice bag of caps is tossed my way.
---
yea project paradise radiation rumble and imposter sheepsquach are impossible without an organized crew unless you got a mic to scream at them then everyone will shit and fart and pick they nose because they are bimbo brains skull fucked buy a radroach
---
I have max fireproof and full Heath and these things still melt me
---
My pleasure!
---
I might invest in some ghoul slayer combat armour to go with that. They're always sneaking up behind me
---
You forgot to mention collecting ore in rad rumble another area I find most people fail at.
---
they did fix it, they broke the built in AIMBOT (Vault Assisted Targeting System).
---
I hope the 1% of the people in the game that want to PVP are happy now.
---
I looked up the reataurant in Helvetia, and saw pics of the food.
---
Is it as horrible as it looks?
---
Now we’re talking
---
Yup, twice this week i was the only guy collecting and depositing ore during the Radiation Rumble event. People were just shooting the mobs, no one collecting ore. It's not always like that, just a bad week I guess...
---
The log cabin didn't come with wall, floor, or roof pieces, just the prefab.
---
yea i just die all the time because being bloodied means assualtron lasers and crunchy ass ghouls eat your butthole
---
It’s one of those bugs that’s doing my head in, I would of thought something would be done about it by now
---
I use one handed melee weapons (mainly my shish) I can occasionally one shot if its a singular charred. Most of the time it's a horde of them and I get overwhelmed.
---
the western outfits are no longer rare or super valuable since you can get them from the claim tickets now and they seem to have a 10%ish chance to drop.
---
**~~WHAT THE FUCK HAVE YOU BOUGHT UPON THIS CURSED LAND!?~~**
---
Ps4 sir.
---
Don't get me started on assaultrons. I got used to them having to charge the laser in fallout 4. Now they just blast me instantly.
---
Put it this way, you could grind for weeks/months and never see a particular weapon drop. Time is money, and a lot of people dont have that sort of time - so dropping 10-100 on digital items is not a concern. If they, for instance, get paid $60/hr in their occupation - paying $15 to avoid 50 hours of grinding is totally acceptable.
---
I wont say I would ever need to, as you can easily kill everything in this game with box of wet tissues so OP weapons are not worth it imo. But I understand why people do. I have bought and sold in many other games as well.
---
I usually equip my double-barreled shotgun, then tap them twice in the head with Vats. That does the trick for me. YMMV
---
yea fr the ones at the freaking robot town with the auto charge lasers give me anxiety
---
I used to bring my quad cryolator to queen before I lost it in a transferring accident, but I would always at least make sure i nailed her with a weapon that does enough damage first.  As for encryptid I always have a ton of stims and I just give up on being concerned of getting hits on him, odds are my drop isn’t going to be that great anyways so I’d rather just make sure the event gets done and I won’t miss that 1 legendary.
---
Yeah most of the builds need one or two perks except for charisma but i tried to find builds that had something.
---
That way you could play a bloodied +  child of atom(rad rifle) or bloodied +  Charisma Build.  
---
even more unique play styles.
---
As VATS is broken your screwed.
---
There is no plan to fix VATS, Bethesda will not even acknowledge it's broken despite hundreds of bug reports and probably hundreds of hours of video on youtube, twitch, and other platforms showing it is simply broken.  It misses well over 80% of the time with a 95% chance to hit and the target literally in the players face.
---
uwu
---
The guy that just made a post deleted what he wrote because it was incredibly disrespectful.
---
ill take hime to vault 69
---
COOL! Now find you can the gold irl.
---
That is true
---
&gt;Wouldn't be the case if they had a survival server and adventure had very little if any pvp. 
---
That is exactly what we had. And, once again, it's the PVPers fault that it's gone now.  Mere days after survival mode launched, PVP players began to abandon survival mode and went back to  fucking with people at workshops in adventure mode.
---
As someone who lives super close to the New River Gorge Bridge I gotta say it's pretty cool to see so many people on here making plans to go visit some of these places. I plan on visiting Helvetia sometime soon!
---
Well that is actually very painful sounding
---
Generally, if it's close or on the river of the eastern Forrest region, or in the mire or bog, unless they have a massive amount in the category I'm looking to sort through, it's a no go.
---
Also if the camp has it's butt hanging off a cliff with the vendors in the back, or a 4 story tall building with the vendors on the roof, NOPE.jpg.  
---
Owner logging out causing me to plummet out of nowhere, while looking through a menu, scares the living hell out of me every time.

We usally dont kill mobs we cripple them in the halls so more can't run past
---
How long have you had your pet for? I've had so many but they all seem to die in a week or so. All of them, my sloths, deathclaws, dogs, mirelurk/King. Everything. Idk if they have a limit on how long they can stay for or it's just bad luck
---
Ah you know that's a good point of view, not everyone has time on their hands to grind, I don't think it's entirely the buyers faults, it's the sellers that are selling weapons for these ridiculous prices
---
I apologize for any confusion, but that person was being entirely toxic, then deleted all of his posts. Some people...
---
Yup, fry cook capital of West Virginia
---
The issue is that sone people could have ('innocently') acquired such weapons through player vendors, so punishing them is a bit delicate.
---
Erasing those weapons from reported players inventory would be the more sensible approach, but logistically might take time and resources.
---
But i agree, those hacked weapons need to go.
---
Are there people who hadn't realized this was a scam with benefits?
---
Ohhhh, that explains it
---
no its kind hot
---
The blocker perk reduces their damage quite a bit. Then depending on which weapon type you’re using, make sure to put all your points into skills that allow those to be more powerful. 
---
Example: 
---
Commando, Expert Commando, Master Commando, Ground Pounder, Tank Killer = 15 Perception for Auto Rifles
---
Blocker perk for reduced damage from melee attacks by 45%, adamantium skeleton 3 removes Limb damage completely, Lone wanderer 4 take 20% less damage, field surgeon to increase the speed of radaway/stimpacks, first aid to increase the effectiveness of the stimpacks, and bloody mess for 15% more damage (all perks shown will be for the max value allowed)
---
Lmao people are paying for fortnite accounts? Those sorry sods
---
Thanks. If you need anything then stop by.
---
Guess I'll chalk that down with bootlace and ghouly parts
---
Friends can help you mule items to other characters
---
yea it is crazy
---
Read Jholigans previous posts... toxic person.
---
That worked for me.  I had to drop it twice and used the printer again
---
That's one of the most expensive plans in the game. No amount of charisma changes that fact.
---
Amen
---
Tho I feel like I could sell fortnite account to those idiots for a couple thousand dollars cuz I started playing after season 2 and have a bunch of skins people can't get no more that I bet they'd be frothing at the mouth over them
---
I wasn't expecting the trash cans to be exactly the same
---
🤪
---
Wtf?!
---
Dunno... I'm on ps4. Maybe this glitch is independently a console issue but I doubt it.
---
There is a confirm trade screen, I just clicked through it like a dumbass because I was in a hurry.  Just seems weird that the game stops you dead in your tracks one way and not the other lol.
---
Wrong. Dead wrong.
---
yea just go to a fortnite youtuber and find a link to a account shop you can make a couple hundo
---
Yeah I don’t even save scrip anymore just get on with a sale per day, better than saving up 1K them going through and getting a troubleshooter boxing glove or a nocturnal spear
---
i thought about doint the same but i do not have the email to my ac
---
Your build looks pretty good.  If you can get an explosive rifle then use demolition expert maxed out at level 5 that will help a lot.  I have this plus my rifle is instigating.  Also make sure you're targeting non torso body parts to get that concentrated fire bonus.
---
Thanks, I'll have to have a look into those perks and see if I can fit them in
---
Wasn't there a data mine about an ammo recycler being added as a seasons reward?
---
Yup, that's the idea :) but that's not how it went down unfortunately. No crippling and no ore collecting, just mindless killing :( I could have lived with just the killing part if people did their part for ore collecting, i was in a bit of a state of disbelief. Oh well...
---
The event loot is far more valuable than what she drops now especially since you cant get serum recipes from her anymore and the fact that outfits are more valuable than some legendaries. If you want lots of legendaries go do a horde event and cripple the legendary it will eventually spawn more legendaries aroumd it just farm like that
---
Vats is broken yes but not unusable by any means.  I use it all the time with limited trouble.
---
Quite a while now. Best tips I have are make sure your CAMP module is either on the actual ground or a pre-existing flat surface and make sure the patrol route your pet takes is free of things that will snag it or get it stuck. (Mine sits on the edge of a bridge right where it meets the ground). Adjusting where your CAMP module is will also alter the patrol route your pet will take.
---
Try level 3 blocker...even on a heavy gunner it makes them into kitty cats
---
Haha I definitely would if my fortnite account wasn't also my psn account
---
I was born and raised in WV.... The game gets it so close. As in, that state already looked ravaged by a nuke even bwfore hand lmao!
---
Ah yes. The entire deathclaw bloodline
---
Ok so now im more confused. I'm 99.9% certain I bought the log cabin and the robit.
---
I got the robit (can verify) but no log cabin, just contemporary pieces of things.
---
Uh what?
---
For the most part, the people asking for mechanically difficult events are the players that do know how, lvl 100+ guys. The only ones who don’t know how to run the events we have are 10 year olds and low levels (&lt;lvl150)/ new players
---
Yeah, my camp is newly underground and they just patrol up and down the flat surface under a power pylon. I have turrets set up they never shoot at him, I even took them away to see if they'd stay. They still disappear..i just had my 3rd deathclaw disappear 😔
---
Even if you do use vats with it it will happen
---
Its the damage return 'feature' they introduced almost a year ago to screw people that use shotguns.
---
The brotherhood will be returning from west coast in fall I believe
---
Help defend Paige and Ward? Man, I dunno. I mean I’ll help defend Crater, sure, no problem.
---
this exactly. Got a Fixer plan off just such a person today for 1k caps. Sold it for 12k an hour later.
---
OP said:
---
&gt;	(im postinh this because tomorrow that turtle guy youtuber that does fallout videos has a community sheepsquach event thats not official) itd be cool if they added a celebration for us to party in and youd have to emote to get a sheepsquach to come out and then fight him and he would be like the level 100 legendary sheesquach like in the project paradise and you can get limited cosmetics and camp items and maybe like a free emote where you have to take a sheepsquach horn and craft a “sheepsquach horn” :) and you blow into it like a war horn and it could be like “fat snatch” event but more community related rather then hurry everyone kill the mega sloth before level 2000000 virginboi69 kills it for scrip or sells a level 12 bloodied wooden leg for 5000000 caps or 100 bucks on ebay
---
Your not listening or being open minded to the experiences of others. Your toxic nature is not appreciated. I'm here to help those that want the game to be flawless for everyone. Were all tired of cheaters, so I want everyone to be aware of this method of cheating.
---
Are you going to condemn someone every time a new glitch is discovered? It's happening on ps4 so get over it. It's real and it sucks!
---
I cant comprehend what you have been through... you deserve anything good coming to you. Keep that wasteland wanderer morale!
---
Herd mentality for an additional +2 str in a group
---
This is so awesome!
---
sorry i am not the best at wording things but mainly the part after i describe why this idea came to my head and before i rant about fat snatch
---
It is the complete opposite for me. As soon as I put .45 in my vending machine it is gone within the next couple customers. I have been thinking of making .45 just to sell.
---
I agree, on the fact that I don’t understand what any of this said. I only understood the you tuber part, which is Angry Turtle
---
Death claw masks easily sold for $60 USD during Fasnacht.  You can actually search by completed/sold to see what they sold for.
---
damn it be like that
---
I could only dream of unlocking this building skill. Looks absolutely amazing!
---
No but the game did CTD on me earlier when I tried to cook food.
---
The whole thing was totally my fault for ignoring the warning and just clicking a bunch of times.
---
Thanks for clearing that up. That's why it still seems so underpowered to me.
---
This. I got downvoted big time when I said this when it was first brought up. If it was indeed true thie majority of the bugthesda brigade would be foaming at the mouth right now and the sub would be full of their incessant tirades.
---
YOU GIVE TODD YOUR SOUL
---
The group I play with have defeated Scorched Earth 45 times so far today... and it’s early. We usually see 3-6 additional SBs during and after the event.
---
At your point you just need a good legendary.
---
That looks beyond amazing! I love this idea!
---
 They aren't over powered though. Once you got your defensive foundation in order.
---
You guys need a shotgunner or melee build at the event...she seems almost always to target those that aren't doing much damage (or can't)while she is the air...and almost always lands in front of them. Almost like she gives them a chance to get a couple good shots in before she gets melted by the heavy guns. Try it for yourselves and see.
---
Yes, send me a friend request. Same username as reddit. Logging on right now. Coming to your rescue!
---
👍🏼👍🏼
---
I think this is fantastic advice. I still dont know about what I've been witnessing at my camp or my friends though... they block me upon arrival and crouch all the way to my vendors, then junk is gone in addition to legendaries that are not for sale. The load in time period doesn't seem to be an issue, so it makes me very concerned.
---
For some reason when I see that, I hear in my head Tim Allen's grunt from Home improvement.
---
I got a junkies SS shishkabob for 400 caps from one of those.
---
Like what? You seem to be trolling. Stop spreading misinformation.
---
You are a saint

You could say theres a hardened mass in my pants lookin at this image...🥴

&gt; daily limit on modules 10
---
There is no daily limit on modules. Just hop servers.
---
Interesting, so Berry Mentats just doesn't have this npc class in it's action list or whatever it is called, an oversight no doubt.
---
Same it just vanished 😥
---
So, you would like Bethesda to include an in-game event because Angry Turtle is having an unofficial in-game gathering?
---
Dont have any I can trust with that so I am stuck ;)
---
Yes, and it melted me faster than an assaultron. Both need some serious nerfing.
---
I've noticed that Charred ferals have very low armor penetration. Get yourself some stronger armor.
---
Another good option is getting concentrated fire and tormentor (I thinks that's what the perk is called) and blast their legs out from under them.
---
Everyone complained about deathclaws not being scary.....
---
Now introducing packs of 50+ deathclaws wandering the wasteland
---
It’s happening on most guns unfortunately. Sucks
---
I have tried to inform people as quickly and thoroughly as possible. I video and screenshot these jerks daily. I want this game to be amazing for everyone so I will be sure to nail any user that would take advantage of myself or another player. I'm irritated because of some of the toxic people spreading misinformation on my feed, not accusing you of trying to get somebody swatted - just know that people do that and I wont be part of that. Take care sir.
---
Listen I play witha lot of players on here a couple hundred that I see over the span of roughly a week i know of 3 people fight these so called hard events with
---
If they do Bridge Day this year I'm gonna go.
---
I'd join if it had the costume.
---
(I've never been bale to finish the event because the majority of people there just sit on the cabin and do nothing
---
I'm guessing it had to do with ranged weapons and PvP if someone wears cloaking and they were to get VATSed by a ranged weapon it would break their vats lock and that would be very OP so either make it apply to ranged and completely change up the meta for PvP or just get rid of it entirely
---
Robot town? Bottom right of map? Become the mayor, problem solved.
---
I have no idea what I just read. (Just didn’t get the point across, I think)
---
The edges of the golf course are especially attrocious, where I dip to low 30s frequently with 70-90 the rest of the time. Very similar system specs at a lower output resolution (1440p non wide).
---
I use heavy combat limbs with a secret service torso atm, I'm hoping when I get the full set I won't be killed by them as easily
---
If ever you can post the vid on YouTube, that might go a long way towards giving credibility to your post. I hope I'm not coming across as being shitty towards you, it's just hard to tell who is talking truth on the internet, I hope you understand that :)
---
So all the people that are sharing identical experiences on this feed... it's all heresay? I'm throwing your bullshit right back atcha buddy. Have a heart, or maybe some respect?
---
Bullshit excuse and bullshit post, now deleted because everyone saw through your crap, from a 1 day account.
---
Sorry i ment I play with a slew of people from here and i know of three that are consistent about the mechanics , I will not point fingers but there is guy here who to this day will argue you can kill the imposter while it is still invisible
---
Yeah and also 2mm for over 5 caps will NOT be bought...
---
Yes the ammo is hard to come by but I can make more the the 25 your selling for 15 caps each in 3 minuets or less...
---
5 lead + 15 steal = 24 2mm cells
---
I’m more than happy with my scrap box and tent. Would be great if they weren’t upsell but if it pays for more development and content... 🤷‍♂️
---
My only gripe is I wish the private server was cross platform. As a PC player, I’d love to play with my more platform challenged friends (ps4).
---
Get a courier from that other sub used for trading. They’re trustworthy. They usually just expect a tip like 500-1000 caps.
---
Or they could roll back the nerf they did to them back in January of 19. Bethesda didn't understand exactly what the community was complaining about. When the game first launched, weapons with the explosive legendary effect where extremely powerful, the game still had slap damage before pvp, players could destroy one another's camps and kill easily. The knee jerk reaction was to nerf everything explosive. Those weapons ( broadsider,fatman, etc. ) were unjustly nerfed into the ground.
---
I managed to sell off 20k .45 for 1 cap each in that area not too long ago. You just gotta wait for the right buyer to come by.
---
It's been done sir, that's why you've been warned.
---
That sucks. That gives you motivation to go do it again.  And again.  And again.
---
Created an account today just to enlighten the community, ok buddy.
---
Video would leave a player open to doxing. Are you not familiar with the rules of this subreddit?
---
That’s true but damn that sheepsquatch was level 70 while I was a level 25 at the time.
---
I will admit, I am not good at encryptid. If I step off the roof I'm dead. I can't use the pylons because I run a sub 20% HP Bloodied build. But I do my part to lessen the load on the conduits by taking out the bots with my Troubleshooters Explosive gatling gun. I do enjoy a challenge, but if I keep dying repeatedly, I'm not even gonna bother.
---
Find yourself an instigating rifle.  An instigating lever action rifle can one shot almost everything in the game.
---
If you want insane amount of riflemen damage and arent into bloodied or junkie builds then find yourself an instigating pipe revolver rifle.  Those use both rifleman and gunslinger perks.
---
I run with an IE 250 dr while reloading Pipe Revolver Rifle.  Can easily get 3 - 4k damage head shots and 900 - 1200 damage gut shots.  Easily kills every non boss in the game with one bullet.
---
 I use an AAE Handmade Rifle for my backup gun if I need faster firing or when I fight bosses.
---
Wow, from the trashcan in the Whitesprings to the Honey Haus all of these almost look like they were taken from an 8k Fallout 76.

The lore is that they are trapped in their mining suits. That would seem to make breeding difficult.

Here is my build.

the blue onsie thing?
---
heavy weapons and VATS is an oxy moron like military intelligence, smart bomb, or fail safe.
---
VATS is currently broken and Bethesda despite hundreds of bug reports, hours upon hours from streamers showing just how badly broken it is not even acknowledging the issue.
---
using VATS with a heavy weapon is an almost guaranteed waste of ammo while you wait to hit the target you could have already ground into a pile of meat without using and and moved on to the next target.
---
I remember doing Project Paradise, it said I needed to put in the feeder some sort of plant, so I was picking the plant from all over the room, and then I went to deposit and said I only had 1 of it.
---
Ah, I see what you mean. I guess I just fight with a good group of people about a dozen or so of us that all know pretty well how to run it
---
Imagine spending full lrice on any todd howard game
---
Yeah with the horns
---
Recently picked up a ghoul slayers switchblade with 40% swing speed boost.
---
Non-power attack takes out L62s in 3 hits.
---
Before that, I used a vampire switchblade (and PA to keep down the rad damage they do).
---
Having Martial artist and incisor probably Helped, too :)
---
Through on some armor buff perks to increase damage resistance. Use the scaly skin mutations if you don't already have it. That extra 50 DR goes a long way.
---
I will go pretty much anywhere as long as it shows you have a decent selection.   If you're just selling ammo and stimpaks I'm probably not going to bother unless I'm specifically looking for those.   If you have a decent number of armor weapons and plans I will travel across the map to check it out.
---
This is fantastic, thank you!
---
As a long time gauss user, prime that bad boy, way better crafting output, though you will need flux.

Can’t say I’ve ever noticed that - and I’ve been using vamp. Weapons for about 180 levels.
---
You seem really mad that Fallout 4 sold more than previous entries in the series.
---
Nether 3 or Fallout NV are particularly hard games. Fallout 4 also isn't a particularly hard game. They have sharp difficulty spikes at times (76 having the worst of these imo but that's the result of uncertain design) but the focus of Bethesda games has never really been the combat. Your gate keeping helps make this website worse. We can have a rational discussion about why 76 has the problems that it has or you can default to shit like this, blaming whoever you personally feel is "ruining my video games!"
---
Also don't close your OP by saying "the more casual players cant read." You look moronic. Learn from this.
---
Actually, yes. I do not like going online because of people like you, specifically. Your speaking from a dark place and you are not acting in love, but hate. Unless I'm shopping on Amazon or reading the news, I'd rather avoid posting things to avoid ever coming across negative toxic people such as yourself.
---
I would say cut your STR to 2 and pick one reduced weight card instead. Can supplement.with grocer or chemist backpack mod. You'll also want max rank Adrenaline in your AGI with the extra perk points toss into AGI 15 and LCK 14.
---
dont have the helm but you can have a mascot outfit if you are on pc
---
Thats why evreyone does the radstag ones
---
same
---
I'll see you on day 2. I'll still be honest and still try to help people. I felt this was too important not to share. I just discovered reddit a month ago dude. Sorry I'm not an internet troll?
---
I will travel anywhere but the forest to players camps.
---
For too many low level camps in the forest for me to bother checking if there's any high level ones.
---
Other than that I prefer camps in the Divide, Cranberry Bog and the Mire since those are the highest leveled areas in the game.  Odds are far better the player is a high level with  good stuff in their vendor.
---
I've launched 4 nukes on fissure site prime at level 200 but never get to kill the SBQs
---
I’m on xbox , sadly I don’t have my pc with me
---
Why do you keep deleting all your disrespectful posts? Dont like getting downvoted for being a jerk? I'll show you the 2 videos I have, but you're way too sketch to trust at this point. God bless bud.
---
The legendaries were all over the board. No god rolls or even great rolls. But a lot of 2 and 3 stars. Things I can use on my alt. 
---
Server was fine. Never slowed or crashed. I really think it was a guy with a ton of crap and just wanted to do good.
---
k
---
i want the scorched to be harder they took out an entire military group why can someone thats lived in a vault with no presumable weapon interactions or training kills 4000 of them in a in game week so a entire miltary trained group gets wiped like a truck drivers ass in a porta potty
---
Wildly underrated comment
---
cant you censor it just use a blur tool
---
I'm new to reddit and I'm just trying to share... but honestly I've seen so many toxic people in this feed that I dont think I will be motivated to share my discoveries. It just not worth it.
---
Adding to this, players probably get reported by other players on a daily basis for no valid reasons. 
---
Between people that don't always understand the game, the people that call your 'cheater / griefer' for building a trap camp or accidentally one-shoting a legendary, and the people that scream 'dooper / hacker' because they see you have 10+ stimpaks in your inventory (extreme example but you get the point...), Bethesda probably has a lot of players they are asked to check on..
---
Red Rocket should get an honorable for the sheer amount of Aluminum present.  Otherwise... yeah pretty much.  I wish there was a major lead workshop, not 5 different ones that have one vein each.
---
Its really not. The paddle ball is the best weapon for knocking other players off vendors. Its rude, but funny so you dont have to feel bad. And then the fuzzy helps me blend in with the raider scum.
---
Still no comment from Bethesda regarding the situation too, shocking..
---
Oh! I'm not far enough in the game to really be checking out daily challenges for anything extra to do (there's so much still new to me!). I'll have to look for that however, thanks!
---
that is true even though im level 159 i cant kill those robots on the roof its annoying as frick
---
True, forgot about the deep pockets. Thanks.
---
I dont have a computer, just a ps4. Idk what I'm allowed to do at this point but I have a long list of offenders at this point. Of anyone can advise me to what else I should do I'd appreciate it.
---
If you think I'm toxic and the type of person that keeps you from going online, for simply voicing my opinion, then you've got a lot to learn buddy, lol.  Maybe the interweb isn't for you.
---
I'm not positive but check hillfolk hotdogs and general steakhouse.  I know I have seen them laying around, I just don't remember where.
---
Holy run-on sentence Batman!
---
I think another fun mode would be a repeatable heist quest that plays like capture the flag. " yo 76 , we need a water cooled bonesaw, go see if those losers at foundation have one." Raider is sent to steal wards shit. If they make it back, some kind of reward. Make a public notification that only goes out to all non pacifist players. " calling all friends and allies of foundation, we need anyone with the guts to help, someone took our water cooled bonesaw, and by taken I mean stolen, if you could get it back we'd be grateful, grateful enough to pay you." Similar to being wanted , but with no fast travel . The raider needs to make it back to crater , or a random designated raider safe house.
---
I totally get it, for me I actually appreciate you sharing this, I hope I didn't come across as being toxic.
---
he was hungi and need some munch
---
I've been looking for someone selling the serum but havnt had any luck. It's one of the last mutations I want.
---
I know you're against getting Fo1st, but let me share my experience. Before I got a scrap box, my stash was at 700 and something. After getting the scrap box, I got it down to 200 and something.
---
I just enjoy going to camps close to locations my quests take me to. I'll do some shopping and check out fun builds, never know what ideas I'll come  upon! :)
---
That could definitely go far in terms of helping rp. Along with that, I think they need dedicated “private” servers, as in like privately owned by a moderator.
---
im sowwy
---
She used to terrorize me back when I used to use shotguns so I can't really say that you are wrong here.  Constantly landed right on top of me.
---
No actually 4 is my favorite I have an honestly unhealthy amount of hours in it what i hate is that it gives player the feeling they understand what a traditional fallout game is and was and thats not what 4 was. Yes I am gate keeping and yes i know it is a bad practice but so is allowing the loudest memebers of a player base which is always the casual dictate the game strip it for what it is worth. How many people on this sub reddit have been active on this game since release why should they dictate how the game goes when they play it maybe 30 minutes a week why do they get to have game mechanics dumbed down since they dont want to read a screen prompt or listen to the game commands . you sit here and call me moronic since im pointing the blame at players but that the thing when has a player base ver known what was for their beat interest let alone the player who hope on get killed while afking an event then blames the game for bad design.
---
Oh, no that's alright. Not really a waste of time to head there, can always do some looting on the side! ;) Those robots don't need all that junk laying around just to trip on anyway!
---
I’m a random build 2 handed melee, and I find hitting them with my +50% dam to limbs fire axe works a treat! I’m lvl 52
---
You're spreading misinformation, so I don't know how else to label you. You've been very disrespectful and deleted several posts that were entirely inappropriate.
---
😬
---
It's a really good idea though.
---
Just keep looking. If you're on PS4, I know a guy that can get you any serum you want.
---
It's been in a couple of times. But I don't remember when exactly the last time it was available. Probably a few months ago.
---
The problem with paradise is not that the troughs need to be filled, its that defending a shitty uncontrollable npc monster is inherently a bad mechanic and most players have been conditioned not try waste their time with more than 1 or even to not bother.
---
ok uhm report to bethesda i dunno how to help i have no experience with inventory thieves
---
I know how you feel I did the same with my blood eagle jacket
---
Super rare outfits, really good legendary items, Mr. Fuzzy tokens and rare plans are what sells best in my vending machine.
---
5.56 and .45 ammo sell pretty good as well.  I will always buy those if I see them for one cap.
---
Lol I like the way you think :)
---
Fat rip man
---
I did a pinup look for my girl once and she wore the pink striped swimsuit, the fashionable glasses and the big pink floppy sun hat. Super cute, she looked like Marilyn Monroe running around the wastes slaughtering scorchbeasts without ever mussing her hair.
---
You realise your responding to yourself bit If this is directed at me then let me assure you I haven't deleted a single comment or post since joining Reddit.
---
The game needs a lot more challenging events. That’s why I like server-hoping NAR Repair Yard. You can find some interesting match-ups like a sheepsquatch fighting Yau Guais, Scorchbeasts fighting super mutants, settlers/raiders fighting fog crawlers, etc. 
---
I would love to see more of these (at more challenging levels) at random locations on the map. 
---
That said, are you allergic to periods?
---
i can kiss it betor doe wight uwu
---
Thanks for the advice
---
I straight up dropped mine for a freshly spawning level 2 because I knew I'd never wear it. Oops! I'm still trying not to kick myself for that one.
---
I use non explosive radium rifles and gamma guns for pvp, I fight folks with legacy weapons, and win some. It's just some skill and some math.
---
yes i hate periods and thats on periot baby
---
Very easy to follow in the footsteps of other growing console "MMOs"
---
Fallout 76 needs 4 man content like dungeons in ESO and raids/trials/12 man content like WoW and (again) ESO has been doing.
---
All these events where the whole server can show up take a lot of the challenge out of it because adds are almost always bullet sponges: I'm looking at you Sheepsquatch Imposter event and SBQ T_T
---
Instanced 4 man dungeons, arenas and 12 man raids and such would add so much life to the game because you're building up to genuinely hard content.
---
Fair warning with underground camps: stow your loot.  Some of them are just a fall to your death when you glitch through and your bag is lost to the void.
---
Updooted
---
I must be the only person who just gets destroyed by a level 52 Mr Gutsy. If I’m not using an exploding gun and in power armor they just destroy me with each shot.
---
Yeah they finally got back to me about it. I'll post all new info I receive in the next couple days. I'm still new to reddit.
---
Yeah, if you want to help noobs under 10 or 20, that weight adds up fast. I felt bad last week, some nice player left me a bag of 20 Stims and Pure Waters while I was looking at their shop. I was already near max weight, as I feel all new players constantly feel after level 4 lol. Radaways would be a really nice gift for noobs, because I felt like I was taking 1 every hour or 2!
---
Certainly! Even those who don’t want to roleplay can get benefits from food or alcohol, so it’s all around perfect, if not for some of those spoiling effects
---
im bloodied is the issue i have i couldnt get close enough to kill them so i just geg far away and snipe
---
All you need to do is one monster and you can get max rewards you also have on person in the room to use the heal command on the robot ive literally got a Yao guai once and let me tell you nothing not even sheepsquatch can fight the big old dusty brute
---
Not at all, that other guy is being so awful... it's crazy how people treat you like crap for trying to help on here! I thought this was the fallout community I've grown to love??
---
Haha, same.
---
My gamertag is “crunchtastic “
---
I'm pretty sure all those phones and lead-filled items laying around messes with their systems. It's me just trying to help them function better! ;)
---
Just the plans added in for events. Not the plans for vendors.
---
Also in a derelict house on the road north from Watoga near the Bog/Mire border.
---
I haven't deleted anything. Not. A. Single. Thing. 
---
You either have no idea what you're doing or are just making things up or more likely both. Shoosh now.
---
I only take Red Rocket when it's the Weekly challenge, I honestly had no idea you could get aluminum there. It's a nice location however.
---
Bad legendaries can also sell ok, at scrip prices. In my opinion (that's how I do it), 10 caps per scrip is ok. So 400 caps for a 40 scrip 3* weapon,  240 caps for a 24 scrip 3* armor etc...
---
What’s a cheated weapon? You’re on PC I’ll bet.
---
Using https://fed76.info/weapons/ as a baseline will help you choose a reasonable price if your selling for caps. Not by any means the de facto choice but it gives you an idea.
---
Nope. I'm new to reddit. Thx bud. I'll be sure to direct it at you next time. Try to take a breath and calm down. I'm here to help.
---
Isn't this everyday? I don't think I've made it through 1 day of play without it crashing at least twice! :)
---
Nope. The outfit is, the hat is common.
---
Yeah, fair enough. I’m still learning about the game, no mutations yet either. I’ve just been doing my solo thing, building up my camp and questing
---
Ok but like right now
---
Ignorance is bliss apparently.
---
I managed to find someone selling serums on the xbox lfg yesterday right after they'd sold out of scaly and talons :/
---
I love these posts. Really interesting to see the real locations and how they compare in game.
---
ok hopefully you dont get your shit stole the last time inventorys were stolen its because people used a inventory glitch and had there camp not be placed down when they hop in a world and when they got to world and its able to place down it just messes up
---
With how many old bugs keep coming back as of late I dont doubt it.
---
Hey just figured out how to block someone, your gonna be my first xoxo
---
darn your on ps4 im on pc i was going to give you stuff
---
Most of my stuff was free from atom shop and I use the atoms I get from new characters to unlock CC stuff in FO4 lol
---
Just figured out how to block somebody, so since you want to be mean, your gonna be my first. Xoxo
---
Sell weird shit like toilet paper and surgical masks for 2020 caps and some smart ass veteran players will take the bait to both help you out as well as keep the joke moving. 
---
Toilet paper
---
Surgical masks
---
Police uniforms
---
Some Guy spent over 8k caps just to be a cop with a Covid mask giving away toilet paper in today’s crisis....
---
A lot of higher level players are close to the max amount of caps and will spend them with zero fucks given if you can make em giggle.
---
Well then, to answer your question: I don’t know o any places where those plans spawn, but there’s a good chance they would be for sale in the Whitesprings mall.
---
Most weapon mods can be learned by scrapping the weapon, (which is why the plans for making them can be handy.
---
Oftentimes the best mods on the best weapons take Makeshift Warrior 5 to create.
---
Op if you want a friend to play with I will gladly join you. I'm fairly new myself, I have 100 hours amd I'm level 43.
---
There are so many cool things they could do for RP enthusiasts
---
I ussaly sell based on how good the legendary effects are and how many stars are on the equipment is that good?
---
Somebody needs to nuke me so I can get the trophy lol
---
Chinese stealth armor.
---
Tactic 1: Just stroll right past the hideous creatures and go on about your business.
---
Tactic 2: Sneak up to arms-reach and give 'em the old how-do-you-do, then immediately move so any others in the area don't jump you. They'll be drawn to where you attacked from. Don't be there anymore. Sneak damage cards are handy here, but you don't need sneak cards with the suit.
---
I always forget how gaudy Greenbrier really is...
---
get up to the roof tops
---
You can have a 50k pc and you will still get not so good fps, it's down to the game.
---
I'm still new and going through the story. I'll jump to any camp close to a quest location I have open atm. Helps me open new fast travel locations and it feels safer going to a camp that very well may have turrets to help keep me alive, because I never know what a new area is going to throw at me.
---
Add me broseph.  Crunchtastic
---
Thanks for the link
---
I had a player tell me about that glitch just last week, then they told me about how people were modding their PlayStations to be faster. The way one of the thieves was traveling across the map was unprecedented. He was in three separate camps in under 2 minutes.
---
I’m not sure why this ruins the game? 
---
Some people’s build just can’t absorb the damage some others can. 
---
I’d reword this to the “people who sit on the fence and tents and DONT CONTRIBUTE”
---
I’m a fence sitter if I haven’t been bothered to grab my PA, but I still mop up a large percentage of the ground forces to help the guys in the ground concentrate on the queen. I’m also able to snipe her from afar with a ranged rifle meaning when she flies off for miles I can aggro her back to everyone. 
---
And the pylon issue in encryptid. People complain yet nobody talks in this game. The only times I’ve been successful in encryptid is when everyone communicates.
---
Xbox actually, but I’m good for stuff anyways cheers. I’m in no rush for big items, I’m just happy to swing at enemies and explore the world. Half my armor is broken and I can’t be bothered farming Fort Defiance for ballistic hahahaha.
---
My camp is right in white springs. I get 2 legendaries a day at least afk
---
Ill try that out lol
---
Invisible assholes that mark you with poison while looting the sbq
---
Yeah this is so true. Kill everything that moves instantly or you fail 100% of the time
---
Useful junk like lead, acid, and maybe crystals too if people would figure out how nice cryolators are
---
isnt it cannon that the scorched wiped out groups like the responders before the events of the game? im fine with just the story of these groups alone personally, finding stories about em is more entertaining than rebuilding them for me
---
Pretty much not worth anything.
---
This is a known bug.
---
It happens with a lot of weapons, I had to stop using my hard earned Gauss minigun because I was tired of wasting those precious and resource heavy bullets watching enemy health going up and down.
---
2 for me so far.
---
Always planned on creating a 2nd as I wanted a dedicated heavy gunner. One weekend my main character got 3 or 4 good heavy guns as rewards so I took that as a sign to get busy on a new character.
---
Currently level 202 and 164.
---
Love my heavy weapons guy!! 😎
---
make legendaries cheap unless its a perfect roll or full set of matching unyielding or vanguard or bolstering armor and rare outfits plans etc should be sold for quite a bit of caps or high trade and any ammo is 1 or 0 caps and normals clothing and armor should be 10 caps at most
---
(no punctuation not sorry)
---
Huh interesting, I hope it gets patched soon
---
Do you have all mutation serums? 
---
Get these For the ones you use all the time. 
---
Not for selling for making and taking daily to completely remove negative effects and freeing up the 3 points in luck where class freak is usually sitting. 
---
I’m currently grinding for my fourth serum plan.
---
How long has it been known?
---
Besides the obvious - reading notes, terminal entries and listening to holo tapes - a rifleman (lots of agi/per perks, str is not important at all) and hw build (3 perception are more than enough but needs 14-15 str) have no good synergies.
---
You already got a commando, so maybe go 2h melee for the start till you can dive into hw perks (start at 30), both utilize str and if you limit yourself with traveling to vendors you have a lot to carry around anyway.
---
Oh yes, if it's a good legendary then i can go for more, sometimes a lot more :) anti armor / bloodied / junkies / instigating / quad are probably the most desired I would think :)
---
Did you check out the wendigo cave
---
Unsure.  At least a year.
---
I didn't pay for it, so I'm not the one that feels cheated.
---
They didn't "promise" it but they indicated they intended to add those features. Those features have not been added and when people have expressed concern that the features haven't been added, they're being told there's no reason to be concerned. Considering the general development path of this game, it's not unjust to be concerned that a feature that you were told to expect either isn't coming or you're not given any sensible timetable for when to expect it. Features have been delayed several times. Known issues have not been dealt with quickly or at all many times. The devs have not adequately communicated many times. I'm saying I'd like *all* developers, especially ones that employ games-as-a-service strategies, to adequately communicate with the communities they're attempting to build. That is not happening here. I already said this and you ignored it and replied with condescension over the fact that I am concerned. You don't need to be protecting anyone. You have no need to be defensive, you're not the one under attack.
---
This is the most relatable comment I've ever seen on this sub.
---
Generally nobody will buy weapons or armor if they aren't legendary. If you can craft underarmor, you can modify it to be stronger and that usually sells if it's decent enough. Chems sell too, I charge 20-30 caps for most but healing ones aren't worth as much. Stable flux sells for 100-200. Steel always sells if you sell it cheap, screws and springs sell pretty well too, as well as lead. 
---
 Plans are always good (but not mounted heads as they're extremely common ever since the massive dupe wave after Christmas), most other plans are worth about 50-100 if they're common and more for rarer ones, you should hop around to other vendors and see what they're charging to get an idea, then average the prices to come up with a good price to set on different plans.
---
 Legendary equipment always sells but if they're crappy effects then people generally only pay 50-100 caps per star because they buy it to exchange for scrip. Anything bloodied is worth a good bit, unyielding and bolstering armors compliment bloodied weapons and sell pretty well too. If you want to get an estimate on the value of any legendary items you have, go to fed76.info and you can enter in the specific item and each legendary effect and it'll tell you the value. That's based on PC prices and often suggests the higher end of values for things, so usually you won't get quite as much as the site says but it'll tell you if what you have is a valuable piece or not. 
---
Rare clothing is always a good seller, common clothing is worth pretty much nothing and is better scrapped for cloth or sold to robots. Pre-war food will sell if you're charging 20 caps or less per piece. Ammo is generally sold at 1 cap each but people mostly look for 5.56 and .45, 2mm EC ammo will sell but you could charge 2 caps each for that, maybe 3, it'll likely still sell. Fusion cores, a good price is half the charge. So a 100% full fusion core for 50 caps. Bobbleheads and magazines sell too, 100 caps is fair for those. People like to collect them. Treasure maps will sell quick for 50 caps each. 
---
These are the prices I set for things generally- you could probably sell for higher but you won't sell things as quickly. I sell pretty low for things because I'd rather sell a lot fast than sell a few things slowly.
---
oh lovely, so its probably never gonna get fixed
---
yea fr i only repair armor im selling in my vendor but have a good day
---
That's ussaly what i do
---
Everyone better be running around in the bear costume.
---
Great job.....I love visiting any camp because the originality is quite amazing.
---
I just want to point out that after Santa scorched and the mole miner pail event I dumped scores of legendaries on low and mid level players.....
---
I have zero God rolls. I just don't hardcore do the scrip thing. So I just need space sometimes. Don't need 122 decent legendaries.
---
Make Deathclaws wander around in a pack. No need to create/code a new enemy at all. 
---
Have an Alpha male and an Alpha female with a few lower level “children”
---
damn like i know faster ssd boost your loading screens but thats so much work to be an asshole
---
Once upon a time they were exceptionally rare. They have been duped hundreds of thousands of times by now though. You could probably get a couple hundred caps out of them at this point.
---
You too matey!
---
Try the search function, this comes up often.
---
That makes sense, but there is no evidence showing that sitting on a fence or tent makes one an unhittable target or at least in my experience. I've seen plenty of players go down on their tents from a direct hit from the queen.
---
Eyy, nice I stream it alot and play with my community so hmu np
---
Prime a plasma rifle with the flamer mod for the queen.  It’s an OP solution for mobs of all kinds, it eats ammo but will melt anything.  When I fight the queen with rifleman I put rifle crits in the head and wings and when she lands I blast her with the plasma flamer.
---
They were duped into oblivion around Christmas so they're not worth much anymore. They used to be rare but now they're for sale at nearly every player vendor.
---
Its not like you rushed out of the vault and immediately fought if lol
---
Thanks alot for all of the info
---
black knight skin
---
The outfit is valuable?
---
Hands down the most fun way to build. Using existing structures has lead to some of the most interesting camp designs I've ever seen.
---
Being constantly at max caps I'll go anywhere as sometimes you can find a good deal or two. Don't even bother crafting ammo anymore as it helps relieve my stash of caps. Besides I like to see another player's idea for a camp. Came across a camp built entirely out of bear skins winding staircase, quite imaginative. Also if you lock your camp I love trying to figure a way in.
---
Ratty skirt?
---
It has been timestamped, verified, sent, and delivered. That's why I'm making this post. The letter I sent to bethesda was real, genuine, and they are involved now. I just hope people understand that the people fighting this post are likely the ones taking advantage of all of us. Downvote thieves is all I'm saying.
---
I’ve never actually seen that as “cute”
---
some of the first enemies are scorched
---
That's just like, your opinion, man.
---
Panda at overseer's house on the bed, comrade chubs outside the purveyor's door, there are three assorted ones that spawn on a shelf in the vendor at pleasant valley ski resort. Bumblebear spawns in the Honey Haus in Helvetia. Pristine teddy bear on the bench inside Charleston station. Can't think of any others off the top of my head right now but those should start you off.
---
It's hard to walk past them, I think they smell my fear
---
Lol used to be gutsy for me...but I could never help saying outloud "Yup" everytime they say "is that someone who needs me to kick their ass?"
---
Nuka-Girl Rocketsuit
---
Glad to help. Sorry it was so long, wanted to try and cover everything.
---
It's a rare spawn and people will pau handsomely for it
---
How do I get it
---
And can I take off the helmet
---
So if something hasn't happened to you, it hasn't happened to someone else... yeah. That makes literally no sense.
---
Those tires are immensely useful as building blocks. 
---
They can be a bit finicky to stack at times, but it's well worth it (I'm a fellow builder)
---
No worrys about it being long the more info the better
---
0
---
The outfit is one of the most expensive apparel items out there if not THE most expensive. It goes for ridiculous trades. But yeah unfortunately the hat is worthless.
---
Why are you threatening someone that's trying to help you?
---
Mine was commie bot
---
Are these just for collecting or am I missing something?
---
Life in the wasteland is tough.
---
My husband and I did that for our honeymoon last year, then went to DC and Boston/Salem. It was amazing, somewhere in my pics I have one of the "end of the world fence."
---
Damn. Hoped I had stumbled onto a fortune. Oh well. Looks good on beckett so still a win
---
Ten or fifteen caps max.
---
This right here is what kills me. I got the prime reciever went to make ammo... Oh wait.... Flux? For ammo? Dang it! I never have enough and when I finally collect some, I have zero masses or no high rad fluids because the mobs in blast zone hardly ever drop it for me. JUST KILL ME!
---
I’m a Shotgunner build and this happens all the time outside of VATS. It very rarely happens in VATS though so my recommendation would be to use VATS as often as possible. Shotguns are so much better in VATS anyways.
---
Cool, thanks.
---
The amount of these threads that pop up, get dozens of medals and quietly disappear without being addressed is just disgusting.
---
Especially when you see "Bethesda Replied" to things like, "Check out my camp!".
---
the swimsuit is cute af, pink striped and 50's retro looking.
---
Sometimes the allies fast travel with you. They share the "pick up weapon" coding from FO4 so if there are enemies nearby and a weapon on the ground or on a corpse that's better than their default there's a chance they can pick it up. They won't keep it after you switch servers or log out though. You can drop a weapon by your ally in camp and they can grab it if the camp comes under attack, but it doesn't always work.
---
patterned fringed dress is best bet
---
Oh yeah, I definitely used nukacrypt.
---
How about the weird noise that happens when you first encounter a mirelurk Queen
---
Yeah I was in the same boat about a month ago until I learned this after a post very similar to yours lol.
---
My stash box stays like this: 10 bulks of all bulkable junk except for lead and steel (i just use those as i go). 50 of all other junk. 5 max fusion cores. Only ammo for the weapons im currently using. No meds, no food or water, no ores basically nothing but legendary weapons i intend to sell and low weight legendary weaps ill scrip, i drop all 1 star legendaries unless theyre selleable or ill give them out to lowbies. I only keep unyeilding/bolstering/90% reduced weight armors and drop/give away the rest. Make sure to save some space for all the swag youre bound to collect #swagout76.
---
True true. I was a level 2 looting a farmhouse and wondering why ghouls were shooting at me when I killed my first.
---
Personally, I just look at what they're selling (or, I guess, what kind of things they're selling) before I decide to check them out. Location doesn't really factor for me for some reason.
---
Search pet glowing version in the search bar.
---
Yeah thats what I have been doing, Im a semi auto rifle build but the shotgun I got has some nice effects for my vats perks, but I didn't build my character around vats completely
---
I see the texture section for face texture after you hover over the cheeks but I’ve never changed it off smooth before and now it’s different. Even if I select something different it won’t even reset the face texture or anything it’s just stuck on wrinkled and it’s crazy frustrating given I spent a good amount of time editing my character
---
Ha! Can you imagine going in there in power armor and just picking up every single thing you see including the clotheshangers
---
It makes the events more interesting for the players who understand what they're doing: sure we can solo Radiation Rumble, but can we also complete it while carrying four DPS-build noobs?

mine crashed once earlier today, but just once in about 6 hours of play, so nothing outrageous. i'm on xbox
---
My rifle woman build . The ultimate sniper, but is so dainty that she'll die if you lose focus. However damage is over the top , with 5k full Andrenaline perks and no buff on sbq with a bloodied 50 vats gauss rifle.  I use a thorn set of Unyielding with some being awr , some pieces have ap and agility

The problem is, launching a nuke and killing the queen is all there is (and it's a pretty shitty boss fight on top of that).  Where are the dungeons, raids or high level zones?  I'm not expecting WoW-style dungeons but interiors/camps packed with high level enemies seems like a no-brainer.  Take it a step further with randomly generated areas (ex. *The Underground* from The Division) and multiple difficulties.  Hordes of Super Mutants or Scorched swarming zones (actual hordes...not 5 mobs wandering in the middle of the road)?  
---
Compared to what games like The Division 2 or Destiny offered, even when they first launched, FO76 falls laughably short as far as having anything to do at high level content is concerned.
---
I have 2 smoke machines so I’m now stuck
---
Yup I agree, but they can sell them for quick caps I guess
---
Thank you for sharing this. I'm surprised you're not getting attacked by random people on this thread for verifying my post. There's been a lot of people downvoting this - I believe cheaters are downvoting this post to delegitimize this method of cheating. Unfortunately for them... I've got video and there will be an end date to this exploitation. Thanks again.
---
No one is talikng about soloing with dps build we are talking about the communities clear lack of the ability to do or read the event then fail and go purple man bad
---
How much is it?
---
Check how much gunpower you have stored. Make sure spoiled food isn’t in your stash also.
---
The amusement park outfits parse as pretty feminine imo. Very colorful to boot. I THINK the Camden Park clock-in station has one that always spawns nearby, either in a container or just in the world. Dunno about the generic one.
---
I worked in the basement of the penn for a haunted house still gives me the creeps
---
What caverns are those?
---
Plenty of people thrive on negativity. It's weird, but there it is. If it wasn't FO76/Bethesda, it'd be something else.
---
When you go into extras(blemishes, tattoos, markings, etc.), has anything changed?
---
Blocker (strength), dodgey (agi), serendipity (luck) and dont forget lone wanderer (char). Lifegiver is also great and radicool is awesome if youre running a low health build. Thats plenty of damage resist for most stuff, no pa required.
---
Lol, I know what you mean!  I just trade for mine, I have nearly 3k altogether.  Try the trading forum, lots of people there will sell or trade for it !
---
Check for gunpower and spoiled food.
---
Actually it is 18 percent based on the poll that they took
---
It's a diverse community of people from across the world; rather than blaming other people for their playstyles we can always adapt to help them
---
I thought that was the Blood Eagles.
---
I can’t do it solo but if some one will pylon for me my BE laser kills her in one clip on the first try. BE laser is her kryptonite.
---
Complaining about shows you don't watch
---
Is this your only experience on a gaming sub? A LOT of them are like that. Take a peek at a sub for anything remotely popular, especially with multiplayer components.
---
We get too much back,  we really do. Especially when crafting.
---
We got enough to worry about with masks in real life lol but totally agree
---
It might be your internet. We recently upgraded and now it only crashes when the internet goes out. Could of been an issue with your internet or provider.
---
Those were the good ol' days lol I wondered the same thing when I ran into the scorched for the first time
---
The artwork in some of the cells was the creepiest to me.  But that basement was what they called the "Sugar Shack," right?  The guards were too afraid to go down there, so whatever happened there, happened.  *shudder*
---
Maybe
---
Maybe a new daily quest for the factions: provide x amount of y ammo type to complete. Finally a use for 10mm and .38.
---
I got a bunch, you can bave one
---
I'm totally up for that 🤘
---
Many trolls don't actually play the games they shit on.
---
I've seen it elsewhere - it seems that r/fo76 is more of that than in other places I frequent.
---
Again, I get people have valid reasons to be upset, but when I get that way about a game, or company, I just move on. I don't understand why people would want to be reminded of the thing that upsets them every time they're on Reddit.
---
Gunslinger with gauss pistol
---
My god your everything wrong with society. No but in all seriousness we arnt talking builds we are literally talking about reading what the screen says and doing it to complete the event I dont care if your a dood varying pa build tank a pylon or do mob duty but dont complain about events not having mechanics then not doing said mechanics
---
So you think it's more trolling than really frustrated players?
---
I remember searching the standing corpses and getting a fat dose of rads
---
Blood eagles?
---
Which happens to be unavailable the skins should be more available unless you can get it ingame without atoms
---
There's actually a few of them, but they are mostly locked behind the Atom store. My favourites are the one from the Raider Bundle, the one from the Mothman bunble, and the Skull Raider gas masks that sometimes appear on the store.
---
All for more variety and uses, but they are awesome for looks alone.
---
At times yes. Most of the actual players have discords that they visit and discuss things there.
---
Idk because i bought mine long ago and it won't show me the price.
---
Here are some other girly outfits in game:
---
-red dress
---
-civil war era dress
---
-Garb of mysteries/tattered dress
---
-swimsuit
---
-witch costume dress
---
20 caps
---
Nothing has changed there, I can def see the blemishes being applied but it seems to be more of a skin effect. When I try and edit the skin type such as weathered, smooth, ruddy it doesn’t show anything change and the % scale doesn’t do anything either
---
Pretty much all of the bears are are at the Tyler County Fairground. The exception being the pristine teddy bear which you can find at Charleston Station.
---
Politics
---
A lot of players like to put them in the display cases, same with the mr fuzzy dolls
---
I'll look into that. Still think flux for ammo is kinda dumb. Ultracite should be enough....
---
You should read the posts below - seriously. This is happening to many people and you shouldn't  denounce something that's already been proven. Multiple people ha e confirmed this. Did you even read the post in its entirety? This is a vendor glitch that has been shared across reddit and is already known... so please stop trying to devalue solid information. Several people on this thread have already shown this is happening to them. Stop looking for upvotes and try to support the community and what others are going through. Whether you believe it or not doesn't mean it isn't happening. I have two videos of this, as do others in this feed.
---
Sorry that you can't adapt to that situation. I hope you have better luck finding players who play the way you need them too in the future

I believe, lore wise... they are flat worms that FEV was tested on
---
I believe they are supposed to West-Tek experiments or something. That's about all I know or remember.
---
Oxhorn made a video
---
Yes exactly
---
You can, sometimes. Takes a laggy server huge damage, and no guarantee. Me and a friend run this constantly. I tank all pylons, he slaughters her. On a laggy server, when she first shows up, wham, dead before I run the pylons, maybe once out of ten times.
---
Explains why they spawn in the ground, thanks
---
I'm really not following what you mean of the game says to capture the pylons to damage the sheepsquatch how is there any other option
---
West Tek need to sort it out
---
I gotta be honest with you... I'm pretty sure I've never drank it myself, I just made it to give out to other people. D: Fuck. Thanks for letting me know, I'll uh. Leave off it.
---
It's ok. I agree with you. Too many bots
---
That’s..... strange. *scratches head*
---
It does yes. Luckily the in-game community is a lot better than the one here. However, once a game has a rough reputation as bad as this one due to a dev that keeps making blunders or has a terrible good:bad move ratio, that's a tough thing to ditch. It's gotten a little better believe it or not. There aren't nearly as many people who don't play the game and just come to argue as there used to be. Fans love the franchise and want it to improve and it can be frustrating when you care about something but have no control over it, watching it just roll around in the dirt. A lot of people mean well but they end up bitter.
---
This sub full of braindead sheep desprate for something to do
---
Dont watch too much oxhorn anymore, just to love him law vidoes
---
TBH you fully deserve this. 
---
Bethesda have failed to deliver on many promises, so you decided to ignore this? 
---
This isn’t the first, second or third lie, its several score by now.
---
Hopefully you'll have learned not to pay for a product before its done.
---
That would be the regular grognak or the king grognak outfit, right?
---
I’ve only seen it one one in a vendor at the price was astronomical, what platform are you one?
---
I know what you mean, they really make you work for that damage bonus, the crafting efficiency makes it worth it though.  Plasma cartridges for example, you get over 200 ultracite cartridges per flux as opposed to 50.  There are other ammos that are the same way, .308 and 2mm for sure!
---
The Red dress
---
Yes but this isnt a mechanic and shouldn't be relied apon
---
The real life deathclaw mask is just awesome..l it’s like art imitating life imitating art... it has come full circle.
---
They did an awesome job replicating West Virginia sights. Thanks for sharing
---
What are mr. fuzzy tokens?
---
So the other people in this feed confirming the same issue... they're lying? The experiences of others are meaningless until it's happened to you? I'm posting this to protect people and inform. You're posting to misinform and smear someone that is trying to help the community. Know your place.
---
Interdasting.
---
But making armor pieces and weapons that really please the player can be daunting.
---
Unless youre like me and have given up all hope on the devs being anything more than 5 holotapes and a corpse
---
Dude I hope not because from the purveyor I got a 3 star furious explosive railway rifle and that thing shreds but my stock pile of spikes ran out and it is expensive to craft them and guass ammo plus 45 ammo lol
---
"Enraged growling"
---
I like to try to beat my time with the imposter sheep but I only insta kill her if it was my card and my sister is my pylon. I also try to team invite any one showing up to share loots.
---
Bulking only saves space on lead and aluminium for some reason.
---
Log cabin is under the last building tab "misc" its a pre-built building you place down. You do not unlock the log cabin walls in the wall section.
---
Yup, definately seems that you're having trouble understanding what was written. It doesn't mean that I'm upset with you, or that I'm going to blame you, or exclude you for not participating properly :-P
---
Here's a good list of most outfits in the game:
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_armor\_and\_clothing](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_armor_and_clothing)
---
Ratty, Patterned Fringe Dress, Asylum Worker outfits.. are probably some of the more girly outfits available. Definitely worth looking through the list to see if there is anything that you might like.
---
You can thank all those players from the past that join in the SBQ fights and don't do anything. If the queen never exponentially got more hp per player (hell even a cap) I wouldn't care at all of some AFK'd the fight. Used to be just shot once and you got loot now it's a minimum damage to receive loot.
---
The proof is all the other people posting about this issue. It's all over the web my friend.
---
Been there, done that lol
---
I wish I could find stable flux for 200, I’ve only seen it at 1 vendor at it was 1000 a pop
---
Mega swag 😂 ima try that out though
---
Too much money dude
---
Lol that do, sometimes I do that just for nostalgia
---
They scrap to cloth.
---
but as moonchild said, many collect them (myself included).
---
As far as stuffed critters go, IIRC, there are 12 Bears (plus the sloth.)
---
Ditto Mr Fuzzys.
---
The atom shop adds 4 Mr fuzzys, the rabbit, mr pebbles, and an alligator...grognak and a gangster plushie.
---
you have to do 1000 damage to her yourself or as part of a team to get the loot and rewards.
---
I also have this problem.  I did quite a few of the Vital Equipment dailies but now all I can get from Ward is his default dialog.
---
True that, tho I would say 2 Todd Howard games I would pay full price for is morrowind and oblivion
---
Ok so are you saying it ok for you to be there if you dont know what to do cause if so thats fair no starts off know but what I'm talking about are the repeat offenders the ones who sever hop events and literally waste ammo shooting the imposter instead of grabbing pylons and the such
---
yup
---
Depends on platform. But between 5 and 10k caps.
---
Geez even that green leafy carpet at WS😳
---
Old dirty teddy only spawns in one place that I know of &amp; it's the hardest to find. Its in the burrow in Harper's Ferry.
---
Wait a minute, you're telling me the atoms we earn in 76 can buy CC content in 4??? Dammnnn never heard that before
---
Now that would be freaky
---
Only picture I can't recall from the game is picture 25. Can someone tell me please?
---
So you think that people with learning or reading disabilities shouldn't play with you?
---
I loved the artwork and yes it was the sugar shack but the worst part was just the atmosphere was wicked
---
It looks like gaudy on a budget.
---
I'd bet money that the Communist News Network took that poll.
---
I was amazed by how accurately they got the Palace of Gold.  I've lived in the northern panhandle of Wv my whole life and still have never been there
---
I just got on now, a bit early. If you’re available atm for it.
---
I have had Beckett at my C.A.M.P. for almost a month it seems. Have only been able to do a couple from him. About to juat yank him from my C.A.M.P. personally.
---
Definitely blood eagles. Notice the rib cage below the eagles wings.
---
Thing is most people never read the terminal entries and do the related quests (if any) to the events.
---
Well that seems incredibly steep. I could see people selling for up to 300 maybe, but it shouldn't really be more than that.
---
it was removed a few updates ago, the reason given the trolling already mentioned.
---
Oh thanks. Makes sense.
---
If the limit is removed there is no need to half the return. Chances to get a roll you want is so slim already that this would only frustrate players more.
---
you didn't do the math.
---
I will give you a hint: limit on scrip from the machine = 150
---
oh, i'll be there in 45 mins to an hour
---
No im all for teaching people mechanics I use to sherpa in destiny 1 and for awhile in 2. Ps I'm also handicap mainly why I wasn't getting the double speak atuff your doing. I dont think there is a place for people who know they are doing wrong and purposely doing it wrong be c ause they think if they do it hard eneough it'll work

Fair

Dross toss at Camden Park has some hanging as prizes

Dont get me wrong bethesda makes a mean SP rpg, but they are filled with bugs, of all kinds. Duping works on all of bethesda games by siming clicking on craft obects really fast, you can create items wothout the required resources. Its like a desync thing or something i think, it exists in all of bethesdas games even f76
---
That reminded of this fine post.

I was talikng about the one bethesda did they where shock that less than 1/5 of there entire players base wanted PvP and that figure is based on across console and pc play so it is even less on each respective service
---
 Try playing where you don't craft or repair anything except cooking, make no camp,  and don't use the stash box.
---
I don’t know which one did it but I’m a power armor main and I went from 57 fc to less than 20 in one hit. Saying I was pissed is a bit of an understatement

---
Thanks. Got those. What are the best mods?
---
That's what I'm running around wearing now
---
Some people have difficulty understanding themselves and decide to be aggressive and poisonous with their words in order to gain some momentary sense of control. It’s easy to do that to anything that doesn’t meet your expectations, especially when you feel like some righteous doombringer when you say certain things.
---
I know man... I was so depressed I had to lay down midday because my heart felt like it was ripped out. Idk how people can get enjoyment out of ruining a game for everyone. Players are PEOPLE not NPCs... I think that these types of people forget that they're negatively impacting ACTUAL people.

Barbecue sauce.

Mesquite is a good bet.

yea if you was on pc id give you stuff

[https://youtu.be/KTQu3EnLBdM](https://youtu.be/KTQu3EnLBdM) I use RifleGaming's build. It's the most optimized I've used. I switched out 2 points in perception, to intelligence (I absolutely need to customize my weapons and need rank 5 gun nut). For addictions, I try not to touch strength, endurance, or DR. Marsupial, adrenal reaction, and other mutations.
---
Instigating explosive still doesn't apply the Instigating effect correctly about half the time, in my experience.
---
Lol, I hate how bad the screen rate stutters when you try to craft a bunch at once
---
I've Ben Wondering how you double smoke machine guys are doing lol. I wonder if anyone still has the extra vendor glitch still.
---
Gotta make sure! Also don’t forget to scrip legendaries or transfer them to alts, holding onto most legendaries just isn’t worth it. A lot of times aid can take a lot of space and saving plans takes a ridiculous amount of storage if you hoard.
---
These are likely naturally occurring ringworms that were infected by water contaminated in huntersville. No direct lore comparison, but they are markedly different from west coast floaters which had some human interference for a few of its generations pre-war.
---
I also make sure to fast travel to train stations here and there to do so. Thanks for the tips!
---
I don't know what guides it, but you're right that the daily (or every-other-day) offerings have become less frequent in the past month or so.
---
I kind of liked having them too.  Flash sales may be their own kind of predatory thing, but it *does* give players something to look forward to every day.  Rather than "Oh, this week's offerings are lame" and not checking until next Tuesday.
---
For sure. I finally using up the last of my regular plasma cartridges and plasma cors so I need to get on it.
---
Imagine how good tes 6 would be if they switched over to unreal engine 4 or something similar

There are three type of people in public events

Almighty one shot bloodied build: do nothing because they are so great and kill everything with one shot

People who dont have eyes or only can press attack button

Last group is peasents. Collect ores tank pylons load feeding througs repair broken things becausr they are trying to complete event most of the time this group cant tag legendaery enemies also this group known as people who can read
---
  IMHO, Sequined red dress and mistress of mysteries garb are the fanciest.
---
 THen there’s the grognak outfit (regular and king/queen), the rocketgirl suit (other than the big ring for attaching the helmet....)
---
the ratty skirt, tattered dress (or the clean version), 
---
For no frills, theres the green dress (which also camouflage-ish in NW) or any of the asylum outfits.
---
If you just want to show off curves, the marine wetsuit, with Chinese armor not far behind.
---
I had that happen. I got out of my power armor and it looked like I had two black eyes. I could change my appearance back to normal, But I have no idea why it changed.

Your friendship is worth more, I'll just get a PC so we can kick it in Appalachia.

No, there was an actual Roman Gladiator outfit.
---
Unlike the Legion from New Vegas, though, it's very "costumey."  Like you picked it up from a Spirit Halloween store, rather than having it be forged and battle-hardened.
---
hell yea baibee
---
It got “fixed” alright— to keep two shot explosive shotguns from killing everything in sight. 
---
Don’t expect much in terms of a fix, just use VATS to avoid the rubber banding
---
I see your point and raise you cooler animations
---
They terrify me worse than Ticks.  And I loathe Ticks' crawling sound.  True NOPE-tology.
---
Bethesda: *No.*
---
Your build is damage based, and for that it isn't too bad except I think adrenaline should be a bit higher.  I don't see any defensive perks except one rank of adamantium skeleton.  I assume you are running PA all the time.  Personally, I'd scrap better criticals and lower class freak, move some of those points into endurance and add things like lifegiver, blocker and serendipity.  If all you care about is damage output, then don't bother, but if you want a better QOL outside PA, add some defense.
---
Just floating in space forever...
---
Too late, many other games do it and have been successful at it. Even if it isn't a full blown monthly subscription service, they still offer things such as "season passes" which are also successful.
---
Calibrated receiver, aligned when possible, and reflex sight 
---
You could chuck on other mods if you weren’t gonna use vats but I like to use em in vats, just my 2 caps
---
I like the fashionable raiders outfit. Sensible— stylish, nice color, works well with just about any hat or helmet type. Also has a half decent face mask that you can wear sunglasses under.
---
It's hard not to be pessimistic about future titles when they've been at it this way since Fallout 4.
---
I'm open to recommendations
---
East of Knife’s Edge and halfway to the fort, there’s a little shack which has (almost?) every bear in it.
---
Well, daily log in of accounts is how they report game 'health' (engagement) and that is what keeps the cogs turning. Unfortunately some dumb fucks in the office dont realise that this sickening grind will eventually drive a good % of the playerbase away.
---
Grinds in online games are acceptable, but of the standard that 76 has right now it is completely nonsensical and dangerous to the games longevity.
---
The last time it happened it fixed a day or two later after I was looking through mouth types and it suddenly flipped to smooth skin so I ultimately don’t know why it does this or how it fixes. I’ve also rendered in with a mans face too but that was a quick server hop fix.
---
You must have not been around for SB ver 1.0. Those motherfuckers were so annoying to fight.
---
Yup! I ran with the greaser outfit for the longest because I just couldn't find anything else I liked.
---
Was a little bummed out when I found out you can't display PA
---
Well, the counterargument would be this: if 76 were a critical, undeniable flop with no redeeming qualities, it would be a lot easier to dismiss.  But I think many players acknowledge there's *something* good in there, which Bethesda has often struggled to bring to the surface, or obscures under bad design choices.  And that makes it frustrating.
---
Prime that bad boy for ammo efficiency and damage.  You get over 200 rounds per craft, so 4x as much.  Nice gun!  I use my junkies ffr for queen fights and love it.
---
If beth implemented an event "guide" that explains what to do , and the basic mechanics of each event and locate it in the main menue that would very helpful. Especially for more casual players.
---
How much we talking? I have like 4 of them
---
A lot of people don't hate FO76 or Bethesda. A lot of people love the game and have a lot of hope for the future of it but feel letdown consistently. 
---
It always feels like there are big promises and they never meet the expectation that Bethesda themselves set. I understand the feeling of disappointment. Some people just wanna see the game be the best it can and feel the need to vent. 
---
Others on the other hand mindlessly hate every game, not just Fo76
---
An over all guide would be nice but the events actually do tell you what to do and are pretty though about it atleast the ones with extra mechanics ado anyways
---
We all want this game to be great, but it's much like being in a toxic relatiknship...  we love the game, but it lies, cheats, and steals. What can you do...
---
You got xbox?
---
some of the places (like Helvetia) don't look appreciably worse off in FO than IRL.  which is kinda depressing ....
---
I am on pc, I bought 10 of each kind for over 5000 caps and lost them immediately after lol
---
Check the houses next to Becker Farm. I live there and I see a spatula on my kitchen counter every night.
---
Yep. I have 600 atoms I got from fo76 and they show up in CC on fo4. I'm assuming atoms aren't tied to the game. Prob another Bethesda mess up. 
---
Haven't checked Skyrim tho.
---
Dross Toss has a fair few hanging around.
---
Upper left corner of the map in the forest area and next to the river. I like the scenery.
---
um, excuse me, do you have anymore .... desk fans?
---
They shouldn't. An online game like this is supposed to have different tiers of difficulty. The problem is that so far, their only difficulty has been getting good RNG, owning meta gear, and not being on a laggy server. People would welcome more challenging content if it's actually a challenge and not a game of chance
---
Wow you think they would have responded to one or two of the complaint threads about this to say "Hey, yeah, you are getting discounts that other people aren't." but I guess then they would also be pressed to comment on the other things they said they were going to work on adding.
---
I think part of the idea of thing, besides just being wacky and fun is to get more players familiar with encrypted event.  I myself am reluctant to run into the mele when nobody will grab a pylon. And for that matter be a tanky build who has adaquate stem packs to survive.  I swear most don't know the imposter takes 0 damage when cloaked..
---
I’ve seen explosive energy weapons reappearing post Wastelanders. My AAE gat plasma started to get jealous, but I have yet to find a weapon to match its raw power— outside of 3 star BFSR Baseball bat.
---
My disdain is for Bethesda's treatment of the game and us.
---
They took peoples thoughts on ESO seriously, they turned things around with ESO.
---
They still have not learned what they are doing wrong with Fallout 76.
---
They think adding shiny new stuff to the atom shop every week will keep people from leaving a game due to lack of maintaining it or fixing known issues.
---
Well if they were paying attention they would follow ESO's example and start FIXing the game first.
---
Even with hundreds of  bug reports, streamers and youtubers documenting the hell out of issues with VATS, with fast traveling, with NPCs disappearing, not giving quests, not responding they  REFUSE to even acknowledge the issues and just keep adding shiny stuff to the game.
---
I love Fallout I wish a company could see what Fallout could be if it was treated correctly and get it away from Bethesda.
---
I feel like atoms wouldn't show up in Skyrim, don't they use a different currency there? But I think the reason why your atoms are showing up on CC is because of your bethesda.net account
---
This is the reason why people who have mics need to speak up during these events. If there was a universal text chat, people who were doing it wrong would get told they're doing it wrong. It's hard to remember that all of us here on Reddit make up a very very small percentage of the active player base. Speaking up here is one thing, but we should be doing it in game. 
---
The game needs text chat so fucking bad.
---
My belief is that when the character model gets all stretched out for use in Power Armor, the engine doesn't restore them 100% accurately when they get out of it.
---
There were a few very minor tells.  My cheeks would clip through the Gas Mas with Goggles after using Power Armor.  Or the screen on my Pip-Boy didn't sit flush within its frame.
---
There's probably some kind of rounding error involved.
---
throw on the big pink floppy sun hat and a pair of fashionable glasses and you've got a solid pinup look going.
---
Just use Vats. If not enough AP, then don’t use shotguns
---
Yes that is correct.  You do not need to find the codes yourself.
---
I list most of the ammo for 0 caps. The rest I sell for 1 cap. I found a vendor selling 4000 .45 ammo for 0 caps and I was like woah. Ended up only taking about 1000 cause I would have felt bad taking all of it. 
---
Thing I think is funny is people selling plans for ridiculous amounts. I cant think of anyone that wants faschnat ribbons for 3000 caps. 
---
I did list a super expensive item as a joke for 20000 caps. It was a 1 star lead pipe I got from SBQ. I named it Queen's Toy. No takers yet.
---
did you tried to make a column with 4 of those curved corner counters? or the budget skyrocketed? xd
---
Does vats make the bug not happen?
---
Flatworms that are FEVed so yea I like them
---
I scrapped a BOS jumpsuit last week when I got distracted by some salesman knocked on my door 😭
---
I have more than enough ap I'd say, my agility is around 7 or 8
---
They are in both games but more featured in the first since the antagonist is the leader of a Super mutant army and "father" to most West Coast Super mutants. However, the Fallout 76 Floaters are notably different from the ones seen in the classics, so they might be completely different creatures or just variants.
---
It wouldnt help in this game just imagine how toxic world chat would get and how fast that would happen
---
When Bethesda asked to base the game in West Virginia they were told they could as long as the map was not geographically accurate for security reasons.
---
The dry lake bed north of Charleston.  Seem to get great foot traffic for my vendors and good source of water from the stream. Plus animal spawns that keep me from starving.  Though I do miss the Super Mutants that were in Summerville before Wastelanders dropped.
---
South of 76 because I like helping newbies
---
Yes! That was exactly what I was thinking, the quality of them varies so why not stick with quantity
---
https://nukacrypt.com/solved
---
I am mind blown by these pictures! I mean even the gazebos are perfectly placed in the game! I want to visit even more now!
---
Cool thanks!
---
Block constantly then strike when you got a clean shot.
---
I'm bloodied and they can't even nick my health bar before they die.  Adamantium, Blocker, Serendipity, Nerd Rage.
---
What math? I just said you can buy as many as you want each day, instead of just 10.
---
Nice. You on PS4 with spare plan? :)
---
I don’t mind encryptid anymore since I discovered that I can simply tank all 3 pylons and just keep stimpaking myself. I’ve got around 600 on me on a good day, I can take it lol. I just grab all 3 pylons and hide while the bloodied players murder the robot XD.
---
My "Pinky Demon" runs entirely in Light Metal Armor with Pink Paint and the Devil Horns.  It was the Felt Antler Headband before that.  Pink Pip-Boy.  No Underarmor.  Sometimes wears the Stalker Goggles.
---
She looks half-naked going into battle, but I assure you, she can tank the SBQ with the best of them.
---
If you at max script the daily limit is 20 modules.
---
I like the look :( didn't really like the sports store look of the Legion I figured they'd actually forge their own armor, football pads and sunglasses is meh. Legionaires looked great though
---
Heavy Guns and vats don't like each other if you know what I mean.
---
How about heavy stealth?
---
Why? Just why?  😡
---
Oh sick, I’ll have to do that tomorrow.
---
I'm also not buying your mounted head for 150 caps LOL
---
There is an exception tho, the Plasma Caster matched a VATS build very well.
---
That's what filters are for. By that logic, how do text chat systems exist and all the other games that have it? Filters.
---
This is without a doubt the most friendly gaming community I've ever seen by a large margin. Yeah, there's always going to be toxic people, but that's why things exist to deal with that. I don't foresee text chat being as toxic as you are cynically implying in this game.
---
What I cant stand is when I'm in locations like the assylum, I'm checking all the corners clearing the rooms one by one yet somehow they always managed to appear right behind me.
---
Like I even once back into a corner of a room and they were still somehow spawning right behind me. 
---
Best way to deal with them is by being stealthed with lights out.
---
There are no girls playing FO76, why would you want 'girly' outfits? 😒
---
Right, but he said 10 modules. And if you have 1000 and 150 at the vendor you can still buy 3 more. That's why his original comment is wrong and now his reply doesn't make any sense.
---
I could really do with this, if you happen to be doing this another time
---
I put the tadpole uniform and a ranger hat on the raider punk for a while.  Then I did the western outfit and cowboy hat.  Both made me chuckle everytime I went back to my camp.
---
lol, just got the gauss minigun and all but the pentabarrel for it, can't craft the ammo. FML, time to go plan hunting.
---
If I tell you ill have to move it.
---
Next to the foundation in a very spefic place that gets me both a Lead Extractor and an Acid Extractor.
---
This reddit is the most friendly gaming community youve found the world in the game is a whole other story
---
I bought the package with the succulents once, still haven't been able to find where those are hidden.
---
No, you are limited by the amount of scrip.
---
Nope that’s illegal
---
Yea, this would be great, especially if you are new. Ive started to avoid events if I dont know what the task is because
---
Its not clear to me where to get informationand actually be useful.
---
You're not allowed to enjoy the game for what it does have and hate the company for making bad decision one after another.
---
Simply put, you think a deaf/mute person shouldnt play the game because they hate Bethesda for ignoring their requests for text chat
---
All the complaints are completely valid, just because you have 20 hours in the game doesn't mean you know as much as the guy with 500 hours
---
I HATE THOSE THINGS! They scare me as much as the Flatwoods Monster
---
If you’re online, we could get it done right now!
---
There’s a pre-existing cabin on a cliff southeast of Whitespring, because I like building with stuff that was already there and it saves on camp budget.
---
I wish it was a power armor bug but I don’t use power armor. Then again any glitch you can dream of is possible in fallout
---
Go away and find something else.
---
Seriously, it will be better for us, and better for you. It isn't healthy for you to keep doing something unnecessary that you don't like. There are so many other games out there.
---
Yeah but instead we will get skyrim and skyrim EE for ps5 with exclusive buster sword dlc
---
Ranged attack, 5.56 handmade, VATS one shell each, watch the pretty colors, harvest dropped loot.
---
Lol I am a girl
---
Well I honestly don't get how promised nodding in the future would properly work without this unless they try and force all mods through the creation club.
---
Modding I imagine will happen once the game starts dying, when its less profitable theyll let us host our own servers and mod the game
---
Have you tried swapping her out for another ally, then back again? This fixed Beckett for me when he refused to say anything new to me.
---
Lol, that's not true at all. Where are you getting that metric from?
---
That's what they all say 😎🤣
---
I see prices all over the place. Some player had them at 500 caps each.  I sell 100% charged for 20-30 caps each.
---
I personally would like some tougher enemies for us solo players. I love project paradise and encrypted. What I hate is having to rely on randoms to complete the event.
---
I've heard of male characters having magic beards that showed up without player intervention, so it wouldn't surprise me if this is something similar.  The character appearance just gets corrupted in some way.
---
I'm betting you have +33 Vats, +50 Limb Damage or Bashing damage on your weapon or you have armor with less damage while blocking.
---
True. Didn’t even think about those extra three. Now what about all the scrip for the daily’s. I wonder what’s total max amount of scrip you can cash in if you let all those pile up.
---
I would say 50-75 caps each. They’re somewhat expensive to craft and are tedious to find fully charged.
---
I just did project paradise last night again even though it goes against my grain. There were 3 others in the area with me and I was the only one running around getting the toxic goo to load into the machine. Some tool kept just following me around the area trying to trade with me the whole time...God it makes my head want to explode! It’s the same reason I dont even bother with Sheepsquatch because it is complete F’ing chaos.....
---
No one admits they are from West Virginia.
---
I used to work in DC. Me and a friend always stepped out front for a smoke after lunch, right on the corner of the block. Seeing the 17th and K sign we were always under is my favorite memory of that game.
---
I haven’t got her at my camp yet. I did her first fetch quest but can’t turn it in
---
Just south of whitesprings near ther miner monument.  There is a junk extractor there, it's pretty high traffic with vending,  and there is a settler spawn in my front yard that has a crate that usually has chems/alcohol sitting on it and a duffel bag full of ammo.  A very short walk away is a small cave that has a static yao guai spawn.  
---
I really couldn't ask for much more.
---
Fair it would be cool to have a really powerful enemy for solo p l ay
---
Lol what's the EE stand for? Extra edition
---
Road tripper outfit.
---
I’m so confused😂
---
No, but it makes it much more likely that the enemy dies before the bug can kick in.
---
I agree it amazes me that the whole development team doesnt understand balance. .50 cal and 5mm rounds do less damage than smaller caliber, the mirelurk’s do more damage and are feared more than Deathclaws...... Just doesnt make sense really
---
Cliffs overlooking Watoga. It's a beautiful view of the bog from my front porch, puts me right next to frequent SBQ events (I love sitting in my rocking chair and watching the nukes fall), very, very rarely does anything ever spawn there to attack so I don't have to have any security whatsoever and it's out of the way enough that I don't often log in and someone else is in my spot. But not SO far out of the way, so I still get lots of traffic for my vendors. I love it, I've been there for months and I don't see myself ever moving. It's home.
---
Sorry bud, Xbox here, check the trading forums, it should be readily available from all the duping.
---
So you are not limited each day, you are limited by the scrip cap.
---
It’s not in the atomic shop but if you wanna sell it I’ll buy
---
Oh! I guess I don't know then. If there's a way to abandon the quest, I'd say try that and start it all over. That is super weird, sorry.
---
I did a similar trip not even two weeks ago. I hit the Mothman museum, Beckley mine, New River Gorge bridge, Greenbrier and the train station, Helvetia (which was an interesting drive as got got me lost at o e point), the Lighthouse (that was fun going up it), the Asylum (we did one of the tours, and they have plenty of tours and events), Palace of Gold and their Temple down the road)
---
It was a good trip. Wasnt able do the Bunker tour though
---
Not all heroes wear capes. Cheers fellow vault dweller &amp; doer of good deeds.
---
Yeah. Sure enough. Thanks
---
My lady character wears Maxson's battlecoat, a newsboy cap, patrolman's shades, blue bandana with a pink pipboy, look kinda cool.
---
The road tripper outfit
---
Welcome to the *paid beta*!  
---
We hope you enjoy your stay.  
---
Please exit via the Atom Shop.
---
It's untradeable.
---
I greatly dislike Floaters. For what they are, they should be less power than the Mutant Hounds. Bethesda should have reintroduced Centuars for an over powered Super Mutant companion.
---
I'm also on ps4 and besides the Bethesda login issues a few days ago, I have seen nothing like what you describe.
---
Ah, I wonder if it's a problem with server desynchronization that causes this bug, maybe it doesn't happen in a private world as much
---
jeez, how many times are you going to ask the same question? it's been answered, stop spamming the sub.
---
I’m PS4 or I’d put in some time with you. I play solo myself, got lucky today and was on a server that did 3 queens, project paradise and radiation rumble. Usually never happens.
---
Charleston, at the pond near the Train Station Vendor. Safe area, water, vendor close by.
---
Sounds more like a local problem else we'd all be having it.
---
Um. What? I love the game. You go away lol. You're anomosity is unnecessary. I'm simply referring to the endless glitches that affect us all. No need to be so angry.
---
Good point. Definately agree on the punishing the many because of the few, they will find a way because they’re dupers.
---
THATS AMAZING, REAL LIFE LOOKS LIKE F76
---
Rule of thumb is never pay more than 1 cap per % of charge.  That is absolute top dollar.
---
Ohhh I’m sorry
---
Even the fucking trashcans look the same
---
I’ve got a furious explosive plasma gat. The damage stacks properly.
---
Only with a flamer
---
Exactly, and having such a small cap limit forces item for item trades, and like I said, is completely untrustworthy
---
Top of Seneca because creatures dont spawn there
---
I literally spend 50 -70 caps to travel across the map if i see a potential good vendor lol
---
My main's is next to Vault 76 itself, mostly because I didn't want to bother with Scorchbeasts or potential nukes.
---
My other two live just to the west of the Palace of the Winding Path in the hills overlooking Toxic Valley, on a very deliberately-chosen plateau where enemies don't seem to ever spawn/
---
How do you have that LSD moving cockroach
---
You can spawn the keycard mission as many times as you want at the Whitespring bunker by server hopping.  And the codes you can just look up on Nukacrypt.  They reset once a week and once you input a code for a silo you don't even have to enter it again until the reset.
---
Yes, they should ignore armor, be able to blindside people. I mean... look at those pointy fingers!
---
 Nerf mirelurk hunters and kings, buff deathclaws!
---
The plasma caster is ok with Vats. The other option is the Flamer, you can run a stealth build with it right now (check out Angry turtle on YouTube)
---
Sweet, I'll grab it daily
---
Is this your first experience with griefing or something? Lol
---
GIFs are supported for profile pics if you upload them as a png.
---
Solomon's pond.
---
There is water for my purifiers, junk around to pickup when I have a spare sec., lvl 3 &amp; 2  safes, a mag and bobblehead spawn. Originally  also because it's close to Whitespring but not close enough to be on top of everyone else and sort of central.
---
Thinking about moving a bit closer to the bog next.
---
Only way to stop it is by getting fallout 1st unfortunately
---
It’s possible, although it all started after the log in problems a few days ago.
---
I had problems earlier. Midwest?
---
Uuuhhh that sounds like a large chunk of the internet ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Fair enough. At least I can either return it or use it as extra storage space on my next console.
---
Top left corner of the map. Because it's quiet
---
Okay cool, should be with you in 10 mins or so, thanks :)
---
I'm sorry I forgot to put Nuclear Winter in the title :(
---
Most gaming subs are shit. People like having an audience for their wacky ideas or complaints.
---
This sub has too many people that complain about complainers. It's just as annoying as the posts they are criticizing.
---
“I consented to PVP and didn’t like the result. I Guess I’ll cry about it on the internets.”
---
It’s not, which is the most disappointing thing about this game, we’re all from vault 76 in the storyline, why is it normal to be killed by a fellow vault dweller especially that of a spineless individual I mentioned above.
---
will do
---
If you can discipline yourself: realistic wepon management. Limit your favourites to 4 weapons and stims. When i travel appalachia i try to imagine that i have a belt with 2 smaller holsters and a heavier weapon on each shoulder. Additinally on the back of the belt i can attach some stimpaks and grenades. I can wear binoculars around my neck, but everything else has to be stored away in the backpack.
---
You are allowed to have 2 small wepons on your belt (pistol + one handed melee, 2 pistols or 2 one handed melees). On each shoulder you can carry a larger weapon: rifle and two handed melee, or 2 rifles, or 2 two handed melees. 
---
If you have to swich to another weapon you have to manually use your inventory, so you have to try and plan your encounters. 
---
What ever your playstyle is (gunslinger, rifleman, heavy, melee), you will have only two weapons available for quick selection that your character is truly spezialized in. 
---
As a bonus i quickly realised how overencumbered my char was with 8 weapons. i started to leave more and more at home and focussed on modding the remaining ones for less weight. My rifleman now has a 44.pistol &amp; a hatchet on his "belt" + a shotgun and shortened hunting rifle on his "shoulders". In urban areas i swap the hunting rifle for a shortened semi auto handmade. In wide open areas i choose a lever action instead. 
---
You can come up with own ideas with this concept, like a "chest rig" which allows access to a third small weapon, but limits your shoulder carrying capacity to only one bigger gun.
---
You may create some kind of backstory for your character. My char refuses to use any drug harder than stimpacks and beer, but has no problem to sell the drugs he finds. 
---
Or stay in caracter. Cowboy: get a hatchet, throwing knifes, a revolver and lever action. Kudos for a cowboy hat.
---
Survivalist: knife, double barrel shotgun, pipe revolver, hunting rifle. Sackhood would be fitting.
---
Native: hatchet, bow / crossbow, powder pistol / rifle. Cultist mask would look cool. Prefers healing salve over stims.
---
Urban punk: baseball bat, 10mm pistol, pump action and handmade. Lots of drugs and molotow cocktails.
---
Ex cop: baton, 44. revolver, combat shotgun, combat rifle. Cop hat and uniform.
---

---
Amazing, the saving grace of this game, a single player mode, locked behind a paywall. Glorious
---
I can tell you're one of the good ones. I post for players like you, the ones that deserve truth. Thank you so much for being uplifting. Means a lot.
---
I'm not angry, I just misunderstood your point. I thought you were one of the "fuck this game" crowd.
---
Or just harder events for solo players. It's either a breeze to complete or nearly impossible nothing in between.
---
Actually I didn’t consent to PVP since download I’ve been in peaceful mode.
---
Don’t take workshops on public servers if you don’t want someone to do this.  If you need it for a challenge, just claim the workshop and leave.  Some people will bulldoze you no matter how low your level.  Don’t let the experience sour you, it sucks that this happened but you don’t have to go through it again.  If you are after a hard to find resource make an lfg post either in this sub or in an appropriate discord etc, looking for private servers.  
---
Hang in there and you’ll find most people are not like this, most players are more likely to give you a care package than take your workshop.
---
I always thought Fayetteville was a small town and still kinda of mad that they didn’t add the town in the game.
---
When I was in the Society for Creative Anachronism ( SCA ) and the went to Helvetia, I made the comment “ What a quaint town.” I was chuckled at and was told the population was less than 60 and people barely call it a village.
---
And wait... war? On bethesda? Wth is going on?
---
Wait... let's go back to crafting legendaries..  what?
---
It does warn you that workshops allow PvP without direct consent.
---
When I solo this event, I wear troubleshooter's armor.  Just as I am about to activate the final pylon (the one where the imposter sheepsquatch usually spawns) I use a stealth boy, down a couple of nuka quantums, take a psychotat, radshield and start spamming super stims as needed after I activate it.  I rarely get killed but it happens.  I find it easier to solo than to do it with a large group.  Far fewer robots to deal with.
---
Bethesda put the system in the game , not the players . Personally i dont give a shit about workshops cause they suck ass. But there is people who will do what you just wrote
---
“Most people aren’t like this” other then you, the comments on here would disagree
---
West coast
---
I'm sure there is but it would be rather complicated
---
Yep pretty shitty but that’s just how it goes
---
Yeah, Junkies or bloodied fixer or  flamer, nuka quantums and super stims to heal with, dodgy, serendipity, evasive, UNY armor with high ER. Tank the pylons and stay in stealth while hitting the imposter and moving when detected. You could also use troubleshooters armor and heavy guns but I've never done it that way.
---
My camp is right there on the lake so I kill them every day. Takes only one shot with my bloodied shotgun in wats
---
You think that's good lol I grabbed a B2525 fixer off a player vendor for 1k caps yesterday, what a dope!
---
I see a lot of posts on the reddit about how good the community is and it's so sad because they haven't met these assholes yet. PvP=griefing in this game sadly. It's not my cup of tea but some people enjoy it, I just don't think it should be forced.
---
I had some level 250 dude steamroll me when I was a level 9, shit happens
---
If it did it would mean 1 in 24 people would be a duper lol.
---
Taking a workshop is consenting to PVP. This community for the most part, barring me mostly, is fucking fantastic. My guess is someone will be along soon and offer to replace your lost items.
---
lol I dont buy from robots.. tell the other guy
---
Pretty south , cause access to both acid &amp; lead because more important ammo than a mansion with a view
---
I move mine around whenever I’m running low on some kinda scrap I can use the excavator on. Farm it for a few weeks then move onto the next spot.
---
This community is generally supportive and helpful.  There are posts like yours daily and many people are over it, hence the hostility you are getting.  Just take my advice and don’t worry about workshops in public, there are easier ways to get (most) resources.
---
nqh i wasnt
---
They're fine. The issue with sleeping bags is when they're on the floor, not if anything is underneath them. Not sure the logic of it but there you go.
---
So it was a bug that I caught a disease from the sleeping bag in my survival tent?
---
Got a urban scout mask and a white powder jumpsuit for 50 caps each at a player vendor today...today was a good day!
---
You have to complete the settlers quest line up to he point of the vault raid, you don’t actually have to side with them but you have to all their missions
---
thought this was going to be about Primal Cuts.. I miss MEAT Week...
---
How are is Bethesda supposed to develop the game in the direction certain people want if the only people that Bethesda hears are the silly MMO whiners that are happy to have a cartoon backpack and who get upset if someone plays a post-nuclear, anarchistic game without considering how it makes Mr. Cutesy, their sweet level 21 tamed deathclaw feel?
---
Honestly don't know. I don't think it's intentional.
---
Workshops attract this griefing sadly. Workshops aren't worth it for the time it takes as well as the risk of assholes like that. Most of the community is pretty nice, just stay away from workshops.
---
Because the game doesn't encourage roleplaying. It encourages grinding and exploration.
---
Todd is holding my family hostage.
---
Ok ...we'll... make that bring back cichlids AND MEAL WEEK TODD!!!
---
I'm not sure on the stacking, but I know there was a bug (probably still is) that caused the explosive effect to negate armor penetration perks/mods.
---
My 1st camp was around there. Excellent spot as was only 1 point of entry for anything coming up.
---
I've heard between 15 and 20000 caps
---
Can relate. I am sick of blowing out a ton of rad-away and stims for nothing.
---
Lol you good brotha
---
They just moved to the southeest side of that lake bed. Whole town of super mutants.
---
I ran  with a project paradise this week and realized it was effed when my teammates started attacking our animal to keep safe. Ugh. I’m still hoping the law of averages allows a good crew to get together at something point when I click to participate. Like a dirty cheater, I’ve hung onto about 71 radkelp to spend.
---
 Same thing happened today with Cryptid. Playing the Chinese stealth I carry all three pylons, burn through about 20 stim packs, even get some quality damage on the imposter as I’m running to the next pylon, and am praying the team knows to shoot straight. Irony is I die as they win with 2 min left and then there’s no Squatch body to raid when i respawn. Remember the name MrBiscuit027, xboxone, and I’m always down to stealth the dirty work, look me up if you’re going at these events.
---
Why do I keep hearing this? My experiences have largely been negative with you people.
---
Sure there's always posts about how one person was super nice to a noob every couple of days. But I see insta killing bosses and trolling events just as often. 
---
And you know what, I have never encountered either of those types of players and can still say my impression of 76 players is largely negative
---
Congrats on the score!  I hate to admit it but when I was new to trading I sold a quad/ffr/low vats cost gamma gun in my machine for like 300 caps 😂
---
Yeah that’s weird af. Fallout 1&amp;2 floaters look like mutated giant earthworms or a slug maybe with floating acid sacks around their mouth. Not sure wtf they’re supposed to be now.
---
"We're nice so you are receiving hostility"
---
I do, it's a beautiful state with some very real economic and social problems.
---
you took a workshop, which is a pvp zone regardless of pacifist mode, so yes, you did consent. pay attention to the pop up warnings and you won't get plowed.
---
Dupers gonna dupe no matter how high the cap limit is. But the trade system is baloney that’s for sure.
---
Tbf, that's how many vaults end
---
Lag does affect it, but it still happens on private worlds.
---
Ahhhh the turret thing makes a lot of sense. Son of a hell.
---
Oh yeah but I wear marine under armor with +2 strength under it so why do you need the ss one?  Is is better
---
I sell fully charged fusion cores in my vending machines for 76 caps.
---
Literal much?
---
Scariest thing in the Wasteland now is the mirelurk king. Can't wait until they make a giant one of those for us to fight. Not sure why each fissure doesn't spawn its own personal giant creature, but maybe someday they will...👍
---
Can confirm. Deathclaw/Wheeling Island is in a heavily  populated area. The Toxic/Ohio Valley runs more north south than east west.
---
I always sell my ammo for cheap, but I cant get rid if .38 or .44 ammo
---
the up votes are flowing in.. this will be bigger than.. than.. something big!
---
Workshops are PvP areas, if you don't want PvP then don't take workshops
---
You can only buy 23 legendary modules in one day, because that is the limit (1150) on how much scrip you can spend in one day.
---
That is assuming you spend 1000 on modules then turning in items for 150 scrip then spending that on modules as well. As well as hop servers 2 times.
---
Agreed, but when a very unprepared ground has been fighting the queen for almost 20 minutes and there's like 1 minute left before it fails it sure is handy to drop her like a rock before the event fails with a bugged LMG. No complaints then.
---
Let'em flow in like the waters of the ole Mississippi River 🤗😆

Does that include plans, and if so are you on PC?
---
Not at all. I'm sad about all the issues but I have supported the fallout franchise since inception. I started this reddit account just so I could help inform the fallout community when major glitches are occurring. My friends and I came across a profound glitch that nearly put me to tears, but i didnt give up or start a war. I did however catch three players using a glitch that allows thieves to steal directly from your stash... but did i quit or post anything negative? Nope, I let the community know and half of them have had the same thing happen... the other half that responded to my post were spiteful hateful and trolled me. For telling the truth and trying to help people... but despite all the bad eggs, I'll still keeping sharing the truth. No harm no foul about that comment homie. Hope all is well with you.

This has never happened to me in hundreds of hours
---
Then how do I start invisible ties I feel people say that it’s the second main quest
---
Sure we do.  Montani semper liberi.
---
gt: evllve 
---
let’s farm
---
I'm afraid you might be overthinking this. It's big and it kills lots of stuff.
---
Want to sell it to me? I’m just dipping my toes into my bloody build and would put it to a good home :)
---
Those people stain the game
---
Mother fluppin duppers 😬
---
I don't like it much either
---
dont go to encryptid holding yo.. everybody knows that..
---
Right?
---
Personally, I've grown disillusioned with the game. 76 used to be my daily kick back and relax game, but after Bethesda started to pile on bad decision after bad decision, I've gotten increasingly jaded. Then I got into the PTS early on, and seeing first-hand how Bethesda just does not care about player feedback unless it's so overwhelmingly negative that it makes them afraid of a PR blowback made me realize that people's suspicions about how things were run at the company were 100% justified. Seeing players report serious bug after serious bug only for Bethesda to ignore all of those reports and knowingly shipping clearly broken updates was kind of the last straw for me. 
---
So that's where I'm coming from. I'm keeping up with the latest news on the game, but I'm done playing unless Bethesda changes how they do things.
---
Welcome to our PVP community. 
---
They are a fun bunch that I wish would try swimming in the crater.
---
I think if I saw that bus at Greenbrier, I wouldn't be able to stop myself from trying to jump up on it to inject a stimpack and snipe some ghouls.
---
This game has one of the best communities of any online game I've touched or heard of. You willingly decided to enter a PVP zone, idk man if you're getting offended by losing and a little bit of teabagging is it your first day on the internet?
---
It’s fallout, you want an FPS pvp go play COD they should have updated fallout 4 to be multiplayer. At least that’s what this game should have been. Not he bugged up hostile mess it is
---
What’s your in game name please? Might have to visit your camp often :)
---
yeah someone could guesstimate  based on the explosion size. its pretty small though.
---
My gammer tag is Jss125 I'll be on around 8:00. I'm level 130 commando build if you wanna join up. I'll be running the dailys for gold when I first get on
---
Seems like a journey for sure. Do you see yourself playing if things don't change considerably?
---
I feel like i could walk that place blind folded
---

---
Don't forget the floaters
---
Lol indeed
---
It is a toxic game, and it’s really sad how a fallout game which has always been single player has become this. It should have been fallout with friends. Not fallout with dick heads
---
Lol nah I'm good, that's exactly what I did and never unequip it.
---
IGN please? I’m always desperately short of .45!!
---
Love those kinds of people
---
I lived in Boston for a few years, and was blown away by the locations in FO4, especially the library, Fenway, and Newbury Comics.
---
pffft. try 5-6 times that easily. 
---
the forest one goes for 25k the yellow about 20k and the pink about 15k
---
Such a noble leap! Thanks for your help :)
---
It is beyond worth it solely based on rad resistance.  DR is higher than any other armor and you can fit a Jetpack.  Yeah, get it.  I had a full set of AP regen 3\* scout armor before, and now that is gathering dust in the stash of my mule.
---
Also Pa is the only thing north of Morgantown
---
Don't carry junk to any event ever.
---
WHERE
---
I like your pricing structure.  Got any stable cobalt flux?
---
I’ve been experimenting solo using all Troubleshooter gear. 1 win, 2 losses, but I’m making adjustments. I can’t imagine doing this with a bloodied build, but with the right perks and armor (and understanding how the event works in general) it is do-able!
---
This is actually good advice.  If nothing else, get the chest piece first and add the jetpack.  I burned through 400 modules to get a full unyielding set of various 2 and 3\* pieces of SS.
---
I mean I get it, it's fun when you're going for it. But greifing is a whole other issue. I don't mind a fun few PVP runs in the wasteland with someone but beyond that it's not cool, people don't seem to understand boundaries. I've learned a lot about the PVP mechanics through this thread though so I see how it septs happening
---
I mean what's wrong is easily seen on any map
---
I have an absolute ton of fuel, IGN name Xierg7, for a reasonable price
---
I dont hate Bethesda.. I might have a lot of negativity about the game but that's because im a extremely passionate fan of Fallout. 
---
For me personally, is me trying to get Bethesda to make their games better. I love and hate F76, I love it because its "supposed" to be Fallout but almost everything that Bethesda does with the game makes it feel like its not. In a lot of ways it feels more like a Chinese mobile game that's a complete ripoff of Fallout. 
---
And Bethesda has been only going downhill since ESO:V. They keep rereleasing that game over and over. With Fallout 4 it was massively dumbed down compared to New Vegas, the biggest complaints being about lack of any depth in Dialogue and Skills.. So what do they do? They release Fallout 76 with even more lack of depth. Now I do give them "some" credit, they brought NPCs back added a new storyline but they aren't doing enough new content updates to keep end game players around. Plus they constantly find ways to break the game or make it so anti-consumer, constantly going back on their word. 
---
Also god forbid they just can't let go of the BoS and create a new faction that becomes a new fan favorite.. They just HAVE to keep finding a way to put the BoS in every game even in a region and date that doesn't make sense.
---
I haven’t played with anyone yet, I could go a Xbox buddy for 76. Add me DirtyHadgkiss
---
There is supposed to be a new one as a possible reward from the Colossal Problem Event whenever that comes.  It looks almost like the Filtration Helmet from The Pitt.
---
Try the flamer barrel. I've got a bloodied plasma flamer, and that thing is *dirty*. Especially amazing for crowd control.
---
reason: we love fallout universe and we upset "how they butchered my boy"
---
It goes “New arrivals” to “Overseer, Overseen” to “Trade Secrets”(Settlers) and “Cheating Death”(Raiders) which leads to “Invisible Ties” and you keep going from there
---
Automatic though?
---
This game was released in an awful state and has been a comedy of errors and has some absolutely brutal microtransaction pricing. I just started playing and it's in a pretty good state, but that's only due to the huge criticism and backlash.

SS with Radshield/Glowing Blood packs is serviceable even in nuke zones.  PA is better against rads, but SS is fine.
---
Sorry, I should of said I won’t be on for 24hrs, but I’m happy to team up whenever we both can
---
Wow, that’s good. I had built there once, out on the end of the arch with a staircase up on the mountainside, but that scorchbeast got tiring after about 5 fast travels back to my base, it spawned every time.
---
If things don't change, I see no reason why anyone should come back. I'm playing XCOM 2 as a palate cleanser right now and having a great time, then I'll see. Shame, but enough is enough.

Was gunna say yes then say the sub now I’m not sure

Oh okay. Sure

I met him again today, too! I should have worn my cultist gear as well! That was a nice touch.
---
These are so awesome!! I loved looking through these and hope I can make that trip someday. Thank you for sharing!!
---
Love it!
---
Like a basketball or football team where each player has a strength and role to play, you wish more role players were out there. Might be shooting off my mouth, but are too many just building bloody or max damage and giving no Fs about playing defense?
---
I have 1 at 350, two more over 250 each, and one at about 190.  The 5th is a lvl 2 mule.
---
I'm the opposite, I love the Ecryptid event when it pops up. Try running in a full set of Troubleshooter's armor and it's a whole different experience. If the explosions are getting at you try a few points in Fireproof, or put the Dense mod on your Chest piece. Also, the armor doesn't have to be an uber set, just normal Troubleshooter's. I run a couple different Berserker's toons that use Level 1 light leather Troubleshooter's armor for that event and they both mop up during that event. Same armor also works great for running the Silos and for the AWOL event.
---
I feel this every time...
---
I've heard the Super Mutants talking to them, I believe they are there pets, that is what i have read anyway.
---
It's a multiplayer game. There's different polarities of players.
---
Yeah, I think Commando *and* Rifleman perks work with it, but don't quote me on that.
---
Are they not good perks or do you need the perk details?
---
I don't understand the "bullet sponge" argument. Aren't all world bosses in just about every MMO a bullet (magic) sponge? Were these people expecting to one-shot them?
---
Kill a flatwoods monster + camera glitch through it's armour = alien.
---
Huh. TIL I'm sitting on a gold mine
---
Yes! This drove me nuts. When I went from Sutton to Morgantown, I was sad because I thought my hometown was left out... But then I went further north and found Clarksburg... Very pleased, but very confused.
---
Same situation for me. I bought a uny sneak luck urban scout chest for 300 out of a some dudes machine, but he was selling 5mm ammo for 15 a piece.
---
I have a good laugh when i see vendors with 350 50. Cal ammo for example, costing 350 xD i know, good thinking, sell bulk with one price, shame it doesnt work that way, and the guy has no clue he is trying to sell 1 bullet for 350 caps. Im past the point, where i would even bother to correct him, so i just carry on, wondering when he figures out why in all hecks no one is buying his cheap ammo... probably when he runs out of stash space.
---
I wonder if anyone has actually solved the codes rather than just looking them up?
---
Where is this room I have seen it done but haven't figured it out, unfortunately 4/5 times I'm usually there alone, can get level 2 creature in venison room and survive till 3rd round
---
Also from KY. I would recommend doing it in the fall, ideally October. Take 64 east into WV and the very first exit is where the pumpkin house is (Kenovo) and boy is it cool with all the pumpkins set up. Then just head east on 64, Point Pleasant is along the way (a bit off the highway north but there’s an exit for it). Then you’ll hit Charleston and it’s a pretty neat place, the Capitol and river are great. From there kind of decide which way you want to go, north or east, and head on out. I’ve only been to a few spots OP hit, but a lot of it is actually pretty convenient to get to.
---
misses need to tie with sliver shroud like in silver shroud radio..
---
That is a beautiful camp.  Totally gonna steal some of your ideas.
---
I just saw a video that can correct the way those dark poles line up on the bases of your garden area - if interested, it's at the 2:45 mark on the video here:

"It just works"
---
It’s always a signal to look closely!  Co grays on the score!
---
When this happened to me, I went on a mission to learn every plan in the game.  I now know them all.  Now I go buy out some low level's vending machines and drop the items there in a bag.  Giving back to the community lol.
---
They were probably asking about crafting legendaries being a thing in general
---
This is, at its core, a very stupid, very disingenuous argument, and it has been every time it has ever been used (which is a lot, coming from someone who has played MMOs for years).
---
You are well within your rights to "play how you want to" and more often than not, people have no problem with you doing such.
---
If you want to run around naked role-playing an alien abduction victim, by all means, go ahead! Good for you!
---
The problem is when you bring that attitude into "group content".
---
People like to say the people who get upset about this are assholes or are trying to force people to play how they want them to play.
---
When the reality of the situation is the opposite. The person running into the imposter completely naked to not break character is the REAL asshole in the situation. They are actively wasting the time, resources, and efforts of the rest of the people who are there actually trying to complete the event.
---
Why do we get called out for "not respecting other peoples playstyles" when these people are actively showing that they have no respect for the rest of the group of people who's time they are wasting by being dead weight at an event designed to be completed by a group of people.
---
I just recently made a sweet full auto plas rifle it's okay but takes half a mag per bad guy
---
My theory was that if I could find an isolated chunk of land, surrounded by rock, enemies would have problems spawning.
---
And I found a place just like that.  There's pretty much no way for them to reach me.
---
They did try to get me from down below, firing up, but once I moved my Fusion Generator out of that line-of-sight, they never came back.
---
Got it. Thanks!
---
Now I wanna go to West Virginia
---
The way I look at it is  you want to sell everything you can the vendor bots to reach your daily caps limit first and foremost, selling the less desirable items to the bots first, and then sell the more desirable items you have left for good prices in your vendors to make extra. If you're not selling stuff keep lowering the prices. You know you've lowered the prices to the ideal numbers when you are selling faster than you can restock. Then you want to raise them a bit to keep your vendor stocked so it doesn't run empty because that will kill sales just as bad as prices that are too high will.  Crowding your vendors with common crap that nobody wants will also cause people to leave before looking at all your machines. Don't try to sell stuff that's super common, like chemistry bench and metal bed plans. Some people see that and will decide your other machines aren't worth even looking through.
---
It just reeks of laziness like they couldn't be bothered.
---
There is a campsite to the lower left of site Charlie that sits below a monorail car. In the fire pit there are a bunch of Mr. Fuzzies.
---
It's a tactical yield maybe 10 kilos.
---
I normally just vendor it for caps.
---
throw it away
---
Yeah, I fear Assaultrons, and Sentry bots probally more than any other enemy just due to how much damage they can dish out and how much damage they can take before going down if you lack a OP build, which below 50? you probably do. Getting the excavator armor plans at level 25 is a fun thing, because that lv 40+ leader-class assaultron? yeah shes always there. I sneak and get the plans and make it praying the assaultron doesn't notice me lol. After I get in the suit I usually then go kill that assaultron but even in the PA shes still a damn good fight at level 25 due to just lack of damage you have.
---
Player or AI vendor?
---
AI vendor.
---
Crap that took me like a month to gather
---
They are all through the settlers, I can’t remember the exact order but you get like 4 quest from the settlers and raiders as soon as you hear about the vault. Finish both quest lines up to the point where you get the quests siding with crater or siding with foundation. The Chinese stealth armor is the last quest before siding the foundation. For me I did all the foundation quests until I got the stealth armor and then sided with crater
---
It's fallout. A world full of hostile, unpredictable &amp; rude people. Psycho experiments. Traitorous behaviors. 
---
Dude you ignored basic mechanics, then on top of it went AFK, and it's somehow the communities fault. Is personal accountability dead? 
---
Sure that guy definitely went too far with the notes &amp; messages, no denying that. But to cast a shadow on the entire community cause of it, say they should play a different game, and have this weird entitled tone the entire discussion? Seems dilusional to me.
---
My tent is at crater, my base near whitesprings station.  Mainly for convenience and fast travel savings.  I can FT to the vault, the north and the whitsprings area for free.  Then I FT once to somewhere around watoga and the RR megastop to claim workshops and I have most of the map open to cheap travel.
---
Pure or stable ? pure is in the aid tab I believe and stable ends up in junk tab so you couldn't have dropped the pure ?
---
I never found fusion cores a problem myself, take over a power plant, you get 3 every 20 minutes, 1 core can usually last an hour or so of fighting, and a few hours if your not doing much fighting and have lower ap use. When I start a new char I usually take over posidon for a day and end up with 50+ fully charged cores, which, with finding new ones in the world, goes down very slowly.
---
I lived in that same area, not far from West-Tek, for months.  I would watch the bombs drop from my deck.
---
But at some point, I started coming home to Scorchbeasts.  When I came across that triple Scorchbeast encounter spawn one time, I knew I had been evicted by Bethesda. 😒
---
But to start it you have to do the overseer missions until she tells you about the vault, then she’ll say she want you to talk to the raiders and settlers. That will trigger their missions
---
It's a daily mission. Once you do it, you have to wait another 20 hours before you can do it again. Unfortunately you have to find a brand new Technical Data to start the daily again.
---
There are a few MMOs that had their version of Collectrons that looted corpses that your character personally killed for you.  It would be extremely useful in Fallout 76 to loot corpses especially during Events when you can't find a particular corpse or searching through a bunch of corpses that you haven't killed.
---
OP spells the event wrong but least the comments get it right.
---
Hit up the white spring bunker, always fresh ones in the desks there plus a handful of fans and phones.
---
It was stable....
---
I have limited flux right now. I’m thinking of priming some gear.
---
It's the same people who spam L on streams when an indie game is announced. Sheep. I don't like what gamer culture has become.
---
Both honestly lol
---
Hit up the Whitespring Bunker. The room with all the desks and terminals you do the test at will usually have between 1-4 pieces of tech data per server hop. Only take the tech data and leave any other junk item because it can then roll as tech data next time you load in. Each time you pick up one you need to go and deposit it. Its a grindy process unfrotunately but it is what it is
---
Honestly surprised they went with this name for these guys, what with the push lately in the industry to tip toe around offending anyone.
---
Camden park has many laying around and there is a Jangles in a car in the parking lot.  Others have mentioned good places to find specific ones.
---
Can you have more than one on you to turn in a day or should I not even bother picking up another one in 24 hours?
---
Its actually pathethic how damn hard it is to actually get that part of the quest done. I've tried asking people if they'd get downed for me so I can revive them for the quest, even offered them stuff, I even said they can go back to their camp first grouped with me, and they can deposit all their junk first. I've never got that quest done on 3 or 4 chars i've made. It would be easier if the game had text chat, because voice coms in fo76 are wonky at best, half the time people can't hear me.
---
Anytime I'm online hit me up. Ive been off and on playing since launch and will happily assist. Dont have my own Mic but I'll enable it so I can hear you. Message me for my ps4 ID.
---
It's not really an argument: it's an attitude. If it's so frightening to you that you can carry more weight than your own that you see disingenuity ij my words that's more a reflection of your attitudes than the situation at hand. Sorry that you need other players to fit your understanding of how to behave in order to succeed but I do not: I rollplay as a Responder, and I don't get upset when other players need help during events
---
I'd love for them to just do away with the reputation system. It was rather an unnecessary addition to an already existing and functional XP system. Implementing another system, like RP, is just another way to force yet more grinding. I get it. 
---
Bethesda assumes that more grinding means more time spent in the game which means more time spent shopping in the Atomic Shop buying... the place where they make their money. I'm not saying that it's entirely wrong thinking, but it's wrong for the reason that it's takes entirely too long. Expecting people to come every single day to repeat the same challenge day-after-day is, well, janky game design. Only the most die-hard fans will endure that grind to obtain the reward at the end.
---
Unfortunately, this system alienates the majority of their player base, the casual gamer. This is aso the demographic with money to spend in the Atomic Shop. Alienating any of their existing player base is yet another black eye on this already floundering game.
---
Bethesda will do away with the RP system, but this system could be drastically improved to bring back the casual gamers and get them excited about questing for RP. This, in turn, will get them spending in the Atomic Shop while they are there. Bethesda needs to seriously rethink and redesign the RP system.
---
One per day, don’t bother grabbing more. The instant you pick one up the sensitive materials quest pops up and anything else is a waste.
---
Professional drinker is best for completing the daily challenges of drinking alcohol, it helps you save on addictol, but I never have it active on a regular basis. Party boy does come in handy if you are a junkies build and alcohol is one of them. 
---
In general, if it helps your build yeah, but more often than not, they’re not super useful.
---
There a good spot to check armor values like there is for weapons
---
Put all but one of them in your stash, turn the one you saved in for 'forbidden knowledge'.
---
turn just one in each day get a rep reward 
---
It does not affect your reward if you turn in 5 .10, 20, or just 1. In fact your reward is about as random as it gets.
---
You should charge people to watch! 10 caps! 😂😂😂
---
Usually I'll price them according to how much power they've got, but if I just want rid of them bc I have a bunch, I'll throw them in for like 50caps for a fully charged one
---
Are you on right now?
---
I just finished the BoS quest yesterday (25ish hours ago) and turned one in and I went to turn it in again today thinking it would have activated without telling me..I’m a dumbass
---
Well said, I’ve had such good experiences with this game community.  Even made some actual friends.  I will continue to defend this friendly and fun community.
