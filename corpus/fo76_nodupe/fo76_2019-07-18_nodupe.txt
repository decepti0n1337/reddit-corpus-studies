If i grinded for weeks for enough Gold Bullion to buy an M1 Garand (Battle rifle in fallout universe) I would say its 100% worth it to hear the *PING* alone.
---
---
---
Go to Top of the World and collect all the ski poles, each one gives 2 aluminum. Rinse and repeat.
---
omg. i consider myself a newbie (4 month playing) and i am hiting lvl 280 or so thanks to covid19 and being in the first group of risk. noob doesnt mean newbie and newbie doesnt mean noob. there is nothing to be ashemed of  if u r a newbie.
---
Did you cancel fallout 1st?
---
?
---
I grinded the holiday event and had over 20 mount plans each with exception to the rare ones. Even then I ended up with a bunch of rares after someone dumped them in the blue suitcase at white spring station. I am not a duper.
---
Long ago our lives were in harmony between the great nations of work, social life and sleep, But everything changed when the depression struck. In a single day it ravaged our work, destroyed our social life and deprived our sleep.  In our hour of need when we needed him most, the energy drinks were nowhere to be found
---
[removed]
---
Join a team, sleep in a bed (well rested) use inspirational perk, open lunchboxes etc. Then grind events and kills and watch the XP pour in
---
That's how I roll on my medic main. EXP for everyone!

---
follow this for max damage. I run it with a bloodied explosive handmade, untill I find a bloodied fixer, and can bring the queen down in 3 minutes. with adrenaline does 2100 damage per shot on LVL 68 super mutants.
---
&gt;Yeah there is its called chameleon mutation
---
What mutation increases attack speed?

Alright thank you
---
If i EVER get to hear that PING In fallout 76, i would have to change my pants. (queue the cream)
---
Beautiful! Love love love
---
Yeah I think I‚Äôll try see how I go and maybe pay the difference. I was going to see if I could just buy outright so I could skip the grind but once I saw how much it was gonna to cost me I was like uhm yeah better not haha 
---
Wish me luck ‚úåüèª
---
I've found the raiders and casual in the H.F. multi-spawn location.  
---
In case you're not familiar with it.  Fast travel to Harper's Ferry.  Upon loading in go to the building next to the gate (next to the train).  There's a hole in the wall.  The plans spawn in the display cases.  The first display case is in the second room, against the wall to your left.  The second, is against the back wall straight ahead if you turn left upon entering the second room.  Now, to the room on the left of that is a small room with a door leading outside.  The display cases normally have vases. BUT, rarely, one of them might have a plan inside. Now, head out the back door and turn right.  Go to the boxcar that makes a ramp to the second floor of the building you just exited.  Once one the second floor, you'll see a small/tall square display case.  Walk around that one to the left and look the the case against the wall.  That one has a chance for the marine wetsuit, along with the next one.  Now, double back to the stairs and go to the third floor.  As you top the stairs, you'll see a display case to your immediate right.  Nothing there.  But, the one across from it always has a recipe.  From there, turn right and walk halfway up the makeshift ramp.  The display case that is directly under the ramp has a good probability to have the wetsuit or marine armor.  The last one, is in the back of this room, against the wall.  That's the one that I found the casual and raider under armors, as well as a couple if the casual/civilian outfits (the slacks and T-shirt and the green dress).
---
Here's the trick. If any of those cases don't have a plan in them, you'll have to wait 22 hours for them to respawn.  If they DO have plans in them, but they aren't the ones you're looking for, DON'T PICK THEM UP!  Move on to the next case. And then sever hop to try again.
---
Hope this helps.
---
The scout armor chest piece also seems to have 2 'no skin' "skins" which can be exchanged against each other for free and count too
---
As a fellow heavy, I wouldnt recommend the gauss mini, unless you are prepared to deal with the following problems;
---
It eats ammo like mad. You're probably used to this, with other heavy weapons, except....
---
Crafting 2mm sucks. Unlike 5mm/.50 the game thinks 2mm is a rifle ammo, so its crafted in really small amounts. You will need far more lead/steel than other weapons to keep it fed.
---
2mm is a "rare" ammo. Dont expect to find it laying around much, and on the off chance you find it, it will be 3-5 bullets.
---
Don't think you can get around this with the ammo machine - it doesn't make 2mm.
---
You can use the converter. Its 240x 10mm to make 15 x 2mm. Until they sort the converter, this is very long winded.
---
You can craft more prime ammo, which saves slightly on the constant need for lead/steel, but instead means you constantly need stable flux instead. This thing is thirstier than a .308 LMG
---
Suprise! You cant actually craft prime ammo simply by priming the gun. If you want to craft prime ammo, you need to know the plan for primed gauss rifle.
---
And lastly, just to kick you a little bit more:
---
2mm is energy ammo. So bandolier doesnt affect it, you'll need batteries included if you want to keep the weight down.
---
Good to know. Thanks. Do you think grim reaper's sprint is necessary, or a waste of 3 perk slots? My special is S-3 P-15 E-2 C-4 I-5 A-15 L-12.
---
I am thinking of moving dropping perception from 15 to 12, and bumping luck from 12 to 15. Or do you think I should drop agility to 12 and leave perception at 15.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm going to see how I go and perhaps pay the difference. If I‚Äôm going to buy at the end the more I can reduce the price the better. Thank youu
---
noooooooo. try next time demolition expert perk card to see the difference. if u think it doesnt  work hit the groud beneath ur legs without wearing armor. If u die it does work.
---
Stash management is also about managing your characters inventory as well.  Weight reduction perks for food/drink, chems and ammo that let you reduce everything by 90% means those things should never have to touch your stash.  
---
From  there on out you just have to be smart about what you do put in there.
---
Don't hoard legendary gear unless it's really good and can be traded or you plan on using it, if you've capped your scrip for the day leave crap behind since you can just find more to turn in tomorrow instead of filling up your stash with it.
---
Don't hoard scrap unless it's rare/annoying to find or you're actually going to use it.  The vast majority of scrap can be quickly farmed up in mass quantities just researching where to go and what  to pick up/kill and a lot of it is incredibly situational and only useful if you're mass crafting gear to scrap for mods.

Here you go
---
Yes indeed! I was also instantly thinking of starting a low-key business with it lol!
---
I think most people would have to.
---
How are people getting 3.75X sneak damage? I use Covert Operative 3 and only get 2.5X
---
All the surgical trays in Fort Defiance.
---
Send in a help ticket with bethesda. AND STOP MESSING AROUND WITH DUPES.
---
The legendary run and the different color icons, public team things. Maybe it's been two weeks, the days seem to melt together
---
I'm on Xbox:(
---
Dude your profile is all about 76. You still playing it. Stop acting all high and mighty about not supporting Bethesda. At the end of the day if you're playing you're supporting them.
---
Use atoms at the end if you are going to at all.
---
Are you shootin some b-ball outside of school?
---
No sadly
---
Man, I had taken some really good shots in photo mode. I was going to post them when I had time, I was so proud of them!
---
At some point really recently, all of my pictures disappeared. I don't know if Bethesda, or xbox deleted them, but I'm big sad... and now super jealous of you! Thank you for sharing, though!
---
take her on a date
---
newbie doesnt refer to ur lvl. it is more about time invested in the game I guess. u can start another caracter and u wont be a newbie bcz u know how it works.
---
Oh god i didn't think of that.
---
You know it's going to be a shitty grind for a few weeks, resulting in the ability to buy stuff with gold (or insert yet another currency here).
---
Does inspirationnal perk stacks with each other when shared?
---
Misc. structures tab
---
And that‚Äôs totally fair. I Donely I started playing the game like two months ago to chance to get sick of it I‚Äôm sure in some point I will and then I‚Äôll stop until the next major update
---
"*Pre-War Tech Tokens*"
---
Because apparently Rule 10 wants to hide all suggestions where people won't bother to look for or talk about it. Including Bethesda seeing important community suggestions.
---
Yeah, I put 5/5 but it still is hard to hear. Well that's a rip for atmosphere.
---
Mr Sandman I think it's called, boost your damage at night
---
Few bags at the watago BOS vendor.
---
Has this been changed? I'm pretty sure that I used to be able to change random player's collectron settings. That's why I lock the terminal on mine.
---
When a couple of guys, that were up to no good, started makin trouble in the neighborhood?
---
If there's another fucking grind I'm quitting this damn game.

Trippy, I use three and works fine for my camp
---
And? I payed 8e btw.
---
Yeah, it's so annoying. I don't know why this would be a feature. I'm lucky it was just that quest and not like an important story building quest/series of quests
---
If you unfortunately get permanently banned, make sure to get a refund on your atomic shop items you purchased, from Bethesda. Also I want to say I hope you get your account back, regardless if you‚Äôre innocent or not.
---
Mister Sandman
---
Just to be safe, don‚Äôt answer the door bell.
---
I know it makes no sense but mod with braced one piece of armor (or find one that already has it, it's "Reduce additional melee damage while blocking") and you will "fix" the second shotgun.
---
I've been lurking the FO76 subreddit because I would like to know if the game ever gets better. Havent bought it and dont plan to until this subreddit stops looking like a wow private server Discord support channel.
---
I don't mind grinds in MMOs and some other games but the Reputation and Gold grind in 76 is brutal.
---
all good, just a suggestion as per the flair
---
Do you have any mods running? Any third party mods for cards, inventory sorting, hi-res textures, etc? Because those are also banworthy.
---
I see nothing that specifically confirms they called you a duper, just that you got banned.
---
Just wondering, is all.
---
Yup.
---
But I‚Äôm having a lot of fun.
---
Thanks. I was a stealth sniper when I first started my main, but didn't understand the mechanics well enough, so I switched to heavy guns. Now I need to familiarize myself with the advanced mechanics of being a Rifleman.
---
In my eyes it's supposed to be ambient and nostalgic when you walk past a radio in the fallout universe. If you just want to hear the music, there are plenty of fallout themed Playlists on Spotify and YouTube.
---
Alternatively, you could place radios in each corner of your structure but you have to turn them all on every time you log in. You could use the jukebox, which is automatically on when you login, however it only plays classical.
---
Shhhh!!‚Äô
---
that‚Äôs the important part
---
If I am buying something, I expect it to work correctly when I receive it. It is not entitlement to expect that from something you pay for, particularly as this is a premium purchase in the game.
---
We can be mindful of the limitations of the dev team, while also critical of a broken premium feature :)
---
I used the lot I had saved just to get to chapter 3, with double xp I‚Äôm gonna be way past his brainy ass for days
---
Trying to read and discover all the lore is a pain in the ass because you are always on the clock in there.  Having it be available in adventure mode would help with that.
---
What exactly are you suggesting? Your title is a statement, not a suggestion.
---
It‚Äôs spend money on this or on hookers and blow and blackjack
---
I have seen this being talked about many times. I'm a father of two and had a full time job prior to COVID. Obviously I have time now to play and I'm way ahead of the curve for the board game. However I'm realizing as I play that an hour a night of play is all you need to do the dailies/weeklies and do some XP grinding. Although it is a bit of a grind, smart playing means you can max your XP take as you play. Busy people have to make the best of your time.
---
Challenges like this do more than just get me the free skins and the likes. It helps push me to learn more about the game and stretch my knowledge. I hadn't known that INT boosts XP. Since the board game started I went from lvl 360 to 438. Also learned more about serum and chem buffs.
---
The argument that Beth puts this stuff behind a time lock; I get the argument but I never see a post offering an alternative to the time lock that benefits the player base *and* keeps the company financially viable. These online MMO style games rely on time in game to make money. You're more likely to spend money if you spend time in the game. You don't have these issues with offline games as the development model is to make a game that sells one off with minor patches here and there. We can debate how well 76 is managed all day (isn't much a debate) but it's just a different game and a different world.
---
They do. Which is why Green Thumb is useful.
---
what does that have to do with either your post or this comment thread?
---
Off topic but if we're talking about Fort Defiance you can get a nice load of plastic by collecting all the plates and silverware on the 4th floor, too.
---
You only get notes if you've beat the wastelanders dlc, and notes are only acquired through the WL dailies, public events and I believe riding shotgun event.
---
Building teams are mostly a group solos so yeah, they wouldn't be playing as a team.
---
&gt;And if your public 'teammates' aren't playing as a team then they weren't your teammates to begin with, so screw 'em. 
---
And there is the selfish dickishness that I was referring to. Thanks for proving my point.
---
It would also be nice if we could enter the vault in adventure mode so we will actually have time to explore it.
---
I know that but my point is events are non existent right now
---
Yeah, we know.
---
I just use a building team, then right before an event ends I switch to get the 100 percent even bonus then switch back, and just keep doing that for each event.
---
I've had excavator on since lvl 25. When I got out now I use ultracite for rad resit in the nuke zone and just thwo shit in the stash. But when I get in my ultracitw. My carry weight is the same lol
---
The cosmic wallpapers are amazing.
---
Buff calibrated shocks, or add it as an option for the arms too!
---
Maybe the server is toast, hop servers.
---
I hope to see this topic 500 more times. just in case someone doesnt know..
---
Are you suggesting.... this game sucks? 
---
Oh yeah, we know.
---
I‚Äôm on console. XB1.
---
Didje get banned mate?
---
And the cue balls!!
---
The flechette mod turns the harpoon into a kind of shot gun. You'll fire multiple harpoons for the cost of 1 ammo and each of those harpoons have a chance of being recoverable.
---
This is sic. Nice build.
---
We're only 2 weeks in out of 10. How doable it is depends a lot on how you make the most of the double xp &amp; score weekends
---
Then they should have been, could be changed to fit the foundation sizes. Having no floor/foundation and snapping on to existing foundations would work. Or have them ignore foundations when placing so you can make your flat foundation, then clip the stand alone building through the foundation to make the seamless connection we want. There are a ton of potential ways to fix this issue.
---
When I do Distant Thunder on my rifleman, I use my own artillery to take out the targets.  My camp is in range of all the Distant Thunder event locations. My heavygunner just wades in and mows em all down.
---
i made the mistake of spending bandwidth downloading this with my Xbox game pass and within an hour or so realised my gameplay experience is more reflective of a mobile freemium game than fallout despite the game recycling like most of the assets from older games like some sort of dead spooky ghost wearing human skin
---
I'd say using the Excavator Armor in the lower sections of the Big Bend tunnel, where there are a decent number of Aluminium ore veins. It'll cost you a fair amount of Acid to smelt it, but its a decent option.
---
Good luck with that. Getting a refund on PSN is exceptional.
---
I assumed none of the same perks stacked if shared so I would guess no but not 100% sure.
---
I dunno, does it? seem like either a lot of effort get to having fun or a bunch of microtransactions
---
Ah I replied to the wrong comments my apology
---
I have vegan mutation :( now my perk is useless
---
Thanks.
---
I only have the raider one so far.
---
Basically I just selected it from the atom shop,then made a new camp. You need a brand new camp to activate the skin,cannot just move the device. It's a pain in the ass for those of us with 1000+ hours decorated and refined camps.
---
A bunch at the power plant near Charleston station
---
A couple times I hopped around to my teammates dropping cranberry relish for them. I felt like a fucking exp fairy granding exp boosts for all.
---
Eh, it's just a number of songs that are quite quiet
---
That what it looks like the walls are made of and it looks great
---
Do emergency power armour build! Nothing scares me anymore, except for assualtrons
---
Sadly I run power armor most of the time.
---
got in one little fight and Grahm got scared, he said
---
"PUNY HUMAN FRIEND GO TO APPLE ASIA."
---
That is good. The backpacks helps a lot, you can add mods later to improve it.
---
I agree the movie is great, but i picked that username because of New Vegas.
---
I contacted support to confirm if my game pass (I even emphasized that it's pc) character can transfer to steam since they're both on pc. I got 2 responses from 2 different reps saying no it won't transfer from game pass to steam regardless if it's both pc. Their excuse is that they "don't have the tools" to do so. Which is contradicting because they were able to from bethesda launcher to steam. I thought this wasn't right at all so I asked a friend and he was able to help connect / transfer my account. I can't believe Bethesda themselves can't help me out on this and are giving out false information.
---
Did you buy all the ranks? I read in a post that the last 10 you can purchase with atoms. But I noticed today that you can buy them, I guess at any level. I‚Äôm at 38 and it had an option to ‚Äúrank up‚Äù for 150 atoms.
---
you must've left like the day before Update 20 hit. we've had all this for like two and a half weeks now
---
Just realized I put bear instead of beat
---
The title is meant to say "Is it possible to beat Zorbo?"
---
Yeah I've been trying to take a photo of an assaultron firing its laser at me. So far I've been unsuccessful.
---
Yes, some people already finished the run
---
It was about a week or two after beta and I was helping a friend build his camp. Some dude was trying to fight my friend, my buddy pulled out a nuka launcher and shot him he got downed, I executed the dude with a 44. We left his junk for him to pick up and sent him on his way. I thought that was pretty funny
---
This is before fallout 4 when they aren't well I guess racist?
---
Is it worth it without the prime receiver?  I just don‚Äôt farm flux enough. I can barely find high radiation fluids.
---
You gain the ability to brag about having over 100 of them.
---
There's a storeroom in Bogtown, just outside the main strip, with lots of canned goods, Sugar Bombs, and cooking oil.  Just eat everything in sight and you should be good.
---
some people who start a fight just arent willing to accept it was a bad idea and play the helpless victim.
---
Maybe the BOS doesn't know the enclave is evil yet
---
Ye, that's probably what happened. Super cool though
---
I am a head of the Z man. Like 6 or 7 more stops in the orange part. XP grind.
---
That is gorgeous! Thanks for sharing!
---
Then why do the fallout first paints exist?
---
What, how? Did they just grind the repeatable xp thing?
---
I guess lol, if they ever release new cards, I could auto unlock them.
---
Edit: There should be an option to turn them in for exp because this mode sucks, or an exchange program to get the rewards from later levels so people who dont want to play can buy them with tickets. Idk give me something.
---
Yeah very true, I'll figure it out
---
I could maybe help you weapon wise depending on what build you‚Äôre going for ! And some armor !
---
You need to go into the atomic shop and click on whatever apparel item you wish to use. This works for weapon skins as well.
---
So, do you stop travelers and charge them a fee for crossing the bridge?
---
It is really nice and cozy though. Great job!
---
Huh. Well, that probably could be good for certain events, then. I wonder if that gives more exp for killing the queen than 4x the event bonus...
---
pfft, agree with youu? i've BEEN you.
---
some level 13 or so punk kept ahooting at me at the Rusty Pick. eventually got sick of it, turned off pacifist mode, and beat him to death.
---
i dont partake in pvp usually, but some people need to learn.
---
Yeah legendaries used to rain from the skys but you also may have got a non legendary drill or some other useless crap and even from the 3*'s. WS is still an effective xp farm and logging out of the game entirely(Closing program) and relaunching still works for respawns as the wife and I do it a few times a week and for major events. Every once in awhile it will glitch for a few and whatever party member has not been logging out and closing the game may have to do it to get them to spawn but this does work 95% or better of the time.(We actually plan to do it tonight and Sun. for 2xp)
---
I‚Äôm having this problem too, when I complete a challenge it adds to different amount, and my total when I‚Äôm in the store is staying the same
---
You can. I name mine all the time.
---
You got that right
---
I see. Thank you for your time
---
Short answer: Yes, due to stabilized
---
Long answer: Yes, but 9/10 out of ten I‚Äôm one shorting everything outside of power armor anyways and the benefits of running around without power armor are +15 of every special with unyielding and a vastly higher carry weight due to backpacks/3* armor and their perks. I spend 95% of time outside my PA and when I hop in (exclusively queen fights or encrypted) I become super overweight albeit a tankier
---
There is an option for this, need to select item and change option becomes available. Similar to rename weapon and armour.
---
But the damage drop, less AP refresh with no lone wanderer tho
---
Personally I want them to make it so each vault has a storyline almost like chapters but vaults if that makes any sense
---
The not reaching it thing is potentially inaccurate now that they've been increasing the amount of daily challenges and the high score weekend coming up, however yeah if they're behind then they're gonna need to put more effort into grinding the 100 score XP challenge. Also for the buying levels from 90-100 I've not claimed any of the atom point prizes just in case so that I'm not tempted to spend them prematurely and can keep them to the side for if I need those 10 levels.
---
i take it you havent bothered going back inside Fort Defiance since Wastelanders came out
---
The settler wanderer's guitar is pretty loud and she's always playing it.
---
If you're on PS4 hit R3 then touchpad when on the chassis in you're inventory
---
Weapons dont go above level 50 
---
What you saying chief??
---
The build team bonus plus the double XP is awesome. I leveled up twice in less than 45 minutes.
---
No. Had like 30 already. I have had over 10k since playing from launch and never using em.  
---
Also ya you get at least 10 free rank ups from the pass.
---
You can literally buy all 100 if ya wanted
---
these are exaclty my addictions.
---
solves a lot of problems: I can use alcohol instead of water: lighter, cheaper, no rads and very commom, also helps with those challenges involving alcohol.
---
mentats family helps because if needed you can pop orange, berry or grape mentats to boost PER or CHA or INT for any challenges or speech.
---
psycho has that one that increases your damage by 25% and your damage resistance by 15% so in though fights you have a nice drug to help.
---
I have a ‚Äòno maintenance build‚Äô and the junkies path was the best decision ever.
---
Yes I love being that guy thankyou for this post it makes me feel warm and fuzzy. I greatly appreciate all the anger.
---
my character is level 51
---
if it's fallout related, try /r/fo76filthycasuals
---
It says a lot that when they add a new floor pattern to the shop they can't be bothered to add the same pattern for the 1/4 and 1/2 pieces. Like really, would that have taken that much development time?
---
Sure it matters they could do the obvious thing and give us blocks for walls and flooring/foundations.(Like Minecraft pixels basically.) And we could build to our needs one block at a time like any good custom builder.
---
That would be good. Like one of the vaults from the other games, you go in there, and find something crazy, like Gaaaaaarrreeeee, Gary!
---
I'm not ps4 but ok
---
I shouldn't have to inspect it tho
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure Gorge Junkyard and the Ammunition workshops have concrete deposits.
---
The only real reason for power armor? Nuke zone. It also depends on your build and what you run. With the right mods/perks, power armor is doable. Emergency protocols, nerd rage, stabilized etc
---
All the TV Dinner Trays in Watoga HS will give you 36 aluminium.
---
Why would they remove that feature?? Salty players crying to Bethesda as usual? Or did it just get broken with a patch and never fixed?
---
You can purchase right now btw.
---
It‚Äôs possible? They were all in the same spawn locations were I‚Äôd normally have seen scorched. Maybe I ended up following someone who was running that quest or something. When I ran the glassed caverns again today (needed to kill scorched for the daily) I didn‚Äôt see any eye bots at all. Weird.
---
Yea its annoying but once you do it a lot of time is saved and its no longer a guessing game
---
I‚Äôll take a look. Thanks!
---
Ah. So if I was say doing mostly anything but heavy PA isn‚Äôt the way to go? I ask because I‚Äôm saving up cores so I can ‚Äúlive‚Äù in my PA. I do have Stabilized and an AA .50 cal (1* level 35(or 30)) and it shreds level 68 super mutants.
---
This indeed. View is pretty but you‚Äôre looking at out of bounds scenery.
---
Same on PS4... and Atomic Shop not available... ugh.
---
Actually, they were already dicks all along!
---
Never had them from a machine . But one spawn on roof of West Tek. It's am assured 500 caps in vendor
---
Me too, with my pink donut sprinkle paint and my vault girl helmet
---
I‚Äôve played since the beginning, here is a half smart ass, completely honest answer...  I don‚Äôt appreciate ‚Äúmedics.‚Äù  Very few do.  It‚Äôs a very role-playing style that ultimately hinders the team.  If you have a dedicated group you play with frequently, this play style would become slightly more viable.  In that case, know their play styles, are they bloodied?  Then take plenty of toxic goo, full health, then stimpaks.  If you were on my team, I‚Äôd replace 80% of whatever aid you have, and put a higher dps weapon in your inventory, that‚Äôs what is valuable to us.
---
Get a better build :o
---
on xbox you can rename them. i have one named uktracite and one named excavator. i believe it's inspect&gt;rename&gt;save and then it shows up in stash and inventory as your new name.
---
I have been running a heavy guns build for a couple of months, but I used to enjoy rifle builds. And PA does negate legendary armor buffs, so I generally wear Chinese stealth armor now to reduce travel weight. Right now heavy guns with PA is the most fun, most effective and most versatile build I‚Äôve used with FO76. But you gotta get a good legendary heavy gun.
---
Yeah heard of that one, im gonna put mine on a display case later!‚úåÔ∏è
---
If anything it's a benefit cause then no-one is gonna build a camp in your view
---
Nerf bloodied
---
Having those photos become your loading screen is one of the smartest things Fallout 76 did.  I stopped playing for a while and when I came back I had all these great memories to relive and talk about whenever I went to load.  I even reached out to people I hadn‚Äôt really talked to since; I would send them the screenshot and be like ‚Äúhey remember when we did this?‚Äù and strike up the conversation again.  I don‚Äôt really care much about the frames or poses, most of the time it‚Äôs just hilarious trolly things or stupid bug we couldn‚Äôt stop laughing at.
---
Inspect the power chasis, you get an option to name it through that
---
Yes. I'm personally selfish here because I would love to cultivate some ash roses (I both think they're pretty and I sell Formula P) and firecap. I can understand why not, but at the same time, we've seen these plants in planters and greenhouses, we should be able to do the same.
---
The only exception I would make for is Kaleidopore since it was exclusively cultivated by Arktos.
---
Yes, optimizing INT to get more XP in various ways.
---
Just checked and it seems active! Look at that!
---
Right now I have a 1* AA .50 cal MG and even though it‚Äôs level 35 (or 30) (mid-tier on the craft screen) and I think it shreds pretty well (at least level 68 super mutants)
---
&gt;there should be trade offs relative to their gain just like are for Junkies or Berserker
---
So like...you mean the low-health part with that, right? The entire idea of being a glass canon? Being able to be hit once or twice by a ghoul and die?
---
I think so.  Ultracite is cheaper to make for me.
---
Maybe because some items are broken when released. Like the screaming eagle skin for the handmade, messed up animation for reload and the iron sights are unusable and you need a scope or reticle. I'd refund it if I could
---
I run berserker, that buff needs to be bigger
---
Oh, things brings me back to late 2018/early 2019 for sure.
---
Bloodied builds have that nack of once you use one it's hard to change it even if you wanted to. I only recently switched to bloodied from vanguard build and I love it. Makes the game way too easy though. I know you risk dieing more but the reward is too great for the risk in this instance. It needs tweaked a little.
---
Pick up my eight one recently. All from machines. Multiple characters.
---
If you've designed an entire team focus as 'solo players only, pls no play as team.' then you might as well take full advantage of it as a selfish solo player and gain maximum exp for yourself. They weren't playing as a team to begin with -- that's selfish. And no, co-ordinated teams want to be in building the majority of the time for their own benefit. You can change focus on the fly for the right time and place, but building is best for everything inbetween. Stop pushing the 'building = solo only' narrative because youtubers said so. It doesn't benefit the community.
---
Thank you.
---
Only if they don't complement my build.  And thanks!
---
I usually sniped from stealth but wanted to try something new. So I want to ‚Äúlive‚Äù in the PA. I have Stabilized and an AA .50 cal so the AA from the weapon and perk stack.

https://screenrant.com/fallout-76-10-best-builds-ranked/
---
Try those websites to get you headed in right direction and play around with perk card builds
---
Thank you^^
---
Also if I calculated it right, it should take a month to get to max reputation if it takes 12k rep and you get ~300 per day
---
If they give us reputation quest for the BeOS I hope they have more than one or two God I would kill for a settler reputation quest that wasn‚Äôt vital equipment. I don‚Äôt even want to be more frequent I just want some variety.
---
Yeah this guy has clearly never experience being a bloody build with 2-3 charred ghouls wailing away at you at once.
---
if your build is halfway decent with nerd rage you should not be dying unless your running ridiculously low health.
---
Carry on, then, and good luck.
---
Yes, there is an option to do this.  From your inventory, select "inspect" then there should be a change name option
---
when I'm at my camp i play music on spotify through my Google home and it comes through my headphones to be picked up by the mic set to area loud and clear. i figure it's my home so if people come by they listen to what i like. sometimes it's fallout appropriate, sometimes it's kpop lol. my house, my rules.
---
Advanced power connectors can be bought off most vendors and powered gates (which has the keypad doors) can be bought of Grahm and some other vendors, im not 100% sure which though, probably just random station ones again, or maybe the whitespring or watoga shopping places.
---
Excellent, congrats! I have received 2 from the port-a-diners since the game launched. It‚Äôs always a neat little surprise.
---
Missed opportunity to use ghouls instead of guys.
---
Atleast we have the guts to help.
---
I'll just make a medical styled crafter then and sell a crap ton of disease cures and stimpaks at my camp for 1 cap a piece then
---
My instigating Lever Action with 171 base damage goes up to 1350+ damage when I sneak headshot enemies.
---
I don't like that finding legendary gear is left to chance.  That said, after years of playing there is a "chance" I may never find any top tier legendary gear.
---
I‚Äôve been doing the same thing and I just got the game, it‚Äôs one of the things I enjoy most about the game as well as building which is kinda weird I guess
---
Yea, I was too caught up in the nostalgic moment. Didn't think things through entirely.
---
Any chance you are on PS4? If so, I have an interesting free Handmade for you ü§î  
---
I'm assuming 250 DR on reload would actually be amazing for Berserkers, anyway
---
anyone know how many days left? I'm not sure where to find the info.
---
Thanks! Ikr you kinda just go like oooooooü§£
---
Wow.It's literally one button.
---
Are those applicable to armors during NW?  Every atom shop armor paint job I have unlocked from all the various holiday events have no option to assign for NW.
---
*long disappointed sigh*
---
Oh so you got cake huh
---
Went in to an amazing camp the other day and they had 4 in a display case
---
Why rework something that is not even finished?
---
You don't ask the designer to rework the car that doesn't go only because it's a design mock-up made out of clay and doesn't really have engine
---
Make sure blocker is equipt. Its like a must have for bloodied builds. Also, i know jetpack is awesome buuuuuut im kinda diggin the dense armor mod for ss chest piece, its crazy good explo resist. Now if only these legendary perks would happen so i stop getting shit on by poison.... : /
---
I still feel I might lose this battle. If support just denied my suspension even though me saying it‚Äôs false it‚Äôs really heartbreaking for me.
---
Which is the entire point. I run 80-90% rads. A bloodied doing 50/50 does the same amount of damage as a junkie. The downside to that is that they‚Äôre at 50% health while the junkie can be at 100%. The upside is their SPECIAL is gonna be a little higher, while the junkie takes very little hits to their SPECIAL. 
---
Me, on the other hand. I have to be careful. I have to know what‚Äôs around me. I can‚Äôt even risk using an explosive anything in tight quarters.
---
I want a high ROF .38 smg
---
Like a p90 but with that fallout retro style
---
how do i download mods
---
See I have the bug where I have the item already but it doesnt repeat for me are you switching servers as soon as you turn it in or do you have any idea what causes it to repeat
---
I hope they don‚Äôt add it. I‚Äôm afraid of what kind of duping it would lead it
---
I believe as of yesterday or the day before you could buy ranks.
---
If you can hold it, go for it. I just keep what i need for repairs.
---
I‚Äôm bummed screaming eagle is a skin
---
I honestly have more fun and more frustration with building my camps, than with photomode. Happy Cake Day.
---
But i wont be able to use lone wanderer.....
---
You can tank ghouls with secret service armor
---
Doesn‚Äôt have to be a new ammo. Could be the .45 auto pistol
---
9999
---
Me too bud.

https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer_rank
---
they need to bring back survival mode and remove PvP completely from adventure.
---
Enough for everyone...
---
Considering no one would be alive and that includes the host(unless you've got the mutants)  in which case the virus would probably mutate as well... so the answer is yes but maybe no... lol
---
Here you go [Overseer rank](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer_rank)  
---
Near the bottom.  
---
The Vault-Tec University stuff isn't unlocking but the rest is.
---
Do you have any idea how hard it is to get a full set of unyielding SS with how RNG works in this game?
---
I just passed him this afternoon,thanks to double xp. You're on a good track anyway just need to fill in some xp generated SCORE,and you'll easily finish it.
---
I know i am tired of griefers
---
You missed an opportunity for a pun. 
---
&gt;Who needs meditation when you've got medication.
---
Yes I do. Took me ~12k rolls.
---
Alot of people communicate through the xbox, outside the fallout comms also.  Does this make sense? Maybe Discord as well.  Not too sure, as I don't have a headset.  So there is communicating going on, maybe you just weren't invited to that specific non fallout team.
---
No idea what's causing it. Just started the day before yesterday- the same day Crater stopped giving quests. The glitches giveth, the glitches taketh away.
---
My character also takes no fall damage, even naked. Go figure.
---
Thank you!
---
Are the Christmas ones still unlocking? I keep unlocking Halloween ones but can‚Äôt tell if the Christmas ones are working.
---
Just hit 7k XP and got the skin from Halloween but not the Christmas beanie.
---
Preaching to the choir my dude. Theres a birdwatching post I. The north west part of the map with a bunch of them and I've been waiting for it to show up.
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
Xbox unfortunately. That's a very kind offer though
---
How ‚Äúrecently‚Äù have you started playing? Because the medium is unlocked at like 16 or 17, and the large crate is over 30 I believe.
---
More like god mode + 200 bobbleheads. Legit unyielding maniac grinders should be at 1/4 of the last sector.
---
I just got the snowflake metal armor so its definitely working
---
Are you sure it was the boxes and not the player icons?
---
This is why I‚Äôm starting to roll bolstering armor.
---
7 downvotes for that response? Lmao it's impossible to have an actual conversation on reddit, everyone is so sensitive and downvote anything they dont agree with. Gotta agree with everyone for those precious upvotes EPICWN
---
I think I read somewhere that it's server lag. The server still thinks you're on the ground, basically.
---
Yea I thought you got the boxes too but they are just player icons. Though you might have the small one!
---
Might have to jump into adventure and check if I can craft it.. I unlocked a background and the weapon skin, maybe I missed the beanie.
---
I had no idea on either just it‚Äôs like go and so many things attack and I‚Äôm like ahhhh
---
Scout armor parts let me change from "no paint" to another "no paint" for zero cost. Did that 5 times and bingo.
---
at least you've gotten a response i replied to my support ticket as soon as i got it and i still have yet to receive a response 3 days later
---
If they make new BoS events that award reputation, that would be amazing.
---
Sometimes the icon doesn't pop up. I had no idea I got the ghillie suit until I went to my armor workbench.
---
Well I'm a silly goose, didn't realise they were the icons! Thank you!
---
I understand the logic, the real world logic I mean.  Some days just to feel pretty I'll throw on my regular armor and a suit and keep the stealth suit set to a favorite quick key for emergencies. Like a superhero.
---
I had a video of someone‚Äôs camp that had display cases full of them like a store on two levels
---
So we get to find out... Why?
---
one day last weekend, on the same server, i had him give me two quests and then i got one from both rocksy and wren. i still have no idea what happened.
---
Damn I wish I had that amount of flux. I need 4 fluorescent to mod the SS underarmor and have made 2 so far because I can never get high radiation fluids to drop. Then again I only go farm when somebody nukes fissure prime.
---
Id say explosive&gt;anything if you are killing trash mobs, its free damage for same amount of ammo.
---
FFR(if its an automatic gun) is king for bosses.
---
Right now I get over encumbered everytime i step into my ultracite PA. For that reason alone I barely use it.
---
As a Bloodied Unyielding user, I honestly gotta agree. The skill checks and INT bonuses are very unfair. I generally only gain 1 extra cap or so from equipping Hard Bargain now, and even though I have a base INT of 3 anything I craft and find has over 100% durability, as well as the obvious exp bonuses. Also, at the time running Luck 3 and cheesing the ending with ATHENA just felt unfair.
---
That being said, do we *really* think Bethesda could handle such advanced coding so as to remove certain stat-based bonuses?
---
Surely the devs would have to go *back to school* in order to learn how to how to add up to 3 intelligence but also minus up to 6% experience gain, as well as not breaking something else completely unrelated by doing so..
---
Also very glad to see someone not jumping straight onto the nerf wagon. Don't nerf bloodied and junkies - **buff everything else!**  
---
Would love to see Mutant's function like Junkie's does, as well as an increased duration and damage cap for Furious! Berserkers *really* needs some love. Nocturnal should have a daytime counterpart to make it viable if you were to switch outfits. And any creature-based damage bonus should be buffed to *at least 30% or more!*
---
It happened in between fo3 and fo4
---
I mean it doesn't take but a 2 second google search lmao
---
The empath mutation gives 25% damage reduction to teammates. Since you count as your own teammate, there are no downsides to running the mutation yourself so long as you are on a team. With Class Freak to reduce the negative effect, your own mutation gives you damage reduction. With regards to damage reduction, I think Lone Wanderer is obsolete.
---
Agreed! I love the chicken coup. It‚Äôs like having pets at my camp. Just wish they roamed around from time to time.

No. This is just one of the GTA Online PVP idiots
---
Oh sorry I misunderstood, what platform you on?
---
Faction rep? Ugh...
---
Hopefully there is more than just one way to get rep from them on a daily basis, I hate Vital Equipment!
---
It'd only be a good start, but they'd still need to do a lot more than just nerf bloodied.  After nerfing bloodied, they probably have to balance other aspects of their game so that the demand for having such obscene damage output doesn't feel like a requirement to some people.
---
Only rick and morty fans understand this, so far all of the replies have been off lmao
---
Called a joke lol jeez calm bro
---
There's a concrete pile you can mine outside Poseidon Energy Workshop. Along with that, the camp allows you to mine lead, aluminum, uranium, water, and fusion cores.
---
I try to claim this and the Ammunition Plant daily, as it gives a ton of valuable resources and ammo.
---
&gt; Will you transfer my Fallout 1st entitlement from Bethesda.net to Steam?
---
Due to technical limitations, Fallout 1st memberships and Atoms cannot be transferred automatically from Bethesda.net to Steam. If you currently have a Fallout 1st annual membership, we encourage you to inform our Customer Support team to see what options are available to you.
---
That‚Äôs from Bethesda‚Äôs website when the game was released on Steam. I of course don‚Äôt know for sure, but it would probably be the same explanation.
---
Unfortunately it‚Äôs a photomode pose. That would be a great emote tho!
---
The terminal is the only thing I could lock on the ammo machine.
---
Most likely
---
I can give you 4 flux.
---
I had that happen once. Restarting the game fixed it for me.
---
[fed76.info](https://fed76.info/weapons/)
---
actually don't nerf anything. Make enemies ridiculous bullet sponges instead. 
---
and buff all other builds. 
---
\*insert thanos balance meme\*
---
The christmas stuff takes a lot more XP to unlock than the Halloween rewards. I had the glowing skeleton for a long time before finally getting the last christmas outfit.
---
It's a abomination
---
Unless the wiki is wrong, it‚Äôs showing the exact same intervals.
---
Yeah but the store is the exact same, so it confuses me a bit.
---
Damn these are amazing
---
Same.  I hardly ever use my crit with my B2525s. Most everything is 1-2 shots max aside from squatch or the queen.
---
I dumped my B5025 handmade for B2525 handmade and fixer and never looked back.
---
Haha are you on Xbox?
---
and how did you get 12k legendary modules?
---
Do you already have and forgot?
---
From what I‚Äôve seen (I just unlocked them myself), though are for metal and combat armor, which don‚Äôt exist in NW. The fallout first orange/blue Camo paints can be applied to wood and scout (maybe marine as well, but I haven‚Äôt seen that one) in the mode, however.
---
I hear this complaint a lot, but I can be surrounded by these guys and they barely tickle me.
---
A single yao guai on the other hand completely fucks me over.
---
Or better yet unused plans
---
This has been happening to me too! Every time I log in, I just have to go turn it in, and quest completed. The object stays in my inventory, so the next time I log in, it repeats. Once, I did do it twice in the same day, by server hopping, but haven‚Äôt since. Not trying to push my luck. Lol.
---
definitely not the norm. a level 4 accidentally fast traveled to my camp down near watoga and died on my front porch to a scorchbeast that likes to spawn nearby every so often. i couldn't save him, he went down first scream, so i stood over his corpse and bag and killed the beast while i waited for him to respawn. then built him some better armor and dropped some stimpaks for him. hope he made it back to the forest safely lol.
---
Once I realized we could do this, both my toons got herd mentality
---
He may have spent all his time around the Whitespring back when you could nuke it and get like 600xp per ghoul, then have a teammate rejoin the server and repeat for hours.
---
do you have escape artist on? with uny. agility I'm very rarely detected even when jumping around
---
Thoughts on where to allocate those last 3 SPECIAL?
---
Yeah.  You need 4 flour?
---
It shows Legacy effects, but not effects that were *never* available for the selected base item. Like it won't show a Quad Black Powder Pistol, for example. If you learn what effects are legacy (like Double, and Explosive on energy weapons) then you'll be fine.
---
You know I thought about getting herd mentality and empath. Decided to pass on the empath because the downside. I never thought about the fact that you are your own teammate like you just pointed out. TYVM
---
Thanks! I am currently working on a 2h melee build but not sure if it‚Äôs better to go ranges or not. Want to get away from power armor if I can help it.
---
Good to know it might reset on it's own.  My other glitches seem to stick around. 
---
The only glitch that has reset on me was a weapon that did 50% too much damage. It corrected after I let someone else hold it.
---
It can take 30-60 minutes to do the dailies most days, especially if you make a new character to help with "Level up".
---
The Nuka World ones are what take time honestly
---
Crits are still good. 
---
Just hold down Y or whatever button when pressing trigger you will get in habit. 
---
It would be nice if was an 'auto use crits toggle or something'
---
Also crits Are NOT a guaranteed hit in 76.  However the crit remains until you land one.  Ie) you can press crit miss 2x and land 3rd which will be a crit.
---
PC. 
---
Just wondering if some stats are "safer" choices when you are still learning and trying things out or if you have to always be working toward a specific build. I've got a lot into sneaking and rifles so not sure where to go from there.
---
Right. Of course.
---
Ahhh. It works so thank you. Was just hoping for something that wouldn‚Äôt show me if it‚Äôs a legacy/no longer available.
---
That‚Äôs what was in my head but my fingers went rogue.
---
SHHHHH !fools you want them to fix it :-)
---
Too bad their is none really for the T-65 and I still can't use my tricentennial paint job
---
So,I did this every other day for about 2 weeks and had 3 wetsuits, and 2 of each marine armor plans.  No more than 10 hours farming, tbh.  This is the most concentrated location of plans I've found (online).  
---
Good hunting!
---
can't believe you haven't been trolled by someone trying to get your goat ;-)
---
There's A perk under Charisma that lets you heal people with flame weapons, it also heals friendly targets like the brahmin in free range. Rad sponge is also good unless your teammates are bloodied, then you're just being A troll. I like to share Philanthropist it basically lets your team share hunger and thirst bars. Lastly there's A legendary effect that heals teammates when you hit with A crit, I think it's called "Medic's".
---
Head shots against most things (ghouls, scorched) are already pushing 2200 damage for me while sneaking. Regular shots against other tough enemies like sentry bots and normal scorchbeasts only take about 4-5 shots to bring down. So even with a crit, which adds only like 50-75 more damage, from what I have witness, isn‚Äôt doing enough in that hit to necessitate the use of having to constantly spam crits against normal enemies. 
---
So I feel like having crit savvy as a perk is useless
---
didnt they add in the bit where you can purchase the levels with atoms?
---
I don't know if it used to be different, but when another player and I tested it, we weren't able to change either the Collectron or the ArmCo settings.
---
Yeah unfortunately that's something you need to learn over time, tbh. I don't know of any tool for that, unfortunately. But obviously the prices given in comparison to another legendary effect with this tool can also help you glean that knowledge, too
---
That's odd, I can lock my container.
---
Actually only need 2 now lol. The struggle for those first 2 was real. I actually think I got them from SBQ.
---
My biggest complaint is with INT tied to exp and exp ties to seasons and now legendary perks UYL makes every other set pointless.   Thats dumb.
---
Fair enough. Thanks for the help
---
&gt; I am in the Mire and at worst I get attacked by a scorched officer once in a blue moon.
---
Worst I've been attacked by is ATHENA.
---
But high level glowing wolves are pretty common, same with cave crickets.  Also been attacked by a scorchbeast, think it was level 80, spawned in the house, damaged the entire camp.  This is in a low level area.
---
Everyone wants their slice of the pie.
---
Steam gets a cut of the sales through Steam, so probably doesn't like Bethesda having a way around that through Bethesda.net
---
And Bethesda obviously prefers not paying any cut when people are buying through their launcher, so why enable compatibility with Steam purchases.
---
Likewise for Microsoft and Gamepass.
---
It's stupid but the most likely reasoning.
---
Then either the wiki is wrong or they're not both gaining XP in the same intervals because I unlocked everything and the christmas rewards took much longer.
---
[deleted]
---
If only dying in Fallout 76 wasn't a mere slap on the wrist.  If there was actually a risk and punishment to dying in 76, then maybe skirting the line between life and death as close as Bloodied demands would actually be less of an inconvenience and more of a risk where you will potentially pay the price of.
---
That's what i meant, i said various to sugarcoat it.
---
I was planning on going with single shot rifles for my build but I eventually went for power armour and heavy weapons just because it's so awesome and cores are way easier to get because you just hook up a fusion generator to the fusion core processor at posiedon energy plant on a private world and play the game. Every time I play fallout 4/76 I cant resist going pa and gatling laser.
---
Turrets yes. If your turrets target something incorrectly, your allies will to. Remove the turrets.
---
I found some balance when I accidentally realised I had a full set of Unyielding Marine armor for sale (I am more of the heavy combat BoS type). I equipped and leaded the set, and radiation attacks (like the ones ghouls perform) barely cause damage. Even if I get surrounded by them, I can tank enough attacks to reach higher grounds or flee.
---
Try Marine, try trapper. I used to have a trapper soldier with like 300 rad resistance. It was fun.
---
I only have 4 Charisma so I'm limited by what I can share, right now it's [Travel Agent](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Travel_Agent) as people are bouncing between farming spots but if anyone has suggestions I'm all ears!
---
I love the glow in the dark wallpaper and cannot wait for the fireplace door. I redesigned my camp and bedroom so that I could remove the modern fireplace and set up my bed to be facing the fireplace door when I get it.
---
Medic builds, mostly. I'm sitting on 12 charisma, always share inspirational for my teams.
---
Buff Berserkers we run around in virtually jeans and a T-shirt
---
Yeah you make valid points. To be honest I probably am not the most knowledgeable at the game and so would not be very efficient at grinding. Which is why I‚Äôm so hesitant. It might take me longer than an experienced player. 
---
I also play the game alone so I think I would benefit from playing in a part of a team who can educate me and make the grind more fun. 
---
I also don‚Äôt have an issue supporting Bethesda financially but I feel like the way they‚Äôve done it so far (the first membership for example) has been the wrong way to go about it. 
---
I would literally throw all my money at Bethesda for more hairstyles or the automatron dlc from fallout 4 or any dlc from fallout 4 implemented in 76. I have been purchasing a lot of the atom shop bundles recently including the red rocket and the diner items. Bethesda are on the right track but there‚Äôs so much potential if they were worried about finance.
---
i don‚Äôt like how you‚Äôre treating a‚Äôs like I‚Äôs
---
I wish I could see progress on ANYTHING in NW, I‚Äôve unlocked everything else but the final 2 things in Christmas and the skeleton suit. Somehow all the other ones unlocked at the same XP.
---
More money if they charged everything separatee
---
Yeah sorry, I'm on mobile.
---
Unpopular opinion that will get downvoted: This is exactly why Survival should still be here. Losing aid items and caps provides a higher risk, especially when *anybody* could have their crosshair on your head.
---
he is playin an air drum solo.
---
that still doesn‚Äôt make sense and i‚Äôm scared
---
Same, at least it will cost much less camp budget this way. Or at least it should o.o
---
Haha. Yeah. The devil on my shoulder is remembering all the SBQ fights where I got booted after sinking hundreds of bullets. 
---
The angel on my shoulder already has me feeling guilty about the trades I was able to make last week.
---
The state of WV has a whole tourism subsite around Fallout 76.  https://wvtourism.com/fallout76/  It links to https://wvtourism.com/insiders-guide-to-real-world-wv-locations-in-fallout-76/.
---
same here (on PC). cannot find it in armor workbench. seems it's some sort of bug or they just forgot to add this recipe to rewards list lol :) Lets wait until they will fix it
---
Bethesda shut down player vending a couple of times.  It sucked.
---
I need to give that one a shot. I've found that I no longer need Action Boy and have one point free for something else.
---
Honestly it is very easy to do, but I wouldn't not be great at explaining it via reddit comment. I would head to YouTube for a video tutorial.
---
Mine for Aluminum or whatever ores you need during Lode Baring event in an Excavator PA.
---
Love this work!

My username is AnonymousLemon and if it helps I'm on Steam, and it happened after i got atoms from the Legendary Run

I‚Äôll put some in my vendor.   Gt willytbow.
---
IIRC the calculation between the two was different.
---
Halloween the XP shown is what you need in total, so if the first item was 100xp, an the second was 200xp you would only need 200xp total for the 2nd item.
---
But for Xmas if it was 100xp for first item, 200xp for second, you needed 300xp total for the second item (the 200xp was in addition to the first 100xp).
---
As you can guess, that gets grindy real fast on the xmas stuff
---
I have over 2000 hours in. I have seen it all. I have had the godrolls. I have traveled. 
---
Nothing compares to that day when I got TWO consecutive perfectly preserved pies from Top of the World and the Ski resort next to it. 
---
I even remember it was a Friday morning and I was in a hurry, getting ready for work. Photomode was made for it.
---
YeH..agree
---
Refund on in game micro transactions will never happen.   Are you high?
---
As for his sub.  Well he shouldnt have to pay after being blocked but it IS his responsibility to cancel the auto renew.   He could contact bank and say the service i paid for wasnt delivered after 30 days.  But you have to wait those 30 days and then they will look into which takes another 60.   
---
If he wanted to wait 90ish day he could possibly get the 12 bucks back.  Personally I would be too embarrassed for that amount lol.
---
How well does the Chinese stealth armor work with a full set of berserker armor? Or do you literally need 0 DR?
---
Bullshit
---
Try your best not to 'appear' tasty
---
didnt your mom teach you not to waste food?
---
Like every single server you join so you haven't played for a long time cuz it keeps crashing, or does the server crash more often?
---
Are you counting camps or player dots?
---
It-It's him, THE FALLOUT GOD HIMSELF
---
Perk for attack speed or comic ik it exists im surprised you still got your ass kicked by someone in melee like thats legit one of the worst ways to die in nw
---
I feel your pain to my core
---
You can wear armor if you like but you don‚Äôt get the full effect unless you‚Äôre 0 DR. Even a hazmat suit drastically drops my damage
---
Anyone had it today? Been trying for 3 or so hours now.
---
Did you put him out of his misery afterwards?
---
You know what, I didn't I just left him there.
---
yep we've had it a few times
---
2 in my vendor for free.
---
No, I don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve ever had it. I came along the Vault 79 door &amp; found out about the fragments.
---
You still have a long way to go then I'm afraid but keep at it. The skeleton is certainly worth it if you ask me, it looks really cool in low light.
---
If I own one or two items already included in a bundle I wont buy it no matter how much I like the other items.
---
If they could make some sort of system such as this, I could return the small item and buy the larger set, aka more money to Bethesda.
---
Ahh the long pork. Delicious!
---
That's crazy, it sounds like it really does need a buff. A hazmat suit reducing your damage doesn't even seem fair.
---
&gt;  I was just stating my opinion.
---
Simply put, your opinion is wrong.
---
"Leeching" doesn't take or steal anything from other players. Other players are not missing out on anything because somebody decided to "leech".
---
&gt; I think people should be awarded by their participation
---
That's what *everyone* here is saying. Can you point out a comment here that says otherwise?
---
If I'm herding cows in Free Range, if I'm holding pylons in Encryptid, if I'm collecting kindling in Campfire Tales, if I'm playing music in One Violent Night, etc, etc, etc, **I am participating**.  
---
And yet I still lose my legendary item reward unless I can somehow get a hit on it before it gets 1-shotted.
---
The system we have right now is awful. Don't be an enabler of it.
---
How can you scrap it? I didn't even know that was possible.
---
Best thing is, I have only received three pieces, total. Those two (ten minutes of separation) and a piece from Flatwoods a year before that. 
---
I did not know about the "secret" piece on top of WesTek. Now, when I want pie, I go there, kill all mutants and climb to the top. I eat it right there, alone have a beer and think of Dogmeat.
---
First suggestion - go to the pawnshop and unload the ones you have, then check all six places and see which one you're mikssing.
---
He‚Äôd be a cool ally...
---
If he had a quest
---
He's more machine than supermutant now.
---
It was the same on another toon.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Bruh teams, camps , player dots it‚Äôs dead am I like shadow banned?
---
It would be cool if his quest made his guilt go away, like helping some people or finding people in trouble.
---
Look at the pretty flowers, supermutie.
---
Yep. Lemme mesage you
---
Sheepsquatch plushie!!!
---
Nukes and dragons build planner let's you pick weapons and effects.. Not sure how precise it is though.
---
Yeah t65 looks like shit but it's good.
---
Go for Bloodied Faster fire rate, its more damage, and less dangerous! If you can net with reduced vats cost, you'll never miss the splash as you'll wipe out everything around him with gunfu!
---
Hold X
---
Thanks
---
Is your server full rn? It‚Äôs double xp 
---
and no queens no sheep‚Äôs not even a white spring s going on wtf??
---
Thanks for the info! Here‚Äôs to hoping I won‚Äôt have to repair something every time I come back to my camp!
---
It's broken since the Legendary Run!
---
Nah, I've already got the reflex for my Railway, I was talking about the reflex for my Radium. I've got everything else *except* the reflex sight. I should just find someone else that's already unlocked it and pay them to add it for me, but my inner completionist wants all of the Radium mods unlocked, even if it means I have to craft and scrap a couple hundred more.
---
I fell for the vending machine booby trap and lost 300-ish caps (I was trying to buy items for my shower). The asshole then looted my scrap bag (items I had just purchased from him). Told him that wasn't very nice, and he proceeded to call me a fat bitch. I wonder who hurt them so badly as a child that they need to go out of there way to hurt people in a video game this way :/
---
Ive always got an Event group going because double xp
---
if you look at the challenge it will tell you explicitly what you need to do to get it done
---
Sell junk. Scrip those legendaries people are not buying, and if you want to keep extra sets of armor, mod them into ultralight. Weapons you want to keep (but not use) need to be free of mids, to save space. Also, sell ammo and gunpowder if you don't need it.
---
Check out this video its older but gives a great idea of how many crits you can get in. 
---
https://youtu.be/G9Udas3wACw
---
and with todays crit food doing 2x + overdrive + magazines I have seen ones where they are constantly headshotting queen for 1200+ and thats with her 75% flat damage reduction so they are effectively hitting over 12k. 
---
Crits can matter but need a crit gun and the right build.
---
I see about 9 players above level 100 and about 6 under level 100. But that‚Äôs just from a quick cycle around the map.
---
Mouse over the challenge and build the stuff it tells you to build. It has to be specific stuff, 5 doors/stairs, 5 display cases or stash boxes, 5 wall decorations, 20 light fightings and 10 water pumps iirc.
---
Too many to even recall lol.
---
My favorite is probably when I was taking some couples workshop from them. I was melting them left and right with a Tesla, and they just kept coming back again and again, then they were suddenly down the way a bit. So I followed them and they were arguing over area chat and then it quickly turned into calling me a hacker. 
---
She was like "look how high he is jumping, yep hacking. We're reporting you." I was using marsupial obviously with strange in numbers lol and he was talking about how I took no damage from them. (Foodbuilds never do much damage.) And I was laughing and trying to explain to them how I was jumping high, and what kind of build I was running, but they had both blocked me, and didn't even realize it, as they both said "we see your mic, but you aren't saying anything." 
---
So that pissed me off that they were so toxic over a little PvP, refused to understand ANY of the game mechanics, including the block feature, and we're so dead set I was a hacker. It was surely ridiculous. And I wish I could say this was the only reaction similar I have gotten from any PvP activities, but it happens alot.
---
It is, a lot of people have already done so, but you shouldn't worry about him or specifically grind your life out because of it. Even if you do a just bit of grinding and finish off daily and weekly challenges you are "supposed" to hit rank 100 on the last week of Seasons.
---
I just made 5 level 1 leather pieces. I lost like 50 mats total from the thousands I have
---
September 8th
---
Is when it ends
---
I‚Äôm in your session but can‚Äôt find your camp?
---
This, and I do run bloodied.  Run level 3 if you can afford it.  It is bugged and if you equip it along with the speed demon mutation, any time you take damage it will bump your health back up to 30hp (just inside nerd rage threshold) if you sprint a very short distance.  Makes you almost unkillable and you never need stims.   Also, with ghouls, I find blocker to be a nearly necessary perk.  Level 3 nearly eliminates incoming melee damage regardless of what % it says on the card.
---
did the same til i uninstalled the game once because it got boring and upon reinstalling all photos are deleted
---
Think that poor little guy would start a duping extravaganza? Lol
---
I didn't see your post before I replied, but this is accurate.
---
It's not worth it  since the FO4/76 damage system is complete shit. It just makes you nullify a percentage of the damage, and with Charred Ghouls doing 80\~ unarmed ballistic damage, you will still get 1-2 shot at 20%hp.
---
Adrenaline, always helpful to share that for SBQ runs, shame it's broken though....
---
I'm nowhere near the cap limit, but if I want to be a bad guy towards other players, I'll switch my camp off the map in case someone wants to get the idea to nuke it later on, as another example.
---
Either way, people want to do different things for different reasons, so more options the better. Nobody said you have to do any of this and feel free to scrap your vendors any time you want.
---
Not with all the robots down there!!
---
That and Line in the Sand.
---
I'll be playing most of tomorrow to grind SCORE. I'm happy to help if we're on at the same time. Shoot me a message when you want the help. PSN is fakenunchucks
---
Lone wanderer has been replaced, empath mutation is so much better now we have public teams!
---
It seems that wearing disease resistant headwear helps with this.  At least for me it does.   Maybe just my imagination.
---
I'm not gonna say how or why I know these things, but *getting* to silo launch controls isn't the hardest part. *Initiating* a launch sequence is the hardest part.
---
Nobody joins the builder teams for some reason...
---
I had three spaces left. So I just stuck display items in case and spammed the items I needed to build then deleted them after. It's the quickest way
---
Lol you should submit this to the creature feature submission. This is pretty good.
---
thank you!
---
These are really impressive! I will definitely be using them as wallpapers now lol
---
It came out deliciously.
---
The bloodied melee benefits from other things (a full set of Unyielding armor, mutations) besides perks (bloody mess, evasive, dodgy, serendipity). 
---
If you want to go full-damage, replace one-hand with unarmed. Gauntlets are "unarmed".
---
Try restarting the game or rebuilding it?
---
Good luck.
---
You should probably list the mutations you need again
---
Worked for me, awesome cheers. Was about to Uninstaller it.
---
You sure you don't want to make ten more posts about it?
---
And it will always be that way too.
---
I usually join off a steamer on twitch, there server is always full
---
Bear arm plan, 2 bear arm mod plans, stimpack diffuser plan, and formula p plan.
---
Project Paradise used to be a triggered event and this allowed people to plan as a group when to attempt it.
---
With it being on a random timer there is no group planning around doing it. Not sure if you noticed but in order to have the best chances of getting the best drops you need a well organized team. Typically a group of randoms showing up won't have what it takes to complete....or even a competent team of 4.
---
Not to say I havent completed Project Paradise with say 2 animals alive during this time period with it being a Public Event, but that is by far the exception to the rule.
---
I lost bird bones, marsupial, and herd mentality
---
Sorry I forgot to mention it in the post!
---
Let's make teams actually go red to eachother at workshops before we start adding new features please.
---
Go ahead and contact the mods about it. I am sure they would be happy to dispassionately address your issue quickly and efficiently.
---
Yep, literally right after I posted, we got it.
---
Bloodied/unyielding is boring. I would rather just play the game however I want and not care about min/maxing damage and whatever nonsense.
---
Is it possible that the Halloween rewards are a cumulative score and the Christmas ones are resetting after every unlock? That‚Äôs the only thing that would make sense.
---
15 out of 24 on a Friday double xp night ???? I‚Äôm going to bed I guess
---
Happens with turrets in Radiation Rumble attacking each other and friendly robots at Distinguished Guests too. The AI is all poo-brained.
---
I didn‚Äôt know there was a mouseover all this time. I will take a look. However, I didn‚Äôt do all those things for the ones I did get credit for. But that is a very helpful tip and I will check it out.
---
It's called "put in your headphones and close your eyes, thinking of Scotland."
---
PS4 here. It is worst than ever. It used to happen with some weapons, but now it is happening with all of them. 
---
Patch 20, probably.
---
Don‚Äôt have twitch
---
I guess, i never did it back when you could trigger it. Now at least people know its there hense why they probably changed it.
---
I‚Äôm actually fighting SBQ right now with you lol. GT SyberKill
---
Bro if they did this I would respec my entire character and never look back. Heavy guns &amp; Melee are cool and all but ping is better.
---
Yeah yesterday, so I'm assuming the ban waves were the priorities beforehand.
---
Or to provide a nutritious super power granting drink for your bloodied friends!
---
Woah woah there cowboy. We aren't even talking about griefing here. If anybody griefed, it was you OP. You killed him repeatedly. I'm reporting you to Bethesda.
---
We must be looking at different things. But thanks for replying. I will check it out.
---
15 out of 24 visible from a quick glance through. 
---
Crouched players don‚Äôt show up on the map unless they‚Äôre on your team. Lots of players use stealth builds.
---
Players that have blocked you don‚Äôt show up on your map. 
---
Go get some rest.
---
I need the space, so I can give you a good one for free. Add me. Andreslamantis.
---
Charred ghouls have armor piercing on their damage, meaning it doesn't matter if you have 0 or 10000 armor they hit the same regardless. They actually do the exact same damage as bloated glowing ghouls, yet if you test they hit you about three or four times harder because they ignore your armor.
---
They are just one of several enemies in the game that does this, others being assaultrons, col gutsies with guns, and a few others.
---
This is correct. That's how it was during the initial run of each of these.
---
hmm yeah i get what you mean but i think they did stopped to griefing from public teams. For example joining one to get your friend to flag you and your team members for pvp.  
---
You could always set it so if people from your public team join your workshop they get flagged for pvp like you would if your are by yourself.
---
Get level 3 alliance with the Settlers, get the gauntlet, some modules, then craft them until you find your perfect weapon
---
I have a question for a high level. I know you said NW but do you still get a perk pack every 5 levels after level 50?
---
He tried to attack me after i killed him but lets keep it civil
---
Not in my experience though.
---
I server hop to stomp foodies, I would be spending more time opening Spotify then loading
---
I did that with my Batman character.
---
Hmm, sounds like what PvE people do all day on here. They bitch about things not being their way.
---
Open the social menu and you can count the total amount of people on the server
---
Damn looks like I‚Äôll be grabbing the skeleton suit and calling it for NW. *sigh*
---
Had it drop from Queen of the Hunt after about a year.
---
I'm gonna explosive bait your CAMP.
---
i do observe that. sometimes i noticed ppl have their own groups intentionally filled out, it would seem. the only time i had someone reach out to msg me was to critique my camp‚Äî and then was like, "oh come peep my camp", so i did and then he was there and gave me a fixer, smh lol... i'll use discord when playing with my one friend, to not cross-contaminate the public chat with ours. 
---
one thing tho i been too lazy to look up is whether voice chat in public pug groups can be seperated from the world chat. i think it might default to switching the chat mode exclusive to the public group you join??
---
Ok so here‚Äôs what I want to see in nuclear winter 
---
1. A new map maybe do Grafton or Charleston 
---
2. Add different modes like solos or duos like no offence but I prefer playing just me and my friend and yes we can go none fill but we don‚Äôt want to be at a disadvantage 
---
3. Add a way to bring your teammate back have it be like a mr handy who you have to pay a certain amount of caps you can find during the game or each kill gives you a certain amount of caps 
---
4.add a way to track your xp and teammates kills during a game so let‚Äôs say you go to the pip boy and it just hasn‚Äôt how close to levelling up you are and a little number for your teammates kills 
---
5. The ability to share perks with your team 
---
6.a mini map to see where the next circle is without pausing the game 
---
7. The ability to go straight into the next match with your friends who are on your team 
---
8. The ability to find legendary weapons make it a low chance or maybe only through creatures or supply drops 
---
9. Supply drops make it so they fly around and you can shoot them down or get one through a terminal 
---
10.add the radio so you have something to listen to you while you play 
---
Those are just my personal ideas I know some of them sound stupid and shit nutmeg please don‚Äôt send me hate messages or comment things telling me I‚Äôm a idiot as everyone deserves respect for sharing their ideas and If anyone has any suggestions or changes be my guest
---
add sonofarobot
---
What? Am I missing something?
---
hopefully they bring more jumpsuits haha
---
Someone‚Äôd find a way. Or it‚Äôd be buggy or smthn tech
---
That's what foodbuilds who can't hang say. Funny how all of the PvP people have been doing it this entire time with legendaries.
---
Max out all Rifleman perks and Sneak, maybe add Tank Killer. Concentrad Fire and Action Boy if you use vats. Add maxed out Bloody Mess and consider Starched Genes and Class Freak for mutations (Marsupial Serum to jump on elevated positions and additional carry weight) This was a game changer for me.
---
Finish all of the Becket quests and you‚Äôll get ‚ÄúThe Final Word‚Äù which is a pretty bad ass 3* .50 cal ma deuce. It has a faster fire rate and ignores 50% of armor. Plus 250+ damage resistance while reloading.
---
Explosive is highly over rated.
---
1) for as you say the 5 perk point
---
2) its 100% useless against queen and we can assume ALL boss fights.    Its not like anyone has trouble killing normal mobs.     
---
3) its annoying AF when people just keep shooting and blow corpses apart.
---
Its more than just those 5 things, but those are the easiest things to place. One of the items is "Plant 10 crops or water sources" so plopping down 10 water pumps is the easiest and cheapest. One asks for 5 display cases or stash boxes, so you just drop 5 stashes down. One asks for 20 power connectors or light fittings, so you throw 20 light fittings up on the roof etc.
---
If you want then I can get some
---
Also, the Chinese used a large variety of weapons from all areas during WWII, Like the Mosin-Nagant, Type 88 and the United Defense M42. hint hint nudge nudge.
---
Those pictures are amazing! I need to start taking better pictures
---
They reset. The previous ones fall into a pit of non-existence and a new set springs up to take their place. I don't know how to simplify it any harder than that. It happens every week.
---
These look amazing. Half the reason I went a stealth build was to get closer to the ‚Äúwildlife‚Äù and I really hope I can produce some shots as good as these.
---
Ok. I got the quest that says find Becket. So just do that and all his ‚Äúcompanion‚Äù/personal quest line and I‚Äôll get it?
---
Yeah, if I can find a list of items to build, that would be very helpful (mouseover?). Thanks for the reply.
---
For the level up, unless you enjoy nw, the way to cheese it is create a new character every time you need to level up. Because rank 0, if you survive two storms you will level.
---
Truth.
---
PA literally has one useful damage perk, and that‚Äôs stabilized, outside of that there‚Äôs no reason and you lose out on perks like serendipity
---
I can one shot 68 mutants with my BE Gat Gun outside of PA
---
I couldn't exit out of my PA till I hopped to a new server, bugs everywhere!
---
What are you carrying?
---
I had A LOT OF FUN with a character who only used an instigating baseball bat + faster swing speed and benefited from those perks which triple the effects of alcohol and prevent from getting addicted to it. 
---
So it was like, have a whisky, go smash some heads.
---
Get a headset. For all they know they can be emoting someone near you and not them.
---
You‚Äôre a bloodied build you‚Äôre supposed to be weak
---
No survival failed because people like you going there for rewards and getting spanked. Then complaining on Reddit.
---
Survival failed because of map markers and predictable spawn.
---
Survival failed because of damage caps blanketing all builds and shutting out most.
---
Survival failed because CAMPs became indestructible with vendors.
---
Survival was ignored and butchered by Bethesda to suite whining daisy pickers like yourself.
---
+1
---
Awwww father and son
---
Dude that woulf be awesome
---
Yes. Try your best not to swap perk points until your absolutely sure you know what you want. I wasted so many levels doing it. Just keep picking useful perks you might use.
---
I have a flamer in my inventory specifically for these feckers. Don't even have any perks equipped for said flamer and it still takes them out in no time. Them and robots, so long as you get close to the assaultron before it spots you.
---
Not for score, ideally im trying to get as close to NW level 100 and I am wondering how much harder the grind gets from 45 and up. Right now it takes me about 2 games to level up being in the top 3-5 most matches.
---
Amen brother.
---
I will be able to get on in about an hour
---
Very kind of you, I‚Äôll add you and see if you‚Äôre on tomorrow.  I‚Äôm usually on around 11AM pst.  Psn name is LGCK
---
[https://imgur.com/a/VjJWAMq](https://imgur.com/a/VjJWAMq) To the right of the challenge when you mouse over it.
---
We call them trash bags or hefty bags
---
lol
---
"gO PlAy NuClEaR WiNtEr" 
---
You mean bush hunter? Cattle herder? The mode people like you are ruining actively?
---
The reputation system with wastelanders sucked. They should‚Äôve called it something else, because I could go and kill every settler random encounter I see and they‚Äôll still love me for selling them a few photos and getting back their medical scanners
---
Save it. It will be used one day.
---
pc level 101?  stealth hunter, i like nw etc
---
Oh ok, never mind then. I just finally figured out how to cheese that daily today and so over shared.
---
Thanks psn is egroegy
---
Xbox and pc has changed the climate so much from the influx of game pass newbs. The stuff i sell used to do real well until the low lvls poured in. God only knows what they want as all offers i get are for bobby pins 10mm ammo and the like. For free that is. I offer them 100 or so pins and whatever ammo at a cap a piece for half the lot and they get mad. Would give the ammo free for a bonus as always.
---
I do have one, and I called them, but they ignored it
---
Its probably under the cooking stations drink menu.  
---
Hey this IS bethesda.
---
Mine is orcaman20206
---
It‚Äôs always in the last place you check!
---
Yeah almost every MMO has some sort of PvP endgame.
---
Me
---
Even better if other teammates also have it, since it stacks.
---
Are you sure you haven't just been milking a mutated Lemming?
---
Lol.  Ok I saw you.  Got another one coming.
---
Grab home defense perk under agi and you can build the higher level machine gun turret, i think you only need one perk card for it.
---
Bush wookie here. Typically get top 12 or so, reasonably often in top 10. Play only when there is an incentive for an adventure item. It is really a slog after level 60 or so. I‚Äôm at 79 currently, no idea if I‚Äôll ever get to 85, much less 100. Depends on the incentives for me.
---
Yeah I heard Bloodied and unyielding is super strong. Like killing SBQ almost instantaneously.
---
If someone shares a perk I already have equipped, it doesn't stack, so I'm guessing the same.
---
Haha I got 1 more flux from the queen.
---
Lol touched a nerve i see.
---
If you take over a workshop and build things and that will complete your mission
---
Well you need to be alive when theres 10 to get placement exp. Im just wondering how fast you could theoretically get from 98-99 if you were in the top 3. Like 1, 2, 3 rounds?
---
Ok
---
I had to move my Brahmin Pen after I realized they kept walking into the river and drowning themselves.  
---
They have two heads and one couldn't stay out of the damned water!?
---
Well we can only hope to get a team member like you. Sorry you tried to help, and they never responded :/
---
Come back I‚Äôll give ya some.
---
Oh I'm positive there would be some bugs, bugsthesda cant seem to bring anything new in or fix current things without breaking something else to all hell, just curious as to why you think dupers would be the downfall of the weapon. I'm sure if they had a chance theyd dupe it, but I'm sure they'd try that with any weapon that gets put in right?
---
My GT is Jss125
---
I just got off for the night but will be on tomorrow afternoon/evening. If your still looking for help then hit me up
---
you'll probably love it if you like running and gunning, but it's the reason i stopped bloodying, as long as it doesn't get bugged enemy AI is set to scrambled egg level of intelligence
---
I tried the food and the chem backpack. It was a net loss with both vs the high capacity.
---
For ALL weapons.
---
Craft them and scrap them.   
---
Note*  when crafting gatling lasers and plasmas you get 1 core on craft.  ALL weapons are crafted with a full clip.   Super Duper yeilds 2.   Therefor by this way you can craft fusion cores without flux.
---
Are you on PC?
---
You don‚Äôt need others to get into it. I have 800 hours and in the 4 or 5 days that I‚Äôve played since the public teams were added, I‚Äôve probably used teams more in that time then I‚Äôve used them the past year and a half combined
---
Haha they are dumb but cute
---
Cute. Its junk,  I avoided it like the plague because I knew that from the beginning.
---
Ok be right there. Dumping some scrip I‚Äôm maxed.
---
That is a definite possibility.
---
The fixer IS a skin.
---
It just seems more fun with others
---
This could be answered by asking yourself ‚Äúhow did I manage my inventory before getting fallout 1st?‚Äù
---
What do you do in NW?
---
Formula p stacks it's accuracy bonus, you can take like 5 of them and turn any weapon into a super accurate, no recoil, no dispersion sniper.
---
Have you played since public teams were added?
---
No, just begged to be corrected.
---
The real trick is to be a building team at all times and get the leader to swap to event team when a big event is about to finish. Then swap back to building.
---
How would that work though?
---
Be sure to restart the "power user perk card" it doubles the fusion core life for armor and guns as well including ultra sight fusion course.
---
Nah last time I played the BR was just announced
---
I'm right there with you, I was so exited to get that Matte black skin for combat rifle for my fixer only to get slapped in the dick by there being no skin option.
---
Lol, I hear you there. When I'm workshop hopping and Camp baiting I always have my iPod with some Pantera blasting.
---
Also, leader bobbleheads are super helpful. especially if  you have the curator perk on, they last twice as long.
---
If they snapped I would use them all.  Cause you can have such a variety and make your camp look more hodgepodge.  Like you really build your camp from stuff you found.
---
They aren't on PS4 - tried to add their given username
---
Im just imagining that ghoul still there unable to do anything
---
I'm sorry you miss your time stroking your epeen among other things while spawn camping level 6's at train stations.
---
 Must be awful not being able to do that anymore.
---
I'm sure you said that to him as you were mercilessly griefing the poor guy. "Let's keep this civil." You brotherhood of steel flunky
---
Basically, there‚Äôs a new tab in the social menu for public teams. Anyone can make a new public team, and depending on which one you do you‚Äôll get a bonus, that bonus is higher the more people in the team. Anyone can join the team at any time so it‚Äôs not like the old teams. it incentivizes players to be on a team, and usually there‚Äôs at least 1 or 2 full ones in a server, and if u make one people are sure to join. So you could just play and join public teams instead of having 1 team you play with every time
---
To get the real ones you have to go to the White House's Google Dropbox and enter the password "Password1".
---
Well I'm not using PA. I have 500 radaway. 300 diluted radaway. 400 stims. 100 diluted stims. 350 purified water. 100 boiled waters. Around1500 ammo  for 45 rounds. 3k shotgun shells. 6k fuel. 30 psychobuffs. A bit more stuff here and there. I have perks and armor to reduce all of that. Not sure if it's an item that's glitched or something. I fast traveled and killed a few scorched,then picked up scrap. I dropped it and picked it up. Not that.
---
Aha. I can see clearly now!
---
Yeah. I‚Äôve been waiting for that one but I don‚Äôt know when it‚Äôs unlocked or maybe I just pass over it (I didn‚Äôt realize you can pick a perk from a different stat then what SPECIAL you increased till like level 42.
---
When they come from the machine, it just hits different
---
I dont know if your joking or not
---
You're a blathering moron.
---
I got the plans from the motherlode quest üôå thank you for the advice ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Yeah changed with Patch 19 iirc.  
---
Not sure if it was documented, though
---
Also, since Patch 20 I think the generic Collectron's deposit box has been unlocking itself. Can be worked around by using another variant and setting to "Junk" on the console, or putting it behind a locked door.
---
It will show up under "intelligence".
---
Fallout 1st already gets too much for what they pay for, they don‚Äôt need to add more bonuses to it and make it more pay to win

Clever!

Fellow mega slothü¶•
---
I'm getting about 3000xp every time I do a retake... event. Made a character (he's Rick Sanchez but this Rick's Szechuan Sauce is SCORE) just for the repeatable and challenges, but he's become my main in many ways. 
---
I use both team types depending on what I'm doing. Just remember to switch when you need to.
---
All of those suggestions would have to be accounted for and loaded by the server, so unfortunately as cool as those suggestions may be, if you implement them, they would make the prefabs eat up more camp budget.
---
Depends on the situation and your build. I'm a stealth rifleman and I use a JE Lever Action, but  also a TSE Handmade (along with a bunch of other guns, but these are my bread and butter weapons). Handmade is good in that it can have a fairly decent sized clip (25 with swift or 30 with the drum mag) so you can put more rounds down range, however you will find that its power compared to the Lever Action is much lower. Lever action is a great opening weapon and once you get enemies in close and have been spotted, swapping to the handmade is probably the go. Try not to limit yourself to one gun, I carry 7 around and each is good in its own situation.
---
Ah, well next time I move my C.A.M.P. I'll remember that. Thanks for the info.
---
These are very good. They are like high resolution screenshots you'd see from a developer in the load screen. I have a theme for my screenshots too. I like to use the Scrapbook theme and vintage filter to make my screenshots look like a scrapbook of my PC's life. Places that caught his eye in his journeys.
---
My friend was permanently banned today for no reason, and they did his xbox account too, which he never plays on. No reason givens no f*cks given. I am pissed!
---
Marine exists in the files but is unreleased.
---
As for the first paints, they are paints, not skins, meaning they do not change your outline or texture, the ghillie paints make it almost impossible to at a glace tell what someone is wearing.
---
Also, while I believe the paints are excellent camouflage and have worked out very well for me, most people think orange and blue and black and yellow as being not very useful for actually hiding.
---
Wait the bramin from the fertalizer producer can die? Holy shit
---
Yeah, I have only been doing Workshops. Thanks for replying.
---
Only reason not to do PA is if you plan to run bloodied than unyielding is to op to pass up
---
They fixed spawn camping withen 12 hours of the severs being live if tour gonna pretend to have played then atleast use know knowledge
---
On ps4? I think that was me!
---
Ok. Thanks. I‚Äôll keep a look out!
---
I‚Äôve never seen a level to xp conversion table for either adventure or Nw as far as I can remember. I would guess it would take longer than that even with double xp but maybe that‚Äôs just a reflection of me not enjoying the game mode.
---
I'm also using a stealth build. How's your weight management if you're carrying 3 to 4 weapons plus the ammo?
---
Great job!
---
I probably won‚Äôt try bloodied until later (when I can move around enough SPECIAL points and perks) to make it a build.
---
You can make them and scrap them to unlock plans.
---
I passed him already
---
Very nice!
---
IMO PA is king for heavy build.  Who cares if you are one shotting stuff with auto weapons.   Its not like any of that stuff is a challenge even with a NON legendary weapon.  
---
All that matters is boss fights in which case stabilized is king.   
---
However I can in no way quantify that while character and legendary perk progression is tied directly to INT and UNY is clearly better in that respect.
---
Post level 50 you can move stuff around as your special is maxed. Its pretty easy to level up in this game. Just join any random team and go do some work. I believe the extra cards are going to be going towards legendary perks as well.
---
This i run a diner ingame and while its nice alot of shit ends up spoiling most of the time
---
It was junk all along dude, seriously get over it.
---
Fo4 bos was very synth racist but this is long before 4 and a completely different branch
---
The fixer is definitely not a skin I see no difference between a modded combat and the fixer. Argument is invalid ü§£

The best perk is the suicide perk it lets you die 10x faster
---
Just this morning I had someone reach out to me for help with it. I was happy to help. They did message/text chat me on xbox. I don‚Äôt wear a headset because of a medical reason, but I listen to others on my team in case they need me. We are not all bad. Do not give up hope on the team concept. I am not a super high level player (121). I have some good guns and I play to my strengths with my build (heavy gunner).  We got the col. down quickly which was nice.
---
Instigating lever action should 1 shot any low/mid enemies. I'd use that because you can really make your ammo stretch. I'm a full lever build with 3 end game levers and I switch them out when needed. 
---
Handmades are good too, but they burn through ammo. 
---
For both though you'd want the respective perks. I have both commando and rifleman, so I can swap out whenever I please.
---
Sent
---
Much cheaper to go find swarms of scorched and super mutants. Pick up everything. Mole miners too. You'll get a ton of weapons at Westek and Uranium Fever.
---
We all know thats a bull shit excuse
---
Saaaame. Also I don't mind spending because that's what supports the game, and I happen to really like this game.
---
Most people that finished used god mode glitch but I have seen a few guys that have streams of them grinding damn near 100
---
I have seen it on the PS4 a few times myself the last couple weeks.
---
Ok great thanks! Yeah for this (I‚Äôm level 48) I just picked what I generally wanted no real build in mind. Just Heavy gun and PA stuff I thought would work together. I think I‚Äôll save levels or something so when I can change builds and actually build a good one I can do it in one go.
---
Wow these are incredible, i love the angles and u captured like a dark vibe to them, great job üëçüèª
---
Oh yeah, I love'em. I just need to put a fence around them or something.
---
Alright so I found out you gotta do the 'repair the uplink' quest first.
---
PA has a bunch of hidden perks too.   Like the RAD thing and you also take less damage from acid/poison and melee attacks.  (Try standing in the queens spooge attack without PA and you are dead.  In PA you can stand there. 
---
In short the DR on your character sheet is pointless.  If you had exact same numbers the PA will always take less dmg.
---
A few of my guns are 90%RW so its not terrible.  
---
I carry the following:  
---
JE Lever Rifle  
---
TSE Handmade  
---
J10 Tesla  
---
J10 Plasma rifle (with flamer barrel)   
---
I2590 Gauss Shotgun  
---
J3390 Gauss Rifle  
---
TS2590 Auto Grenade Launcher  
---
Shepherds Crook  
---
J40 Shishkebab  
---
All of that takes up around 90 pounds.  As for ammo, I try not to carry too much of any one round, for example I carry about 1000 .45 and 1000 5.56, 500 fusion cells, 900 ultracite plasma cartridges and about 300 ultracite 2mm EC rounds. My max carry weight is about 295 and I'm regularly around 190\~
---
Then I would say PA for sure plus like you said you wanted to try somthing new so dont hold back man
---
The Brotherhood has always been discriminatory against mutants. The only real exception is the Midwestern Brotherhood and their canon details are vague beyond the high level stuff.
---
Yeah, straight up kamakaze
---
Nice Job!
---
Lol you weren‚Äôt really ‚Äúsimplifying‚Äù anything when my question was ‚Äúthe regular Tuesday reset or?..‚Äù obviously I‚Äôm aware of the way weeklies work if I worded it like that. Just wasn‚Äôt sure if people meant the regular reset or if there was some new type of weekly or something. Sorry to inconvenience you I guess.
---
It does have goggles too?  Of that I was not aware.
---
Mega sloths 4 lyfe
---
They are pretty much an afterthought. I‚Äôd say top up your PER with a 3rd point in Concentrated Fire‚Äîmakes a big difference for VATS accuracy, and top up AGI with whatever you want. Use the 3rd point for INT, take something useful and enjoy the extra XP.
---
Do the main quest like a regular fallout game. Dont think about grinding until ur atleast 100 levels into the game. Survive, cook food, shoot stuff, and if you see a giant bat or a very mad sheep, run away because u cant kill it unless your atleast over level 50.
---
WELCOME! just a few things i have copied and pasted
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Put a few points into luck as early as possible and use pharma farma. You will have more drugs than you need eventually. (Most builds require at least 5 luck anyways so it'll come in handy after 50)
---
Melee as much as possible to save ammo in the early game.
---
Join a public team. Building gives a boost to INT and higher INT gives more xp. You can then fast travel for free to your teammates and their camps. 
---
Junk is used to make everything. When you build a camp try put it near a junk pile and build an extractor on it. And once you have 500 atoms your first purchase should be a collectron. it collects scrap and junk from around your camp.
---
Capture workshops. They give XP, loot and caps (and usually a free fast travel point but that's buggered). You can then either defend or let it to be captured and then take it back. Taking back is quicker and easier as it's only one wave of enemies. Defending can be up to 4. When you build in a workshop if the junk needed to build something is green then it comes from the workshops own stash so build away. (Workshops are pvp zones)
---
Scrap weapons and armor you're not using as you get components and a chance of a mod. 
---
scrap all junk at a workbench and then store it in your stash.
---
And this link tells you where to find ALL of the things. It is pre wastelanders so some stuff may be wrong now.
---

---
Sleep in a bed and play an instrument until you get a bonus. Takes like 30 seconds. 
---
Plant some crops in your camp. Corn or Razorgrain. And then make soup.
---
No I just built locked rooms around them. I figured that's just how it was because you know, Bethesda.
---
lol wtf
---
You have 0 poison resist in PA, meanwhile with 50 PR from legendary effect I get something like 90% dampening outside of PA
---
And those are both defensive (Rad/DR) not offensive
---
You get caps and xp when your partner finishes quests, you can enter eachothers instanced questing areas and listen in on conversations 
---
You can also build on eachothers camps, which is cool if one of you has unlocked stuff that the other hasn't 
---
Also enemies will be lootable by both of you if you stick together 
---
Also most of the quests are able to be done by players at the same time if they have the same quests active, aside from a few exceptions, what were you having a problem with?
---
Take your time explore everything and do not rush through the main quests.  There is a great lack of end game content and you'll simply have more fun taking your time.
---
Not to sound like a jerk or anything, but you're better of moving your camp. Turrets in this game are abyssal, they're more trouble than they're worth. Half the time you'll have super mutants shooting them out of range of the turret, turrets refusing to lock on, sometimes turrets will even aggro against each other.
---
Because bethesda would just remove it and not fix it it feels.
---
And I mean, they would dupe bulk junk or smthn
---
Shotgun build with 9 charisma specifically to share this perk
---
I tend to notice the caps more than the XP. Still not a lot but something all the same.
---
Nice, the room in the 11th shot was my house for a while!
---
I level up twice as a lvl 280 inside the radiation rumble event by shooting ghouls constantly. I for one can confirm that this indeed boosts Xp, plus having egg head which boosts Intelligence that's a big chunk of xp per kill
---
What usually happens if four people are bloodied so only four charisma is everyone runs their own inspiration perk for three points and then everyone shares a different 1 cost team perk. Works well.
---
I'm on PC, so I think we just have to wait for a patch cross platform. I just pulled out another ally for now.
---
Just remember if you put sand man on after covert operative you get 3.5 but if you put covert op on second it goes to 3.75 and I dont no why
---
Jesus I hope so
---
Peeps like killing mine. lol
---
Some have speculated that, especially with the various hand scanner locations that are also currently inaccessible, but idk if anything has been successfully datamined yet.
---
I actually just made a post about my (partial) shotgun build earlier. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ht29gt/loving_my_new_rifle_shotgun_build_posting_it_here/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
Long story short, I dunno how comfortable I‚Äôd be playing with *only* shotguns (range is too short and I like to pick off as many enemies as I can from a distance). But combined with some rifle perks you can handle pretty much any situation. With the investment in strength required for shotguns, it also makes it pretty easy/cheap to re-spec to a heavy gun or melee build later if you want. 
---
Vats shotgun headshots are just hilarious, I can run through Whitespring and kill most of the ghouls in a room before they even stand up.
---
Edit: to clarify, I‚Äôm not bloodied or anything and my shotgun isn‚Äôt anything special either, just anti armor. Even so, it still completely sheds. Anything more powerful than that and I‚Äôm sure I would be able to take down a legendary scorchbeast in 2-3 shots from the right range.
---
I bought the red rocket lamp before deciding to get the bundle that was also available. I submitted a ticket, responded to an email giving the details I was asked for, and they gave me back the 250 atoms I paid for when I bought the lamp :)
---
It was the 1st story quest when I have to go into the bar to learn how to build my camp. My friend was stuck outside and was frozen until I left the bar.
---
Try standing in a queen or scorched beast spooge attack in armor with 0 and PA with 0. 
---
I promise you PA takes less dmg.  Very easy to test this yourself.    I mean obviously is not hard to just move but the point is its there as a hidden perk.
---
why on earth do you have so much Chen's?
---
Hands down the plushie.
---
Instigating lever is a nice piece.
---
I agree.. if you join a public event (free from map) you would get access to all boss drops even if it dies in .00001seconds and you dont get to hit it.
---
Ultracite Gatling Laser is better than ordinary one, but not for laser pistol n rifle
---
You can wake up in that wagon after some nukashine. Definitely a Skyrim reference.
---
Uh frozen? That's unusual
---
Not sure what that's about, but if youre the team leader he should've had the option to enter with you
---
Haha yea I think they would know how to differentiate between games/movies/tv and real life. That and people don't public nuclear launch codes online and so even researching into launch codes intently means very little. Many people would take a general interest in how nuclear weapons are launched, how many people, how it is authorised etc.
---
I saw someone in game with that outfit earlier and it looked terrible - like they used low quality textures or something.
---
I'd recommend at least checking if it was just on my end (or just a PC thing) before wasting your money on it.
---
Haha got another 2 from the second queen. Think I got enough now. More queens inbound?
---
You have to put /s so we know you're not serious.
---
Then after all that it still doesn't work right most of the time.
---
Another options is all PUBLIC EVENT Legendary monsters are immune to any dmg for the 1st 5 seconds -- but if you hit the monster within the immune time frame you still get credit for the kill.
---
Yes it will allow others to leech -- but id rather have people leeching than people not getting any phat lewts.
---
No, my friend was perma banned. They even perma banned his xbox account which he doesn't play on. I am pissed!
---
I saw the bottle in when I approached the wagon from the other side
---
This is true till adadrenaline perk card broke. A lot of perk cards have been affected imo.
---
For example, whenever I'm in stealth, I will not receive extra dmg.
---
üßê
---
Haha bro I wonder what my score is !! Probably higher than all yours. This comment just made it higher.
---
Nice!
---
The legacy explosive laser rifles too. All 5 of them.
---
Even junk has value to those with little
---
I just got lucky and rolled a bloodied plasma caster with 50% limb dam and +1 perception. Is flamer barrel the way to go, and what if any perks work for plasma caster?
---
Done. You still here?  I have a bunch to spare.
---
I approve of this üëå
---
Got it just for the goggles. No regret.
---
I notice this also they fixed it once before so hopefully it'll be a quick easy fix for Bethesda
---
They do more damage to scorched and scorchbeast, but the prime reciever also gives a damage boost regardless, doesn't matter what you attack.
---
I couldn't afford the log cabin bundle but I really wanted the wooden wallpaper, so I paid 700 for the wallpaper bundle that it includes. Now the log cabin is back and I ignored buying it because its 1500 points and I already paid 700 for the wallpapers. I don't even want a full discount, if it were 1200 points I'd have grabbed it.
---
Honestly, I'm surprised that the Settlers didn't sell at least a few plans to grow plants that are wild. Would've made sense alongside the dirt tiles and the fertilizer machine, and would've felt far more equal to the Raider's little ammo factory.
---
Dang, sounds like you're a one man army! Wanna sell your handmade for caps? lol
---
Are the numbers you're listing in front of your weapon the weapon ID number. (sorry for the rookie question). Again, thank you for your input!
---
Such a great community to be part of!
---
How about just not spending the money? It's a terrible deal on the face of it. Just live without sf put that money to more fulfilling &amp; worthwhile things.
---
In a few months you're probably not even going to care about let alone remember everything you missed.
---
I‚Äôd buy that for a Dollar! (Or $25 knowing bEthesdA)
---
It was probably the new gauss minigun
---
Personal use. Plus some of them I accumulated after using alternative methods. I sometimes keep my rads since I have a bloodied explosive flamethrower and I also have a decontamination chamber sprayer to remove rads when I'm at camp.
---
Other than personal use, I sometimes sell them or just give them away to new players too, so it's good to keep them just in case.
---
The super mutants spawn right next to my camp so I don't have to worry about them being too far. And about the other issues.. well, I spent 2 days looking for a new spot for my camp and spent about 6 hours building it (altough it totally doesn't look that way lol) and I'm super attached not only to the CAMP but the spot itself. So I'm fine repairing stuff once in a while but I don't have the space to carry alot of junk so I need some semi-reliable defence
---
It's a great addition but also a low effort one, the textures are horrible.
---
Pip-boy skins don't count, even though they get applied at an armor table. Incase anyone was wondering.
---
Sounds like gauss minigun
---
We‚Äôll have tryouts
---
It‚Äôd be interesting to go in and find people in simulation pods.
---
The name drop of Braun was a pretty big clue that it‚Äôs all a sim.
---
Well, I guess that's all they did for awhile. This was in a camp that was all the new dinner build, it was one of the most amazing camps I've been in.
---
Yessir! I've been using it for a long time now. I would like to change things up to spice my gameplay. I just never come across anything that I could use in my build.
---
*I only run one character.
---
Thank you. My next grind fo sho
---
i forget which game does it, but yeah, offering prorated prices on bundles is possible, and should be standard.  also all bundle items should be available separately.
---
Nah, Prefix and major/minor traits. So J10 is Junkies 10% Damage while aiming i2590 Gauss shotgun is Instigating, 25% Faster Fire Rate, 90% Reduced Weight etc. I probably still mess some of these up as I am still learning all the shorthand for them.  
---
I play solo alot, so I like to feel as if I'm equipped for any situation.
---
Nice, sounds like a bit of a hassle though.  From what I've heard thier response to tickets varies between players.  Really should be built into the game, automated.  Would save the employees time in the long run by reducing their ticket load.
---
*AKA another way for you to make/save money Bethesda!*
---
Till then, I urge people to bother them with these tickets till they decide its beneficial to institute a propper mechanic rather then making it an inconvenience for players to get the compensation they deserve.
---
How good is the bow/crossbow for stealth builds?
---
Incredible lighting in these. I find them very inspiring.
---
piper = worst fallout companion ever.  she got on my nerves soooooo much lol.  when they offer cait's outfit i'll be interested.
---
Ahh, then I have some more to learn.
---
Here's the full build. Personally my damage output is high enough that I'm able to kill most mobs in one shot with my combat shotgun

---
Thanks fir the advice though!!
---
The goggles are really great. Only thing I use too lmao.
---
Maybe if a Nephilim drops by I will give him her mom's trenchcoat, if anyone understands.
---
Honestly, it wasnt that hard. Plus, atomic shop queries are more likely to get solved quickly, compared to bugs/exploits tickets
---
I am just extra vigilant before buying anything in the atomic shop now üòÖ
---
Its a unique combat rifle with its own skin then
---
Feel better?
---
Just put "asking for a friend" at the end
---
That's a great idea. I'd also like to see persistent workshops (that are still there when you log back in) or something similar.
---
I find the cannibal perk particularly unpleasant.  Some people seem to get a tremendous amount of joy from it.  To each their own.
---
Jarl Ulfric Stormcloak, it has been a pleasure.
---
Yes this branch was strong enough to do their own work and didn't resort to nukes
---
Yea shotguns can be broken. I have a bugged one. I don't use it but it has bash damage and one shots things since the bash damage is bugged. I haven't tried but also apparently you can make it have negative range which actually makes it bug more and have insane range and in effect be a sniper rifle in vats with each pellett hitting for huge amounts.
---
FYI, there are hollow trees too. Not saying where, but you will never be seen.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure you do. I‚Äôve had a teammate finish a quest that earned me the repeatable challenge.
---
Its just a legendary combat rifle. Just say it once.
---
I‚Äôm not I‚Äôm level 60. It just pisses me off how all these high level players think they‚Äôre so fucking high and mighty.
---
It's not really a range issue, turrets sometimes will absolutely refuse to lock on. I've had even mole rats attacking a turret directly and the turret just spun around. Also, even if you do build turrets, they're pretty underleveld, I think missle turrets are level 21 no matter what? Super mutants are some of the strongest enemies in the game.
---
If you're going to build turrets though, I'd recommend missile turrets, put them off the ground. 
---
I think I know where your camp is, I had my camp near Grafton dam and there was a super mutant spawn in like this brick warehouse thing, they caused me to move away from my spot after they destroyed everything I had. You can stay there and try to fight them, but the repairs are gonna cost a lot of resources.
---
Would also be nice to use some of those wallpapers i've paid for in it. On the outside it looks cool, on the inside its basically like the first ever garage I built. At like lvl 3.
---
No but srsly bloodied melee build is basically a suicide build more so than reg bloodied builds
---
Responder: Hey! You. Finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Cutthroats ambush. Same as us and that Duper over there.
---
Excavator, max strength, radicool, standard backpack w hi cap
---
I had no idea the game was even based on real locations. A lot of the work put into games in this regard gets lost on people not from the USA. I found it hard to appreciate GTA 5 was in a real world location because it just looked like any other game world city to me. If it looked like the cities in my country it would be different and would make me take a second look. I mean it's similar, a big city is a big city lol. But there are different features and ways things are constructed. Some cities are old and have heritage buildings too, it's not always a fast food restaurant on every corner.
---
Awesome build! I wanted to do an under the bridge build but couldn‚Äôt find the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù bridge hahaha. So I just made a height limit ‚Äúskyscraper‚Äù (until it got nuked, hahahahhhhh)
---
Haha, that's funny becuase that's the exact build in working on right now.
---
Noobs are like stray cats if you put out a dish of food for one they will all be there the next day.
---
A pleasure to take his head for the imperials perhaps
---
That would be awesome! Like after you tame a mountable creature it could follow you around and help in fights! I wish this was a thing
---
Good point. Just looked at the weekly repeatable and had the GF finish one of her dailies and it went up. Just weird it doesn't pop up an XP gain bar.
---
Not the same thing at all! When a bank deposits money that isn't yours it's coming from someone who it actually belongs to. This game.and everything inside of it is... wait for it... is NOT REAL! The guns, outfits, plans, etc.... they don't make Bethesda money. They are for our use and enjoyment while shooting down a scorchbeast.  But, this time, Bethesda has banned A LOT of people who did nothing wrong. And yes. I have a friend who was. Notified today his pending investigation is a perma band with NO explanation. They also banned his xbox account. Something he doesn't play on!!????  As a paying customer of F01st he deserves a valid explanation from a human being. And quite honestly, with how cheap it is to file. I would take them to small claims court to recoup all of the money and time I had invested in the game unless they could show me proof that I did something wrong. Bethesda is looking for investors.  And having lawsuits against them would not look well. This whole thing is BS. Ban the people actually cheating. And make sure you have proof they were actually cheating. And yes, Bethesda's game is broken because of their own shitty code. So how about they just fix the damn game. If ANY other company pulled even half the crap Bethesda does with its customers. They wouldn't be in business anymore. Sad.
---
There could be several reasons that they didn't show up.  Mine would be that I killed 3 already and was disappointed in the loot.  I am solo just as you stated.  I enjoy public teams as I want to benefit from the Inspiration, Stranger in Numbers and the card that adds DR along with the Public teams benefits.  I don't really care if I ever do an event with a Public team member (circling back to solo).
---
Right that would be nice, get a group to build it up maybe make a few friends. And be able to come back to it a day later and not loose all the resources you spent. Especially when building turrets!!
---
WoW, huh? Why not, TES has mounts.
---
How do you join this? I see a team up on my server for an event (can‚Äôt tell what), but the two people in the team are 116 and 398, so I‚Äôm scared to join. I saw a tooltip saying I could fast travel to any event, but I don‚Äôt see how without joining them, and it also scares me to go that far because I don‚Äôt want to lose my guns.
---
How does his Xbox get banned? That‚Äôs ducking stupid. I never heard such a thing. That‚Äôs a huge dick move by Bethesda.
---
Totally agree with this, I have no idea what they were thinking (beyond being blindly greedy) putting the train car in as a "bonus" item in the slocum Joe bundle - I was really excited to see it in the camp menu but no way am I buying that coffee shop stuff, I honestly don't see the connection and I'd never use the rest of it
---
And what about those that didn't do any duping and have been caught up in this ban?
---
Haha thats what I came here to say, only reason I figured we did is because my repeatable updates when someone else completes a quest.
---
You're his Mini Meü§©
---
Ha!
---
Building in my spot is tricky, since it's a random encounter location, and that creates weird zones where nothing can be placed.  But if you're willing to spend some time working around that, I highly recommend it.
---
Except its not legendary at all.   
---
Not the base version.  Its unique.   Just like the weapons from pleasent valley tickets.    Except they dont have plans.   
---
Yeesh I dont even know why you are arguing this.   It is what it is.   Live with it or select a diff weapon.
---
Thank you sir.
---
Knowing this game though it would require grinding for a thousand hours to get it and the creature would die every 15 minutes and you have to go find another with only a .00001 chance that you could pacify it lol
---
I have 800 hours in the game and still looking for one
---
Crossbow is fun. They are good weapons for events, but be ready to play "support". Kill minions, stay hidden.
---
Ultracite Gatling Laser does more damage than Gatling Laser.  
---
If they are exactly the same (same mods/same legendaries/etc) the Ultracite will always do more damage.  
---
There's no reason not to use it over it's standard brethren.
---
or G.O.A.T.
---
can confirm gauss mini, have a 2 shot and it's a light show
---
Instigating lever action for everything except really tanky enemies if you want the most bang for your buck (ammo). No other legendary will give you double damage or even quadruple of you're full stealth. If making ammo isn't a problem, go full commando.
---
NOICE!!!!!! Those are awesome. I constantly take pictures too... but mine suck hehe.
---
Ok. 
---
Crazy But!
---
There's a female bartender named Molly in Crater? Wow.
---
If you go this route, here's a couple of tips. It doesn't matter what level you scrap, so craft the lowest level available. Also, if you can, get some copies of Backwoodsman 3. It lowers the amount of crafting materials needed. When scrapping, equip the Scrounger perk to get more stuff back when you do.
---
Anecdotally, others have said that a higher Intelligence gives you more of a chance to learn mods when scrapping. Others have said there's no proof of that happening. Also, others have said switching servers before you start scrapping will give you a higher chance of learning. Again, others have said this doesn't matter.
---
I wish you luck in your quest to learn. At least you're not trying to unlock Radium rifle mods...that is the path to madness.
---
Edited for spelling.
---
These are Awesome
---
Did you click on the legendary run icons on the board to move faster?
---
This is exactly what blizzard does in their game heroes of the storm. If you own part of the bundle the price just dynamically changes to take it into account.
---
Half life?
---
You say theres too many perks, but the good ones are the scrap box and the survival tent. Unless you wanna play alone, or have many a few friends that play fallout the private world is pretty much useless. And you dont have to be a fallout first member to join on one of the private worlds.you just gotta know someone with it. Im just sayin id be nice to have the option to open up the private worlds to nonmembers so that people can join a world for what they want to do instead of server hoping to find teams to join.
---
My first actual I‚Äôm going to try camp was a huge (using all the wood I collected until level 22) 2 story filled most of the circle and only one room was filled the rest was empty. So now (that I sell) I tried to make it like the Celadon city mall (from Pok√©mon) first floor is Weapons/Armor. 2nd is Ammo/Junk. 3rd is Plans/Aid/Meds. And the 4th is my ‚Äúroom‚Äù/work shop. 
---
Then Someone nuked white springs and I was indecisive because my camp icon was literally right on the edge of the Nuke circle and I was thinking of leaving but decided not to and *boom* bye-bye Celadon Mall.
---
Joseph's Techno-Coloured Asylum Outfit.
---
Amd just give us everything else we had in fo4. Where are my scaffoldings?
---
Lmao i built mine across from the island so that my friends and i could farm it at low levels and deposit our loot. Now i keep it there since its next to Leader of the Pack for free legendaries
---
Someone else build them then left the world or lost the workshop and the build stayed. I've come across a workshop that was unclaimed with a stash box and a junk collection bot.
---
Well, I will tests my luck as I play "praise the lord and pass the ammunition" on loop.
---
Lvl 3 Sneak Perk Card, Chinese Stealth Armor.
---
I join/create teams simply for the xp buff, not to interact or actually play with the other players. Emote all you want it'll just be ignored as I go about my way.
---
Yes she was added for Wastelanders and is near the instruments
---
Amazing. Subbed and liked; I‚Äôll be trying them both when I get online later.
---
If in a Blast Zone they are raw Violet Flux.
---
I went from 99 to 210 just since legendary run started ( I'm not a hermit I swear was waiting on covid results) I was lucky enough to get a 3* bloodied handmade from fasnaut so I made the switch from bow to cammando but had no unyielding so I rocked the css for the longest but then again got super lucky with my ss rolls and got almost full unyielding set (missing right leg) and this is buy far best way to level fast
---
I think it's always been like that. I bought it when it first came out and found out the hard way from a mid air camp.
---
However, the teleport to roof is not limited to the camper. Put things on a rug and they temd to stay down. I have a base on the highway tunnel now north of watoga and putting stuff underground there warps it up into the street above. Same solution.
---
How do you do that?
---
No I didn't. I'm still at the same rank I was before I lost the atoms. Thank you for the suggestion though.
---
Shrouded is broken for wood currently.  It does literally nothing. 
---
See here. 
---
https://youtu.be/5vSK337vv2M
---
That said with 1 peice of harder to detect secret service armor and NO sneak perk I can walk right up to super mutants in west tek.  So IMO its seems pointless anyway.
---
Edit: maybe thats shadowed thats broken.   My bad.   Still seems moot IMO.
---
Sounds like the forties.
---
I haven‚Äôt really been playing that long, I didn‚Äôt know. I just always see people standing on those literally every time
---
And this right here is why I play solo.
---
the server lag and trying to climb up rocky mountain cliffs would be sorta fun, or some death stranding type fail where all your inventory falls off the mount :) 
---
nah, flying mounts please. into a nuke zone.
---
Atoms seem to be bugged for many (including me) right now. After completing lifetime challenges they do not reward atoms and instead you get a random number showing as your total atoms. I sent a ticket to bethesda and still no response.
---
I went up to 10 charisma, got a medic shotgun, friendly fire with a rapid swing shishkebab, first aid, team medic, and proceeded to not be needed a majority of the time.  Now I'm down to 6 charisma and bloodied.  I'm not bitter!!!
---
Lets put our heads together! We could well come up with some schplendid schit! DM me hun ;)
---
I like chinese stealth armor, but it means I cant use unyielding :/
---
You're a clown ü§£ just accept what it is and move on. Its a Legendary combat rifle it should be rated as a 4* legendary because thats what it is. Even in beta the sacrificial machete with base 3* was upgraded to 4 with the mod placed. Dont be upset someone has an opinion that differs from yours because you think you know it all.
---
I love it. It‚Äôs always inspirational to see other people‚Äôs camps.
---
It took me like 12 hours yesterday to get from level 94 to 100. And I was almost always in the top ten
---
Yep, whenever I see a help me emote I drop whatever i'm doing and teleport straight to my teamate.
---
Was there any update to this working? I just started this quest line and the same things is happening to me.
---
Huh, that could be it. I'll have to pay attention next time I finish another challenge that rewards atoms. I hope the atoms are rewarded somehow and not just lost to oblivion. Hopefully, they'll respond to you and I'm glad I'm not alone.
---
Just click the event when it pops up it‚Äôs called wolfs horde etc etc lvl 10 are the mobs every other mob will be lower around it and I can understand that. 
---
All events are pentagon shaped just click the event when it pops up. Events with exclamation marks have level requirements but you can still join if you want but I don‚Äôt recommend joining events higher then you if you don‚Äôt have somebody higher then you who will help you out because otherwise  your on your own.
---
the wolf‚Äôs horde event doesn‚Äôt have a exclamation mark and is always in Appalachia‚Äôs forest (usually starts at Tyler‚Äôs county fair ground
---
Did you get on pc in order to use the keyboard and mouse, or would Xbox controller make your life easier?
---
I think both might be broken from what i've read haha
---
It should be noted that ALL gauss weapons are explosive by default.    
---
No need to roll it that way.    In fact you cant.
---
I loved this when I woke up from a drunken transportation lol
---
All your posts to this subbreddit have either been removed, or they're negative. Just unsub if you dont like it.
---
It happened same to me when I completed two challenges today. Atoms go not to my steam atom account but to my bethesda one (I got free steam copy from linking). Is there a way to submit a ticket to merge two accounts or just transfer atoms from bethesda atom account to steam one?
---
Each platform has its own seperate FO1st sub. Steam has one, [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) launcher has one, I can only assume the one on the MS Store must be for the game pass version. But I'd be asking support, or finding someone else who has successfully purchased 1st on gamepass, I'm only guessing.
---
Look im sorry youre wrong.  Getting angry wont change it.   
---
Grow up.
---
Why do u believe they think that way? For now lvlng up is important only bcz of comming legendary perks and there will be a difference between 60 lvl and 300 lvl. If someone will give u all awesome plans and u manage urself to get all pieces of armor and get legit weapon from the first roll u will as mighty as every high lvl r.
---
Nice wasn‚Äôt aware of that thanks
---
I kill other players Brahmin because it is funny.
---
have to max the raider rep, idk I the rep glitch still works, and if it doesn't you will be grinding for a long..time.. like maybe a month if you're lucky
---
You're good man.
---
I get that sometimes it sucks when you have such a hard time finding something you need or can use.. I have two bloodied toons. One Commando, and one rifleman.. I don't have a bloodied weapon between the both of them because I've yet to find a bloodied rifle of any sorts.
---
Sure, it's a bum, but adrenal reaction and sneak pretty much wreck anything anyway.
---
The one thing that would make it easier is if enemies only dropped legendaries for your specific build, but I don't see how they could implement that in this game.
---
(Thinking of like D3, for instance, where you mainly only get usable drops for your class so it's easier to grind for it)
---
Since you can use anything in this game it just makes the pool larger.
---
I think they're pretty close to as good as they can make the RNG for legendaries. I know some people want to be able to use Modules to craft legendary versions of any weapons.. which would be cool, but it would remove like.. 95% of the RNG.. which I feel like Bethesda wouldn't want to do.
---
Says the dude who's last 3 days in posting were about people complaining or people getting banned or removed from sub for ignoring the rules. You seem to have an opinion on everything someone says or does. Ill continue to know what the fixer is and if you dont like it well tough. You can see your way out of the post if you have nothing factual to present backing your claims.
---
Same. Best i have is instigating pipe bolt action
---
Forgot what it's called but it's in Intelligence and reduces the rate weapons break
---
Wahhhhhhhhhh
---
I want duped weapons
---
Wahhhhhhhh
---
 i want skins on my duped weapons
---
Wahhhhh Mommy!
---
^  Thats you right now.  You are being a CRY BABY.   Just stop.
---
It wouldnt be that fast plus we have people with like 50 something agility and run faster than the game can load areas to put it simply it would be faster than speed demon with 10 agi
---
Point proven kiddo. I'm sorry adding a skin to a gun I already owned triggered full salt status off you.
---
Well, if you actually had a coherent argument, instead of simply pulling assumptions out of your ass, then I wouldn't need to be so clever.
---
I never once mentioned camping lv 6 players at train stations. In fact, I argued that the predictable spawn points was a reason Survival failed. So if you read my responses, and actually had input, it would be different. But no, right now you are literally the definition of blathering moron.
---
You got your answer.  
---
You just didnt like it. 
---
You are welcome to delete this post since at least now you know.
---
Thats not as bad as I thought tbh.
---
You get:
---
A survival tent, very useful when out and about and overweight from too much junk/items
---
1650 atoms (somewhere around that) that‚Äôs already more atoms than your money‚Äôs worth if you were to buy an atom bundle.
---
Private server that‚Äôs always there and ready for you and up to 7 friends
---
A free cosmetic every month
---
Scrap box, arguably the best thing along with a private server. Makes managing your inventory and stash easy
---
Weekly atomic shop sales exclusive to fallout 1st members
---
In the future, more rewards from seasons
---
All of that is worth way more than 13$ a month. You‚Äôre just complaining because you only use a few of the things it gives you. If you‚Äôre gonna be that picky then just don‚Äôt buy it
---
Would give a better use for the tame function *i just want to walk around the wastes with my deathclaw named rodrick*
---
Full salt.  
---
All I said was say the fixer IS a skin and you flew into a blind rage. 
---
GROW UP.
---
Sorry I forgot Kjammer1769 the all knowing Bethesda employee was roaming the subreddit tonight ü§£
---
Just record your clip using a third party software (make a record of the video) so it have less space size. Then attach it to the email that asks you for proof if you have any.
---
Every game needs a photo mode! Wish I could do close up shots on my console, the textures look like trash, but that‚Äôs what the series X is for!
---
You realize you are just making yourself look stupid right?
---
But please.  Do continue.
---
Fallout 4 is 210 years after the bombs, so unlikely.
---
- Blind Rage - is replying with that there is no visual difference between a fixer and a modded combat rifle? Damn id be worried how you actually present yourself off the sub.
---
Controller maybe eventually, but we‚Äôll see if I even bother to stick with PC, so far a lot of higher levels just trying to kill me. 
---
I already have a set up since I stream, so I didn‚Äôt switch to PC for any reason; it‚Äôs just already here.
---
How exactly are they suppose to know what you mean by simple emotes? Don't expect excellent "teamwork" from public teams that people are only using as xp buffs and free fast travel points
---
Will do. üëçüèª
---
I wish these pre-builts would at least snap to regular foundations.
---
This sub, or any platform LFG are pretty reliable.
---
You should list your platform, too.
---
Rusty pick next to basement terminal
---

ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°
---
Ur misc possibly
---
Any interior areas that are instanced like the Wayward you and your friend both need to do separately. You can still be grouped, but you each need to enter the buildings alone and complete the quests yourself.
---
Stop making so much sense haha üòÇ
---
Sounds like we might start seeing more bounty hunting then.
---
People can already unlock anything they want. They catch a bounty and then a bullet.
---
No. It‚Äôs easy.
---
You can pick locks right now in camps. 
---
It get you wanted flagged.   Unless they changed that I havent been trying.
---
Just put lvl 1 locks on stuff.  Lvl 3 is pointless.  What you think everyone dont have master picklock :)
---
It's under walls, all by itself.
---
I don‚Äôt have an answer but my guess would be it got broken and never fixed.
---
A lot of people have this gun but don't use it due to the restrictive costs of its ammo.
---
Too cool man. Hard to believe the photo editor did these!
---
They are there theres just so many are low lev and there camp wont show up on the map till then place and power a vender
---
Gotta be honest with you, I'm going to try this now anyway even knowing what will probably happen.
---
Talk about a meat-cute!
---
You'll still get a wanted level for breaking in. Nobody can steal anything of value except some small scrap from your robot or ammo machine, purified water. Honestly, locks on camps are bullshit. I only lock my purifier rooms door because I don't care to waste the mats locking the rest up.
---
Play with my brother almost every day... Took herd mentality, I can probably get him to take empath
---
Google "Skyrim horse glitch" and marvel at just how badly Bethesda handles mounts. 
---
No thank you.
---
You can disregard this response, got off topic and starting ranting haha.
---
To me it's about principle, not just an effective end solution. 
---
Bethesda stood as my number one, thought they where the best, oh how they have fallen...
---
Intentionally driving a hard hype train for a game they knew wasn't ready, false advertisements for various products,  countless bugs, money grabbing for a paid buggy game, taking away atoms for daily's when it was advertised as part of the product I purchased and spinning it as a good thing for players, etc. They have slapped the community in the face so many times, I love the game but cant help to resent their lack of genuine care.
---
Beyond their community relation employees they seem empty. I get its a business but somewhere along the way they lost something.
---
I would be my first friend. üòì
---
Team players.
---
People would complain more if lunch boxes were purchasable especially since atoms are harder to get now. They should just keep it as it is
---
Agree that criticals are not needed in a stealth commando.  If there were points you really wanted somewhere else, then reduce Adrenaline to 1*.  
---
You could experiment with converting to a stealth rifleman?  Crits could come in useful in big fights as a rifleman.  
---
I have the fireproof card, but use the Ironclad perk.  Would fireproof be the better option?
---
Well as soon as they pick the locks and steal your stuff, they could just hop onto either a private server or a server with a friend on it, have them kill the griefer and they'll continue to steal from other players. 
---
The question I'm asking is will they still have to pick the locks or with the perk, skip the lockpicking and just open anything and everything with the rank 4 card equipped?
---
Wow I did the whole Wastelanders questline, both sides and never even saw her lmao. I'll have to go there next time, thanks for telling me where! Now I hope she's related to the Bobrov Brothers in some way, an ancestor maybe?
---
Piece of shits end up crippling me every time.
---
Power Armor should have multiple mod slots per piece. The tosro should be able to have a jetpack or backpack and something like emergency protocols or Tesla coils.
---
I have a full set of unyielding SS armor. So with my DR and ER at above 350, anything after that is diminishing returns. So I run fireproof to basically be dang near close to invulnerable against SB sonic attacks
---
You have made my weekend!
---
Yea but someone has to kill the SBQ and it's probably not the people with 15 charisma haha. What they going to do? Talk her into landing?
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt know maybe
---
I have the terminals locked on my collectron and my ammo machine so people can't change what they're collecting but the storage is unlocked on everything else so people can help themselves.
---
Heavy weapons fuy
---
I think it‚Äôs weird that she has the red hair and goggles like Ed. I found the welding goggles when I met her.  It to mention that Paige is literally Jet. I love it honestly. It gave me chills when I met Ra Ra like ‚Äúhey....this is not a coincidence‚Äù.
---
I dont think its called a toupee but your talking the fake hair thing right
---
I'm the best friend I could have LOL
---
Support has gone home. 
---
Not even the phone jockeys work these hours.  
---
I read the first post but didnt reply since I figured someone else would:
---
Strip naked and unequip all perks. Relog. Then re add perks and then gear.  Of that dont work nothing will.   
---
*also are you 100% sure you didnt pick up like 10,000 2mm or shotgun etc rounds.      If you were crafting a bunch of weapons it also adds ammo too.
---
True but it's another catch up mechanic like buying the legendary track tiles.  
---
This time it's more about playing and leveling rather than outright buying.
---
  
---
If i'm not mistaken the exp bonus stacks 4 times.
---
Yeah, im going to grind some levels on my melee character to respec for two hand melee.  Should be fun
---
I place level 3 locks because low levels sometimes lockpick a camp without being aware of the bounty following.
---
At level 3 i know it is deliberate
---
I won't take your resources if they're locked. But you bet your butt if your door is locked I'm making my way inside
---
I have seen way too many charred ghouls tank absurd amounts of damage. I think they're broken because no matter how high my level is they have almost boss levels of health.
---
Nope. I have bandolier perk so ammo weighs next to nothing. I'll try that out though. Thx.

Haha I live close to grafton IRL and I use a spot sometimes that is pretty much at the same spot that I live
---
Not toss.. yeet
---
I like to parosg up in your mom's pad.
---
Hope you like empty rooms fecker, I ain't you damn pit-stop and that definitely sounds like a griefers reply 
---
Edit: definitely something a griefer would say, if it's locked then stay out of it. It's not your damn business to snoop around if they have it locked for a reason
---
Backpack?
---
You don‚Äôt have to be close at all, I do my own thing on a building team and my stats are still boosted, you just have to be on a team. I also tested it when I was the only one on the team and I still got the bonus
---
I carry a lever gun and a handmade and use each situationally. Most of the time I stick with the lever gun because it can 1 shot nearly everything, especially during events like Radiation Rumble it's very handy for picking off the ghouls before they can even reach the NPCs. For most world mobs the handmade can 1 shot with a torso shot from stealth and is much better when you get swarmed because of the faster fire rate and magazine size. I suggest going with the best armor piercing magazine despite the appeal of the higher capacity ones.
---
I should also mention that my handmade is not automatic so the same perks are used for it and the lever gun.
---
2mm is energy ammo.  Bandoler dont count for energy ammo.   But its just something to eliminate.
---
Hope this gets added in a mod for private servers
---
Not really. I don't do anything, I just want to see what's so important to keep locked away. I like to see others camps to get inspiration for my own and don't understand the point in locking up your camp
---
Edit, what possible reason could you have for locking your camp? I can take anything. Can't move anything. You spent time building it. I don't know why you wouldn't want people ot see it and admire it
---
Ya I have batteries includes for energy ammo. Mainly for fuel ammo. Hopefully this will be like a hard reset of my account. I'm going to hard reset my console too just to make sure.
---
Wanted stays until you are killed and server hopping dont get rid of it. 
---
Its why most people when wanted just go to 76 and await their fate.
---
Dying too much? Just don‚Äôt do that.
---
 Not on my end
---
Ya I have one. It's for chem reduction
---
It changes nothing from the current game.  Not a single thing in the scenario you propose.
---
Also look at gunpowder and items under MISC. Some items there are heavy. Craft tons of ammo if you use Bandolier
---
Along with this, I would fucking kill for them to let us build the half and quarter floors on top of the grate flooring on the 2x1 staircases. This was possible in the beta and even now, almost 2 years later, I'm still pissed it isn't possible anymore. I built a half bath for my bedroom in my pre-war house build last night using the half room technique and I had to cover the floor in rugs because it's on top of my staircase. Those rugs are taking up 6 extra slots in my maxed out budget and they look like shit, but the alternative is people being able to look straight up into the bathroom because for whatever reason we just aren't allowed to have decent fucking interior stairs.
---
Aye, Eltons John's rug. Cheers!
---
Thank you üëç
---
Try going to the atomic shop and seeing if you can reequip each emote from there
---
What are the chances to get a Chameleon, Speed comic that punches that fucking fast that it can kill 3 people in seconds?

I don¬¥t have a problem with dying by someone beating me with meele. What i do have a problem with is cheaters fucking the game. I don¬¥t care if you believe me or if you just think i¬¥m salty. Either way Have a nice day.

Nice. Make it so people get screwed out of their SCORE and then let them spend money to get to where they should be LOL.
---
Forgive me for not knowing, but can you craft (for example) a TSE fixer?
---
I have been doing the same, but my console corrupted multiple times and I lost everything.
---
After taking a look at the preview images, I disagree - the ghille skins for these items leave chunks of armor unexposed, and do not change the outline significantly from the original versions of the armors. Wood leaves a chunk of the original visible, as does marine, and scout has the gap for the crouch plate.
---
You mean "Everyone shares Strange in Numbers" :D
---
I butt hurt someone else in another post so hard that they came and downvoted me answering your question best I could when no one else did.  
---
Some people are just hateful lol.
---
If you put all your supplies thats used for ammo on the ground and go to a bench and tag what items you need to make ammo and leave there all the time you'll naturally only pick those items while out and about and before you know you'll have hundreds of ammo for each gun or if making a specific type of ammo youll have plenty
---
Had a similar situation where there were three people under level 5 inside the house at my camp, and one level 270 out front at the vending machine. I build them each a set of armor, handful of weapons, and ammo to match. I start giving the gift emote and dropping stuff. 
---
The level 270 sprints in, insta-grabs all the stuff, goes over to my workbenches, then gets on the mic and said "I don't know why you dropped that crap, but I just scrapped it. Thanks for the materials." Then fast travels away. In disbelief, I start crafting more but the lowbies leave, unarmored and probably wondering why I was taunting them with "fake" gifts.
---
Crit builds are only useful if you can reach the 33 luck threshold which is what is needed to fill the meter in one shot with 3/3 crit savvy.
---
Reaching this cap can be quite difficult. You need +15 from SPECIAL, +15 from unyielding arnor and then +3 from Herd Mentality mutation with the Strange in Numbers perk card.
---
If you are not running this setup, it's not worth doing a luck crit build imo.
---
For example, if you opt to use a piece of chameleon armor, you will lose 3 luck from unyielding. At this point reaching the cap becomes slightly more problematic. One solution is to wear a shielded vault suit (+2) and even then one piece of your armor must have +1 luck. 
---
With all that being said, you are probably better off just dropping as much luck as you can in favor of int now that the season is here and EXP boosts are actually useful.
---
You won't notice it in the damage numbers
---
It's a glitch you can't do it normally
---
I've found it's super easy to craft ammo late game so use what you have because you'll eventually get t ok a point where you focus on a build and will only have 2-3 weapons that you use. As for modifying weapons and armor it is in your best interest to do so since as you progress things get stronger based on area and can easily take you out if your not careful. Also build your camp on an acid deposit now and stock pile the stuff. Its needed for crafting ammo and is one of the trickier resources to get.
---
Only good thing about that is when your corpse shoots 50 feet in the air and rag-dolls around as it hits the roof on the way back.
---
Right? And this also allows for all sorts of fun camp items like a buffet station, a fully stocked picnic table, etc. etc. I feel like they just have to write a script to cause an activator to spawn for a certain amount of time, too. This should not be difficult within the engine.
---
I still haven‚Äôt seen this thing. Whenever someone nukes the queen after the event I run around the sundew grove because I heard it will usually spawn there. No luck so far
---
Good idea! I'll try that now.
---
Haha I usually go for something else since that's a common one. No one shares bodyguards so I often do that. You can also share travel agent. Run speed I think isn't that good because I don't think it stacks with adrenal reaction and most people have that.
---
Also don't forget power, should be able to attach an outside wire to the unit and and inside node to wire to devices. Just look at the seedy shed, it clearly has power, conduit/wire hookup on the outside.

 Bethesda : "mOsT dEMandED itEM"
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Berry_Mentats_(Fallout_76)
---
Um hell no
---
Pay money to level up faster is classic p2w. Get out of here.
---
Buy the Raider Collectron..? It's only 500 Atoms
---
I've been Server jumping modus for over an hour the only thing he ever has is serum recipes
---
People really shouldn't be supporting these business practices by buying it. You do know that it is literally the exact same outfit from Fallout 4 right? Made 6 years ago. They did nothing new to it. It is quite literally just dragged and dropped into the game.
---
When you reach the end game, you will have more caps than you can spend, and you can always farm the materials you need. Your ammo supply today - and the mods on your weapons - are almost entirely irrelevant to that equation.
---
You can outfit yourself to the best ability now, and it is unlikely to hurt you later.
---
1) Email Bethesda and say 'I am using explots in Fallout76'
---
2) ??
---
3) wait to be banned.
---
So that worked for most but I'm still missing thumbs up and thumbs down emotes because they aren't in the atom shop from what I can tell :(
---
Oh and also don't forget, their size should match the camps base shapes and be x squares wide by y squares long.
---
Nice try.  Like I want everyone building in my spot.
---
We‚Äôll take what we want and you‚Äôll deal with it you farmer. Raiders don‚Äôt care about your whining and complaining.
---
How many plans and mods you holding?
---
üòÜ
---
It took me at least 50-75 nukes to find it
---
Junkies Build
---
Keep in mind, yes server hopping increases the chances of finding said item but there is still a limited number of active servers per platform and the inventory only changes ever so often per vendor. I think it is currently 20-24 hours?
---
lol well i hope they do so it serves meee
---
Bounty trap boxes are my next CAMP idea. Get a bounty, hide in camp full of traps, and hassle your attackers in a game show host voice.
---
Let's be real here....nobody sells legit legacy weapons nowadays,
---
Totally a Bethesda employee here, I'll relay this to the team and a broken skin of both the m1 garand and 1911 will be add to the ATX shop soon.
---
Damn that's a shame.
---
Or save them until the next exclusive NW event. You can get the items you want without playing. Unless you want to benefit on the current Xmas items being available.
---
Haha yeah there's that too
---
I'll give that a try once my game loads back up. I hard reset my account and console.
---
Agreed - this game engine just doesn't do certain things.....
---
I got fallout first but haven't bought anything else
---
You don't exactly get anything better from leveling up, i mean they will let you buy legendary run game tiles.
---
You could maybe make an argument for legendary perks but that system isn't even in yet.
---
Christ for $150 i would have down you a door in Photoshop if thats all it takes.
---
Weird. May need to contact support, the thumbs up and down most definitely show up in the atom shop for me. What an odd bug.
---
Noice.
---
Ehh not too many I don't think. I have 3 mods and all the plans I pick up I have in my stash.
---
Im planning on selling the mods.
---
I tend to agree, 30% EXP boost from the 15 int is too good now that experience is actually important.
---
Before no one cared because level was just a meaningless number next to your name, but now that rewards are tied to EXP gain it's quite an extreme advantage.
---
Another thing people tend to ugnore in regards to these builds is ammo efficiency. If you can kill an enemy in one shot instead of two, you effectively consume half the ammo, meaning half the farming, crafting etc.
---
Have you tried not cheating?
---
I'm Bloodied Build
---
Take my poor man‚Äôs award üèÖ
---
Ignorance is no excuse in the eyes of the law. 
---
Best you learn this in a video game and not real life. 
---
Besides be honest you know it was duped.   My advise is junk it asap and pray the ban hammer misses you.  If it dont at least you can say I deleted the illicit goods.
---
Level 79, 150 hours. Ive gotten 3 pies, one of them on the first try
---
kill people
---
Nice, are we even playing the same game? It looks beautiful!
---
Win what exactly?
---
Give me an example
---
i‚Äôll be home soon so will login
---
I mean, that's not untrue. But if you get a faster swing speed deathclaw gauntlet, use marsupial and bird bones, you can get in and out really fast and jump around like a maniac to avoid hits, it's crazy but do-able
---
Neat
---
Alright all fixed now, I checked the atom shop again and the thumbs up and down emote were already equipped and when I opened up my emote wheel they were there! Thank you for the help!
---
That's fair
---
oh and previous ps4 player as well,? you‚Äôll enjoy pc layout better
---
Look at it from Bethesda's point of view.  If they were to notify people that dupes were about to be removed, everyone and I mean literally everyone, would say the same thing you are.  Regardless of it being true or not.
---
Can i ask where you read that it deals more damage to scorched? Because my ultracite gatling laser deals the same damage to ghouls, scorched and everything else.
---
If i where to mod my ultracite gstling laser with a prime receiver so it uses ultracite cores than it would deal extra damage to scorched.
---
I want to say:  no because the fixer is a unique combat rifle with its own skin. 
---
But last time I tried that buddy flew into a blind rage.  People are very sensitive lol.
---
Agility doesn't affect speed.
---
I was being humourous.  I have no idea ;)
---
It got scrapped while you were crafting.
---
Only if I can ride into an event on the shoulders of a feral ghoul. Release the crackhead!
---
They can do quests with you. I've co-op'ed three characters well above level 50.
---
The new Wastelanders quests can only be started by the quest owner, but you can enter their instances and earn loot, xp and overhear conversations. Likewise if you want to complete your quest with different outcomes.
---
Every other quest in the game can be completed side by side with partners.
---
2018: bethesda better not add pay to win in atom shop
---
2020: Let us buy lunch boxes.
---
But now I can be just as annoying as she was.
---
It might just be a visual bug. I lost 1000 atoms before for some reason in the UI and now they are back again.
---
Probably could have saved $50 if you just waited to the last week. Unless you have no time to play the rest of the season. But congrats on you're secret door!
---
They didn't say they fixed it completely yet, they just added code to track it when it happens and a small bandaid. 
---
Currently I have 0/8 dailies complete and I'm trying to figure out where my 9th is
---
Personally speaking, I fucking hate that term and will not use it
---
150 bucks
---
for mediocre cosmetics
---
I don't know man, you could be the richest man in Appalachia for that kind of money. you'd be eating B2525 Fixers for breakfast.
---
You can put them on display so you don‚Äôt accidentally scrap them while crafting.
---
Try doing a clean reinstall. If that still doesn't work you might have to contact support.
---
It's right for them to deal with dups anyway they see fit. Blame the dupers not the company. Besides, caps are very easy to get in game so you should be back to where you were before the purchase in no time. Cheers
---
Wow I guess unequipping everything and stripping solved it. Finally back down to 230.
---
Very much appreciated for the help. The pepperoni roll is still active,so hopefully when it expires. Nothing will happen to my weight. If it does I'll just try that again.
---
Are you on xb1 by chance? If so I'd like to give you free radaway or something else you might need as a way to say thanks.
---
Do other games have problems? If so it could be your hard drive. Otherwise, try uninstalling both Fallout 76 and the Bethesda launcher then reinstalling. If that doesn't helo then try renaming the Fallout 76 folder within your Documents/My Games directory so that the config files regenerate.
---
Experiment a little.  I don't have a typical bloodied build, but I have many more points in luck because I want Class Freak, starched jeans and senderpity all at max level.  I also have upped Charisma and Intelligence points with public teams now available to benefit from extra xp.   At level 51, you could benefit from the extra xp to level up faster to gain more options on cards.
---
Glad it worked.  I am on xbox but need not.  I have 4 toons full of stuff.
---
I‚Äôd say pass it on to the makers of the game, but since it‚Äôs been over a year and they‚Äôve done nothing about this kind of crap, I‚Äôm not sure what to do!
---
Oh gee, I thought that was at one of the Raider train stations! Is it targeting the Order of Mysteries?
---
It's best to do it legit and when the season is almost over you buy the ranks.
---
Might as well gotten a real door for your real house. Im sure the price wouldnt have been that different.
---
Would you rather they remove the weapon in question, or the account in question? Quite frankly, be grateful they took so little, and move on with what you still have.
---
I want vertical half walls too. I realized how much I wanted them when my house bugged and wouldn't let me remove the half floor platform thingys I put on the side nomatter what and I couldn't close walls around it.
---
I ended up moving the camp after removing everything else still didn't work just to see the full extent of the bug. Would be pretty cool if they fixed that.
---
Ah alright. Cool cool. Take it ez.
---
I hear that there's lots of room for 'aggressive expansion'
---
meh, you can still get them ingame
---
Both these guns are in new vegas already so it‚Äôd be cool to see them ported over
---
There‚Äôs people who‚Äôve already finished it?
---
Truth be told I bought it with 6 Xbox gift cards, and I didn‚Äôt remember that the highest tier for atoms was $40 for 5000, so I bought some extra atoms and kept like $14~$15.  And with the extra atom shop purchases it kinda equaled out
---
Yeah actually that is a good distinction thanks.
---
$
---
The Chinese stealth armor is fucking ugly compared to the one modders made for f4
---
That door is the single most beautiful camp item there is. do not besmirch it‚Äôs good name
---
Didn‚Äôt realize you could pay for ranks already
---
They have been working on vault 51, they changed the vault door since the last update. I have a camp there.
---
No problem, glad its sorted.
---
They made it invit only?
---
No.  Its time for bed.   
---
Besides I thought it does show as offline in social menu.    I know a couple youtubers on xbox who are always offline because if not they get messaged all day long.   You can still message them but you dont know if they read it.
---
Is it on or are you in PA
---
I noticed the opposite.  I'm always finding junk that I never put in my stash.
---
so the 2 friends nuked queen.. didnt quite kill it because its so bad now. I guess the server was done for anyway.
---
So I'm assuming you're having zero issues with the Adrenaline perk/VATs.
---
Stairs are so volatile in general, I ended up swearing to never use stairs to build a house again till they fix them. They got snapping issues, bugs that make them and other objects unscrappable, clipping railings on the atom store ones that don't let you set doors or things on walls and all kindsa crap. I now use haystacks instead if I need stairs. -.-
---
Ghouls mainly aim for legs and lag will always be a thing
---
Yeah, but doing that requires playing the game regularly, and I hadn‚Äôt touched the game for 2 months before seasons and I probably won‚Äôt until the next major update, soooooo... no?
---
I can see the next season having more ranks and it being impossible to finish without paying thanks to people like you.
---
I would NEVER do that! I hate that guy!
---
As far as I know there are only upto 3 star legendarys in the game for now.
---
Radiation can penetrate many things.
---
But yea. Its annoying.
---
I managed to solve everything. I pretty much hard reset my account and my console. Logged back in and requipped everything. Hopefully this pepperoni roll I ate doesn't affect anything when it expires
---
No.  But a legendary fixer with Prime reciever has 5 effects.   
---
We all just think thats for future use.  No one really knows except Beth as they aint saying.
---
caps/gold/scrips
---
still dont know the stats of PA so might be that as well.
---
Blocker and dodgy are good specifically for melee bloodied, along with the other bloodied perks like serendipity, radicool and nerd rage
---
Pretty sure those are stored on whatever device you played.    Just copy the game data.   Its not like they were ever uploaded anywhere.
---
Yeah right.
---
Obviously it‚Äôs your money, but I feel like you shoulda just waited until the end before you paid anything.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the modus vendor that sells the serums is not the same one that sells the berry mentats recipes. The one you want is in the medical section not the science section.
---
so get this its acting so messed up right now it thinks the friends server is my server.. my servers nuked..
---
He's so freaking adorable.  I got mine today (Friday)
---
I miss cement walls and everything else cement related. They had some unique mechanics that let you skip annoying flaws/restrictions in the building system, just like the floors can.
---
Shit really I thought it was the same thing. I'm a little dumb
---
Thanks for giving advice though. Very much appreciated üëç
---
No.  Every player gets the same amount. 
---
So its fair.   Holy I cant believe I have to explain this. 
---
I've been looking myself. I've found plenty of spots where water goes downhill but have yet to find and actual waterfall.
---
Press and hold the holster button, frees me every time.
---
A farmable event would work like repair kits, they are pay to win by your standards.
---
By the next time I pick up that game for more than 3 minutes we will be in season 2 where I will spend another $150

Sheesh I'm only 36 üò≥
---
You know they are shrimp right
---
I just unlocked it, and am 80% sure the answer is no
---
Meh should be permanent.  
---
But if they wipe all items and account level then its no diff then buying a new copy I guess.
---
No, it isn‚Äôt.  You can‚Äôt expect players to ‚Äúknow‚Äù what is and isn‚Äôt duped, moreso when these things are dropping in value BECAUSE of the dupe!  Legacies have been duped for over a year now, why wasn‚Äôt this action taken back then?  If Bethesda is finally doing something about duped, they need to be going way back.  Not that I think they are, this kind of investigation takes work.  It‚Äôs likely left to coding checks, and we know what masters of coding they are...
---
Disclaimer:  I have not been banned, nor have I had any weapons taken from me.
---
Todd howard says  N O
---
Agreed, 100%.
---
In addition, I wish these structures had more than one entrance.
---
The train car‚Äôs useless to me because I hate that it‚Äôs a long dead end.
---
I‚Äôd love to use it as a hallway/joining element.
---
I wish the walls of these pieces had fluid ‚Äòsnap points‚Äô for entrances that fit our design needs.
---
Echoing the idea that specs should match up to the palette of our C.A.M.P. Elements, I feel like incorporating some of these pieces is akin to working a Duplo element into a Lego System design.
---
.... no fog?
---
Oh, there's definitely fog. Maybe not all that common, but there's definitely fog.
---
46.
---
No!  They are Rock Lobsters

https://youtu.be/pQO-sbIzyxU
---
Maybe the plasma caster? I don't think I remember many people asking for the classic gauss pistol, or the fairly uncommon gauss minigun. They responded to gun feedback at one point regarding the lever-action rifle.  It previously had that awful reload animation from Far Harbor where you'd insert the same amount of bullets into the magazine no matter what was currently already loaded into your weapon, but people complained and eventually they made it reload individually like the pump-action does.
---
I'm going to assume the Plasma Caster more because there has been more of a move to cater to things prevalent in New Vegas than other games, because Fallout 1st has the Ranger armor skin (personally mixed on this one since I don't like Fallout 1st), and I believe they added a skin for the handmade rifle that resembles the service rifle, along with one that resembles a Chines Assault Rifle, which was from Fallout 3 and has been strangely absent from that point on. Both are pretty damn stupid since obviously people would have much rather had a weapon, and now you guarantee we probably will never be getting a Service Rifle or a Chinese Assault Rifle.
---
No fog? There is SO much fog that you can hear the Settlers bitching about it. You must just be lucky or have not explored a good chunk of the map.
---
Yea you did deserve it get banned
---
What does account level mean?  One has character levels, and that has little to do with duped items.
---
Thanks. I'll give that a try next time.
---
No, that commenter misunderstood your question. There is a GoogleDocs spreadsheet  posted that answers your question perfectly - have a search. The correct answer for TODAY is 41.
---
Yes, every 5 levels even beyond 50 gives you perk packs.
---
Yep, I am solo and now have a build and mutation that has locked me into being on a team, but I still run solo.  If I really want to run solo in a private world, I can use my alternate account to team with.  Funny thing is I use to run in the private world all the time before public teams, but now I want to be on a 4 person team to benefit.  I don't know if I am running as a teammate that the developer intended, but I really like this addition to the game.
---
Oh dam might have to buy some ranks then
---
step 4 profit?
---
Yooooo you‚Äôre so bad ass!
---
Hold the reload button.
---
31 and I play a lot, which means some people are reeeeaaally putting some time and energy into the game.
---
The GECK from vault 94 was destroyed and it cause a thick fog that created the mire.
---
Fog in the right region at the right time of day looks really nice and eerie in this game.
---
It baffles me that this isn't the case, but I'm never surprised by Beth anymore.
---
Sarcasm at its finest
---
Yeah same, although I missed the first week
---
It's on the counter in the souvenir shop/museum.

Dang whenever someone requests random trades I offer that.

No one has take it yet though.

Why I switched back to junkies...I hated getting one shotted.

I'm hoping Fractured Steel adds some west coast weapons, like a 1911 in 9mm or .45, or like you said, the M1

I have this bug on one of my characters, it's the misc item osmosis kit that I picked up off the ground.

Welp if hodd toward said no then I guess its a no üò≠

Omg are you the hero we all need or deserve?

I get that! Lol
---
Could you imagine being the guy that has to write down a list of Betheadas bugs.  
---
Your grandkids would have to finish it.   That is a multi generational task.
---
The funny part is that you say there are TOO MANY perks, but the majority of reddit says there's NOT ENOUGH to make them want to sign up for more than 1 month.
---
Right?! I was just so damned surprised someone bought it. Maybe it was a generous tip or something for my camo design? Lol
---
You could use Reshade and make a preset that inverts those Colors into more friendly ones that you can see, and toggle that Reshade on and off when you‚Äôre using building mode :-)
---
I've never used adrenaline and VATS has always been fine aside from the times it just misses for no reason.
---
Na people buy stupod crap when almost max caps and they have stuff on vendor. 
---
I literally go to vendors and just buy plans i dont care what price or plan is.  Long as it dont say known.  
---
That actually might have been what happened here and dude was in a real rush to get to that queen fight that spawned.

You have to pay in organs

I think I was around level 20 and had taken Hemlock Holes. Then it was attacked by Anglers and I was utterly boned. Then a level 240+ comes in, kills me in an Instant and takes the workshop. I come back for vengeance to be mowed down again. Then I give up and carry onto Wavy Willard's with my tail between my legs. 
---
2 mins later, Mr. 240+ comes to me and starts talking on his mic, asking what I was doing and if he could help, apologizing for killing me and taking Hemlock because he needed the acid. All I could do was emote but I love you managed to communicate okay.  Long story short the guy took me all over the Savage divide and The Mire showing me some cool shit and useful stuff along the way. Gave me my first legendary weapon too. Instigating pipe rifle which was really helpful at the time. 
---
Was just nice to have someone show me the ropes. Even if he did kill me twice üòÇ I'm level 125 or there Abouts now and try to do the same for lower levels
---
I offer 1 kidney.
---
This map was tracking movements of the scorched before Morgantown ultimately fell to the scorched as well.
---
Yup, you've managed to identify that it's from the previous game. Some players like using assets from Fallout 4
---
bro i‚Äôm sorry to be the one to say this now but after tier fifty it takes like twice as much score to tier up so you would have been better off waiting
---
Sorry but your gonna need more after all he cant make his money couch out of 20 dollar bills.
---
i don‚Äôt blame you zorbo is a pompous fuck

both legendary run and level on all characters were set to level 1

Sounds like a rewarding hobby.

Well hello 'yeaterday' how are ya?
---
40 and I just hope I can reach the Captain Cosmos PA before its over
---
I detest the ghouls in this game. Early on they weren't bad, could have a whole pack on them in just power armor with All Rise. Slowly over time they've become more and more over powered. Little fuckers apparently have the magical ability to stand directly in the center of my hit hot, literally right inside my character, while hitting me with their, apparently, depleted uranium fists. Other melee mobs do this too, it's really fucking annoying, but Ghouls are the most egregious offenders.
---
what about items they only take the duped ones or? story progress reset ? how extensive was this
---
i just got the ufo play garden lmao
---
Ah, makes sense - thank you!
---
I know you will hate this but .....
---
If I were you id toss the account and use a new one anyway.   Sounds like that account has a huge red flag hanging over it.    Not worth it IMO.
---
As a middle ground, I'd be thrilled if we could dry/powder/preserve/whatever the wild plants so when I DO stumble across the stuff needed for meds, I can grab it instead of having to detour all over the place. Just make the preserved version less potent so you need to use more of them in the recipe.
---
how did the math change there since now we have like 7-9 daily events till 20th and last week score are doubled or something like that
---
You are going to actually play again? Even after they wiped your account?
---
Some people just wanna watch the world burn
---
I have 9 CHA in my non-bloodied [heavy gunner build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=c32988e&amp;d=sq2s32sr2pe2s22ek1c52ck0cr0cu2ic4ip2a04a12l71lu2lt2l22ls2&amp;w=lg2c72c62). The cards I usually run solo with are chosen, with a couple alternates shown, aside from the usual locks/hacks/crafts/gathering swaps.
---
apparently last week of score you can earn double or something like that and 50 from any kind of events

Nearly 40, and I skipped anything NW and at least a couple of days.
---
items will disappear and and reappear in my inventory constantly to the point where i know for a fact i‚Äôm not mistaken. it‚Äôs like casper the ghost just borrows my power armor and legendary weapons.
---
You‚Äôre welcome
---
I mean i met a guy with race car beds and when i asked why he said "I do the sexes quick." and that is possibly the best response i could ever ask for
---
yep this happens a lot now, have had this at free range many times and today alone i was the only one playing an instrument at one violent night, as soon as nightstalker is coming they rush outside and instakill, knew it would happen as the last dozen times at least this is what has happened. Then at project paradise same thing, sheepsquatch comes in the corner and gets killed in five seconds as i turn round to look at it, no one else had any time to react. Its just not on in a social public game.
---
Have you tried popping a few radshield?
---
I‚Äôll still get my door and the next season rewards for free though hahaha
---
I had the best Rad Rumble I've ever experienced last night. Usually I focus solely on collecting ore, but there was about 3 other people collecting with me and 2 or 3 more focusing on protecting the NPCs, so I focused on healing them with Friendly Fire and then gathering ore once they were fully healed &amp; the ghouls were under control. We hit level 4 with several minutes still on the clock.
---
This. I know that INT increases XP gains in the single-player games, but it isn't stated this time in the description for 76. Good to know.
---
Is this on pc?
---
lol: do you want to say No because you have the experience and knowledge required to answer this question and are being coy, or do you want to say No because you don't have the answer beyond a need to express your opinion?
---
If only there were some way to check to bump that number to 100% :-/
---
I use ‚ÄúYour the dumbass‚Äù (sic) note now.
---
He's been at it all night. I've seen him in 6 matches so far. When I see his name in the kill feed, I leave the match. Gives me time to get in a match without him.
---
That thing has the worst farts üò≠
---
Always laugh when I see those on a vendor for 20k caps.
---
I play with a controller most of the time too. Same for the vast majority of my gaming time, pc included. Fallout 4/76 are actually pretty great with the inclusion of vats. I've gotten better aiming with the analog sticks too though. Honestly a lot of the controls feel like the games were kind of made with a focus on the gamepad.
---
I've started experimenting with a ds4 and steam controller. Unfortunately fo76 doesn't let you use gamepad + mouse so some of the nicer configuration options with the sc trackoad and gyro don't work out of the box
---
I ain‚Äôt online, but it‚Äôs at 90%
---
Check" Walls".üòâ
---
There's a decon shower right next to the ore dump. I always put on my Excavator, clear out one of the 4 sections for all of its ore, dump it in the receptacle then hit the showers. Even if the event ends (which turns off that shower), there's another button activated shower close to the interior entrance. Anyone who farmed mutations in the old days knows exactly where it is.
---
A do not disturb option that hides you on the social menu would be nice. I‚Äôm usually happy to be social, but sometimes I just want a quiet session to myself.
---
They've been assholes since day 1. Reminder your first mission with them is the BoS sending you to an irradiated hellhole fully expecting your Wastelander idiot self to die. You not only coming back but with logs from a team that died there convinces them to do a 180.
---
At least your flair is accurate
---
It was a 2-part question, to which Barbarian7 gave his answer to the first question.  The OP mistook that as the answer to the second question.
---
91 üòÅ
---
Mutation serums
---
But they are expensive
---
Settlers called it long pork.
---
Well I‚Äôve got some catching up to do I‚Äôm only lvl 39 üòï
---
So ? Don‚Äôt buy it if you don‚Äôt like I get what you‚Äôre saying but it‚Äôs our money
---
You should be able to find them for 300-600 caps from player vendors.
---
It will come at some point it was leaked a long time ago same as this
---
yep, just put zeros in, that's what i did when i requested a refund on this item a while back and it worked fine.
---
There isn't any other way to get the exact ones you want unless your rng on rad mutations is godlike. Serums are only worth bout 250. Just wait till someone posts bout selling cheap serums.
---
Grocers is always "dah wey"
---
Brahmin Milk is required to use it as a good way to balance rads enough to be at Nerd Rage but not too low where you die asap.
---
Yeah, I don‚Äôt get it. If you play the game even somewhat regularly, you‚Äôre going to at least get close to completion. If you don‚Äôt, then I don‚Äôt understand why you would pay for items that only exist in a game you don‚Äôt play regularly. 
---
To each their own though, we all have something stupid we waste money on.
---
Depends on your settings a lot of outfits and armor get fucked on certain settings
---
Yeah litterally 1 in 10 comments this morning has been bout buying ranks.
---
Yup, i got confused for a moment there! lol I swear that i read prime somewhere but it was just my stupidity. Sorry about that!
---
Is it just me or do you think you should be able to use legendary modules in any weapon to be able to get it up to that or is that to easy
---
It depends on your settings it happens with some armors and outfits it‚Äôs fine on my end
---
Mostly I wanted to avoid a shithead response like this. 
---
Buy hey I am a sucker for punishment.
---
I have everything in ultra and sadly it doesn't look good enough on my end
---
With carnivore you can still use the cranberry relish but you don't get the 2x bonus. You also can use the stew for 10%.
---
I'm not very original with the ingame names, as far as I'm aware the only time they are used are when you become a pylon in the encrypted event. 
---
So my mule is called Francis, of course.
---
i made it half way (50) with challenges and after that just bought with atoms i had 2k saved up though.
---
Like a said he could have XP Grinded the Shit out of the Game. Its possible, but since a lot of people abused the XP Glitches back in the Day it could also be possible aswell. Oh well.
---
Go to bed. It still shows you as online in the social menu.
---
That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm asking.
---
Do you have fallout1st?
---
Go to a private world and put the stuff into a WORLD container. Such as a golf bag or sack.  Do NOT drop on ground.  
---
Log other character in and pick it up.   Your private world persists for a few mins while logged out.   Technically this works in public too but I dont recommend that.
---
Teddy bear display, I'm tarded
---
I wish I had some CAMP talent well done sir
---
They won't add it because no one would use it, scrap is important
---
Hit X on the board. It says so at the bottom with the rest of the controls
---
The game's tick rate is 20. Saves Bethesda a lot of money, and makes the game feel like wading through soup.
---
I wish I had Fallout 1st but unfortunately I don‚Äôt
---
The first time they went missing they were on display.
---
Chemist or grocer depending on build.   
---
I use chemist backpack and swap in Barbarian outside PA and Trav Pharmacy instead of Barbarian in PA.     Synergies well.
---
Most likely you will, we are just at week 2-3 of the 10 weeks of it
---
Today I killed him by accident. I was at Torrance Manor, inside the maze, and of course there are a lot of protectrons inside, so I was killing all the bots and one of them keep chasing me withouth firing and... it was the Insult Bot. First time I've killed him, I felt kinda sad.
---
I have Fallout 1st, I drop stuff to transfer over all the time, I have yet to have any issues doing it this way.
---
All of the white buckets, too. 1 plastic and 1 steel iirc. There aren't as many enameled buckets as there are surgical trays, but there's still a decent amount.
---
I mean... You could avoid it by having an answer to the question? Your answer wasn't really a "shithead response", it was just a little entitled. It's nice that you're getting your kink for " punishment" on though, I guess :-/
---
Getting all the way would be nice but I would just be happy with that PA skin, especially since I started a 2nd Heavy/PA focused character the other day
---
Calm down it's just A mistake.
---
Mine just showed up after you commented right when I asked the question I did not have the Rank Up option
---
I don‚Äôt have Fallout 1st though
---
Scrap/ store whatever it was sitting on and it should show up in your srored tab.  My camp eats turrets every once and a while too...
---
There isn't a tradable plan for that booze. You need to learn it directly from Biv. You unfortunately have to learn it directly from him...which means doing his dailies until he asks for a challenge with it. There are a couple other beverages that are like this as well.
---
WTS turret.  Only slightly used.
---
Radaway usually clears only one random mutation. If you're stacking mutations the complicated way, using radaway might help.
---
Ok thank you I was wondering
---
If they know it was duped, then yes, it‚Äôs fine. A big piece of the responsibility for duping lies with players who knowingly buy duped items‚Äîeither for in game currency or cash in many cases. If the buyers have to fear that their item will vanish, they‚Äôll think twice about buying things they suspect are duped instead of pretending they have no idea. Sellers will need to assure buyers of an item‚Äôs legitimacy, which will be really hard to do, but it should create a more skeptical market.
---
Its the same as my reddit name.
---
Xbox?
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
Better criticals. Crit Savy and four leaf clover. 
---
Remember sneak attacks are not criticals though but you want both.
---
I cry.
---
I‚Äôve noticed my ultracite PA goes missing occasionally too, but it always seems to come back.
---
Yeah
---
Sadlyvthey do disappear even on display cases. Someone pointed out the other day that putting items in your vendor locks it in your stash (Make sure to use a really high price so one really buys it)
---
no invites received
---
And if there is a door then let me snap stairs to them! Or at least give us the mirrored version where the door is opposite
---
I was talking about the ultracite in particular also
---
Add me gt oaktooth69 I bought the initiate plans from a player vendor a while back. I'll give it to ya. Just shoot me a message when you see me online
---
Sneak and Covert Operative are musts.
---
The shit monster from Dogma lol
---
Good to know. Thanks!
---
I duped like a mofo and didn't get banned, so I'm not sure how they are tracking who to ban or what specifically they're looking at. Whatever they're doing, it's gotta have some pretty big blind spots.
---
That‚Äôs a handy resource. Thanks for sharing!
---
If you actually go in game and try to go in a private world or on the main menu just press the key for "more info" about Fallout 1st, you'll eventually be taken to a windows site to buy Fallout 1st, difference from Xbox being there is "(Windows)" next to the listing. I can't find it solely through searching the Windows Store, but it took me there from inside the game
---
Idk how exactly but i have this often, making some emotes again can fix it
---
Oh man thank you so much, I have been searching high and low trying to get these! My gt will be the same as on here, Ill send you a message rn even though i see your not on, just so you have my account
---
You can get them for free, heres how ...
---
But them from players for about 250-300 caps.  Buy EXTRA.   They sell to a vendor for about 450caps with hard bargain3 and grape mentats on.    So basically they sell for less than a vendor pays and you can actually make a profit.  The reason this works is because vendors have a daily cap cap.   But as long as you not hitting that already its free caps.
---
Lmao this made me spew sprite
---
Hey man, where exactly on the wiki can I find the log of atom shop updates?
---
So you paid for cosmetics admitting you will not play the game until season 2... That's rough there buddy.
---
It‚Äôs your money, spend it how you want. Honestly, thanks for funding the game I have fun with every day. 
---
I just want to know, for my own curiosity, what compelled you to spend $150 to get cosmetic items that only exist in a game that you don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll even pick up for months at a time? Do you expect to return more regularly at some point or is it a ‚ÄúI just want it‚Äù kind of thing? 
---
No judgement, it‚Äôs just money and it‚Äôs yours to do with as you please, just interested in the reasoning behind these things.
---
100% as of rn you can‚Äôt unfortunately
---
I don't use PA no more and wasn't gonna use the plan. The goal was to use it as a trade item but I don't trade that much anymore. I noticed you really wanted one. So I'm happy to let you have it. Yeah I should be on around 10am central time tmrrw
---
You have no idea aha, I wanted them so bad, I can give you flux or something for the trouble if you want
---
I'm at level 44 and I don't do any of the NW ones, im not into the PVP.
---
I did.   The answer is IT ALREADY IS A SKIN. 
---
You simply dont like the answer and that I cannot help.
---
Nah, you're good. My fo1st expired so I'm not trynna fill my stash with junk atm. See ya tmrrw amigo
---
Lethal Force must be engaged you know.
---
You should have a display case already unlocked for you in build mode at your CAMP. It's under the "DISPLAY" section. Place one of the tall ones (with or without the glass broken out of it), then exit build mode. You'll have the option to assign objects to it like you would a vendor.
---
Thanks man! See you tomorrow!
---
Disappointed but not surprised.
---
Does lone wanderer well if your the only person on a tram? Keep seeing mixed answers
---
Roadway diluted will take a random one off but getting starched genes lev 2 and using serums is the best bet
---
Place it from 'Stored'  
---
instead of Recent, Vendors, or Blueprints
---
Yes, because you're not earning the XP in adventure - you're getting credit for it in your level up bar, but not for the repeatable because it's earned in NW and then just credited when you log in.  
---
The tldr: It counts to heko with leveling, not the repeatable goal
---
The two eye bots talking to each other, reminds me of Siri and Alexa chatting.
---
"A dumb man and his money are easily parted." - Someone
---
The mannequins one is great for the spookiness, the Mr. Handy about to explode is kind of sad but great too and my absolute favorite is the Mr. Handy leading stray cats
---
Did you recently move your camp and they are in storage? When you move your camp, your previous structure will be a blueprint in the stored tab.
---
yeah most people sell them under 400. buying 2 gives you the one for free, I always buy serums out of vendors if they're &lt;/=300  because I sell them for 410 at train stations and its literally free caps
---
Still so sad about Adrenaline being broken. I had just made an bloodied unarmed build and the next day the update which broke the perk came out. :(
---
56 :D
---
Its because explosive weapons are actually trash.   
---
100% useless on any boss and who has trouble killing regular stuff.  Therefor explosive IMO is 100% useless all around.   I consider people who run around with explosive weapons not very good at the game or they would already know this.  
---
Care to guess which I know YOU are?
---
Go with the High Capacity. Unless you're carrying way more food or aid than you should be, you'll get more use out of it than either the Chemist/Grocer mods like others have suggested. Armor Plated does very little for you provided you already have a set of high end armor (SSA, Heavy Combat, ect.) given that DR has very bad diminishing returns after 300 or so. The lead lined one is probably the only other choice I'd suggest if you care less about carry weight, since the extra rad resistance is nice as a bloodied build.
---
That worked, thanks man!
---
I have not.
---
Most challenges are bugged rewarding no atoms to a lot of players, i would send a ticket to bethesda.
---
*everyone liked that*
---
Nah just appreciate it
---
As much as I don't have a problem with launching nukes, there are others who don't have the ability to do it yet, can you imagine the shitfit on here and the bethesda forums if people couldn't get their 250 score because they can't launch their own nukes yet? :P
---
Yes and no.  The only caveat is if you are not hitting cap cap already. 
---
But this guy gets it.
---
There seems to be a display bug with atoms.  When I go into the atom shop it shows the correct amount for me.
---
I use armor plated cause its hella resistance but I carry a high cap/Armor/grocer backpacks on me at all times for when I need them on
---
I may have visited you house before if your on xbox dude a like a atic type deal with the brahim in it and it was dead..
---
Time to change your tag then.
---
Jai\*\*\*\*\* i hope has been reported by everyone and hopefully some action is taken vs him. Granted it is the weekened so he will probably go unpunished until later sadly.
---
Diluted radaway works just about as well and is more convenient for most players. More often than not that milk turns sour in my inventory.
---
Do you even play the game ?
---
Somebody else is usually sharing Inspirational, so I share Night Person, gives us another 2 Intelligence at night.
---
I like chemist because it opens up perk slots normally taken up by traveling pharmacy. Armored isn't going to do you much good if you're a stealth character
---
thanks for the recs all!!
---
Oh yeah I like that one too! It‚Äôs like they only kinda understand what each other is saying.
---
Yup want to join an event with me and watch your explosive get demolished by my BFFR?
---
Pretty much the games motto
---
You can't spell "to" correctly, either.  You're an illiterate peasant.
---
Huh... I saw the negative range and intentionally steered away from that because logic would assume that you‚Äôd need to be right on top of them at that point. The bug makes sense since negative attributes work that way in Skyrim and previous Fallout titles.
---
Oh I hope I see the Mr. Handy one with the cats some day. 
---
I found a Proctectron with an NPC once and she asked me to help fix him and I gave her a fusion core (I think) and he exploded and she was very sad.
---
Shrouded is broken, shadowed used to be broken for all except leather until recently and works for all now. Since you're going Unyielding you'll want one piece with harder to detect. It does stack but the stacking of it is so small that it's not worth it. With max stealth perk, escape artist (escape artist has a secret bonus of that it makes armor weight not effect stealth.), one piece of harder to detect, and all the agility of Unyielding you'll be really stealthy but not the stealthiest you can be.
---
TL:DR Shrouded broken, Shadowed fixed, get one piece of harder to detect, max stealth+escape artist, and unyielding
---
Originally I had taken photomode pics and screenshots to detail my character's roleplay journey from fresh outta the vault as a military woman all the way to a raider queen who drops nukes on her old stomping grounds for fun, but every few months my photos get erased and I have to start all over again. I just stopped trying and take pics whenever I see something particularly neat like a dope CAMP or something.
---
Damn dude, you really RDJ Sherlocked me, how dare I have an opinion on a game I like playing. Oh no, the SBQ is immune to explosive damage, this sheer fact has clearly effectively culled the market for explosive energy legacies.  Oh wait, they are still on ebay for ¬£40-¬£60, clearly the issue is solved.
---
As long as you thing explosive is 100% useless all around, I guess its fact
---
I just craft and drop some treasure hunt outfits for them.
---
Only dmg to bosses matter.  Period.  
---
What are you new to MMOs or something?
---
I love it too. Do you know the name of it? It has that "reunited" feel.
---
They actually had a reason for deleting the legendary effect off the mask, it was the only mask that had one and could only be obtained by making a choice during the storyline. Which then locks out and huge portion of the player base who didn‚Äôt choose that option. 
---
For legacies tho, yeah a lot have been dupped. But what do you tell the the players who did grind their asses off to get them, or always had them and are happy with them? Do you just steal them to eat shit?
---
Probably because you pushed the envelope.  Bethseda had to step in now cause people were taking them for granted in that they didn't care what was going on. Not a good look and had to be made an example of.
---
Yet I still have fun with it.
---
I was in a team this morning with all three other people sharing bodyguards 2. I do applaud your effort to share something that most people don't share or have though. I only have enough Charisma to share a 1 star, so in an effort to share something useful that not everyone runs I share good with salt 1
---
Stop using Strange In Numbers, and it should stop.
---
Maybe Vault 51?
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_51
---
I only have one spot to share. I was sharing bodyguard but wasn't sure if that was good so today I switched to travel agent. I wondered if it stacked I'd others has it already.
---
There is one available as a seasonal reward at level 76 actually.
---
 I'm imagining the Mr fuzzy ride animation on a radscorpion, giddiup!
---
If you play with class freak or can afford -4 str, bird bones is a good option  ( and work so good with marsupial/ jet pack
---
Yeah, kinda. I grinded the mask for a buff and guess what... guess I ate shit. Not really different, there was no warning for those who grinded the mask, so why ahould it be any different. ‚ÄúYou have unintended OP gear, it will be removed next patch‚Äù
---
Same here
---
"Bush wookie here." 3 words that instantly put a sour taste in my mouth.
---
yes once you find whats inside the vault you can buy the plans for secret service power armor and the gauss pistol and all its parts
---
yup it fixed it. Wow why is that a thing? I basically can't use that perk because of the annoying bug lmao. Thanks!
---
Fallout 76: God awful but you still play it.
---
I levelled up 20 times in four hours lol. Add in rest bonus canned stew with carnivore and inspiration and a lunch box or three with radiation rumble and line in the sand and you can get there.
---
Yeah and some idiots also buy a potato chip shaped like jesus for hundreds of dollars. 
---
That dont mean its a holy relic.
---
Check in the crafting thing! You should already have them :)
---
I've got a bunch if you need some to tide you over
---
I was a rifleman for a long time, and my primary was an Instigating lever. I worked very well. Usually one shot ghouls, mutants, etc. 
---
I did end up changing to commando so I could do better against SB, SBQ, Sheep, etc. I ended up with a so/so bloodied handmade. I do like the bloodied/commando combo. 
---
Not sure how well a base handmade would work, but your lever will do better with rifle build.
---
wow how far did you scroll down to see this post
---
Try a full power armor heavy build and use a furious explosive 50cal. Stupid amounts of damage and you don‚Äôt have to bother maintaining your character
---
Ok do you want any caps for them
---
Anyone else read the original customer response to the ban on the very bottom of first page?
---
It's been that way since the Season started.
---
You DO get credit for the "Level Up" challenge if you level up in Adventure Mode from NW bonus Exp though.
---
You must be new to PC games...
---
until you can learn to teach the game what is a crash VS someone rage quitting -- it will never change.
---
Unless you can teach your PC it was the internet dropping and not you unplugging your internet cable, it will never change.
---
But keep the fight on, rage on, my brother!
---
45
---
I looked up if the servers service power armor is better than ultracite and I found it on pc
---
Vault 51. I really wish Bethesda would turn it into a hub so you could go in there and queue for NW and explore at your own leisure instead of small 2 minute chunks before each match.
---
The PA strenght boost is a joke in total.
---
They should boost the PA strenght to 20 and add +50 to carry weight while in PA.
---
Also the calibrated shock carry weight could be boosted with additional +100 if you have both on.
---
This way PA would get a small boost to melee also, so the non-PA unyielding would not be so much more powerful.
---
Can‚Äôt wait for SBQ Savage and 76-Scape Extreme
---
and yeah I think the t65? Was it called is the best power armor it has the most protection
---
Like it says on the flair ps4
---
Nah. But I'll take salt if you've got any...
---
TheCrimsonDon
---
Unless they add a bunch of masks that can be earned that have a random legendary effect then yes the radical mask should have stayed. 
---
One: Legacies tho there are issues, for one if they remove them from the game they completely busts people‚Äôs builds. 
---
The radicals mask didn‚Äôt bust anyone‚Äôs build it didn‚Äôt have such an effect. 
---
Two: how do you compensate some one for breaking their build? A weapons deals damage, and the mask doesn‚Äôt. They aren‚Äôt comparable in that sense. 
---
Sure you may have grinder to get the mask, it wasn‚Äôt very hard to do so, not compared to getting god rolls, or some one to trade you a legacy. Very different amount of effort was placed to obtain those items.
---
Yeah I did every challenge so far even the nw ones and I don‚Äôt play nw normally. Reached rank 45 yesterday and Zorbo is only 3 ranks ahead of me now :)
---
Gotcha. I've yet to see any legendary handmade and I've put in 400 hours plus into the game. lol
---
Yah it‚Äôs really confusing on which ones are actually the power armor but I‚Äôm gonna do ultracite for now then go to secret service
---
What is salt if you dont mind me asking
---
It is for sure, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't be getting alot more random junk that I usually skip over on my play throughs just to blast some fools with. I pass up on so much junk, I would be a mecha packrat with that thing
---
Alright thanks.
---
Just an ingredient. You find them,on tables in,resturants and kitchens and whatnot. If you don't have any, I really have a ton,of them. I don't mind dropping some
---
Tell it to my BE flamer. Oneshots everything except bosses, does not break stealth, is basically a vats-sniper rifle.
---
Weird, PMed you mine
---
Or use module to change legendary effects on weapons. Well imo if you could choose the effects with those modules maybe there would be less duping
---
Oh salt nevermind I dont have pick up any of that but is that an ingredient for it
---
It's a win-win situation. Low levels makes profit and high-level can get more caps daily
---
Because Todd hates you. Sorry man lol
---
The Mr handy and miss handy flirting with each other.
---
They have twice the stupidity.
---
This guy is right
---
Move you CAMP device around and get your friends to jump to your camp
---
That's just the trade off for using bloodied. You're made of glass.
---
No, it's for a different recipe. I think all you need for rad ant lager is ant meat, corn, and boiled water. All of which I find a lot of because I do tea time every time it comes up
---
Not for me. I just don‚Äôt know what to do
---
What do you need salt for
---
Most helpful post of the thread if accurate :)
---
I always share double harvest because its a gem for 1 cost.
---
Yeah, I'm not an idiot. I did exactly that. The attachment failed.
---
76 or 78... whatever rank that T-65 PA paint is.
---
 yeah I realized that once I built it! Lol  it's awesome that they are all unlocked! 
---
I went with the t65 helmet and ultracite arms and x01 body and legs. Looks awesome! Thanks for the idea!  I just wish the ultracite had more skins
---
If you are really into doing damage only part of the time.  Might I suggest a nocturnal weapon.   Sounds right up your ally.
---
You dropped this. üëë
---
Wow this home just gave you a legacy! Good man! Happy for you. And jealous!
---
I don't think so. I use it to tank the queen alongside dodgy and it negates so much of her damage, I can tank her in a stealth suit and she can barely scratch me. Without she can kill me in half as many hits.
---
Lots of stuff. I'm mostly using it for tasty squirrel stew. Big so boost
---
Xp
---
That's pretty fucking lucky considering it equates how many times youve tried to get the pie for the payout
---
people complaining about legacies always come off as salty. they were intended, just didn't work properly. as if we're to believe Bethesda, which I don't, the mask on the other hand was actually unintended.
---
a lot of legacies also aren't op, and/or work more or less as intended (bar the projectile mishap). people assume all legacies perform the same as gatling plasmas. they don't.
---
the gatling plasma specifically is op because the splitter is broken. but if you take something like the flamer, even regular ones shred through enemies. the only difference is that legacy ones get an absurd range boost. which contrasts with the vaporization nozzle being broken since release. or the gatling laser, or the tesla riffle. both perform more or less as expected and are far from broken.
---
regardless, optics are everything. if memory serves, legacies became a thing shortly after (or before) the TSE nerf, which already drove a ton of people away. they've been treading carefully since then. I believe the only reason they went ahead with the mask nerf is because a minority of the playerbase knew about it, and it'd been like a couple weeks since they were introduced. not six months.
---
If a mask that gives 1 legendary effect pushed the envelope then what does 3000 icicle light plans accomplish?
---
Thats funny. Im 1300 hrs in and havent got a single legendary Fixer. I stopped trying once i got the gauss shotty, but now that i built the two i wanted, i think ill start trying again.
---
There‚Äôs also a Dark Brotherhood reference at the train yard near Mount Blair!
---
That is literally exactly what I did the other day when I unlocked the atomic onslaught skin for the T-65! I think I actually might have the T-60 legs though
---
There is still good people in this world thankfully! I super appreciate what he is doing for me. I looked high and low for these plans.
---
From what I've heard it's full health with no rads... makes since if you think about it though I mean if they made this perk usable for the most popular build people might start using power armor and they clearly don't want that happening.
---
Yeah bloodied builds are glass cannons we hit hard but brake easily
---
Have you tried batteries included or whatever
---
I'm at 51 with a ton of hours and all but 1 challenge missed
---
Nope. Shouldn‚Äôt. Fixer is a skin for the combat rifle. If you want the buff and extra damage gotta deal with the ugly
---
There are 3 soaps in the spa and 2 lamps in the Bot who sells armors shop in WhiteSprings, easy 5 oils to swap paints.
---
I'm pretty sure he meant the rampant duping.
---
fool me once, or a dozen times in this case. fool me for the 13th time...
---
I'm pretty sure batteries included counts towards fuel.
---
An extra 3 strength made my Deathclaw build worth using over my Fixer/MG42. But I guess it doesn‚Äôt count because my build was made in 2019 vs 2018? Because I guess it wasn‚Äôt very hard to do. Must be really, really hard to get lucky. I guess thats why only the tryhards win the lottery?
---
IIRC, players tend to spawn in north from your CAMP device. Move the CAMP device accordingly, and get some friends (in PA) to test it out.
---
The fixer does not have even a mod slot for a skin, they likely will not add one.
---
I just discovered it, gonna delete this lol thanks
---
you probably don't wanna hear this but some people (me included) experience a bug with explosive weaponry that triggers a mini health regen.
---
they vastly underperform compared to a 25/ffr counterpart.
---
the days of explosive are long gone. a 20% increase in the form of secondary damage (separated defenses) is hardly gonna break the game.
---
Oh my God! Thank you! I'm going to try this when I get home. I've scrapped her first so many times, but on my latest character, he's too low a level to recruit anyone else.
---
So why would bird bones help?
---
Since legendary update seems to be broken, before update i could take 2-3 hits from glowing yao-guai, being at 20% hp, now they just one shoot me with bkocker or not
---
I guess I'll have to ask my friend to log in for me. Thanks
---
This is great advice! Thank you!
---
I put those things in my vendors and didn‚Äôt realize people actually bought them. I have to keep refilling them more often than I thought I would
---
3 extra str points is something like 5% extra damage.
---
It slow down the fall and you need to fall  higher to trigger your animation
---
Awesome! How are the gauss shotguns?
---
Quick question, does it really matter to have a silencer on my rifle?
---
sweet thanks!
---
Damn dude, you sure are right, I am salty as hell that my Double lvl 30 .50 cal got removed, it was soooooo OP, thank god I managed to sell it to some sucker. It just didn‚Äôt work as intended, thank the Lord Jesus that you were here to deliver unto me the truth about all legacy weapons.
---
Alright so just get whatever except wood, thanks
---
I wanted to get that PA too but then I rezlized it was a mod made for Fallout 4 several years ago... That thing wasn't even made by Bethesda. Gives you an idea about how much effort they put into this legendary run. Now I just don't care and don't want it anymore...
---
To end game players like me and the scorchbeast queen who avoid explosive damage completely, that is just a furious 50cal. So you‚Äôre using it for weak enemies that can be defeated with anything else. Energy explosives are the only ones worth having because robots (imposter sheepsquatch) have low energy resistance and low explosive resistance. Plus, explosive adds long range to teslas and flamers.
---
Got a loot from queen as lvl 22 with auto laser rifle with beam splitter (on the mule alt), so yeah, that person just doing shit damage to the queen
---
Meh, as much as I like to put on a show for new players, I've found that most of them are too scared to venture into the Bog too early. Don't blame them.
---
That's why I've started nuking Morgantown. It's in an area that new players can easily get to, and it's also useful for other players too with its flora and mobs that drop flux components.
---
One time I had about half a dozen new players all gathered around the edge of the Morgantown nuke zone just after I launched it, just to watch the spectacle.
---
I don't want to set the world on fire
---
The sloth being only one star and low level  doesn't justify the poor behavior considering there were still low levels at that event who could have used those legendaries but didn't ever get a chance because level 400 people were one shotting the sloth even though they didn't need it
---
I guess 5% is worth shit then, sure would hate to have an extra 1/20th damage. Clearly that means nothing
---
What are you talking about. Please tell me you‚Äôre not talking About the daily and weekly challenges as they don‚Äôt give atoms anymore... you now earn score to level the season pass.
---
you lost me with your sarcasm. I don't really know what you're implying.
---
I called you salty because people complaining about legacies usually just can't source one themselves. sour grapes, etc.
---
double weapons work as intended. I don't think we ever got an official reason for them being removed, though. maybe because there's no reason for them to exist considering quad. then again, heavy weapons. so who knows.
---
The innate world challenges separate from the challenges list. You can still get atoms as a reward for said achievements, or challenges.
---
Which challenges did you complete?
---
What the H-E-double *fuck* did I just read!?
---
I just passed the tree, but I bought my way through the atoms level right before, so I feel kind of dirty.  I figured it was break even, though.
---
i avoid them in game their high melee damage with rads and the ability to stunlock if theres more than 1-2 is broken they should really have some parts of that nerfed in some way it also doesn't help that the damage bug is still in game so enemies regenerate their health when being hit
---
Their are many like that. I still missing discovering all locales in the Mire (Abandoned Bogtown), kill scorchbeast queen, mistaken identity event. Probably more but I‚Äôm aware of those three
---
I don't know where you're getting 1/20th, but if 5% is enough to break your build/make a DCG of all things worth using over something else, because of measly 5% more damage, which you can get from several difference sources, including perks and a ton of food, then clearly you're doing something wrong.
---
Back in time, there were so many low lvl leechers at queen fight, that's why bethesda added 1k threshold to get loot from queen (and her health was not static, more players - more health). Bring molotovs or flamer or other aoe weapons to events, helps with tagging
---
My two cents as someone who used to main PA and went deep into body armor recently:
---
Carry weight on PA is perfectly fine, but Unyielding on body armor is grossly overpowered from both a combat and quality of life perspective despite the low health requirement. I'd rather see this effect toned down to be better balanced, allowing PA and other legendary effects to shine.
---
Carry Weight vs Combat Effectiveness
---
Calibrated Shocks x2 = 100 carry weight, using only 2/6 of your PA armor mod slots. The other 4 can be focused on combat.
---
vs
---
Deep Pocketed x4 + Backpack = 100 carry weight, using 4/5 of your body armor mod slots.
---
If you also mod your chest with Deep Pocketed, your lose Dense / SS Jetpack.
---
If you mod the backpack to give you DR/ER/RR, it loses carry capacity.
---
If you mod it for High Capacity, you lose DR/ER/RR.
---
If you mod it for Chems or Food/Drink, you can remove the equivalent carry weight perks from your build, but if you want to obtain PA levels of DR/ER/RR you still have to slot quite a few defensive perks.
---
All of this is fair. You have to choose between quality of life - maxing your carry weight - or combat effectiveness - stabilized for aiming, custom fitted for AP, etc. 
---
The Unyielding Problem
---
But if you bring Unyielding into the mix, things get out of hand very quickly. Unyielding gives you 15 points to each SP-CIAL at low health. This bonus goes far beyond the insane carry weight (75 units) you get:
---
- Pass any Speech/Stat check
---
- STR significant increase to melee damage (multiplies with Bloody Mess, Adrenaline, etc)
---
- PER VATS accuracy + enemy detection range increased
---
- CHA max caps from sales to vendors
---
- INT XP boost
---
- AGI double your Action Points (dodgy, sprinting, jetpack), better sneak ability
---
- LCK faster VATS crit meter filling
---
The trade off is playing at low health. However, this can be mitigated pretty substantially through appropriate perk, weapon, consumable, and playstyle adaptations. I'm not saying Bloodied builds aren't squishy, especially to poison or a sneaky charred feral ghoul attack, but all of the above bonuses factored in with a "stealth archer" playstyle put you at a significant advantage over similarly decked out players of other builds. Were Junkie's damage not bugged and doing more damage than it's supposed to, the gap would be significantly higher compared to a Bloodied Unyielding build.
---
TL;DR
---
So while it seems unfair to PA that you can carry more in body armor and with a backpack, this is only really possible if you invest almost all of your body armor mods + backpack mod into carry weight utility over combat effectiveness, or if you rely on a meta Bloodied Unyielding build. The former is a playstyle decision with relatively similar trade offs, whereas the latter
---
I crafted a level 1 piece of wood armor modded both slots +paint, unmodded it and got it
---
There‚Äôs one I haven‚Äôt encountered recently I call him The Cowardly Super Mutant he‚Äôs usually the boss of any given location and when you first engage him he‚Äôs extremely belligerent your typical SM but once you start getting the upper hand he yells  ‚ÄúRetreat‚Äù and runs away. Since a acquired a couple of good legendary weapons I can usually one or two shot any SM so he doesn‚Äôt last long enough now lol
---
The Leader of The Pack Event northwest of vault 76 spawns fairly often
---
Doing that you'll get 3 Legendary wolves each time
---
Look for horde events in the forest and toxic valley as well, they're usually led by a legendary 
---
(I've only had a few times in the forest that they weren't legendary, I think it's because it's a low level area)
---
I stopped doing the herding at that event because I got completely sick and tired of literally 0% of the time hitting the Sheepsquatch at the end because some dip shit always feels the need to wave his e-peen around and one shot it
---
The wolf pack event at the Tyler county fairgrounds is a good easy one... You have to kill each of the three alpha wolf's, and each one is a legendary, and they're pretty low level
---
You def shouldnt be buying ranks this early. It's a waste of atoms
---
Side note: bring back Laser Musket from fo4. He have Pipers outfit  already, while she not even born yet (it literally named after her) so lore is not relevant
---
I mean if 5% = 1/20 is too much for you i‚Äôm not sure what you are doing trying to commune with another member of the primate family
---
Scorchbeast brain ... bumps your INT 8 with carnivore.
---
I've been doing world challenges also like discovery, hacking, and picking. The system, or client, is aware I am completing these challenges, but I notice I'm not getting compensated when I saw that my atom count jumped from 500 to 200 when completing a challenge, then reset back to 500 as if nothing ever happened. I just really want the liberty prime PA skin...
---
Also having this problem... Seems it's becoming persistent...
---
there are far better ways to communicate 5%.
---
like, I don't know. 5%.
---
not that you addressed any of my points thus far. not that you can, probably.
---
legacylets, I swear.
---
Haven't heard of this issue at all, even after earning atoms it stays stuck at 75?
---
Or maybe just increase stash? But it will be filled so fast, same with pa more bonus weight, you gonna be overweight soon enough even with extra 200.
---
Oh I wanna go Animal House on her and that guitar. Too bad with my max budget I won‚Äôt be able to put a toothpick in front of her. Is it worth deleting a finely placed lamp? Hmmmmmm
---
Ship, I had one for you if your on ps4
---
I didn‚Äôt know items in a stash box would be automatically scrapped when crafting ammo. I know it uses already scrapped junk from your stash, but not items that weren‚Äôt scrapped.
---
In like 10 hrs
---
Idk what crack you all are on can melt the queen solo with be gat plasma in like 2 min wtf sorry it‚Äôs not sub 1 min smh
---
I JUST WANT TO STAAAAAAART A FLAME IN YOUR HEAAAAART
---
Not yet but there was a historical exploit that enabled 5 star legendaries. I believe all of them have been removed from circulation and the accounts were banned. (This was a long time ago)
---
thanks pal will go look that up
---
You need to hit more check boxes, I'm probably on a list for my searches over the last year comprised of  Fallout nukes, Factorio nukes, Turn A Gundam nukes, Youtube nuclear test footage, in addition to internet searches at work regarding roadway design.  And for my job I'm a trained radiation worker (nuke density guages).
---
That was an interesting period of time in the YouTube rabbit hole.
---
Not exactly, ever heard of Nagasaki or Hiroshima
---
thanks, appreciate the help :)  will go look that up and see
---
Your points are...5% isn‚Äôt that much I literally don‚Äôt see any comment from you that says anything different. That is a really good point, thank God we can address  percentages in a fractional manner in order to make them more widely understood.
---
Got flux or caps?
---
I typically play the game in waves, the next time there is a big update, like the BOS return, I will come back and play for hundreds of hours, but after a couple months I‚Äôll be burnt out and I won‚Äôt come back to it for weeks. I‚Äôm also a minor completionist so if I can have the option to literally pay to win I‚Äôll do it. Most of all, my good friend absolutely hates micro transactions and I wanted to piss him off
---
Yep, but this seems to be happening after they implemented the hotfix because most if not all challenges are not rewarding atoms. Those you listed are known bugs since release
---
It‚Äôs in int.
---
She just goes to my band stand and plays tuba.
---
Honestly, they are buggy, but still fun (play on PC). VATS first shot is almost always a miss, but it only takes one shot with my Bloodied to kill mostly anything but SBQ. My issue is that for some reason, and i cant figure out exactly what im doing that causes this, i can no longer use a hotkey for a stimpack, run or basically anything until i "holster" the weapon and then bring it back up. Running bloodied means i die often because i cant perform a life saving move. 
---
As for your other question, Ive always only used a silencer if running sneak, which i havent done in a couple hundred levels, but even after the first shot i was still un-noticed.
---
It has to do with the mutation enhancements that Strange in Numbers gives... If you don't have that perk equipped, someone on your team is sharing it.
---
 did you just try to apply logic to why you can't wear a backpack inside of a powered armor suit that can't carry as much as a person with a backpack?
---
At some point in this game, large holiday presents were duped &amp; when you open them you get tons of plans [often learned]. So, to avoid weight problems, people just randomly drop them at other peoples camps.
---
you said 3 extra str points "made your DCG worth using over X", which is categorically untrue. 5% extra damage doesn't make or break a proper build. my point is that you're wrong in the assumption that whatever build relied on the mask.
---
but also your op as a whole, for the reasons in my other post.
---
In my heart I have but one desire
---
LOL, thank you for bringing it to my attention. I forgot I even had a tag on here
---
Yeah, just had rad rats attack and the turrets couldn't get them fact enough. Found two chewing on my Aluminum extractor and generator. Put a turret right on top of the extractor. Works Luke a charm.
---
I really hope they start banning people for this
---
Easy to kill depends on your lvl. If you are low lvl than leder of the pack is probably your best bet. But IF you have a tesla rifle and are stocked up on fusion cells you can just join radiation rumble and tag every ghoul there. You can be pretty low lvl in this event this weekend since alot of People are doing it with The double xp and all
---
Both Stevo and Zane are correct. Also, most public events have legendaries. Get your hit in and let everyone else do the rest. You dont have to kill them solo to get credit.
---
To have 3 extra strength meant my gauntlet didn‚Äôt intrinsically need %40 power damage or +1 strength, it did the job regardless instead of being a perfect godroll unarmed weapon, outclassed only by a limbd damage power fist with the same legendary rolls for crippling capabilities. But now any decent unarmed weapon could oneshot a bloated glowing one. I had the necessary deathclaw but I wished that it would be replaced when nukezone ready weapons could replace it. But nooo, the Free Radicals mask is so much better than an explosive gatling
---
Wellllllll... Anything but Wood, Marine, and Secret Service. As these 3 don't have a shadowed mod. Any other questions?
---
Power armor needs +100 additional carry weight across the board, excavator +200.
---
Just my opinion but in the first part ending or summary of your post you completely ignored one important factor: Fusion cores. On in my regular armor character I don't have to keep a stash of fusion cores to operate my standard armor. 
---
This only gets exacerbated further when you add unyielding into the mix, as you mentioned in the second part of your post, but the first part of your post completely ignores that you're already making a trade-off using powered armor by having to farm and maintain Fusion cores, which means either you have to dedicate a lot of weight to them, or do you have to dedicate a portion of your perk Loadout to making them more efficient. In my opinion that nullifies the trade-off in armor slots potentially gained ( and let's be realistic here the arm slots on powered armor are dead slots for anything other than an unarmed build , so they barely count)
---
Only a weapon as powerful as an unarmed shitty close range weapon deserved to be nerfed, better leave the plasma gatling explosives well enough alone,
---
Dont recall such a quest. 
---
Sounds whack.   Relog and switch characters back n forth maybe ....   What happens if they quick equip it and use it from that menu?
---
¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø

I get like 600 score just killing all the ghouls on one side. 
---
I‚Äôve completed it too many times to count and have never gotten the Hazmat or the Rad Barrel plans, so I‚Äôve lost interest.
---
You're not missing much. Green DOES NOT mean you can place an object... Only the potential to place an object some of the time. Maddening. They really need to get build mechanics refined.

Go to overseer cache on top floor of morgantown airport for easy backpack plan.

As a new player &amp; somewhat longtime Fallout fan (well, ever since FO3) as well as someone who is *already* tired/fed up with c.a.m.p. glitches &amp; especially with how much grind is in this game (to the point where I've basically decided never to pursue the SS armor, bullion, &amp; all that beyond whatever we get from the Legendary Run/quests) -- THANK YOU for pricing your plans &amp; stuff cheap. Every time I find good prices, it makes me so happy to not have to worry about searching for that stuff in a game already bogged down by so much other grind.
---
Just a heads up, excavator doesn‚Äôt give you double ore, so you‚Äôre better off using X01 or a Hazmat suit.
---
As a non PA user, I love this bug, in tandem with the jetpack, its possible to launch yourself and fly so high. When you "land" in the air, it gives you a speed boost if you are sprinting and then if you jetpack it shoots you up further than normal. So much fun to get around with.
---
Was placing my camp and it made a bush dissapear and there was a player crouching there. Nearly shit myself

That is always such a hood feeling! Congratulations fellow 76'er!

Man you shoula seen how many quarters I used to put in arcade games.  And I never could make it past that stupid Ketchup bottle.

Ketchup Bottle!
---
lmao bethesda replied to a bug, but only because its a PSA not to buy an atom shop item   
---
HAHAHA couldnt script it
---
This is a very elegant solution!  It fits from the game narrative point of view (PA makes you super strong) and would be exceedingly simple to implement under the hood dev-wise.   With my unyielding set and radicool my str is over 30, so base 20 Str from PA wouldn't be that ridiculous.
---
I find it frequently in the bathroom mirrors in the garage between Whitespring Resort and the club house.
---
Yes

I think they deal damage in rads. So they're flooding what little health you have with rads an killing u
---
24
---
wow
---
that's a reach if I've ever seen one
---
the mask is not directly related to the DCG or your build. it just so happened to perform that way under those very specific circumstances. you can still buff yourself though other means if 5% is such a life and death matter to you.
---
legacies are a completely different matter in every single regard. the mask was removed, officially, because it was unintended. unlike legacies. but also because it directly interferes with their revenue model- no one is gonna buy cosmetics if they can have an extra unyielding or chameleon piece.
---
it's also a reach that you lump "legacies" together when clearly you have a problem with gatling plasmas alone, which are in a league of their own, together with laser rifles, because of the splitter. so again, nothing to do with legacies.
---
You‚Äôre right man, only gatling explo plasmas are op, because of the splitters. Not the Tesla explosives, or the gatling laser explosives. Or the flamer explosives. Or the cryo explosives. Or the laser rifle explosive lasers. None of those are OP at all. Bethesda should only remove the Free Radical masks!!
---
Wait a minute... in F4 on very hard difficulty these ghouls were even more deadly.
---
My biggest issue with ghouls in F76 is these mofos make me sick all the time and i hate that.
---
IIRC there's 2 versions of Falllout 76 on the windows store. One says PC and the other doesn't. Have you purchased it? I looked on the forums (which doesn't show up when googling the issue) and apparently people had trouble claiming Fallout 1st on Game Pass.

People are using their tents to make Line in the Sand at Fort Defiance an absolute goldmine, I'm a low int build and with 3 lunchboxes I get close to 100k from tagging all the enemies as they spawn in the middle. Obviously if the event is being done normally, its going to be much slower and XP gain won't be as good, but if you see someone with their tent parked outside fort defiance and line in the sand pops up, you do not want to miss it.
---
they aren't. they deal 20% extra damage as intended, with some minor side effects.
---
only gatling plasmas and laser rifles are broken due to the splitter. I don't know where you're getting your info but it's clearly not accurate.
---
Well that's a good point. At least if I can keep up the pace I still have some Atoms left to use.
---
Atom shop
---
Not really, if something is removed as it was unintended, then it is a legacy, surely? Double weapons, explosive energy weapons, legendary masks...they were all unintended, according to Bethesdas official forum? So why the special treatment for the most duped weapons in the game history?
---
Why do i miss out in good shit
---
I would agree with this except, then nobody would be doing any damage and we would fail the event. I base my weapon choice based on the amount and level of the help I have.
---
Do you have any graphic mods?

So 50% limb damage adds the furious effect on purpose? Those extra energy effects add extra damage, please don‚Äôt play dumb, all those guns rise above 200 fire rate

Same here. Never successful with vending due to my extreme camp locations.

Well the Doc Brown did say to never interact with yourself or it would destroy the space-time continuum.

Count on it.

Got it. I agree with those.  I carry a .38 Combat Rifle just for those instances. Its not enough to one shot but just enough to put them down once everyone has their shots in.

I just looked at the stats w/o. The difference doesn't really make that much of a difference, especially dmg out.

Don't know if you know, but never Uninstaller the game. It will delete your pictures, it did with my pictures and I started in the beginning as well. However cool set tho

Ithe dpad right is.  Dpad up is quickbar can do chems food and other aid incl stimpacks.  Even armor and weapons.

Lmfao, well played
---
that's a bug? that has nothing to do with any of these?
---
and what fire rate? what are you even talking about? only gatling plasmas and laser rifles are broken due to the splitter. the rest deal the intended 20% extra damage.
---
if you don't believe me try a radium rifle and see how "overpowered" it is. energy doesn't automatically add more damage just because it's explosive.
---
no. not everything removed was "unintended". the mask was, at least officially. legacies were intended but didn't work properly due to a limitation in the engine that existed since Fo4. they even said they were fixing them, not removing them outright.
---
no one knows why double weapons were removed.

It makes you wonder if they intended it to work that way and if theyll change the mutations to not work while being a single person on a public team..... gunna be a pain in the ass to move those SCORE points around again
---
Not to mention they also probably put a filter for anything that has FO76, fo76, Fo 76 and so on in the search.
---
I remember when I went to a guy's base and then he gave me like 30 stimpacks and radaways right off the bat, and his base was actually really cool. His purified water was free, and I was a lvl 10-12, somewhere around there. So his kind gestures were nice. I appreciate the higher levels helping out the lower ones. I hope to be there someday.
---
I read somewhere that iguana bits are human bits, since we never see iguanas around
---
Fixer is it's own weapon. They don't share skins.
---
Anyone having trouble getting it to show up? It's not under my resources in camp mode. Is it just a skin or something?
---
Explosive weapons were halted as they were under investigation. I apologise for my unspecific language but I can‚Äôt recall how Bethesda referred to explosive energy weapons but I swear it was referred that they were under review subject to change.
---
I agree, a lot of this feels worse because of how OP the Bloody Unyielding build/set is.  
---
I still think there's validity to increasing carry weight across all power armor platforms.  I know I would have more fun not feeling like I'm forsaking the significant benefit of an extra 100lb of carry weight to run a power armor type I like better.  Additionally, the way things are now, calibrated shocks don't feel like a choice I'm making to have a lot of carry weight; they feel like a necessity to avoid getting encumbered right away.
---
I like the idea someone mentioned of making the player's base strength 20 while in power armor and adding +50lb to carry weight for being in the frame to give every player in power armor 100lb more carry weight than we have now.  This would both serve the narrative that PA makes one stronger than a normal human (presumably at a max 15 str) and it wouldn't rely on mods, slots, or level.  It also wouldn't devalue having the Excavator set since it's +100lb of carry weight bonus would stack to give +200lb of carry weight.  People would certainly still stick with Excavator, but I think we would have a bit more freedom to use something else if we didn't need to go completely all in on carry weight.
---
thanks for the info.
---
wasn't aware. level 183 and never once tried NW.  will do later
---
indeed. they were never "unintended".
---
Wait, do you only need one alpha code to launch the nuke? I though you needed 3 different segments of the code for the entire code and though I was just unlucky to have 1 of each bunker code.
---
A futuristic mining city, mind you.
---
Yep. You can get the pie. I'm not sure on the numbers by any means, but it's just really damn hard to get lucky enough to grab it.
---
They need to give y'all paniers for your PA like they have on bicycles. Or how about a suitcase-backpack for PA? If Behemoths can strap on a whole shopping cart, I can't imagine that in a real-world scenario we wouldn't be hanging stuff off your PA like y'all were oxen. 
---
A carrying pole/yoke like they still use in Asia for carrying heavy loads would be a hilarious visual but not super convenient for combat. Personally, I might use PA if they let me have a backpack to put Gramps in to carry him into battle.
---
8 codes, plus the keyword from the bunker, plus the keycard.
---
Damn, then if they weren‚Äôt intended I‚Äôm waiting for my double gauss shotgun
---
Vendor hop, i see them pretty often.
---
"how do I spell incest?"
---
I'm already shocked
---
Reminds me of when I started a new alt, I was doing leader of the pack to get some low level legos for my level 10/15 character...when out of nowhere some PA wearing douchcanoe kills the first 2 wolves, then before i can get to the third, he kills it then leaves an insult bot note in a paper bag, like how fucking desperate are you for scrip at level 200+? I'm just trying to get some lego gear for my toon to level up with. Some people in this game are right tossers.
---
Can you imagine being the first person to open that storage up?
---
Buried under a literal mountain of data just bursting out from it.
---
Oh
---
You young people and your euphemisms. D:
---
well yeah whenev i am in a building team i just assume they are there doing their own thing. if for events, that's a lil different‚Äîbut also assume some are just absentmindedly in them as well
---
Oh right, ok I tried that, the animation happens but the glitched stimpack is still in the inventory
---
i do miss lone wanderer while in groups
---
I think it‚Äôs there now. Looks to be a fo1 exclusive.
---
It is for the astronaut ally quest
---
Touched lucky there
---
Also use "Herd Mentality", always. You can open a team anywhere, even alone on a private server.
---
Yeah this has been brough up a few times, my advice is use 3rd person to get around it, but I know thats not a solution. Neither is this: line up the enemy with your crosshair before ADS.   
---
Until bethesda implement a solution, these are the two best methods outside of sticking some blutack in the middle of your screen.
---
"Stupid Molerats!"
---
Not sure if it happens elsewhere, but by my camp just south of Lady Janet's,  there is a little girl who is beside a grave with 5 or so molerats attacking her. After killing them, I went to talk to her and she says "*name* (forgot the name) was my best friend... stupid molerats!"
---
I just find it hilarious this little girl is getting mauled by molerats and is unphased. Pretty sure she buried a teddy bear.
---
Il recommend to roll for more in the next days and hope for a better one than these two ‚úåüèª
---
My guess would be it probably has to be applied similarly to Tent skins, so Atomic shop only. See if you can find the skin in there (all of the items ive received from legendary run show up in there) perhaps you can click on it to equip it?
---
the limb damage/pseudo furious/magic weapon bug is just that. a bug. it has nothing to do with legacy weapons so I'm not sure why you even brought it up. assuming you're right, which you're not, and I'll get to that in a second, they're allegedly fixing this in patch 22. then what? your argument, which is weak as it is, just dissipates? that's what you're saying?
---
and no, that's not how legacies work. explosives do not somehow double your fire rate. I have plenty of guns to test myself. and so so routinely.
---
I know your pain, I really do. Eventually I got used to it, though. But if I were you, I might see if there‚Äôs any programs that have an overlay for a crosshair. Might be kinda annoying, but...it would work. The monitor I use has that as a built in setting. Kinda wish I knew about that early on, though.
---
I hope not I'm already a BOS veteran amount of forbidden knowledge quests I've done getting the BOS paint jobs lol that a grind in itself
---
I guess you missed the part where I said "no one knows why double was removed".
---
Bethesda explicitly said they were removing explosive energy weapons because they weren't working as intended, not because they weren't intended as a whole, and would put them back in the pool as soon as the issue was fixed.
---
see the difference?
---
i love rad rumble. my 2nd favourite event. I just accept folk play the way they wanna. so i gladly gather if a few are capable of holding ghouls off, or will solo.
---
Does radshield suppress mutations?
---
I would love to see it as a DLC along with the ability to plough tidy furrows/ridges so that I stop wasting time trying to set my plants all out in a row. :P
---
Also, why can't I use the sewing machines? I was so happy to see them, and the spinning wheel, and then... can't use them as far as I can tell. Someone please send Bethesda the whole Foxfire\* series to study so we can have more cool stuff. 
---
\*for the unfamiliar, it's a massive collection of Appalachian survival, agricultural, and domestic wisdom gathered through interviews with locals starting in 1966. Real old-timey know-how.
---
Same here. I just completed the 76 quests in the Mire (40 atoms) and the 76 quests in the Toxic Valley (40 atoms) with no atoms added to the bank. weirdly my map briefly showed 800 atoms available but in the atom store it shows 75 available.
---
Oh great, so I‚Äôm gonna have to lose all my mutations just to switch from Carnivore to herbivore.
---
TS because I get enough AA with the Stabilized perk.
---
Good luck getting a refund because you didn't like the game
---
silent disables the voice lines which some people dont like (communists). The red visor can be achieved with the red tactical mod. You can sometimes find it from MODUS armory or player vending.
---
I literally pre ordered the game how come i dont have that shit
---
Tell me about it!
---
afaik it's a pa skin, not sure what stats you're referring to.
---
I think it's bugged (wow what a surprise!). It's in the atomic shop in the camp category... You can click on it to get that check mark but it doesn't change how you camp device looks. If you go to the shop again it will be "unchecked".
---
Really nice reward imo
---
It just works
---
/s
---
People aren't going to spend real money on Atoms if this happens, I would have thought this would be a priority to be fixed.
---
Not me: well ima just join and go afk...some person.
---
Its not.
---
I feel the opposite and enjoy the game.
---
That said, I can respect you not enjoying yourself here. I wish you well in you future adventures.
---
/salute
---
No, it's not, not when you're on sub 19% hp on purpose and get hit by the highest possible level ghoul in the game, if anything, bloodied should increase the damage you take just as much as the damage increase because of how much of a damage increase it is.
---
Crashed Satellite
---
idk if someone already said this (tried rereading comments, thought i had seen someone write it), but from experience so far with the new group feature... i recall being in an events group and doing the follow me emote to see if the others in my group would join the event i was at (duh, if you are in events, wouldn't you check the map to see where your team members are??) no, lol. i guess they prolly thought i was gesturing the follow me to someone else in my proximity, not for the team members specifically
---
If others are stuck at 75 Atoms as well, maybe a visual glitch that will self resolve?
---
you can just tag with bash for ranged, for melee just punch. Been doing that to legendaries so people can get it too
---
ah ok, thanks!
---
You know who‚Äôs the opposite of the MVP? The people who join a team in NW only to hide in a bush the whole time...
---
This. Please.
---
Honestly, you should ask before you start acting like a smart ass. You have to move your camp before it‚Äôll apply, it doesn‚Äôt just update your camp on the fly, it needs to load your camp in with the new asset applied. 
---
Source: I have the rider camp unit.
---
T-60 plans can also be earnt from distant thunder
---
Under resources it's an alternate skin for the base collectron.
---
Yeah, I reported my teammate who was doing this.
---
Yea and I suspect this was intentional as everyone (including me) would just afk play NW to finish the gameboard. Sucks for the legitimate players (also like me) who cant use that time to get some SCORE.
---
Yeah, banned too for server hopping probably, the night before I was searching a mod for the power fist at Watoga...Hope they unban me without wiping out anything that would be unfair. If they do so bye bye Fallout, I have to finish Horizon Zero Dawn and start The Witcher 3
---
If yall can tackle scorchbeasts, I'd just go fissure farming for it.
---
This\^
---
They changed the texture of the door for some unknown reason.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Name it? and favorite it. I have all my used gear named with a !name so it's at the top of the list also.
---
I just found the vault door from inside NW, and it's open. I tried to get to it but I couldn't jump high enough.  I assume there is an invisible wall, but I'd like to know for sure.
---
No skin slot on the Fixer, so no skins. Sucks... Just like you, I use skins to protect items from being sold / scrip'd by accident. Really looking forward to maybe one day getting skins for gatling lasers (+ultracite), gatling plasmas and LMGs...
---
Yeah, I responded to the mail and submitted a ticket 3 days ago, no one cared to answer me
---
My camp dissapeared from the map when using it . Had to rebuild whole camp after switching back to the old one üò§üò§
---
Yet a broken thing
---
The save system in this game is one of the only things that puts it above other games in terms of how up to date it keeps your inventory. I can empathise with the questing situation though.
---
To add another location to number 3, the burrows is fantastic for XP too.
---
mask?   no - all the other sh\*t.
---
Ight
---
My man!
---
I love mine. I use a scoped two shot +10% damage while aiming for distance and a good old fashioned TSE for everything else. I‚Äôve had the first one since level 35 (I‚Äôm now ~115) and it‚Äôs been amazing. 
---
So much so that I bought the real life version and shoot it pretty frequently.
---
Steam Game Bundles typically do it too! They lower your price if you own things already.
---
You could lock her up
---
Which skins would you recommend for the lever rifle? I‚Äôm using the gilt inlay one at the moment.
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4 i usually stock all serums for 250 caps a piece! Sunday sales for 200
---
THANK YOU!
---
Bethesda should add that, if the player with aggro has CHR 12 or above, it can force the queen into landing, if 20 CHR it stays down and 'chats' (only while the CHR player has aggro)
---
Favorite it. It adds another level of "Are you sure?" to the scrip machine.
---
Farm Charleston Capitol building. There is one part that is 15+ and one that is 30+
---
Not the same crack you're on judging by that comment üôÑ
---
I can't buy anything because the value is too low.
---
I just run around the pa spawn locations. That is how I got the set I'm using today. You will have to repair everything which you wont have to do if you craft it
---
Settlement building needs an upgrade. It's not as nice as  some mods for fallout 4,
---
Not sure on value.. some love the vamp effect on any build but 300 is insane .
---
Ok that is your opinion but I believe as long as someone has the funds to buy atoms then what's the harm?
---
I made it half way thru the vault 79 mission and got dropped from the server and had to start it over, but it did not replace the ammo and stims I had used to had to restock again.
---
Gunsmith
---
Love it
---
bug
---
Moving camp device doesn't do anything. You saying I should move my entire camp just to make this thing work?
---
I haven't even started wastelanders yet. I only trade here and there just to relax. I'm more active on reddit, than in the actual gam
---
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs hard to gauge how valuable due to the fact they were mass duped. On the other hand it seems as if a lot of people doing the duping (hoarding the duped also) were banned. In this instance based on how you talk about it, I‚Äôd say keep it for yourself.
---
ive encountered one of these people tonight as well. 28 kills and counting hah
---
If the item will scale to level it would be better to wait till you are max lvl and then get that sledgehammer even if you will not use it. A max lvl sledgehammer that is bloodied and faster swing speed is worth  5000 - 11200 caps on the pc version (used the pricing tool at [https://fed76.info](https://fed76.info/weapons/)). So, I can see that being worth selling and I would even sell it for a slightly cheaper price (that way you can sell to someone who wants to resell elsewhere).
---
That‚Äôs pretty damn rare. Chances are there‚Äôs not many around since rolls like this obviously don‚Äôt spawn anymore and chances are the few people that might have it from back don‚Äôt even play anymore
---
Nope
---
bloodied stealth is your friend make that stealth suit and never take a hit again.  
---
Youll learn to hate other stuff though like rad roaches and dogs that can see you regardless.
---
Happens to me a lot.  Pretty it's tied to strange in numbers.
---
Rad shield stacks 1000 rad resist per, have a supply of those on you and you‚Äôll never worry about radiation again
---
PIPE IS LIFE!!!
---
And you can get rid of the shockwave you talking about by changing the mods on the legs of your power armor
---
Can I get a few of those üëâüëà
---
Asking the real question here
---
Gave up shotguns, quit LMGs due to ammo/damage because of this bug. Converted my handmades, radium rifles, and combat riles to semi-auto and can control the damage to minimize rubber banding. You can still shoot near auto manually, but use 1/10 the bullets.
---
If that person's name was Rooster\_Cult, it may have been me. i tend to accidentally eat people when I try to jump over them.
---
What level are you?
---
I agree but I don‚Äôt get 300 damage in full health, I‚Äôm using other mutations but I‚Äôm kinda liking the bloodied vampire build and even in pvp if I don‚Äôt shoot them if I just shoot the ground a little it gives me HP. Full health with no rads it has a base damage of 128 but if I have half HP and rads it does 267. But what I do now to surprise the players during scorched earth events I go with only 30HP and full of rads to get the full 300 damage. Even my teams I‚Äôm usually don‚Äôt understand my build and don‚Äôt believe the damage until they‚Äôve seen it. The fastest time I‚Äôve killed a scorched queen was 3 minutes. I can‚Äôt get foot damage when she‚Äôs in the air but when she‚Äôs down her health just drops at a insane rate
---
Double explosive, pretty sure that‚Äôs a damn legacy in it. Nice find, especially if you were drunk
---
There‚Äôs been a massive dupe wave in the last week...
---
I believe it was in the patch notes, they changed the mechanic of berry mentats in pvp. If I find the link I'll post it.
---
üëå thanks
---
The great brahmin will not be stop by fences build by mortals.
---
Get a buddy to run glassed cavern or tanagra town with you. With enough grenades, and a nuke, you can gain a ton of levels in tanagra in like an hour.
---
Huh that's weird
---
Ah yes the classic: "You're hacking for jumping too high" also what level were you and what level were they.
---
The reason why you bearly see the event is that the event could be done in less than 2 mins. By doing the event, you could get the armor pieces as well.
---
I believe you can get them from treasure maps as well as these other suggestions in the comments
---
Yes. I really hate those ghouls. You can miles in the air &amp; one little tap from their f*cking lunge attacks will send you flying miles away like it's an anime.
---
I think you have to keep all 3 animals alive in the event for it to have a chance to drop
---
Idk, i see this happen a lot. I'm usually alone in a group cuz everything else is full then a new group gets created so i end up joining that
---
Ya that makes sense but I just got to level 112 and had the game for a couple of months. I don‚Äôt see why so many have to dupe while others such as myself grind like hell to get a few keepers. And is there really another duplication glitch ?
---
You can't make me regret my Red Rocket station. You just can't! No matter how long it took to line up right!
---
Herd mentality and empath work both when in a team on your own
---
Picked up marsupial, speed demon, and...the one thanks you invisible when not wearing armor....
---
300 each from player vendors tonight on ps4. I made those caps farming purified water to robovendors from my camp in a couple hours....yeah, I kinda started playing again.
---
I go for the forager instead, I like him talking down to my visitors.
---
If youve played more than a few hours of the game I can't see you getting a refund.
---
I scrapped a jumbo mr fuzzy which is annoying because I had plenty of cloth and leather and I cant put him in a display ü§¨
---
Yeah, that's been around.
---
Either use a short scope or 3rd person.
---
I've taken up a sick sense of pleasure for knocking them to the ground (Lvl 3 Enforcer + Explosive Combat Shotgun to the legs) and repeatedly slapping them with a furious Shiskebab while spouting 40K lines about "Holy Hellfire."
---
So nah, I will upvote this post instead, just to let you know that your frustration is justified.
---
It‚Äôs not too much to ask for both?
---
I tried this out in West Tek. Sniping a lvl 68 super mutant warlord with a unyielding set, then took mentats to increase intelligence and killed another lvl 68 warlord. Xp was a big bomb, i got 20ish intelligence in unyielding.
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs necessarily true, I went up at least an entire level yesterday from doing radiation rumble at level 200+ which takes I believe 15880xp
---
2-5 gmt would likely be 7-10 my time, if I'm correct. I'll likely be on. I've got some shielded under armour. Gives +2 int,end,lck and +1 str.
---
This just fixed it for me too, thanks mate!
---
Umm hate to disappoint but there‚Äôs a big the makes flux disappear on death around scorched earth.
---
The one where I find an excavator boy in a workshop and he drops 400 lbs of junk when I kill him
---
I look at my pip boy, switch view, switch back, exit, and it fixes
---
I got out of bed to double check- it‚Äôs definitely there under free and special offers. Limited time: 3 days left. 
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox if it matters
---
Flux is super easy to get......
---
Dang bought a legacy while drunk, never seen people sell legacys in vendors before.
---
It's just common sense really. If you play at all over the rest of the event, you will likely gain some levels on the board. Furthermore, as later levels require more score, you get more bang for your atoms by saving them for later levels, and may have some atoms left over to eventually buy something else.
---
Just because you can afford it doesn't make it a wise purchase, but at the end of the day your finances are yours to contend with.
---
If you run mutations, try egg head with the radicool perk. Egg head boosts +8 INT. Just make sure to have Class Freak at rank 3. Since it takes a chunk of strength and endurance.
---
The lack of grammar in this post has me convinced you‚Äôre still drunk
---
I just want to put sliding doors in the frames and to have gutters on the roof ends.
---
I thought raider and trapper also didn't have shadowed? Anyways, thanks for the help, was searching all day and everyone disagrees about how stealth buffs work.
---
Legacy, nooiiuccceeee cant wait to try it out after I unloaded the many failed gauss shotgun attempts at a bloodied one so my perk cards are back to normal XD st least it was a great buy then, the only bad thing is I had 30 mins of 100 extra xp left of well rested in the top of the map with nothing to kill XD
---
This acually worked for me! I tried it before and wasted an hour on nothing, but now I got the full set in 30 minutes, thanks man!
---
Don't look at the Screaming Eagles skin with a reflex sight. Just don't.
---
(For non gun-lovers, the side mount partially covers the ejection port, and the dust cover, when they could have easily put the reflex on a rail riser and the gun would work just as well, /and/ make sense. Oh, and it doesn't change shape at all for barrel, stock or magazine mods. That too.)
---
Project Paradize / Radiation Rumble / Uranium Fever. In the first one u have a garanted 3 star legendary and usually there are 5 more. Try to go first and activate it without waiting for other players to join. If there is no event u can go to clear up Capitolium, West Tek, Golf Club (it is my xp farming route and i always have few legendaries).
---
Another option is to nuke Whitespring and there are always few legendaries glowie ones. My record was 8 3\* withing 10 minutes. 
---
But the easiest way is to go to vault 79 to farm a big robot 10 times. It could be done less than 1 hour. just search in u tube vault 79 legendary. Of course u could do this stupid event leader of the pack but be prepared to run a lot and there is nothing good for u as reward. 
---
cheers
---
Well I wont be driving this morning put it that way ;)
---
Why would I use a level 45 AA ffr lvc fixer, when I could just use a level 1 pipe rifle. Of course, great suggestion.........
---
These are awesome and so well done!
---
lmao what you think breaking TOS is same with someone not reviving you and taking stuff next time try to stay alive and not to die for fuck sake what is next "I am dying disable dying" you guys are so fucking strange
---
If you have Presents you can open them and I think you can get T-51 plans out of them.
---
Wow üòÆ I‚Äôll try it !
---
Theres also the Thompson in game as well
---
Like you said, unyielding. Even tho i know INT boosts xp, best way to really test it is by using a mentat to really confirm it. Considering how unyielding raises all stats so there's no way to tell. While mentats raises intelligence.
---
and you think this is normal? it's just another workaround for the broken thing in this game. I doubt those items was made by human beings if they designed to be like that intentionaly. Why the skin can't just be applyed on the existing device?
---
Nuka cola machine in atomic shop: https://imgur.com/gallery/0qqEWPQ
---
Yeah, it is there, thank you!
---
Valentine wallpaper is there too.
---
I thought about this the other day and instead of giving you the good ol' "thank you for doing your duty, glory to the brotherhood, knight", I hope the BOS is perplexed about some random West Virginian hick leaving volumes of technical information in a long abandoned outpost in the middle of swamp for a group he/she never met without the faintest idea if it would ever be collected or just turned to soup when the basement inevitably flooded.
---
look for Vampires with a decent rate of fire.
---
Furious is always good,
---
Captain Cosmos power armor
---
it doesnt say "skin" but i guess u r right. I actually thought this is a set of PA when I saw it for the first time.
---
so caps/gold/scrips and nothing more.
---
Ohh, my friend you got a talent right there. Very nice.
---
Is this PC? I think I may have actually passed by either this or something quite similar (short term memory is not my strongest trait).
---
Ultracite vampire gatling laser with 25 faster fire rate and 15% critical refill. i primed it and definitely don‚Äôt regret it.
---
It would of been duped last week so any of the so called legacies that were hard to get are on accounts that are banned so who knows
---
bye. don't let the door hit you on your way out
---
This, you don't even drop your flux when you die so. The people just didn't want to waste a stimpack I guess. Some people be like that.
---
You could get banned but idk hiw theyre doin it exactly
---
Ya that‚Äôs what sucks imagine all the other legacy‚Äôs most people actually earned and kept but don‚Äôt play anymore
---
I was actually really glad for this challenge yesterday. It finally got me to upgrade my heavy combat armor to BOS and deep pocketed. More carry weight FTW!
---
Thank you for sharing supplies with low level players. I'm a level 16 and generosity from higher level players has really helped me out a few times. I'm going to pay it forward when I get to a higher level.
---
Bohooo cry me a river. You just don't get the setting of the game. Good luck in life though.
---
Again trying to mix different things. An apocalyptic videogame is not real life and is certainly  not a Lego project for kids (which my 6 years old has done tons as well). Kids are better thought to defend for themselves and stand up to fight for what they want. Not everyone gets a medal and that just hurts the kids ego. 
---
Besides what you all don't get crybabies is that I wasn't that person but I won't ask for his head on a pile because it is a GAME.
---
Lmfao. Good luck with that honesty in the community stuff......
---
That‚Äôs the shity part. Som many people get greedy and duplicate making everything worthless
---
Ohhh so smart. Here is your üèÖ

I thought the fixer is already a skin for the combat rifle?

I was mistaken, that's 9-12 my time. I'm not going to be available

I have the chair at the edge of a flat roof. When I spawn into camp shes playing but then she falls off and can‚Äôt get back up üòÄ

When you‚Äôre dead and the queen is killed during that moment, when you respawn you have all the fluxes with you. But if you die again they disappear, no one can pick them up.

Did you get the whoopsies? After almost 2 years I haven't get that one

That‚Äôs on my run. Great area, that once you know the layout you can get most of the ferals easily.

$150???? It‚Äôs free.
---
I agree, when it‚Äôs running as it should it‚Äôs absolutely brilliant. Even when bugs do happen I still play it daily anyway so that shows how good of a game it really is.
---
Doudle explosive gatling laser? That's a double legacy.
---
There needs to be some challenge
---
I actually don't know. Sometimes it works, other times its overkill.
---
Try the daily mission at ohio river adventure or the heart of the swamp event. Both spawn large number of mirelurks including hunters.
---
I love that event for xp farming. But it can be hard to get kills when a lot of people are camping the hallways.
---
Watoga vendorbot I think
---
Nope. Manage your inventory better.
---
I think you're supposed to cover the username before posting so that it doesn't cause a bunch of people to send them messages.
---
I haven't encountered cheaters myself but I'm not surprised that they're around. I remember my first online gaming session of Counter Strike (either the mod or the original release, I'm not sure) involved some guys who were partially invisible. Some dicks just can't get their jollies on without ruining other people's fun, sadly.
---
You can but only on throw explosives and npcs.
---
I was around 200ish and they were both above 150 but below 200. It was awhile ago, and quite humorous.
---
Yeah, you can RARELY move your camp as a whole. Its bugged like that for MONTHS (maybe longer). A chance they will fix it anytime soon is 0. But at least you can buy atoms and get some hideous cosmetics. &lt;3
---
Oh shit i didnt know! Thanks!
---
On 1 side it's good because power armour should come with its benefits and negatives. It's expensive to keep it running and requires a lot of perk cards if you want to fully specialize in PA.
---
You don't want everyone running in PA don't you.
---
But I do agree PA could use a more mods variety and set bonus sets like Excavator
---
Vampire minigun.
---
It's just insane and makes me basically unkillable.
---
Haven't used one yet, is it an automatic weapon? If so I'd definitely stick with ts ffr, and as mentioned by someone else you can get armor penetration from stabilized while in power armor.
---
Which I‚Äôve done...
---
Mine are for a strength build but that‚Äôs pretty general:
---
Anti-Armor Explosive whatever Gatling Gun
---
Instigating Swing Speed whatever Super Sledge
---
Both have been my primary weapons for general good times in Appalachia.
---
Yeah I wanted to test out the other T series power armor legs but don't have the plans for them. But atleast the x01 legs look good in the black paint
---
Fallout 1st only, says so in the store update on the site
---
I always have the cannibal perk on , I basically just get free food and health , people start throwing up but I can‚Äôt help but eat boys up ,breakfast and lunch , then when I‚Äôm thirsty I‚Äôll drink their blood , I‚Äôll use their fingers to stir my tea and for dessert I‚Äôll suck their teeth üòè
---
Her wing swipes are melee (blocker perk) and the sonic blasts are explosive which can be mitigated with Fireproof perk or a dense chest, or both but that's kinda overkill
---
Modification plans, yes. Actual pieces plans, no. The piece plans were rare drops from events in the bog, but are everywhere now in vending machines due to the holiday gift dupe a couple months ago.
---
But i was there for the beta and i preorder how do i not have it
---
I found a little girl standing over the grave of her cat that had passed. I didn‚Äôt expect to find anyone so close to the edge of the map.
---
I use the lead lined mod to help mitigate environmental radiation, which saves me some pip boy time spent drinking Brahmin milk and hovering between 10-20% health.
---
The high capacity and other weight related mods are great if you‚Äôre a hoarder, but I‚Äôm not.  High cap will also penalize your rad resistance, making a diluted Rad-X nearly useless.  With shadowed unyielding armor and stealth perks I rarely get spotted, so armor plating isn‚Äôt very useful to me, either.
---
If you‚Äôre more interested in useful defense, I‚Äôd opt for lead lining.  If you want to carry more stuff, I‚Äôd use the chemist or grocers mods.
---
I don't know, sorry.
---
 I‚Äôm almost positive. I‚Äôve never owned one. But I know the double prefixes legacy. And I‚Äôm pretty sure Gatling lasers don‚Äôt drop explosive anymore. Which would technically make it a double legacy
---
Was referring to your fallout 1st exclusive comment
---
More xp for us.
---
True. Just don't make me face assaultrons with stealth capabilities. :)
---
It was a bug? I could've sworn that the permanent loss of flux on death(anywhere) was intentionally added because players would steal flux from eachother after the event so much that it actually became a noteable problem.
---
&gt;until you get an M79, Gauss Shotgun, Auto Grenade Launcher or Missile launcher. If combat isn't avoidable, try your best to kill your pursuers with the weapons you have. 
---
And here is the problem with such a build.   Every single one of these weapons is a pretty uncommon drop.   Your chance of getting an M79 is mediocre.  Gauss Shotgun, Auto Grenade Launcher or Missile launcher are so ridiculously uncommon that it's almost impossible to plan a build around it. I have a similar problem running a heavy weapons build.  
---
To be truly successful with a heavy weapons build you need a Gatling gun or a 50 cal and you need to be in power armor.  When all of those elements are in place then yes, I do monstrous damage.  But all of those elements rarely fall into place. 
---
Which is why commando builds with tank killer and frog legs seem to  dominate NW.
---
Until you can admit you did.
---
I wish I could take pictures as good as these. All I have is a photo of a luxuriously-stretching dead Scorched next to my pre-wastelanders character.
---
Rotate her chair to face a wall
---
Ok that is your opinion but I believe as long as someone has the funds to buy atoms then what's the harm? And it was only a question no need to jump down my throat like seriously
---
I wish I can follow you around reddit reading your posts enjoy reading while expanding my vocabulary.
---
You can (or used to), be able to change the save frequency in one of the ini.   
---
Worth checking out if this is a reoccurring issue.  Sounds like a cloud issue if your PC actually crashed
---
Right there.
---
Everything is broken
---
I agree that it‚Äôs wise to be cautious.  99% of traders are honest about the deal, but it only takes one guy to rip you off and leave you feeling like a fool.
---
Discovered this yesterday, thanks for the thread, glad to have an answer
---
I rather enjoy the game. This is the one multiplayer game I can play and not be forced into PVP with a guy playing since beta or launch.
---
Dirty duper Why can't you all just be honest with yourself  Bethesda already said that they do not do ban unless there is extreme item and you probably had twenty thousand of some things or some weapons that duped
---
From what I‚Äôve seen, FO1st exclusive deals get placed in the limited time tab. It‚Äôs usually the small icon on the bottom row.
---
And the ban is forever by the way you better start a new account if you want to keep on play Fallout and don't dupe this time either then
---
From my understanding there is yes. I believe it involves blueprinting the ammo maker, so maybe don‚Äôt go blueprinting that.
---
Not in super large quantities for ultracite ammo crafting ammo hungry weapons
---
IDK.  
---
I used the CAMP for the first time a few days ago. Apparently you're supposed to be able to build a separate blueprint of which is usable in Adventure and NW.
---
I tried this out and if I remember correctly, the briefcase must be like 90' for it show up.
---
A versatile explosive build will run the perks I mentioned along with commando perks. 
---
Commando builds don't dominate by a long shot, they're just the most popular choice. A good player using a commando-only build will lose to a low skill player with an explosive build often. That same low skill player won't get anywhere near the same results with a commando-only build.
---
Ok i dup 3 legacy and 1 fixer BE
---
They share the same meshes and UV layouts, the only difference is the new texture sets, I wonder what the problem is for Bethesda to not allow Combat Rifle skins on the Fixer, maybe low priority on the issue list. 
---
Hell, even the Combat Shotgun is sharing some mods with the Combat Rifle that are the same, hence why on the storefront image of the Jack O' Lantern paint for the Rifle you can see the Shotty as well.
---

Makes my ‚Äú teabagging the SBQ‚Äù look like complete garbage. Great work.
---
Well I build a home as well and not everyone gets what they want yesterday there were three guys at my vendors and I was restocking then on my another player and when I was attack suddenly when I looked I shot at this man and he attacked me then he destroyed my house so no we can not all have nice things apparently
---
It's not broken, it just doesn't show the little animation. Your ap will fully regen on kills if it activates
---
So you did dupe then we'll I'm glad that you know it now and won't do it again hopefully if you need weapon on PS4 just let me know when you after level 50 and no cheating
---
Sorry but i read that the ban last 30 days the error is 4 8 2000
---
Do you find much purpose in being a chemist? I‚Äôve thought about... well, essentially being a drug dealer in my CAMP, but I wasn‚Äôt sure how well they‚Äôd sell.
---
It will take about 2-6 weeks. You are not only one, many people were suspended falsely, but they have to go through the Besthesda investigation before being allowed back in. It's just backed up since around 62.5% of players on every platform have been suspended. Ignore these dweebs saying you deserved it, you don't, and I think you'll be back soon, just have to go through this stupid process like a lot of folks.
---
OK. How does that compare to other free DLCs for MMOs?
---
Sometime the ban is day and sometime month and sometime it can be years that is what I heard but I have not been ban as far as I checked
---
That super sledge sounds nice.
---
Im unarmed ive got an exterminators swing speed deathclaw gauntlet. It just melts mirelurk of all kinds. Only things that don't die in 1 hit are cryptid enemies like Grafton monster and snalligasters along with bears, supermutsnts deathclaws but they take 2 or 3 hits to kill. 
---
My build is literly armor with +1STR on all armor pieces (slowly upgrading to SS armor) and i feel like a tank which 1 shots most enemies.
---
Would not be surprised? Alot of vital perks are broken atm üò°
---
So the ban last 30 days or forever
---
The bow is ok but not good because the damage cap makes you only do 110 in PvP anyway even with bloodied or anything so you can only use automatic types weapon at this moment until they decided to actually balance all of the weapon
---
how can a bow compete with legacy explosive lasers?
---
Kinda like a skin. You manually place it you can pick what Collectron you want by going right or left from the basic Collectron. You can only have one at a time though.
---
Ok thanks
---
Yep... Happed with me also couple hours ago. I died while looting SBQ. I called for help and other people just surrounded me and waited until I will be dead completly to steal my flux. That's how this goes in this game... and yet we still get those unicorn rainbow posts "I just got a level 5 legendary gun from level 400+ player. This community is awesome!". Yeah awesome my ass... They just gonna wait like predators and steal your shit with first opportunity they got. That's thier true face...
---
P.S. and yeah I still don't understand why we supposed to drop our junk if we die? What the idea? Punish us for the death? Why can't the punishment be more reasonable like "if you die your equiped items lose 25% of their durabilty" or something like that?
---
? Blueprinting the ammo maker. Wth lol people still desperate to duplicate that‚Äôs ridiculous they just patched 3 or 4 of them in the past month or so
---
You should be able to, I run the targeting hud on it. Maybe it's just there by default. Did you check?
---
They come with the helmet, check your power armor station
---
Can confirm it works you just don't get the animation.
---
Little tip for line in the sand if they are using the tent.
---
Grab a grenade launcher and just shoot once into the middle as soon as they spawn. You don't deal too much damage but enough to tag almost every singe enemy.
---
what the fuck
---
Yeah that could work, should give enough time for people to hit it. Just thought there should also be a marker on the legendary so you can also see exactly where it is, save you missing it entirely
---
I think he‚Äôs talking about they‚Äôve completed the legendary run, by buying atoms to purchase the remaining squares
---
Yeah. I'm nearing level 40 so I might try find the t60 pieces but you get the x01 plans from completing the enclave questline and a full set (and plans) of ultracite pa from the bos questline. Maybe u might want x01 armour when I'm level 40 if I have it by then idk.
---
Well I heard there was a bug or some sort that make the bow go automatic or a little glitch
---
Yeah, Adventure mode PvP mechanics especially discourage the use of slow firing weapons. Unless each weapon type had its own damage cap there's no way weapons with a low rate of fire will ever be able to compete in the meta with high rate of fire weapons. You might be able to kill a few noobs with a bow but any serious PvPer is going to laugh the second you draw your first arrow then blast you away to Valhalla.
---
I‚Äôll pick a couple newbies out of a hat and make them marine wetsuit under armor with protection mod. I‚Äôll also drop stims and radaways- wish we could give them caps, but we all know they would just use ‚Äòem to go buy drugs... Which might be a good thing!
---
Dont die?
---
My post was specifically focused on the carry weight differences.
---
If we're going to talk about fusion cores, we have to think about what it buys you. We'd have to factor in all the pros and cons of the different types of armor.
---
Just to shed some light on what those fusion cores are buying you:
---
- 42% damage reduction at all times
---
- 90% rad reduction at all times
---
- Higher base DR/ER/RR than body armor on top of the above reductions
---
- 100% immunity to cripple (freed 3 END points used for Adamantium Skeleton not required)
---
- 100% immunity to fall damage (no need for Goat Legs or reduced fall damage mods)
---
- No need to farm legendary rolls to max out your PA
---
- Mods that are just as powerful as some body armor legendary effects or perks like Serendipity
---
There are some cons for PA as well, but again everything is about trade-offs if we are trying to think about game balance:
---
- Fusion core weight + drain/management/farming
---
- Fewer outfit/cosmetic options
---
- Batteries Included almost required, less painful if you are also an energy gun user
---
- Batteries + Stabilized/Demo Expert means high INT investment for heavy gunner / explosive launcher PA builds
---
- Flux requirements for most mods
---
- Expensive mod plans / low drop chances
---
It's easy to pick any of these cons or one of many others and be like "yeah, but PA is underperforming because XYZ" but we cannot take for granted all the advantages PA gives. The balance between PA and body armor is no better demonstrated than in Nuclear Winter where each has their strengths and weaknesses. The poor perk, damage, reduction, and legendary balance in Adventure Mode is the reason PA feels weak when in actuality it is the _best_ armor to aspire to for most players, assuming you can work around or adapt to the fusion core and INT perk card requirements.
---
They unlock with the helmet plan. You don't need to buy individual plans.
---
And it depends on your armor
---
I prefer burning at the steak. Thanks.

I just found a 30 lvl player in the server and crafted them a full BOS heavy combat set. Karmically positive way to do the challenge.

Welcome to Fallout üòÇ
---
This guy on PC?
---
good ol champ here doesn't want to hear that 'santa-Maks' is possibly a duper, and also it is quite an accusation, if of course that is what you were doing.
---
So tell me kjammer1769, which law did you break? Ever got a speeding ticket? Traffic violation? You clearly have 0 disregard for the law, your vehicle needs to be taken away. Hell, were so far down the evolutionary line if it hasn't sunk in by now that the law is the law you should be castrated. Your blood needs to be removed from history. I don't care which one you broke, you and your potential offspring are law breakers and you DO NOT deserve to be with the rest of us law abiding citizens.
---
My first character base is there. I love the location. Great job!
---
Whenever you tell me I'm pretty
---
That's when the hunger really hits me
---
You're little heart goes pitter-patter

I want your liver on a platter

Use your finger to stir my tea

And for dessert I'll suck your teeth

Be too sweet and you'll be a gonner

Yeah, I'll pull a Jeffrey Dahmer üòàüíÖüèª

Why lie about this? It's not like random reddit users could help you
---
I do it on a private solo just for the xp and loot!
---
Yeah I want the NSDAP flag on my CAMP so it represent my other real life "camp" near the German town of Dachau.
---
Must not watch YouTube world record with a fixer is like 44 seconds solo or something gat plasma isn‚Äôt far behind
---
Bethesda themselves didn‚Äôt do the banning they set a bot to do it ... my mate got suspended on investigation and he didn‚Äôt dupe anything he didn‚Äôt even play the week the dupe was/is out. The bot pick his account cause he has mass amounts of ammo. This case has happened to loads of players and they all suffer the same fate more than likely
---
Haha yea I know the verse I was just mixing it into my comment so it sounded less lyrically , god blesh Ke$ha ü•∞
---
Your reply is overly defensive, passively rude, and smells like argument bait. So I'm going to be a little more direct so I can earn that touchy response.
---
Unless you do not plan on playing for the rest of the season, then there is 0 benefit to paying for ranks now unless you JUST want things early for whatever reason, which is likely rooted in impatience, or superficial bragging rights. But hey, buying your way to the end of a race early isn't really something to brag about.
---
Buying ranks now when you do continue playing during any portion of the rest of the season is wasting atoms because you will gain more rank, even if its unintentional, as you play. And since each rank is progressively harder to get, but the cost to buy ranks remains the same, it makes sense to wait as long as possible to buy them.
---
Is it just my opinion, certainly. But it is an opinion based on logic, and readily available, and obviously factual information. So unless I'm missing some vital information, which is possible, it is sound, reasonable advice given sincerely to help you. But go on being snippy and impatient just because I was trying to help in a way that contradicts you're view.
---
I was walking down the train tracks near Charleston Station and this guy walking towards me stops and asks me to take his picture, then he makes all these goofy poses as I snap away.
---
I don't know if theres any validity to this but if you're relying on glitches and exploits to win in PvP you aren't seriously PvPing. Even if it's to make an ineffective weapon better, cheating is cheating.
---
Lunchboxes were leaked a while back, and everybody thought they would be Atom shop items and pay to win. They gave bethesda a lot of crap for it and they just saved them until now I guess. They‚Äôll most likely stay the same on how they are earned
---
And we care why?
---
I do.   I went with 9 in Charisma specifically because I wanted to share Inspiration rank 3 with my partners.  I've developed team relationships with a number of amazing players.
---
Mostly non-PA, heavy weapons with a secondary emphasis on commando.   Can run bloodied for everything except Scorched Earth.   I'm just not good enough to do that bloodied (or need some of those Charisma perks somewhere else maybe).  Kinda moot because until they fix the SBQ so that she can be crippled and/or land more than several seconds, I'm done wasting ammo on that event, bloodied or nonbloodied.   Fix coming in patch 21 maybe?
---
Morgantown and Morgantown Airport would be pretty good I think lots of ghouls and scorched, many events and double XP this weekend :D
---
I didn‚Äôt say I use the glitch I know there a glitch that you can shoot rapid fire but don‚Äôt know how to do it, so I‚Äôm using the normal fire rate
---
My guess they will add lunchboxes to the shop with the legendary perk card update...
---
43 almost 44  I hope to get 45 by end of the day.
---
Most of them didn't earn them, they bought them ($$) lol
---
So where did you put those extra four Charisma points?
---
Some did it already a week ago go with the xp exploit.
---
Yeah I rolled a TSFFR auto launcher the other day (i made a thread yesterday about how much fun it is), I have to remove demo expert so as to not kill them outright, but it works well to get all the tags in, thats for sure.
---
You could knock it off by the time it took you to make this post ....by just playing a few events, or the game going about other things on your quests. will be done chop chop through normal gameplay.
---
Very nice work
---
This same thing had me going mad for so long
---
I don‚Äôt understand building teams , how can four people build together ? I‚Äôm capable of building my own stuff ..
---
I had slightly over 10K atoms so I purchased about six ranks and am now caught up to the Villian we're chasing.   I was bored and wanted the raider tree to tell someone, "this is what we do to thieves."
---
Go for a high rate of fire vamp weapon, will help in dealing with these very annoying ghouls.
---
&gt; about 10% of the time
---
Pretty good for this game, some intended mechanics don't work that often
---
why u always lying, always lying
---
I had a bunch of pictures from beta on my old xbox but it sadly broke.
---
i idid a SBQ yesterday and probably 2 minutes into the fight i blue screened...
---
Why even bring it up then?
---
Mine shows 97 base damage with rifleman perks. I'd have thought commando base damage would be much lower as it only accounts for 1 bullet of damage.
---
I might try move some perks around, if I get on later tonight, to see if I can boost it to 100.
---
Platform?
---
Geez, you should have been at the failed SE I went to yesterday.   Couldn't kill the SBQ, but an absolute trainload of minions and XP from them.   I just wanted flux.  LOL!  
---
I farm West Tek, but I never thought about doing Glassed Caverns.  Thanks.
---
I wonder if they added Lunchboxes to bundles they already sell as free items for the same price if they would get hammered as pay to win also. Some people would probably only buy a bundle for the lunchboxes, so maybe so.
---
If you are going for bloodied PA then it is mandatory.
---
Not a huge power armor user though
---
Before we go talking about buffs to carry weight, we really need to analyze from a game designer perspective what carry weight represents.
---
Unless they change their perspective, Fallout was always about scavenging and making the choice to pick up and keep some things over others. In a hypothetical infinite carry weight situation, this aspect of the game of making decisions over what to scavenge is eliminated completely, which has drastic consequences.
---
Because of the Scrapbox, for example, we are able to hoard a lot more Junk than before. This devalued normal Junk substantially, but made room for Flux to be hoarded, which has increased in value by 100% over the course of one year. Because heavy Flux is easier to hoard, more people are min/maxing with Primed weaponry and Ultracite ammo, in turn bringing the value of certain Junk items back up to original levels (Lead, Acid, Copper, etc).
---
Because we got an infinite weight Junk stash box, more players are using more powerful weaponry than before. Duped and hacked weapons aside, more players can store a larger arsenal of weaponry to experiment with and swap to different builds for different encounters than they could before. Because of the increased choices and the Primed receivers and Ultracite ammo, more players are doing more damage against more enemies, further trivializing the already easy content in the game. They introduced a new Wendigo Colossus boss in the Wastelanders patch, but instead of being an encounter people found very difficult, even with the Fear mechanic, people instead have complained about its low chance to spawn and lack of reward. Because of the power boost obtained by the average player, the devs have to artificially increase the Colossus event difficulty by limiting the fight to 8 players at a time.
---
\---
---
There are a lot of factors to consider when we talk about carry weight. Does it fit with the philosophy behind the game? Does it directly correlate to changes to the player economy or combat balance? What other aspects of the game change for the better? For the worse?
---
It would be nice to be able to carry more stuff, but say we throw another 50-100 carry weight onto PA: we'd enjoy it for a time until we go "welp, I can carry 3 big guns now, but I really need to carry 8 different ones for these 8 different bosses and Bear Arms isn't good enough." We saw this with the stash box - which is why they went with a subscriber-only Scrapbox instead - but no matter what the actual carry weight number is, it will never feel like enough.
---
Again, another two cents maybe no one asked for, but I think this game would benefit from a lot LESS carry weight and stash/scrapbox space. I think the problem isn't that we have too little stash or inventory space but that it demands we fill it past the brim every time. Why are Gears, Springs, and Screws not just consolidated into Steel? Why is Aluminum used in protective armor at all? If screws are holding things together, why do we also need Adhesive? Why do I need to have thousands of Lead, Copper, and Plastic on me at all times in order to craft enough ammo to shoot for the next 2 to 3 hours? Why do I end a play session with hundreds of Purified Water, Stimpaks, and Super Stimpaks from all the events I did, "survival" consumables that are supposed to be very rare and highly sought after if the single player Fallouts were any indication? Why are Slayer weapons and armors a thing when in every (successful) online game a one-size-fits-all set is typically more preferable?
---
1. any public event. try to tag enemies from where they cant get u.  never go first to these public event. never give a sh!t about any bad thing other players can tell u. in general all 2nd caracters use the same method. 
---
2. join a public team and ask nicely to help u out with west tek/golf club/capitolium. first goes ur teammate than u join him. this is bcz enemies are spawn depending on lvl of the first player appeared. as for me i d rather go with a newbie to help him out than do another daily for the foundation or any other quest. 
---
3. dont be afraid to die during any event. sometimes i prefer to die of radiation than use radaway in a nuked zone.
---
From my experience this sub reddit is literally the opposite. It's almost impossible to find information, especially considering how sensitive of a subject this is. Very few people would post up "I GOT BACK IN, HAHAHA" without getting flamed out the royal ass. And if one does so manage to post such a thing, it's very unlikely I'll catch it without constant monitoring of reddit. Combined with rumors that it would likely be months, I don't know that anyone would want to be filtering through alerts that long - especially when they clearly don't play anymore. So if you'll excuse me, I'll post the occasional thread asking every so often. It would help others part of the wave who may have done something minor enough to be informed as well.
---
You can wear most head wear with it and still be totally in stealth. I think.
---
thanks for the location heads up.
---
These are freaking sick you should be proud. 
---
You have a good eye.
---
I mean all of you is pretty good I‚Äôm sure but in particular your eye.
---
I like to drop them nukashine to give them a little taste of reality
---
On top of my original question, how is somebody with a bloodied gauss rifle like me supposed to kill feral ghouls without dying instantly from them?
---
Literally the most relatable post for this game lol
---
Pretty much just Bethesda in general. Bugs.
---
If they become accessible it needs to be through ingame means, not the atom shop.
---
It's one of the biggest buffs you can get when you acquire the rank 2 starched genes perk. It is pretty much essential unless you are a masochist and determined to run a full health build without damage mitigation perks.
---
Ah ok, seems weird that they were in the 150-200 range but don't know about mutations like marsupial exists?
---
Waiting on: "We have received lots of feedback and requests and we wanted to tell you that we hear you! We will be adding lunchboxes to atomshop with patch xx!" 
---
I always wonder who are these invisible minority of players that "requests" more of these monetization schemes.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind fast levelling
---
Mic?
---
Sure do
---
Blocker, dodgy, serendipity.
---
Just waiting for the announcement.
---
I‚Äôll start a party, join me. GT: KING0026 well get you some serums and levels
---
Already working on blocker. I'm going to have to stop becoming an explosives build, but that's fine. Thanks for the help on the other perks.
---
Yeah totally agree do so many events get 3 lunch boxes
---
Jesus christ. Nobody can have opinions can they?
---
I agree
---
That would be a great place to earn them. I like this idea a lot.
---
Nope. Seem to only disappear after Scorched Earth. I've collected flux off other players bags as recently as the current patch.
---
That's evil
---
Wait, I can buy ranks? How?
---
well, you can lose them one at a time and hope carnivore is not last.
---
yes
---
Hi, yes you can craft legendary weapons and armors using legendary modules and yes only specific armors and weapons, happy scavenging :)
---
I guess he means this investigation suspension or what it is called
---
Random reward from the Project Paradise event. It doesn't even drop as a plan. I just randomly discovered I had acquired it when at the crafing armor table. And no, contrary to popular belief, you can get it even with just one animal alive.
---
Patient to Doctor, "It hurts when I ..."  
---
Doctor says "Don't do it then."  
---
Doing something and knowing it's a bad choice is hilariously stupid, but very human.
---
I've been making hardened 10mm pistols with large mags and heat bats and selling them for 1c on the vendor
---
Same. The glowing blood stacks up and sells for my daily limit some times.
---
I've said before and I'll say it again.  The fairest way is to just give rewards to everyone in the event who isn't literally idle.  There's already an idle timer in the game - it's when the camera detaches from the player.  Use that, or another timer just like it with a different delay.
---
Because otherwise there will **always** be edge cases where someone is participating, or trying to participate, and unable to get the reward.
---
Yeah, yeah, all it takes is to run around doing nothing, or have some software do it for you.  No system can perfectly prevent asshats ruining things.  This is, I am sure, the fairest option.
---
I used the serum and am seeing a huge damage difference. Thanks guys!
---
Yeah I suggested this a month ago but people said that it would be hard to monitor and avoid just being a spamming system by players. But I would like the same thing. Just to be able to say 'hey who has x and y for sale' or 'come to this event' etc. Would br helpful.
---
Me everyday : Get Launch codes / Best places to get uranium / Best places arround Appalachia to launch a Nuke
---
A long time isn't a month. 
---
Month is a Quick and easy grind.
---
Long time is more along 6-12 months and a long...time is more like 1-2 years.
---
You kids need to learn patience and not expect everything given to you immediately.
---
Well nobody but yours because of course you're right. Nobody else. Just you
---
PLEAAAASE, just look around. We are talking about USA. One of the worst and parano countries
---
You wouldnt happen to know which weapons i could craft because i have a decent weapons to run around with but i kind of wanting to start making my own legendary guns.. i just have no idea where or how to do all of it
---
You are only able to craft legendary versions of weapons and armor where the plan was bought with bullion.
---
Forever unless stated otherwise.
---
Ahhh that helps thank you my fellow falloutian
---
They should just make a bank as a fast travel point on the map. Somwhere you can pay a fee to store your caps. That or make the safe able to store caps in your base. The more safes, the more caps.
---
You might be thinking of gun-fu it‚Äôs in agility I think. After each kill it switches to the next available target.
---
Survival tent explit/bug
---
I personally have never launched a nuke, never wanted to, never needed to, but I do now have the appropriate trophy due to the wonderful new player teams feature, I just hid in a quiet corner, and the trophy popped when the other team members completed the nuke launch. So now I will never need to do that thing I didn't need to do, again.
---
I have a very distinct feeling that they'll be on the atom store.
---
No problem. Basically just the new stuff that came with wastelanders.
---
They were first added to the game to craft the vault armors from the vault raids that ended up removed with wastelanders.  You can now but those plans with bullion too now.
---
When the legendary run menu is open I think you can like press a hotkey that opens up a level up option for 150 atoms.
---
Shhh.
---
I personally kick off a player from my builder team if this perk is shared by him.
---
Im sure about secret service armore and plasma caster, gauss shotgun, gauss minigun and gauss pistol
---
I‚Äôd like to know just HOW MUCH raw damage they do. Like, what are their attack stats, that sort of thing. Last I checked I couldn‚Äôt find any resources but good god, Meatball Man doesn‚Äôt give a fck about armor.
---
You can‚Äôt even exchange them for ammo like you could in previous games, because of the insane markup for everything in the stores.
---
Hahahaa.
---
Buy the plans frome the guy in the end of the wastlanders storyline
---
If i disnt just start my 12 hour nightshift I would have jumped on with my new character as my main has bugged challenges and ive been waiting for double exp to start over.
---

---
I've been finding him here a lot lately.
---
Only problem with increased cap is the price of stuff will go up cause the limit is raised but totally agree I had 3 weapons in my vendors over 10k different builds some bought the first went up to 1975cap then second 2975 last one he bought was a gamma gun that was up at 15000 I think I saw 300 caps out of it grr I was in middle of something and was bought to finish and turn off my vendors but to late. 
---
But I do agree a limit stopper would be nice
---
Not a bug, not an exploit. Just blocking a spawn point. 
---
They either remove survival tents from the game and refund all those people who payed real money for FO1st or make all spawn point areas in the game non buildable, that would hugely impact the games C.A.M.P system.
---
Don't talk to me or my son ever again.
---
I'm more of a daddy's girl
---
Been a long time since I've used concentrated fire but from what I remember it defaults to the last body part targeted whenever you vats onto a new target.
---
The dense mod itself seems to mitigate about 80%, if you want full immunity put 2 points to Fireproof and it can't damage you.
---
Concentrated fire (PER) you can target limbs. If you aim for a head in vats and kill the target the next target you vats will already be aiming at the head.
---
Gun-fu also help with this a bit more if you have concentrated fire. As it automaticly aims at the next target automaticly.
---
Having both of them you can auto target enemies easily and it will aim for the body part you last chose.
---
Yeah, Gun-Fu is the perk card I have. That works great. And concerntrated fire does let me pick a part, but I think VATS always goes back to torso when picking new targets.
---
Blocking a spawn point is an exploit.
---
Ward...
---
Ward never changes.
---
[Have a seat.](https://imgur.com/gallery/s40chuv)
---
And to answer the question yeah I bloody hope so hope they make getting the other one easier or quest items been grinding forbidden knowledge for month now lol
---
Kill a Brahmin?
---
They would need to fix them first.
---
Crazy that it's the first time you've seen this.  I haven't been to a normal line in the sand for around 1 month now.  Every fricken time someone has their tent there.
---
For a month before that it would happen occasionally and there was almost always someone's tent out there, but in the wrong spot to make it work lol.
---
Oh, nice. I‚Äôll probably buy some
---
As the other comment said, Brahmin is needed. Most basic recipes will be automatically learned when picking up the necessary ingredients- in this case, Brahmin meat.
---
When I get to 25k caps, I buy a new serum blueprint, or some other expensive plan
---
If they where to remove the tents I (as an australian) would be eligible to get a refund for every fallout 1st ive purchased. So i don't think they would do that.
---
As for stopping them from putting down tents in spawn points I think that could work. There are very few places that have an issue with tents affecting spawn points so they could just make them no tent zones. The problem is these areas can just be stood in and has a similar effect.
---
Stealth suit negates the cloud effect so either posion or radiation's
---
Yea two shot is not good.
---
This is my guess. Two shot hits the armor twice and each of the 2 shots is so heavily reduced already it becomes a weak bullet hose. Maybe try with AA cards?
---
Great, if the thing I said doesn't show up just look it up on the internet for a sec. Because I've seen the option being there but I'm not sure if I remembered correctly though.
---
Look at Path of Exile for good communication, the devs explain whats being patched or corrected, why its being so and what they hope to achieve fx with nerfs, if things dont work out they simply admit so and change it again based on feedback.
---
The damage shown in your pipboy doesn't account for DR.
---
reowrk it because its total trash. its only about the perk coins tho and im scared they are stupid enough to release it that way
---
Was it your friends quest (are they the host of the group) and have they actually started the quest themselves or was it someone else?
---
Fallout 76 NW
---
Cheating... Cheating never changes.
---
How were they able to get ahold of Bethesda and actually get them to look over their account so early?
---
It‚Äôs a great place to exist. Like you said, potter around, adjust your camp, meet new people and check out others camps. The last grind for me is just reaching full Rep with crater, to get the ammo producer. I‚Äôve got 90 treasury notes sitting about because I‚Äôve hit gold cap, even tho I have all the SS armour, and mods for it. It‚Äôs so good that I don‚Äôt even use my PA anymore!
---
They‚Äôre scumbags. I have 430ish DR and if they get a double tap on me, I‚Äôm crippled, staggered and can‚Äôt get away or stimpak. They‚Äôre absolute shitbags
---
Drop them a serum or 3. They can get caps from an npc vendor. You might have to message and tell them so a level 5 doesn't use a marsupial.
---
They sometimes don't add on until you log off and go back on. I had this happen when I was doing lots in a row. Think the server doesn't register it until you log off. You should get them once you close game and go back on.
---
He's only just figured that out thanks
---
This doesn't fit. OP isn't asking for refunding stuff prior to his ban, but after where Beth had no right to the money.
---
Yeah around 25k I turn off my vendors and go round buying ammo or plans.
---
This happened to me. I'm not guna lie. Launching a nuke seems like a lot of unnecessary hassle and I was just trying to finish quest. Was quite pleased üòÇ
---
Stood in? I had not thought of that, would need more precise placement I guess.
---
Spawn points then must be actual small points in world space, I'm going to try this on private and see if can find the exact spawn point for Line in the sand.
---
Build a actual shop with a garage door. turn off the power to it and it shuts everything down.
---
There is supposed to be work around for this bug. Activate VATS three times before shooting and it should work.
---
That said I hate the bug and don't use snipers because of this.
---
Since you were banned before the renewal took place you have a legit claim to do a charge back. Talk to your bank to get it initiated.
---
Yeh, I suppose it is, not cheating though, exploiting game mechanics.
---
I dunno.my best damage dealing gun is a twoshot explosive auto combat rifle. I melt a lot of non legendaries with it. I would love to try a AA explosive instead.
---
Delete ths üíî
---
There is no point to buy ranks until the last day, because with buying easier levels and keep leveling after, you just make it harder for yourself.
---
lol if u care about ur karma delete this topic...
---
I haven't had one since wastelanders, I'm on Xbox
---
Two shot explosive is decend but normal ts is not that great since the damage hits the armor twice per shot what reduces it even more than already.
---
I‚Äôve closed the game, waited a couple of minutes, and gone back on TWICE now and nothing.
---
Some plants should be only harvestable in the wild, it gives a purpose for exploration and scavenging hunts
---
Delete this ASAP
---
Yes, very often. PC
---
I feel you on this but that‚Äôs the game. I just solo the SBQ because that‚Äôs happened to me. Even people who you think are your friends, have taken my loot. I get it‚Äôs boring but it‚Äôs worse when you did all that work for nothing while leeches profit.
---
u the kid who tells the teacher class had to do homework for today
---
That‚Äôs one way, but sadly locked doors mean little in this game due to a photomode glitch where you can phase right through them. If someone really wants to get to your vendors, then they will.
---
That Feel when you wanted to buy that water wheel. But it was only in the bundle.
---
cores.. not magazines and that is why i scrip every gatling plazma
---
X-01 mods applies to t-65 helmet
---
Cant really explain where exactly it is. But on the rocks opposite the road passing by the front gate. The scorched won't spawn at the beacon like with the tent they will spawn at the far hole in the wall/fence within shooting range.
---
Mine is bugged.  Anytime I come to camp it is closed.  When I open it suddenly it is open and started closing
---
He'll be fine.
---
Faster loading times.... unless bethesda decides to upgrade to the next gen consoles and optimise the game not much will change.
---
I do hope they do upgrade the game as I will still be playing for a few more years on console unless they bring in cross platform save (which they probably won't) as i dont want to start over but do want to play on PC.
---
I have a lot of stories about that fucking ghouls...too many.
---
Less player on consoles?
---
Well, SS armor is it the way to go I guess? ( DO NOT BUY HELMET ).
---
...this post convinced me that I need to get really drunk and play Fallout 76 so that I can score a priceless double legendary.
---
When have bugs ever stopped them from doing something?
---
My ultracite gatling laser, any gatling plasma and my combat rifle all do this for some reason. My combat rifle decides to reload when it gets down to 10 bullets for no reason what so ever.
---
Unfortunately the best bet is server hop until you find someone selling plans for cheap. That or do lots of public events and enemies and legendarys sometimes drop good plans. You are better to try just buy a legendary weapon 3* with the things you want on it that is level 50. It's cheaper and easier to do that. Crafting only comes into it when you want to for example customise your legendary deathclaw gauntlet and you unlock extra claw for more damage. It's just down to luck really.
---
I can agree as well but sometimes they got to learn that a lot of people dont play nice. I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm a jerk but you really should worry about yourself and make the right decision to be greedy or a great neighbor. If you‚Äôre new, be on your toes and hit everything in a blind rage!!
---
Everyone I know had 100+ perk packs for NW due to some weird accidental glitch with specific challenges in adventure, I on the other hand being 100 levels higher than them had 4 or 5, I love how every aspect of this fucking game is riddled like a whore with glitches to the point that avoiding them is like crossing a fucking minefield drunk and with clown shoes on.
---
Make sure you spawn next to a cliff and just jump off
---
The SS armor is the way to go if you dont use PA. BUTRESS mods after you get the original plans.
---
SS armor is a great choice for most builds.
---
If you are a melee build also get the underarmor and shielding lining as its +4STR. Gauntlet from settlers is also great.
---
Or the jetpack (yet) and you would want the buttressed mod for the best DR possible
---
Ive been in a SQB event where a player was doing Herbert the pervert impressions, they were quite good tbf and funny especially when he said ‚Äò get your fat ass back over here‚Äô to the sbq when she flew off.
---
Strange. I would submit a ticket but that's pretty much a dead end. It may take until server daily refresh to add. Going off and in seemed to work for me. Hope it sorts. Atoms especially for non fallout 1st players are valuable.
---
They almost definitely won‚Äôt re-release the game or ‚Äòremaster‚Äô it to any degree, I can‚Äôt see it being very good for the popularity of the game if it becomes a backwards compatible AND brokenly buggy game, do you think it will still have as big a team as it has now?
---
I sont recommend that back room in lucky mine though that sound ü§Æü§Æ
---
Doesn't actually stop the problem, the person currently shopping will still be able to purchase even from an offline vendor, all a powered vendor does is advertise it on the map, doesn't affect buying capabilities, plus if I'm on the opposite side of the world when that happens I can't do it anyway even if it did anything useful
---
Shhhhh let the boy believe in kindness..
---
Probably more of a stagnant player base right? Less support and more buggy maybe
---
Hey I know 2 people already said this but Batteries included might work
---
Sorry to be a pain but can I have the jet pack with the as armour? I should really know this stuff when I'm level 118 üòÇ.
---
Does not matter, sometimes it load one when you log in a server and sometimes it even autoreloads one when it is still charge in the core.
---
I've an AAE combat rifle set for auto but it kicks like a mule, luckily I found an assault rifle thats Furious/Explosive that I forgot I had so I'm going to switch to it, far more manageable.
---
Also found a Vampire handmade recently, that's going to come into service as a backup weapon.
---
There's also the Final Word of course and a furious UGL but I've had to switch to rifleman as I'm burned up my ammo supply for both.
---
Well there is a flipside to that coin. 
---
Sometimes it will be beneficial to reload your weapon to full when you have small downtime before combat continues. Than to wait until you are attacked again with you having only 5 ammo left. For example in pvp when you move behind a corner or wall and have few seconds you would want to reload. 
---
If you have a bad habbit of reloading your weapon when you don't want to.. Just teach yourself not to press the reload button. Or even remap the reload key to some other key to stop those involuntary musclememory reloads.
---
RIP indeed. I'm done too.
---
Mine is when 2 super mutants find a floater and keeps it as a pet. Then they get murdered by me, of course.
---
You just want a pay to win game.
---
I think it will depend on backward compatibility or Bethesda comping existing players for next gen versions.
---
I've only been saving mine since Wastelanders, have a few decent ones but definitely trying to up my game... These are great üëç
---
I don‚Äôt understand why you would buy them now with so much of the season left... are you not planning on playing for the rest of the season?
---
All that‚Äôs going to happen is you‚Äôll be level 100 and won‚Äôt be able to progress the pass any further, I would slightly understand if you could level it up for rewards after 100.
---
Like I‚Äôm excited for the fireplace but I can just design my CAMP around it and add it in after I unlock it.
---
What are you wanting you unlock so badly?
---
No, Just No. Don't give em any ideas.
---
I hate the rng too but I really don't think that would be fair, just my opinion. Good luck on your grind though
---
You are right in some things, but the real problem is when I join a server, I have my GP with a full core, not he last core I had...
---
that's literally pay to win, as a Fallout 1st member, I am not okay with that.
---
I play on what I think is off times, And casually, so I don't see many of the bugs I see posted here. I actually learn about and how to use them here usually.
---
Once you got to the ‚Äúinaccessible‚Äù part is when you should‚Äôve got on Reddit. And the fact that you‚Äôre a first member is because you wanted to be, Bethesda doesn‚Äôt require it to play the game. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not trying to be a dick. But you can play this game completely from beginning to end without forking over in nickel except for your online access online access wether it be Xbox live or just the Internet
---
I love Lunchboxes but hope that after Legendary Run they get added as rewards to events like SBQ with repair kits as that would work well.
---
Thanks just frustrated been grinding for month and there is new players dropping the bundle of out fits lol I'm so jealous and unlucky
---
On the normal and patriot version, the mutes variant is broken, the chest talks too.
---
With the shadowed, it is fully muted?
---
"Hear me out, I have a bad luck, so I want to be able pay to win"
---
It is a silly name in my opinion. All that happens in a building team is you get  +1 experience point for being in a team (even if you are the only member). For every other member, once the bond forms (blue bar above each name) you get +1 Intelligence per bond/member.
---
Each Intelligence point = 2% extra XP
---
Yeah didn't think of that yeah scratch that just give everyone a better drop rate for items
---
If they're smart, they'll add them as rewards for the boss events (SBQ and the colossus one), but then again this is Bethesda so when were they ever smart.
---
WAIT UNTIL THE END OF THE SEASON!!!
---
For all you know you‚Äôll beat the villain.
---
as others mentioned allready,
---
the twoshot effect splits your damage evenly between two projectiles, 
---
meaning that when you hit an enemy you do two lower damage shots with a combined damage thats 25%(maybe 20 i cant remember) higher than your single shot would do.
---
the problem is that due to those projectiles having lower damage individually they suffer more from enemies DR wich isnt accounted for when you look at the damage numbers in your pipboy
---
if you shoot a car or an enemy with zero damage resistance your shots should say 20 and 21 but as soon as you fight armored enemies the damage gets reduces quite heavily
---
Mate that‚Äôs a big difference from hackers to someone not reviving your. You‚Äôve clearly just had this happen and are in a bad mood and trying to vent. Still.. think about what you‚Äôre saying. What‚Äôs worse losing a little flux or having someone buy stuff out of your storage?
---
Because that was a previous glitch.
---
Sony has said that PS4 games will work on the new PS5 system. So I don‚Äôt see any reason why it wouldn‚Äôt work.
---
Bad luck doesn't come close but yeah I see your point maybe better drop rates for all
---
Haha, suffer metabitch
---
Yeah I just tested this again by doing radiation rumble, I earned at least 30,000 xp
---
i am also interested to know the answer to this
---
take the friendly fire perk, join public group with radspngoe and be sure to hit every bloodied player as often as possible.
---
Can confirm i have had lots of expressive communication from them. haven't read all as thanks is not required. it's what i am here for.
---
Hopefully won't drop frame rate much
---
Yeah, it is double legacy :) Nice find!
---
The Nuka Cola seller in the Whitespring sells them, along with other unique flavors like Orange, Dark and Wild, and there might be one in the Nuka Cola nut's room in the Eta Psi frat house.
---
Have to admit I‚Äôve only ever been in a building team by accident mistaking it for events lol
---
I don‚Äôt think I does that for me. It‚Äôs a standard to me, I‚Äôm a rifleman and couldn‚Äôt live without concentrated fire
---
I was hoping that wasn‚Äôt going to be the case, that and the lunchboxes were the only rewards I was looking forward to..
---
The poor guy needs help.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/1iDSol8.png](https://i.imgur.com/1iDSol8.png)
---
Didn't Sony say the top 100 game will work out of the box then they will add more
---
Nothing really. They‚Äôll probably just update it so that it‚Äôs playable on both generations and move on with whatever else they plan to do with the game
---
Or not give a shit. It is only caps and they are easy to get.
---
I'm a completionist. I want to finish everything there is even if there are no meaningful rewards i would really really want or need. The reasoning behind my choice to buy (which didn't happen) was that i'm tired of being forced to play the game everyday just for the dailies if i wish to eventually finish the season. I already did 67 ranks that way. So if i had bought the remaining ranks i would have been "freed" from that chore for the rest of the season.
---
What we actually need is a better way to buy, sell and advertise stuff. Then if your luck sucks, at least you can try the market.
---
If it takes you two games now, it‚Äôs probably gonna take 10 when you get up in the 90s. Just a guess tho, I‚Äôm only lvl 26 in NW
---
This. I already own all the serum plans and am now working my way through Power Armor plans. Once that‚Äôs done I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôll do as I already own all the non-PA plans from vendors
---
Good idea, it would give me and many others something to do when we bought all we want, now we either grind gold till 5000 and stop, but this would allow us to continue and gain some atoms.
---
Yeah checked your stored tab in build menu
---
Techincally, junkies does not need any special build, nor perk cards, just 5 addiction.
---
They patched it ages ago to still target the same spot when it switches.
---
It's with the walls. There are 2 red rocket doors and only one works with this.
---
First piece I'll buy then
---
But while you‚Äôre in the workshop, if you do any of the ‚Äúbuild up‚Äù challenge, It will use the workshops resources first
---
You don't need PA to run Bloodied.
---
Do you play on PC with a similar user name?
---
Intelligence boosts your BASE exp gain so it stacks in a multiplicative fashion with % EXP bonuses, like lunchboxes.
---
So if you're using something like a Lunchbox, Canned Meat Stew and Inspirational 3, +4 Int represents a much more significant amount of experience than just 8%.
---
Lever for Rifleman, make Handmade Auto auto go commando (if bloodied, literally pwn the wasteland)
---
ü§£ü§£
---
The vendors at the shoping mile in whitesprings are selling most of the weaponplans. There are some rarer which you wont find there. They are rewards from events or you are lucky and find them by exploring appalachia. Grahm (the super mutant random vendor) also sells some of the rarer plans. And for the modifications you have to craft the weapons and scrap them. Use super duper for crafting and berry mentats for scraping. More INT increases the chance to learn a mod when scraping stuff
---
What effects would those be?
---
For non bloodied / junkies build AA is really good and for ground control mayhem TS Ffr is maybe best.
---
Mole miner gauntlet, pick one up
---
If it hasn‚Äôt been duped you sure as hell wouldn‚Äôt have been able to trade for one with a tse fixer..
---
Do you mean stable flux? If so, yes, it will show up as junk in vendors
---
Same. My solution was finding player vendors with rare plans / legendaries, friending them and writing their names in a special note. Took a while to find them but now I'm collecting Fixer plans :-D
---
While absolutely true, and the best way to handle it.. The reasoning to *my* choice (which eventually didn't happen) to buy the remaining 33 ranks (if my memory serves me right) was that i'm tired of being forced to log in everyday to do the dailies. I just wanted to finish the whole thing so i don't have to worry about it anymore. And have the ability to stop playing for couple days or a week or two if i so choose.
---
I've got some Atoms from the challenges for sure, but I'm also pretty sure I'm missing some. It's annoying that there's no way to check what you've completed versus what you've spent. A transaction history in your account would be most useful, but doesn't exist.
---
Recently yup, On Xbox
---
Agreed, its like sheep squatch needs to charge more, make a animation where it shows its about to hoof it at you. Bring back deathclaws ability to pick you up and add a pinned to the ground fro sheepy. But have it so if you time it right you can stab/bash it in the eye. No prompts like quick time events just time it right and bam, stun it for a moment to get free. Or throw a live grenade in its mouth, time it wrong biffs its head nade lands at feet damages you both and pisses it off. If you have one handed weapons try to aim and hit its face while team tries to free you.
---
Another legendary buff lifesaver, gurantees that you'll at least be downed, even if the effect doesn't revive you itll allow team mates a chance late game where you usually just die.
---
You can also just jump inside with a jetpack or marsupial. Inside is an X-Cell spawn - very valuable for people who want that.
---
I would love to do PvP in ESO but not in FalloutüíÄ
---
Yeah or if you do say 250 or higher of the same event the items drops. Yeah be nice I've managed to get some of the items o want but I've literally been doing 100 events a day  and not got anything for it
---
Ooooh, I'll have to join some teams I think
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind this but then max caps would be pointless cause you could get a friend to take all your caps and buy something Then you would leave it on the box essentially increasing you maximum caps aloud.
---
It needs to happen
---
What-About-ism. Your question is related to this topic how?
---
There's a cap limit?
---
My favourite melee with the extra blade
---
I block people like this, leave NW and then find a new match. Very rarely do I end up in the same match as them again. If everyone blocks them they‚Äôre gonna be very lonely.
---
Oh and report them!
---
Does the Shadow Prime skin work with the T-65 Power Armor?
---
Less player on console means they have to pay less to Sony for patches...
---
Id like a toggleable server voice/text chat option
---
Yeah I'd like this or something similar. Sold a tattered Field jacket for 15000 and I had 22000. Was annoying knowing id basically lost 7k caps.
---
I'm a collector, so know the pain heh. I had some nice luck with the Pleasant Valley tickets, though, and got the cowboy outfits fairly quickly. Which was nice.
---
I play on PC so I have no clue, but is FO76 really in top 100 on console?
---
Whats a legacy? Like a weapon you camt get anymore?
---
Pretty sure its because of the Fingernails.
---
Or Toenails.
---
Yep. Players and AI can kill it.  Environmental damage can as well, for example, if your camp loads in a nuke zone, the rads will kill it.
---
Not a chance that's why I don't think it will be backwards compatible on the ps5 straight away . Mybe intime since it went on game pass ever one playing it on Xbox it's jumped up the ranks
---
Might have to expand my content from mostly dry humping dead bodies..... great talent there for finding those awesome shots
---
This. Explosive energy weapons and "double" anything were both removed shortly after launch.
---
If anything. Todd loves a good re release so hopefully he will try get it cross platform. Cant see it though as Sony are dicks when it comes down to it.
---
I didn't have any drive to collect didn't keep any of the outfits you get by playing the story only kept the scout mask luckily then I got my mask in faschnact and  first asylum dress and I'm hooked I'm playing all day searching vendors asylum and doing ever event I can
---
If I'm reading this correctly and youre saying youre at rank 67 of the run you can already take up to maybe more than a month off and still complete it. Assuming when you come back youre grinding half as hard as you are now. 
---
Youre way ahead of the curve even with 2x exp. I've been doing mainly dailys no grinding haven't missed a day missed two or 3 dailys and im at 44.
---
Yes often PS4 especially freezing when going into the map
---
u can run both factions chain of missions up to the heist.
---
They were part of the very first banwave and had their account deactivated, so the running theory is that they're going through harshest punishment first.
---
Maybe give you 12 hours to withdraw the caps or then you lose them.
---
good to know but that quesltine is glitched on my main char. smh
---
When I am in a team now and someone is sharing that card I was shooting a sheep sqautch and every vat hit was head shot over and over again.
---
I don't have any but want to be around when it happens &gt;_&gt;
---
This is an old post. Athena now shares the same caps pool with the train vendors now.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects
---
It's not hard to get them, there is Double XP weekend.
---
How much did you buy for?
---
It's fixed now,unless a new method has already been found.
---
Shouldn't it be Stop &amp; shop?
---
ah. thanks.  you know any way to unglitch the commander? shes on the floor in the bunker. dailog wont go any furthur.
---
You just have to kill a Brahmin and cook it under the meat option on the cooking station. Just check you‚Äôve got wood or it won‚Äôt show up as craftable option
---
I'm imagining a kazoo cover of "One They Fear" from Skyrim
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a9wogg/event_related_cosmetics_reward_list_full/  
---
Might be useful if you've not seen it already.
---
I did not know they can still buy from an unpowered vender! I apoligise lol
---
Good hits on the queen.  No big deal one shotting mutants.  I would take off makeshift perk, it‚Äôs easy to fix mele weapons.  Put 3 points into agility.
---
While true, rank 63 is the mid point when you look at the total score needed to get to rank 100 from rank 1. So i would have to grind roughly the same amount that i have already done. But yea, i'm well aware i could take a break already. But.. I have the tendency to extend those breaks. If i bought the remaining ranks i would not have to worry about the whole season anymore.
---
Thanks I haven't seen it before üòä
---
It‚Äôs very hard to grind nuclear winter when I get disconnected every match, and in adventure too.
---
Its dumb
---
A long time ago you could actually create team with yourself. Found it by misstake was kind of funny.
---
Do you not hear the Many singing to you, telling you of the glory that is to come?
---
Have they stopped emptying gatling plasmas every time you switch to another weapon yet? That was a huge pain.
---
Why don‚Äôt you try playing something else? If this game irritated me as much as it does you, I‚Äôd probably do something else?
---
Did you try relogging? As well as shutting down the System?
---
Same happened to me, then I selected a speech option referring to his brother‚Äôs health or location (can‚Äôt remember exactly) and he commented that all‚Äôs well with his little bro. Definitely a bug, and no adverse effects as far as I can see.
---
52
---
Yep! 30,000 I reach it once a week, just before I buy 6,000 bullion from Smiley.
---
There's a few problems with this request regrettably, I want 'em too. &gt;\_&lt;  
---
1 - Bethesda can't just up and add new weapons without a reason. I mean, they could - But it doesn't follow their development trend. New weapons are always added with either new events or story content. I'd say your best shot for these weapons anytime soon is expeditions in late 2020 - early 2021, doubt the BoS is gonna arrive with them.  
---
2 - If they do come, they'll likely come as skins. Real world weapons seem to fall lower on the priority list as far as I can tell, getting implemented as skins rather than brand new weapons. Sucks big time, but I expect they'll keep knocking out classic Fallout weapons before they even touch real world stuff.
---
I've had to do that so often and I feel SO BAD!!! :(
---
I'm thinking I may just save the game play (PS Share), review the footage, then send em a message or something, though.
---
It's hideous.  The original camo paintjob is much better.
---
Well ok the first part is correct,even tho I still stand by my point.
---
The second part,I don't care how holy immaculate you are; if you want to trade it,you'll have to fave the fact right now the market is at a really low point and nothing have much value at all.  During the dupe I trade the top items just 1:1 with not so top level items.
---
Power armor.
---
I mostly use teams as a means for free fast travel. I'll even swap teams real quick if I see someone close to where I need to be and they're on an open team.
---
And then buy another 3000 to try get the role you want
---
So no worries for me
---
On Xbox. yes I have. its been like this for several weeks now.
---
Piper's outfit wasn't invented by Piper?   
---
It's a pre-war coat, hat and goggles.
---
I hear you and I ain‚Äôt tryna bash the game but are these stealthy players also not forming pub teams?
---
I bought the helmet and I love it, so much better than the pipboy light, though it is rather expensive so I bought it last!
---
You tell my level 20 melee one shooting is nothing special ü§îü§î
---
Just curious if you have to buy the plans for the plasma caster with bullion or can you just find it?
---
Well actually - I finished the run 8 days ago and was using them with other people how you are trying to do now for the later ranks.  Saved a handful for the start of double xp but have burned through em so I been having the most success just mentioning lunchboxes during events for people to pop em.
---
I meant when I am downed. I dont have time to just sit there.
---
Lol okay I don‚Äôt have Snapchat either down vote that too
---
I‚Äôm just looking for a live server
---
wait can you select the photos you took for loading screens? I thought it was random
---
When you do send the ticket make sure to also include the character name that has the bugged quest or else they won‚Äôt know which character to choose that you play.
---
I believe you just got really really lucky
---
I don't really find it detrimental to gameplay tbh, especially with jetpack, it's actually kinda helpful for sniping enemies who are hiding behind obstacles.
---
I wish they would increase the limit on all currencies.
---
Add me on steam, GOLIATH\_946
---
lol no it isn't, if a spawn point is blocked they should just recode them to spawn from multiple areas. I'm sure it isn't that hard, they just don't care. If the spawn point is blocked by a tent, it means they sold a FO1st membership.
---
Mission. Accomplished.
---
Anybody know how to mute this?  It rips me right out of the game. (PC)
---
All the forum ideas don't seem to work with the Legendary Run groups.
---
It's been publicly known for weeks...
---
Great idea, would be good for helping newcomers who might not know exactly what they're doing yet or just low level as well.
---
I also bought the helmet and love it. The light is great. So much better than that weak pipboy light.  Plus it looks cool. I also bought it to round out my armor set as I had all the other pieces + jetpack.
---
i just posted on the support page. would an email be better? was trying to find the email link.
---
We *do* have the same shoe size.
---
No, I don‚Äôt know how many times I‚Äôve accidentally targeted the leg of a ghoul and killed them and vats to the next target still targeting the leg
---
I get friendly with my self regularly and it never causes a crash.
---
Have you tried finding their name on the Social tab and muting them?
---
Had the same thing happen yesterday.
---
I‚Äôve killed him in sundew grove once and that area by the scenic overlook 3 times
---
Yeah you can‚Äôt spam the vendors or stash boxes. I‚Äôve gotten lucky, I put skins on my weapons and armor if possible because I almost sold one of my vanguard combat pieces
---
Cant carry more than 1 anymore...
---
Yea a number of teams as team leader I wanted to change the team type so selected my name but, instead of the usual options, I could fast travel to me, kick me from team etc.
---
I've narrated the Encryptid event in a golf-announcing voice before. Teammates loved it.
---
"Ah yes, there goes Player X. A sharp eye, shotgunning that imposter sheepsquatch in the chest cavity. Brilliant play. Player Y approaches the Major Gutsy to the west and - yes - he's down. Another skilled move by Player Y. The imposter sheepsquatch makes his move on Player Z, and Player Z is just devastated by these results..."
---
I have a TSA lever action and combat rifle. I switch to Instigating explosive lever action and bloodied explosive combat rifle. I do not.miss two shot. I dont know why people were so desperate to get one. It's not good.
---
Yep me too
---
They can't. He's just bitching to bitch. That's literally the point of vendors needing power.
---
try logout and login (just in case). sometimes that solves a problem like this.
---
Because I like some parts of the game yet I hate some of it also. I can close my eyes on some bugs and use workarounds for another bugs but I start to getting tired of all this.
---
Check the roof for the 2 missing items or perhaps store the shed and they might appear in stored too. Not sure what to do about the smoke machine though.
---
Just when I think I've seen everything in a location...
---
Thanks for answering!
---
If it goes higher people will charge way more for the same items. I say nay
---
Show me what that mouth do, and maybe we have a deal
---
That‚Äôs not what OP is getting at.
---
Look at the picture.
---
It LITERALLY has no reward tied to the achievement.
---
They work automatically now
---
Ohhh, ok. My bad. Wasn‚Äôt trying to be a smart ass. I was serious. GL man
---
Just added.
---
Oh cool thanks. I was hoping i was actually using the perk correctly
---
I just want you to know I could HEAR this hah, updoot.
---
That's fair. I can't help but agree with the majority of your post for being factual and reasonably accurate but I do have to disagree with your post on one point. You list not having to farm for legendaries as a benefit, whereas I see not being able to farm for legendaries as a detriment
---
Xbox has been very quiet lately. Ban waves probably, either ghost towns or low levels all over the place is what I'm seeing
---
That happens in structures you build but in premade buildings they disappear into the roof not on top.
---
Enjoy it while it lasts. Usually when that happens to me it shuts down not long after.
---
Oh like the fridge? Yeah that ended well.
---
They aren‚Äôt flirting.
---
They can, power just advertises it on the map!
---
What are they doing then
---
For people like me that have bought all of the serum recipes and every single plan from every single NPC, we have nothing left to buy.
---
 I usually end up buying encrypted cards which I have a stack of about 20 right now.  I also buy all the ballistic fiber bundles when I see them.
---
The only other things I buy are 5.56 and .45 ammo from player venders.
---
 There needs to be a serious cap sink other than the smiley bullion dude.
---
I haven‚Äôt a clue. I‚Äôve seen silly stuff like non legendary weapons and armor for 5,000+ caps.
---
It's a reference to two chat bots having a conversation with each other
---
Nice.
---
I have wasted a shit load of Gold on Shit :-)
---
The only worthwhile piece of kit so far is my SS unyielding Chest Piece.
---
Limbs are useless without deep pockets..
---
Get all three tiers of lockpick. Level 3 locked containers can spawn plans for weapons.
---
Turn all their lights off before you leave and empty their extractors and collections if you can
---
On the roof of Poseidon power plant in a small trailer is a lev ten hazmat suit if your still looking for one
---
That doesn't change the fact that it is an exploit. I'm nit arguing semantics, it is what it is.
---
Yes you can buy from unpowered venders.  The only thing power does is make you appear on the map.
---
 The confidence in your answer was kind of cool but you are dead wrong.
---
That won‚Äôt help much they would just say to submit a ticket through their website. You should have a Bethesda account linked to your fallout 76. 
---
Log onto Bethesda with the account that is linked and go here.
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/home
---
Lol. The fightback begins.
---
Fortnite does this.
---
I leave all their doors open. And if they have a room locked, power armor glitch in, turn off lights, and leave a bag of spoiled food to let them know someone got past their locked door.
---
Yeah, I'm also doing this when 25k+/-.
---
Ive seen a few of those. Most people are good and vend crappy weapons at a reasonable rate. But others good grief. My fave so far?  30000 for one toxic goo. You would be pretty drunk to nab that one.
---
That is a good idea. It sucks when you hit max while someone purchases a really expensive item and you get no caps or barely any. It should go into some kind of storage that is only accessible by you and can be deposited into your inventory when you drop below max. I do think it should be limited if they intend to keep a maximum limit of caps as Azure_Wolf stated. Perhaps a 10K limit or increase the cap limit to 40k and make it 5K. It would also be awesome to have some remote control in the Pip-Boy when you reach near your max that allows you to disable your vendors (also remove your camp from the map as a vendor) until you can manage your caps. Just a thought.
---
If you get the perks and gear right, it can be tankier than power armor!
---
They‚Äôre based on this. https://youtu.be/Tv2CiA1taF0
---
Is it it totally went over my head lol üòÇ
---
I‚Äôve noticed there‚Äôs not been that many people on Xbox lately probably these bans have something to do with it.
---
Store the structure and then just place it back down. It‚Äôll store the items stuck in the prefab as well. 
---
And this is a way advanced tip, but I always try to leave enough in my budget to build a little walkway underneath the camp. Like an underground camp, but just to retrieve things that may initially get lost. I had to retrieve my camp module this way when I accidentally sunk it too far underground yesterday
---
Shotguns are bad but this was the worst by a Mile.
---
You had to see it to believe it.
---
Mole Miner stood point blank in front..
---
Gauss shot when all around his Silhouette.
---
it was actually really funny.
---
Firing off 4 Shots and he was chasing me,.
---
I always like to Road test all my weapons under various conditions.
---
For instance i use a bloodied Tesla for Camp Fire Tales.
---
50 Cal for heat of the swamp.
---
Bloodied Pipe Rifle on Uranium fever.reason being it needs 2 shots to kill,so i always fire off 1 shot and let others get off a shot.
---
Different weapon for every event.
---
That 2 shot Gauss Shotgun with 3% accuracy is the worst weapon i have ever owned, in 370+ levels.
---
Thorn armor is really good for stealth characters. I just made a full set the other day and it's actually pretty amazing. I'm just glad I can wear something over it because it looks so stupid.
---
I feel foolish lol üòÖ
---
Wow, you're super certain but super wrong. Kudos
---
Because when people get to 30k caps they have to spend it on something! Or they just want to keep them but would be ok with letting them go at a what they consider a decent price..
---
Or finally god forbid they are playing for themselves and not you :)
---
So it is a exploit
---
They are saving it,
---
After the secret service armor, get the ammo converter from the Raiders.  It requires max rep with them.  Settlers have a fertilizer machine.  Me personally, I got the chest piece, the jet pack, and the ammo converter.  Then got the underarmor and shielded mod.  Using other unyielding armor pieces for now.
---
Chat volume off under Audio
---
Sure hate Capitalism.
---
I get all of that. I just find it a little disheartening. I offer my crap at 50 caps a pop.
---
Same. Of course I didn‚Äôt get the helmet right away. I waited til I had pretty much everything else I wanted first. But I wear that helmet more than my deathclaw mask now because of the flashlight.
---
I think you are right. If you equip both arms you get the 4x ore harvesting from veins. Built you only get the +100 carry weight with the full 6 piece set. 
---
It‚Äôs worth it to get all the pieces.
---
Actually it does suck.
---
This just happened to me lost thousands of caps because of the limit.
---
I give a lot of stuff away for free, but that‚Äôs my choice , I would dare tell anyone they were charging too much, I suspect they are just storing it until the legendary vendor resets.
---
It makes it much easier to grab them when they are at the top... plus I mean who would buy a nocturnal harpoon gun even at 1000 caps!!
---
That toxic goo better give super powers. Haha.
---
K, I'm mostly wanting the 4x ore for farming lead cause it's not fun going through 2000 bullets a day
---
I dont even know why there should be limit on cap
---
 The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step. 
---
Worlds start with zero people. Then someone joins. Then someone else. And so on. Then people leave. And join. 
---
I just joined a world and there's 10 people in the forest area.
---
Same here since the bans. I don't often need to go to my private server now. It's weird. No one to do events with really either.
---
I‚Äôve had a nice mix on my Xbox servers in the past couple days. Fastest ever SBQ event (in my experience) yesterday with several high levels. 
---
The first time I ever ran a silo two weeks ago, the server was full. When I finished and went down to the event, there was only me and a level 9 left. Lonely for sure and I didn‚Äôt have enough firepower to do it. 
---
Got a bunch of XP for killing mobs though.
---
They have also been in the atomic shops advertising pictures for as long as it's been around.
---
thanks
---
When I‚Äôm at max caps, I‚Äôll go clear out all the resort plans from Pendleton at Whitespring and resell them at my vendor for dirt cheap to new players. Because caps are super easy to get and there‚Äôs no sense in hoarding them. Stimulate the economy and beatify the wasteland!
---
Me too.
---
Knowing bethesda the fee would be 10 caps for every cap you wanna store lol
---
The 50 weight oart is not really needed,but I agree on the rest.
---
Also the ability to stack items in it ,is fundamental and not implemented.
---
Lol
---
Kill like 5 enemies and sell their loot.
---
&gt;This game.and everything inside of it is... wait for it... is NOT REAL! The guns, outfits, plans, etc.... they don't make Bethesda money. They are for our use and enjoyment while shooting down a scorchbeast. 
---
The money, time, and resources to do the coding, record the voice overs, market the game, obtain web servers, etc. was all very real.  Just because it‚Äôs now a bunch of 1‚Äôs and 0‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt suddenly mean you have free reign to do what you want in an online service.  
---
And everyone using dupes to easily clear content \*costs\* them money.  If they just allowed people to have the best, most overpowered weapons and gear in the game, then they need to spend more resources to create content that people wouldn‚Äôt be able to just waltz through with the B2525 Fixer. 
---
It also costs them money because when people get fed up with dupers, they leave the game.  Those are people who are no longer spending money on Atoms Or Fallout 1st subscriptions.  
---
Your line of reasoning is just one step away from the logic of people who pirate off the internet, or that take people IP that was uploaded to the internet and think it‚Äôs fair game. 
---
&gt; Bethesda has banned A LOT of people who did nothing wrong. And yes. I have a friend who was. Notified today his pending investigation is a perma band with NO explanation. They also banned his xbox account. Something he doesn't play on!!???? As a paying customer of F01st he deserves a valid explanation from a human being.
---
Sure they didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. I‚Äôm sure.  I‚Äôve been around the block a long time with various MMOs.  Without fail after any banwave came the people who said ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do anything‚Äù or like in your case ‚ÄúMy friend is innocent‚Äù.  And without fail, somewhere, something was found that had done something ban worthy.  
---
And given your ethics from the first thing I quoted, where you seem to think that just because it doesn‚Äôt make someone money it‚Äôs ok to do with it as you want, if your friend had similar ethics I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised they did something. 
---
&gt;Notified today his pending investigation is a perma band with NO explanation. They also banned his xbox account. Something he doesn't play on!!???? As a paying customer of F01st he deserves a valid explanation from a human being. And quite honestly, with how cheap it is to file. I would take them to small claims court to recoup all of the money and time I had invested in the game unless they could show me proof that I did something wrong.
---
I fall back to what I had just said about ‚Äúsure he didn‚Äôt do anything‚Äù... or maybe your friend is bad with passwords and somone used his Xbox account information and duped with that account.  
---
And good luck with small claims court, you might get a judge who knows nothing about technology or Terms of Service and then judge in your favor. Of course, how Bethesda reacts  after would be interesting.  
---
&gt;Ban the people actually cheating. And make sure you have proof they were actually cheating. And yes, Bethesda's game is broken because of their own shitty code. So how about they just fix the damn game. If ANY other company pulled even half the crap Bethesda does with its customers. They wouldn't be in business anymore. Sad.
---
I think they did, I mean... I‚Äôm still here.  All of my friends are still here.  None of us dupe and we all avoid like the plague anyone trying to sell any of the high value items that we know likely aren‚Äôt legit just to be sure. None of us got a ban or suspension.
---
When why not buy from *My* store then comrade...
---
Lol not me. Although if anyone is interested in a 3 star nocturnal death tambo then Im your man. 2 caps.
---
That‚Äôs a lot of bullets. But a good run through Lucky Hole should set you up for a day or two!
---
what plan is it?
---
Probably, it is 5mm though so that's good
---
My games have been well populated with the only exceptions being before a server Reser. The many new players have obviously meant the high levels are more spread out and the South and East parts of the map are sometimes player free but the forest is heaving.
---
Xbox Live player count...https://playercounter.com/fallout-76/
---
Sure add me bincat237.
---
Well man, feel free to message me and I‚Äôll set you up with armor and weapons and then get some proper xp for you
---
its a 10 week season its week 3 and it gives you 1500 free atoms - meaning even if you only hit lvl 90 you can still clear lvl 100 without the need to spend real money
---
They were logging the game at the time. Check inside the vault. They say they dont want to give cheaters info but by mentioning theese things they always do lol. We know some places in game red flag you, certain amount of items red flag you and so on.
---
I was playing a mobile game the other day (dont laugh, insomnia will lead you to desperate measures) and I was getting really rich with the in game currency, to the point it was going in to a "piggy bank". The game then gleefully told me it would only cost ¬£4.99 to smash open the piggy bank!
---
I declined and deleted. Please dont be like those games bethesda
---
If ESO, which is way bigger than FO76, can do it than 76 can definitely do it.
---
It‚Äôs purely Bethesda devs being lazing or taking their own sweet time.
---
Yep, I typically stagger away with over 800 pounds of weapons that I turn into scrap. Happy days.
---
Is "tee" different than "tea?"
---
I have been suggesting this since the game released. There needs to be a server text chat on all systems. Now even a group chat would be nice.
---
 They put so much emphasis on all these team things but still no way to communicate with one another other than mics which 95% of players dont use.
---
 I personally will never use a mic so this game has pretty much been a single player game for me this whole time since Beta.  It even feels like I'm playing a single player game when I'm on a public team.
---
Nice! Glad to hear theyre listening!
---
I always give low level players some modded under armor, weapons, ammo and aid. Sometimes serums and good legendaries. Sometimes all of it. I like doing that right at the vault 76 door.
---
not really sorry lol
---
Thx grammar police
---
good point mate!
---
Oh my god dude...
---
I really hate that the photomode stuff exists and is so publicly used. Also, there has been nothing from Bethesda on if they even know this glitch exists or what they can do to fix it as far as I know.
---
I sometimes hide in the tops of trees, rather than in a bush.  At least up in a tree you can snipe people!  But, when you say hollow tree you mean actually \*inside\* a tree? Go on, do tell :P
---
You have quite the eye for a pic, some beautiful pictures there. Beats having Megs or Paiges face staring back at you after doing Davenports photo op mission lol
---
Oh my god if I see a bunch of half empty plasma cores in my inventory many more times I'm going to scrap my 3* plasma I dont care how fun it is on scorchbeasts. Sort it out !
---
At this point in the game there shouldn't even be a cap
---
Value of shit's gone way above one can reasonably expect to trade with regardless of this arbitration and all its done is make trading a mega headache
---
No matter how many times I see this request I will never not up vote it
---
It can be given as a reward for any event or quest based in the Mire, with a 0.02% drop chance, so "super lucky" is a bit of an understatement. I grinded Mire daily quests every time I played since a couple months after release, and finally received one from Idle Explosives a few weeks ago.
---
If you're talking about the one with the for mannequin standing in the road facing each other oh, that one seems to spawn right next to my Camp constantly
---
Well its not all bad, I asked for a refund once and got annoyed by bot respond so wrote a new ticket... Got refunded twice, lol
---
People see other people charge stupid prices for gear, don‚Äôt necessarily understand what‚Äôs good or bad, and the. price from there.
---
People don‚Äôt want to be the schmuck that sells the Unyielding, Ap refresh, ammo weight combat armor for 500 caps and then have people mock you in the trading subreddit
---
I really enjoy NW, but I play on PS4. It's a shame that the cheating on PC can hinder people getting into this mode.
---
You can buy bullion with caps?
---
no.  the science master can be equiped at higher lvl. some modules for energy weapon u can craft if u have science master equiped.
---
I have not, because I'm smart and don't dupe 1bn presents or weapons :)
---
What do the lunchboxes do? I have 4 of them o think
---
The only difference is that the meat one you have to have on when you kill something, you can‚Äôt put it on to search after killing stuff like you used to be able to :)
---
LOL!
---
My Instigating Explosive Flachette modded Harpoon Gun one shots almost everything in the game and I don't have a single perk for heavy guns.
---
I am a 100% Full health stealthy rifleman.  Yet this beast destroyers just about everything I use it on.
---
 Most the time it hangs out in my stash but once in a while I will pull it out for fun.
---
They absolutely can buy from unpowered vendors. You are 100% correct. The power only makes it so the vendors show on the map. If someone comes across your unpowered vending machines they absolutely can buy from them. The only thing you can do is store them. I've found if you place your vending machine on terrain/ground NOT on foundations, then store them, it will keep your inventory in them. But, you should test this yourself with a couple items in a machine before loading it up. Also, I read that if you attach an item to the vending machine, like a light or plant, then blueprint it it will save your inventory. But I've never tried that one.
---
Egg inc?
---
The literal point of vendors needing power is so they show your camp as a vendor site on the map. *A vendor does not require power for a player to make purchases.* I am near the cap limit so often that I no longer power my vendors at all. This cuts down on traffic to my camp and when someone does find my camp (at this point I am only selling a few handful  of rare and rather expensive items) the occasional purchase doesn't send me over the limit.

yeah there's a dude upstairs in the wayward

fallout 4 and 76 ghouls are beyond annoying, they detect you easy as hell, they al telepathically rush to your position, they all gang bang you with stagger lock, high damage, high attack speed and when you get out of their reach they shoot off faster than an Olympian sprinter as well as zipping back to your position faster than a fat cop to a slocum joe on opening door first thing in the morning.
---
for "heavily irradiated" and rotted people not just soldiers but just average human beings they all seem to be super human, and with how flimsy their limbs are they sure take quite a beating and give it while simultaneously moving at break neck speeds.
---
at least glowing ones make alittle bit of sense, they are overflowing with radiation and bulging because of it so would probably be overclocked but other ghouls are just a joke.
---
speaking of ghouls why were fallout 3+nv non-feral ghouls changed to just be very scabby instead of worn away like lore implies? i mean in 4 and 76 non ferals if they wear a mask and basic armor you wouldn't even notice they were a ghoul but in 3 and nv even with armor you would see the tearing of the neck, the scalp rot, lack of hair and the much rougher voice.
---
Niceeee
---
I used to hand out Brotherhood Recon Rifles, them being already pre modded hunting rifles they're very handy to share!
---
Thanks for the response. Not grammar police. That was a real question. I have a lot to learn about some of the words and abbreviations here on Reddit and wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something.
---
i dont think they'll do that because... well, money. but maybe trading bullion for legendary scrip or at the very least caps would be nice for those who got everhthing they wanted (or maybe just EVERYTHING) they can with bullion.
---
And also means less revenue.
---
Do their names start with a period and is temporal in nature? If not, definitely seeing a lot of Halloween costume trolls as well...
---
That's the point. Let's say you're high level and have Science Master as a drop. Why bother getting Science Adept anyomore? Is it only a perk for lower levels that should be discarded?
---
Yeah usually Halloween costume and start with a period.
---
I had the same issues with my cal 50 MG then i Discovered the gatling gun and now im swimming in lead an bullets as its extremely economic compared to the damage output.
---
For farming things i use the gatling for killing things the DSE cal 50 is used.
---
The Cap limit needs to be increaded, the game has progressed and naturally players are more wealthy than 2 years ago, it's basic economics that this is now a problem many players are having. 
---
The solution I would say is to increase the cap and also create some sort of interface at the "My PC" CAMP item for players to exchange caps for GB. That may require an adjustment of the values of the items but based on the guy at the Wayward the exchange rate could be similar or better slightly.
---
Update it how? It‚Äôs already held together by those bandaids that are always floating in swimming pools
---
yes, but they also said they hope to have just about all games workable eventually, and i feel live games like 76 or even ESO, that still have new content coming out, will be up there in priority even if they arent the best selling.
---
They are made by prewar companies or raiders and such after the war. None of them are unique models, just something added on top of the existing models.
---
i made a suggestion a while back about giving all PA a new mod slot that does the same as weight reduction 3 star legendary effects.
---
for example you could slot both legs with reduced weapon weight, arms with chem weight and chest+helmet with junk weight
---
It was good before the initial patch it did 400% extra damage.
---
For real, I felt like I was rotating instances w/ the same 3 people earlier. One shooting into the sky to kill everybody, one shooting the floor to kill everybody, and one I just fell down &amp; died while I heard him shooting nearby. You'd see one, quit, next lobby there's one of the other two. Probably not the only ones either.
---
Yea idk what happens if your frame-rate goes below zero lol
---
Yea it was an honest typo because of hangover and in my country (or better yet the contry i live in) the word is Tee.
---
Done. Had over 10k atoms doing nothing.  Bought shit load levels because time gated bullshit makes me not wanna bother and i just came back to game so i was way behind already. Like a child i rage leveled lol Meh...
---
to craft gauss shotgun u need science perk, to craft a some modules u need a science master but u can unequip science.
---
I‚Äôm new to the game, so I didn‚Äôt exactly understand what you‚Äôre talking about. So you can have max 30k caps per day (?), what happens exactly when someone buys more than that so that your caps exceed 30k?
---
they dont know market prices ofc 
---
but i would sell 2* nocturnal broadsider probably for 100-200caps rofl
---
I put the generator on the roof.
---
My fixer has started doing that recently in Queen fights and it's really pissing me off
---
All you have to do is make sure you log in on the last week and buy what ever season levels you haven‚Äôt unlocked.
---
Just casually you could make about 20+ levels saving yourself 3000 atoms.
---
I understand being a completist and wanting unlocks I have the same issue but (I get you didn‚Äôt buy them) I still don‚Äôt understand why you considered it. You could buy two bundles from what you would save (if you still wanted to spend it on fallout)
---
Yeah, it is a kick to the gut. My old C.A.M.P. at Dyer Chemical was a 4-story building, and a really nice player was sleeping in the guest bed on the 3rd floor. I waited as long as I could and I hope she didn't lose all her health when I logged out!!
---
the best part of the joke is that doesn't complete the alien challenge
---
You can get the bots to 4000 exp with more buffs and int
---
I kinda figured. Its just the new State Trooper set is looking more like a new model with the amount of new modeling on it.
---
***Final Word
---
Bahaha.
---
How do you buy ranks?
---
I don‚Äôt use melee really but I‚Äôve got an instigating +40% power attack and some other 3rd star death claw gauntlet that‚Äôs nice with no build, other than that a furious explosive 50. Cal, furious faster fire gat plasma and gat laser, vampire explosive assault rifle, and I guess a bunch of other stuff I can‚Äôt remember
---
Well, I never assume any lore behind any skin. 
---
But if I had to wager, there was 25 years from when the vault 76 was sealed, not everyone was dead right after, it was some time before people started to leave or get killed off by the Scorched.  During that time the BoS came into Appalachia.  
---
My head cannon would be people just recovered PA suits from fallen BOS soldiers, took them off the back of shipping trucks that were on their way to military facilities (such as the military base) and then painted them to meet their needs.  Chinese ones could be a result of commie espionage.
---
Towards Serendipity and Nerd Rage? Lol
---
what does being a 1st member have to do with this?
---
Do you know the other stats?
---
They give random boosts for an hour like +15 carry weight, taking less damage from bugs, etc. The effect is randomized and applies to all players standing close by to the one opening a lunchbox.
---
To piggy back off this maybe  we can oay gokd to increase our limits on scrip or caps. Say 1000gold = +10 script limit which caps at 300 script per day or 1000 gold =100 vendor caps which caps out at 2500
---
&gt;a limit stopper would be nice
---
Yes, if once we reach cap limit, a simple pop up to they buying player saying "this vendor is currently not available for purchases, check back later" would be great. And then the seller could get a pop up, saying something to the effect: you are at cap limit and people are trying to buy. Gives you the opportunity to quickly sink some caps and vendors would automatically start selling again.
---
That or a central bank where we could hold our excess caps. Hell, they could make one of the Sunnys a banker and then he would seriously be the best Sunny. Lol
---
It's funny how you go from "Who the hell wants to pay a cap a bullet?!" to "Whelp, nothing better to spend it on and I know I'll use them.  May as well stimulate the economy."
---
Happens all time when large mobs
---

---
Unless I have my vendors unhooked, in which case I feel 0 guilt.
---
Thats more of an 'ejection' my friend lol
---
I‚Äôm looking for help ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Yes on xbox, plus the awful fps, unplayable sometimes.
---
Same
---
Yup, you've successfully identified that "[you] cannot help‚Äù, but your response could have been very helpful to the community if you presented more knowledge based on immediate and repeatable testing and less on your opinion of people's reactions. That there are currently players who can test these results and present facts, just so that you don't think you have to carry this weight of opinion-knowlegde by yourself!
---
It gets stored as a blueprint which you can scrap to the pieces previously built to then place back down with out costing resources to build.
---
On the legendary run screen. Rank up button. X on xbox i believe. 150 atoms per rank
---
Indeed! I remembered when vendors 1st came out I was so mad when I saw bullets for 2 cap a piece.  Two caps for a single bullet?
---
 Now I won't hesitate to buy 10000 bullets for 2 caps a piece if I see them when I'm out looking for things to spend caps on.
---
Seriously?! I saw it twice in one week shortly after launch. Did they lower the spawn rate or something?
---
Instead of supply drops we get to hack terminals
---
Hmm. Not a bad idea. I appreciate the explanation
---
What's the creature feature submission?
---
anti-armor faster swing speed mole miner gauntlet. got it as a drop from my first SBQ, and it was so good already that i redid my whole character to be built around unarmed melee so i could make it better.
---
If gets fed to angry albino yao guais
---
Leaded mods on most of your armor does quite a lot
---
Have you tried using the helmet in PA?  Wondering if you can remove your PA helmet and use that for the light.  Would make lucky hole runs less annoying if I could see the fricken ore.  If that's possible I may buy it after all.
---
You are right and it sucks. Stealthboys are however counter to another cheesy pvp - railroad VATS... Which people use to counter legacies... The cycle just never ends, does it.
---
Just got one of those the other day after 400+ lvls.  I was pleased for a minute then I just threw it in my stash.
---
 It will most likely never see the light of day again like most of my super rare clothing but at least I have it. lol
---
I never get more than half way to max, so for my various mid-100 level characters I spend it all on mounted fireflies.
---
Ahhh the first class member picking on the second class citizens...
---
Oh well back to the bus with me.
---
An interesting idea,but I don‚Äôt think bullions are the way to go.It is a currency that one has to grind for,and there is a limited amount of things to buy with it.It would be better to expand on the item selection rather then create a bullion-atom dump.Maybe a new vendor that sells rare plans and certain limited time rewards from past events.Because the bullion is a grind currency,the ‚Äúdifficulty‚Äù would be regulated by the price of these items.
---
In my opinion it would be much better to have a caps-atoms exchange.Caps basically worthless because they are constantly being created by the game.Its basically like constantly printing money.We lose caps with each transaction with the NPC and player vendors,we can exchange caps for bullions and it still isn‚Äôt enough.A cap-atom exchange would be a very deep pit to throw caps into,especially if the exchange rate is hypercapitalistic and unfair.Each cap would be irreversibly lost with only a small sum of atoms gained.
---
One problem I can see is duping and potential scamming/stealing.Due to the buginess of the game this could be a real problem.The scammy change rate would drain your hard limited cap purse quite quickly and certain players would just need more.Some of them would just buy the atoms for IRL money,others would want to get more caps,which means duping.
---
You can have 30k caps period, not per day. If someone buys anything else, or you make caps some other way, they just disappear.
---
SBQ carrying 3* items?
---
Or it need a real cap sink to curve the cap inflation
---
Yet another reason I'm glad I have my voice chat volume set to 0 for other players.
---
You'd better hold on to it and not trade for anything else; that's one of the very best weapons in game.
---
Been playing for over 700 hours and I've only seen it once. I was still pretty low level and wandering through the forest when I saw it through saw trees. I tried to sneak up and kill it but as soon as I hit it the damn thing vanished. Never saw it again.
---
You sir have a point. One that‚Äôs frustrating, but a point nonetheless....
---
Fellow XBOX builder! The key to designing a good bedroom area in your camp is not just fill the outlines of a wall. There‚Äôs nothing worse than going to someone‚Äôs camp and it‚Äôs a cube, with sixteen panels on each floor and a few decorations. Smaller is always better for a design quota, but think outside of the box. Instead of using the pre-designed bed, box‚Äôs, walls, cabinets (etc) try to make more yourself compiled from different objects. Cut off a single cube corner for a bathroom, try to partition up the room with half walls, or slanted walls, and try something different than usual. Create a skylight, a garden terrace, that sort of thing.
---
Bethesda just seem too caught up getting other bits up to speed they have neglected the economic systems within the game that keep it going, creating more issue that could be easily solved. Personally I like the idea of GB being able to be converted but there is really a plethora of options, but no action is bad.
---
Well if it‚Äôs only three pieces. Pick up your camp box and place it again
---
Fair enough.
---
wait, you can _buy_ ranks?
---
Ya know, if Bethesda had the guts, instead of banning or tiptoeing around NW cheaters and how to handle them, put those suspected of cheating in lobbies with other cheaters. If they knew what they were doing, they would also take any associated accounts (whether by email, payment info or IP address, or some combo), and place these guys, whether dupers in Adventure, or insta-killers who have a grudge against survival time XP for some reason, in servers with their fellow hackers. On top of that, remove the ability to level up, gain XP, and set all their challenges to empty for everything.
---
If they don't want to play for the rewards the rest of us are, (whether enjoyment, hard-fought achievements, or that last skin unlock), then they shouldn't have to anymore :) Who's with me?! And what happened to block makes it so the player won't be in your lobbies?! I blocked three cheaters tonight, and got punched in the groin by those same cheaters floating around in multiple matches.
---
I rarely see ghoul yao guais
---
I'm using the gatling already, it's been a long day
---
Good one! I rarely see these too, will keep an eye out!
---
I used to have a perfectly preserved pie in my machine a while back for like 20k. No one did by it, and I‚Äôm pretty sad about it.
---
Why don‚Äôt they just implement a check to block sales that would exceed the limit? This is effed up!
---
Yes with atoms which equals real money these days
---
I‚Äôve only got four more serum plans to buy, then it‚Äôs on to all the PA mods.
---
Thanks! I appreciate this. Are you online at all to hop into my base to just take a gander if it's a suitable size for the room ect?
---
I would love to get someone to place some of those real nice wood floors so I can store and use for my room, in exchange I could build them the RR garage or something idk
---
It was pretty nice with 1k bobbleheads üòÑ
---
I run into a chameleon DC a few times running Whitesprings. Never seen a scorched mothman. But I have seen a Yao Guai Ghoul a couple times
---
Insult bot, I love him so much. I hate people who kill him. Fragile egos...
---
I didn‚Äôt look at the player totals in the public teams but there were like five. And even when I see servers with more people not everyone is in public teams.
---
It seems to only be FO76 that I‚Äôm having issues with. I‚Äôll try a clean reinstall of everything Bethesda related and pray that helps
---
Like legendary modules for crafted armor. Will take you years to get sets lol
---
Sure! My GT is: RamenDaemon. Feel free to invite me. I can help out, don‚Äôt need anything in return though it‚Äôs fine!

---
And here i am, lv170, still struggling to break 6k caps.
---
A character can only have up to 30k caps at any given time, it's your max capacity, if you're at 29.999 caps and somebody buys an item for 1000 caps, you get 1 cap and the other 999 go in the void of nothing
---
I laughed just at the thought, thank you
---
Yeah enjoy free private server wohoo
---
i miss the sound fallout 4 made when it procced.
---
also allowed me to know i could immediately jump back into VATS and clear more enemies out
---
If you dont want duped items dont buy legacy weapons or 3* god rolls, 99% they are duped.
---
Yeah but you don‚Äôt have time to run to whitesprings while someone is buying out your inventory. When you reach max at minimum it should shutdown your vendors, but I‚Äôll take an increase in caps.
---
Ohhh. Shit. Ok, thank you very much for explaining.
---
It would be  ice if vendors had a storage for caps we can draw from up to our max. But also that storage can't be added to by us.
---
However we could also have standing buy orders.
---
So example:
---
I sell a weapon for 1k caps and leave those caps in my vendor but my vendor also has an item saying "buying stimpacks 10caps each up to 100" and someone sells the stimpacks to my vendor and they get paid from its cap stash.
---
Science perks don't stack. It's not like the lock pick where each level grants you better skill. Each science perk is it's own separate card. For example to craft a guass mini gun you need the science perk if you use science master it won't  work. the plasma cast needs science master no other science perk will work. Pretty sure they did it this way to F with us and make waste points.
---
I prefer 3 players sharing "Strange in Numbers" to 1 player sharing "Gun Fu" ... I hate this slow lockon skill that targets enemies even when they are already dead.
---
working as intended

well shit, I didn't know that!

Store the items that ‚Äúate‚Äù the other items. See if they show up as a blue printed item.  If so delete that blueprint and store the items separate and then set them in the camp individually again.
---
We knew this ahead of time, the halloween combat rifle skin doesn't apply to the fixer, and the lack of customization slot means it doesn't have any available ones right now
---
i can't remember what was in the wheel bundle.... but i remember it being well worth it lol.
---
I don't know how rare they are but I once saw an Albino Deathclaw and a Vengeful Mothman in the same area
---
I love my junkies Gatling. Been using it from levels 75-158. Just bought the plans for crafting aand scrapped a dozen to get the mods. Thinking about priming it....not sure yet
---
If the block feature worked properly then we can all block the hackers so we don't get them in NW games and they the hackers struggle to get into a game with everyone blocking them.
---
Because you can get one for free without using the machines. And many players that have 20k to spend know that. 
---
It‚Äôs a novelty item, not really a rare item.
---
Some of the hermit crab variants, maybe
---
Just use a burner account and you‚Äôll be fine ;)
---
Some cheats are pc only, cheats activated in game is for all platforms though
---
there was a purge event... many didn't make it
---
That‚Äôs why I had it in the machine so people could look at it and say ‚Äúhe‚Äù.
---
Also, do the arms have to be the same lvl cause ones 25 and the other is 35 and I'm not getting the bonus
---
also I'm pretty sure that anything you do that uses AP also used Fusion core power. So every time you jump, sprint, vats or if use "dodgy" for DR you are also using your cores which is kinda bogus if you ask me. It should use one or the other not both.
---
Both times I‚Äôve seen a Yao Guai Ghoul, was in the back of Dolly Sods Wilderness. 99 times out of 100 it‚Äôs a Glowing variant
---
Only so there wouldn't be a cap economic crash...not because we are a$ses we swear.
---
Check behind Dolly Sods Wilderness
---
Happy to help!

the mothman bundle?
---
it's been increased i think twice so far so it could easily happen again
---
or 10 atoms xD
---
Yeah. Doesn't work. Apparently it's in the audio tab.
---
Sometimes I list a weapon that I don't use it my current build but also don't really want to part with for 5555 caps and figure if someone pays that great if not I'm saving it.
---
Completely agree, I have a friend that every day runs the three silos, I always try to help him but he easy do it alone. 
---
One day I dropped to him a note "The North Star"  but I think that he didn't understud it because of the confused emote he shown.
---
Same place I'm at. I haven't had my vendors left on for over a month as I tend to stay right at the limit. I've already bought every (non-gold bullion) plan from vendors. I'm down to buying a few select ammo, misc., and junk from players.

Or just start an Xbox live party by yourself. Effectively cuts off chat when you want to and you don‚Äôt have to remember to turn your chat volume up later.

I have the mothman bundle and it has the black and red wood, I saw some other vertical wood panels in people's C.A.M.P.s and have no idea where they came from. I would like to make a twin peaks themed C.A.M.P and those wood panels would come in very handy.

Nah, but i do have similar issues with that shit shed

I saw a perfectly preserved pie for 2500 caps and ten fasnacht berets for 100 caps each at one vendor
---
Is there a cure for her running up &amp; down like a mental?
---
I think we‚Äôll see them in the shop eventually. I hope they do something like they do with repair kits though. Make the ones they have now with the XP boost something only obtainable as a reward from Season progression or for completing certain events. Then sell ones with just the minor buff/cosmetic effect.
---
For a touch of irony,after this OP my second required drink to make to give to Biv was Ballistic Bock.
---
Imagine what our real economy would be like if personal savings were capped.
---
I'm not advocating it, of course, but it's interesting to imagine.
---
I have zero commando perk cards. All maxed out rifleman.
---
I hear ya there. I just didn't realize that quest was considered in The Mire, since it was at Whitespring. To be fair though a good chunk of it does take place in The Mire so that makes sense.
---
It's a shame the matching cap removes all facial hair and such like the treasure hunter and insurgent hats did before the latest patch.
---
Absolutely!! I went from like 4k caps to 29k in a matter of seconds because I had someone buying all the about and weapons, and i had to find a way to spend a lot of caps, fast. I was actually able to buy 3 serum recipes from modus that day because it kept happening.  
---
I also think 5k is a bit low for the gold bullion cap.
---
Yeah sadly there isn't much I'm running into that goes well with it. Not to mention the matching cap removes all facial hair and such lol
---
You get access to better weapons and perks. Maybe not after level 50, but absolutely for the first 50. It‚Äôs pay 2 win and does NOT belong in this game.
---
Yea it was enabled maybe two days ago. Originally it was supposed to start at last tuesdays reset but they had some issues and it got delayed two days.
---
I play drunk and wake up missing weapons, naked and dying of starvation and usually with a slightly smaller friends list.
---
Interesting concept. There would have to be separate caps for each profession though. I don't want a doctor to have the same cap as a Burger King employee.
---
Adding to clarify since op clearly is new to the game.. Ammo for gatling plasma.
---
Aww, thanks! I have a bunch of Keycards I'm sitting on right now so I know what to do with 'em!
---
Love the story!  I hardly ever see that thing. My husband encounters it weekly though. I swear it likes him better
---
You‚Äôre welcome!
---
I don‚Äôt even know what these notes are
---
Glad it‚Äôs not just me having this problem, my fix is too quick switch weapon to stop the reload
---
lol, they are not elitists they are noobs. Endgame content is cheating... People thought it was nuking the queen 24/7? gtfo
---
It comes with a risk and excitment the games content cant give you.
---
Anti-cheaters shouldnt buy 3* god rolls unless they admit to be hypocrite.
---
The biggest issue with this bann was it went to public, ppl doing endless grinds wanted to try their luck. They didnt know as the mass/irl cash dupers know, you need a burner account.
---
This bann actually got a big amount of ‚Äùnormal‚Äù players. While the cheaters like me will continue with the next dupe. üòâ
---
And they give 25 percent xp bonus which cam be stacked 4 times.
---
Junkies. When legendary perks comes out the perk what rads would essentially make rads non existent.

If you search on this sub, there's a post that shows how to disable the in-game vsync. Helped me a lot, I have a 5-6 years old PC. There's many more tweaks but most of them eliminates visual features that not everybody are willing to sacrifice for a smoother experience.
---
Great idea!
---
Choo Choo!
---
It‚Äôs a super rare spawn. Haven‚Äôt seen in over a year. Only seen maybe 3 in 850 hours.
---
The vendor should have a bank where you can store ‚Äòexcess‚Äô caps.
---
This is the price you pay for having like 8 times the DPS of any build type though.
---
What was the cap originally implemented for??
---
Okay, thanks.
---
2-3 shot would be ok. But not 1 shot
---
400+ here to and only seen it once. 4 days ago i fight for first time the Colossus I was scraping after SBQ and I listened "hey psycho there's a Colossus spawned in the forest, wanna join?" Tongs up and gone ahead. I just can say thanks to that dude.
---
Albino wolf and scorpions  are really rare. Glowing behemoth is also rare,I only saw one in a nuke.
---
Check the challenge if taking photo of enemies: you have a list and sime of them are really rare I never met one.
---
Oh, I completely missed the second part. My bad for any confusion.
---
Tse causes 4x durability loss, at a minimum. It's a pain haha
---
Why? None of this makes sense as cap limit prevents inflation.  Not to mention items are. Not hard to get

There's one you can grab at wes-tek on the roof. No machine needed

You can do a melee atack with your weapon too
---
Probably better solution than mine
---
I dont understamd this post. Can someone explain why he signs out?
---
I know this is going to be an unpopular opinion, but you could actually take some responsibility for your own caps limit and go buy lead and steel, or serum recipes, or plans, or whatever and not expect this game to do everything for you.
---
I‚Äôm just about out of keycards but I love running nukes for everyone. Tried to stock up before the event but not one person was selling cards. Sucks that you can‚Äôt get your hands on them easily. If anyone on XB1 wants to donate cards to me to run silos with I‚Äôll graciously take them.

YouTube. There are tons of videos on the subject, and there are YouTubers who regularly post such things so once you find a voice you can tolerate you can subscribe and get as much as you can take.

No...  Look at your arm...

I think I have flux and I have 5000 caps

My C.A.M.P is at the south west end of white springs near the fissure site. At least two or three times a week I load into a world and Flatwoods Monster is chillin at the golf course. I have built a small watchtower at my C.A.M.P, I go up there and snipe him. It‚Äôs crazy that some players have yet to come across that lil alien when I‚Äôve seen him at least 50 times now, and frequently. What I haven‚Äôt seen yet is a Wendigo colossus. And I‚Äôve come across one chameleon death claw but it was already dead.
---
No sorry mate
---
But mine free adhesive and gears
---
The Pip? Really? Lame
---
Nope. If you see someone selling or wearing one they are illegal hacked items.
---
Well you have to consider that there is not exactly a set price list for every item other than whatever low low price the game says something is worth.
---
Ultimately if i am selling something in the vendor i think that someone out there would actually want it, otherwise i would just scrip it. Most of the builds are so specialized i think it is fair to think, for your average player who does not go into the trading subs, or keep up with the current meta etc etc is basically guessing. Unless you dedicate time to researching each and every build and effect etc etc is it really worth the time to worry you undercharged a virtual currency and put a smile one someones face.
---
If something does not match the build i am working on then to me it is worthless, but that does not mean it is not god tier to someone else. On my main, since i have learned all the plans i want and the only need i have at all for caps is buying the elusive items i find in the wild, i can be generous with my machines. My lower chars though pinch pennies as they work on building themselves up.
---
It is a bit annoying when someone empties out a machine with conflicting bits and pieces etc for cheap as it just makes me assume they are going straight to their machines to get profit from my "stupidity" by charging so little.  There is a undercurrent of being taken advantage of, that irks me as much as i like the freed up stash space :p
---
Nope, not outside of the Vault 94 raid armor.
---
No skin has ever applied to the Fixer. Its a unique Combat rifle with a unique green skin that cannot be changed.
---
The toxic goo is great for bloodied biulds to keep there rads at the right spot but it was easy to farm I'm not paying more than a cap and that's only if I'm feeling lazy
---
i‚Äôve been playing forever, saw the flatwoods monster once In the toxic valley when I was about level 30 or 40. Didn‚Äôt see another one until I was 320+... And since I‚Äôve seen the second one I‚Äôve seen four or five. Queen of the Hunt daily has you search three locations for cryptids. This is where I ran into him last four or five times
---
Pylon V-13 right by the workshop for Abandoned Bog town has one for every 5 or 6 runs
---
Retirement would be even harder
---
I don't get why people even list the useless legendary effects.  I only put up Anti-Armor, Berserker's, Bloodied, Furious, Instigating, Junkie's, Two-Shot, and Vampire's.  I put up Mutant's and Suppressor's weapons only if the second/third effects are stellar.  Other than scrip, there's no market for Ghoul Slayer's, Mutant Slayer's, Hunter's, etc.  You can't build around those weapons.  You might be able to make a Queen killer with a Zealot's weapon, but you're honestly just better off making a Bloodied/Junkie's weapon into a Queen killer.
---
Also, non-legendary weapons for sale: why?  WHY?????

From the Fallout Bible;
---
&gt;The first suit of power armor is deployed in Alaska. While lacking the full mobility of future versions, this power armor is incredibly effective against Chinese tanks and infantry. Its ability to carry heavy ordnance becomes key in various localized conflicts, and it has the power to destroy entire towns without endangering the wearer. **China rushes to create its own versions, but they are many years behind the United States.**
---
Honest question. How do you get to that point? I stopped playing a year ago and just re-download. The reason I quit was because I've never managed to scrounge up more than about 900 caps in all my 70 levels. My rng with legendaries is so bad that I don't consider it worth my time to pursue them in hope of finding someone to sell them too. I just want to be able to afford the fun stuff and guns/armor/serums I desperately want. But no one is gonna sell anything worth a damn for less than 900 caps.
---
No, lone wanderer does not work if your the only person on a team.
---
Yuuuup. Me and my wife both play and so we mule most of the valuable stuff we arent using onto one vendor- usually about 110-ish legendaries at a time. When I hop on with this vendor I need to be dedicated solely to transferring caps to other characters because I earn them so fast- and nothing is set above 7k.
---
Luckily though as a result I can thank people for purchasing and manage the free table and leave the garage and decontamination shower open (The camp is over by Whitesprings for convenience).
---
Pretty silly there is a cap limit when there are pretty basic work-arounds that just require significantly more effort.
---
That's a dumb take, do you expect players to really keep their caps in relation to what any potential buyer might get from their vending machines at any time? Or constantly adjust how much caps one can potentially get out of the vending machine instead of simply raising a cap of banking caps?
---
I want some god damn bright head lights for t 65. It seems no ones even talking about this.
---
They excluded all the head lights from t 65.
---
Finding any variant of the Flatwoods Monster is rare as fuck. Been playing since BETA, I've seen a total of just 2 of em' ever.
---
Do you play on pc? Say chance I can visit your vendors? Lol
---
Run blocker/lead lined if its that bad
---
Where's that at I'm not sure if I've seen that one or not yet
---
Thanks guys I‚Äôve been playing off and on for a while but I have a ton of them and really didn‚Äôt know what they were for
---
Okay so I am new to playing with others on my game. What is the cap cap? I didn't know there was one and I'm probably doing it wrong!
---
Teach me your ways.
---
Thank you the heads up
---
Ya at first I was excited that we got anti Venom then I noticed that it may not work for PA. 
---
After this update I‚Äôm happy again.
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 unfortunately
---
Without a  hard cap on these things, it'd be hard to keep these things controlled, which is why I stayed away from suggesting caps initially.
---
I'm not expecting you to do that, the game has set that parameter for you. It's a restriction given by the game itself. You know it exists, so you've got to live with it until it's changed. People have been upset about this limit and the other limits in the game, I've bitched so many times about the daily scrip purchase limit, but it won't change it. It's a facet of the game and we've got to deal with it until Bethesda finally says they're going to change it. It's just the hard reality of this game as it is.
---
I completed 3 today for a total of 120 atoms (took shot of at least one before and after as proof). Noticed that when I completed the third (each was 40 btw) my total atoms showed as 120 instead of the 575 I had prior to the challenges. So it looks like it wants to credit the 120, but they are just out in the ether for now. And how many months before I can expect a reply from the support ticket?
---
I have now done that being on Xbox most players don‚Äôt have anything good being they‚Äôre low level being it‚Äôs on game pass and the high level players vendors are off and so are mine because I can‚Äôt find anything to spend caps on. I have been buying bulk lead from every vendor so that‚Äôs around 500 caps each purchase depending on how much vendor has.
---
Can‚Äôt relate, I‚Äôm level 130 something and the highest cap amount I‚Äôve had is over 8000 lol
---
Choose a backpack mod from either Grocer's or Chemist's, and then buy the Secret Service Underarmor and Shielded Lining for it.  
---
All that will only set you back 800 Bullion.  
---
**Everything else** is secondary to these things.
---
Hmm, this makes it useless because it may not able to finish the events such as Guided Meditation with 100% durability.
---
Laser weapons and flamers with the explosive prefix. They stopped dropping like a year and a half ago.
---
Player vendors really, and there comes a point you dont really need to buy anything. Save good legendary drops for trading instead of spending caps which keeps your caps. I end up buying plans and other crap for funsies, but my main and alt are maxed out
---
Sell ammo, all of it for like 1cap a piece, I have people buying all types of ammo in all quantities even if you have a few, itll stack if you add onto it.
---
This is good info, so Bethesda needs to catch up with industry standard. I gotta go put in some tickets so they manually refund my atomic shop purchases so I can buy the bundles I want. Wish me luck :P
---
I'm mostly sell any plan that is a mod, Mr. Fuzzy tokens are a good seller 200 caps a piece,  I acquire a lot of legendaries from just killing stuff around the map and the purveyor( I use   fed76 to see whats valuable), ect.  There are shoppers around that want to spend caps like me.
---
Holy run on sentence Batman. On a side note, stop workshop stalking and maybe people will stop fucking with you. If you play with fire, you're going to get burned.
---
Depends on your personal preference. I have bloodied + crippling + VATS enhanced one, which i think is the best i could ever get for my needs / use. Some other player might not consider it the best.
---
My cap dumps are fusion cores for my PAs. I've never quite figured out a. On tedious lucrative way to get cores, so I buy ok from wandering vendors that show up at my camps
---
They were logging the game and most vendor dupers got caught, you could try and write a ticket to complain if your story is true. Problem is, ppl will lie about having the same thing happend to them. So, good luck.
---
It‚Äôs a great PVE centric survival game. Exiled and Ark are more pvp focused and griefing is normal. I play them aswell in certain moods. Fallout is chill af
---
It's double XP weekend, what do you expect?
---
On the same spot :p
---
Before that spot.. I was building my camp, on different spots everytime when playing.
---
Changed my camp few times, but staying loyal to the bridge
---
Only 7.5k plus a couple of scraps
---
That's a non statement that I already deal with by logging out, it doesn't stop it from being a dumb side effect of the cap.
---
2 perception and 4 endurance
---
What
---
One thing is the water filters plan. You need coal and the bark from those trees in the Toxic Valley.
---
Dang. Well thanks for doing what you do.
---
They didnt get ppl for that.
---
Thanks for the info. I'll see how far I can get before the season ends, then I might do it. There's all these atoms I have from the monthy stipend from Fallout 1st, and I'm not really a big splurger in the Shop. The most expensive thing I got was the Log Cabin bundle.
---
I run full health most of my weapons are f e or f ffr my fe 50cal and handmade shredders thing
---
You‚Äôd be amazed how many caps you get (1500 a day) from selling aid items and non-legendary items at any vendor. Pop a grape mentats and drink a beer beforehand.
---
Isn't there some wood in the one with the log cabins. Not sure as I don't own it personally
---
They never move that stock. Anybody who has that much caps knows better. I just laugh and move along
---
It means it will take a back seat to 'Skyrim Rerererererelease Again Again'
---
Idk what the purveyor or fed76 is. I also don't know what Mr. Fuzzy tokens are. 
---
What are some good ways to find plans?
---
Yea the best way to handle it would be to buy missing ranks (if any) on the last day of the season.
---
The point of vendors needing power is so that they show up on the map. A vendor will work absolutely fine if someones at the camp and it's not powered up. Imagine giving someone shit and being that wrong.
---
Could be but, players who got items that was passed on didnt all get banned. Atm it seems the logging and doing vendor bot dupe was what got ppl.
---
I asked for that.
---
Somehow I don‚Äôt believe the live player count on that site. It jumps erratically losing 10k players then adding 10k players every 10 or so seconds.
---
Some of the mutation serum recipes, or at least one, needs coal
---
Yes, that is the clear wood and it's not in vertical panels. It is a very nice wallpaper, but unfortunately not the one I am looking for :(.
---
They just need to nerf bloodied builds. I think they will sooner or later
---
Had a crash,  a fail &amp; 2 completed runs today. See what I get tomorrow.
---
Pays to look at the general level of the server before launching
---
The caps cap is 30k per characters (and for information on other caps, gold bullion is 5k, scrip is 1k, ammo points is 2k soon 10k)
---
You're not necessarily doing anything wrong, caps will naturally rise over time, but if you want to expedite the process, use the travel agent card when doing dailies, sell items in your vending machine at tame prices, if you find that you have way too many legendaries than you can scrip, you can sell them at 15 to 20 caps per scrip value (ie a 1 star legendary weapon scrips for 5, so you can sell that at 100 caps), though make sure to raise the price if it's high demand effects like junkie, bloodied, explosive. And moreso if they have good secondaries such as explosive, fire rate, reload speed, etc.
---
Oh so like selling them to a vendor? Don't they have a cap limit? Also where / how does one get grape mentats? 
---
What kind of aid items should one be selling? I hoard my stimpacks, radx, and radaway since I'm always close to dying (not because I'm a bloodied build, just that I'm bad).
---
Dont worry, it‚Äôs easy to get back
---
I camp by site alpha and he‚Äôs spawned outside my camp 4 times or so. It‚Äôs rare but it happens.
---
Don‚Äôt use bugs. It‚Äôs that simple.
---
 [https://fed76.info/weapons/](https://fed76.info/weapons/) 
---
Maybe it's new players that do not know how to price items. I had super high price at my vendor when i first started playing.
---
Sorry about your loss, but I'm personally happy because I didn't know that doing the overseers mission gave you 100 scrip. Always put it off. Will bash that out later, need more modules to roll my plasma caster, thanks for making me aware! Sorry again...
---
The water wheel was neat  but in a way it killed the bundle for me, guess I wanted a rustic watermill to match the log cabin theme and I never even build by water.  Though I totally support them adding more post apopcalyptic scrap built camp pieces, so that's nice.
---
Not sure if you're aware, but you can call in a mission from the whitespring bunker to shoot a keycard escort down, doesn't take long, just a little cost in fast travel.
---
Your all good if they are all unyeilding, though you obviously want good DR and ER too.  Want to minimize the amount of damage you take when you are running around with low health.  Figure out what type of armor you want and replace pieces as you find better ones.
---
Thank you
---
Bloodied builds in shambles
---
some of us keep resources open just to be neighborly..even my ammo maker I've left unlocked, though I did try to hide it a bit in some trees :)
---
How is that a 'non-statement'?  It's a statement of the facts of this game. They've set limits on most things in the game, this is yet another of those limits that you're forced to live within.  So what, you lose this fictional currency. You can't convert this currency into real-world currency, it's not like you're losing real money. 
---
If you're just logging out because someone's at your camp, that's up to you, but apparently you're already conscious of how it might make that player perceive you, that's standing at your camp trying to get what they need or want to play the game.
---
I just leave everything open
---
Thank you very informative and I'm gonna take your advice right now! Thanks for making it clear for me.
---
I'll have to look up how to get decent legendaries then. Only thing I've ever gotten in all 70 lvls has been a V/E Submachine Gun and a Two-Shot Fatman. Which I jjst scrapped the Fatman because that's what people in another thread said to do. 
---
Also its so hard to part with ammo :/ 
---
But i def don't need it all. 
---
Thanks for the info/advice.
---
It‚Äôs kl my fault for hoarding lol but yeah when I found out it was 100 scrips I completed it today lol
---
Not bragging here but with my bloodied unarmed build i can tank around 10 of those guys. They do destroy sneak build though lol.
---
And then there‚Äôs me who sold a travelers leather coat for 25 caps before I realized it‚Äôs rare.
---
Had to check myself as i have had 4 coal in my scrapbox/stash from 2018.  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Coal](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Coal)
---
It‚Äôs fine I have 100
---
Scrips losing 56 doesn‚Äôt affect me but I should stop hoarding now I guess
---
Nvm just read one of the holotapes requires a nuke to be launched somewhere other than a fissure site. Will wait til whitesprings is done I guess.
---
If your using it then it really doesn‚Äôt matter. Unyielding stacks as does sentinal/cavalier. HTD does as well and u can lose the sneak perks as you‚Äôll cap out max sneak with 5 pieces. As for the quality/material heavy pieces give u the most protection. Wood the least. If your sneak is maxed with escape artist the weight won‚Äôt affect your sneak so it‚Äôs only the overall amount of protection that goes down. Unless your a tank build running about at 19% things like blocker and serendipity are far more useful than an extra 30 points in defence.
---
I‚Äôve tried junkies but again it‚Äôs management related and seems to feel like it makes the game less fun.
---
Thanks! Yea that was my thinking. As long as they‚Äôre all Unyeilding I can swap out as I find better pieces.
---
Unless you are going to get in a full set of wood (for max stealth) or a full set of SS (for max resistances), just mix and match. The only other benefit of a full set is to flex without an outfit on.
---
Oh? Because I have the perk "full charge" and it makes it so sprinting requires no extra fusion core energy. Sadly it doesn't work for jetpacks tho XD
---
Cap the caps cap! Uncap the caps cap, I mean.
---
I go around and lock pick peoples ammo machines. You‚Äôll be surprised how much ammo they leave in there without taking it out.
---
I got a couple of 1000 5mm from them and a couple hundreds of .45 or 5.56 from others.
---
Yes. In this game hoarding works against you. 
---
Besides turning in a bunch all at once will end up giving you a lot of legendaries you won‚Äôt want, probably can‚Äôt sell in your vending, and if they are heavy you have to lug them around for day till the rest.
---
Have you done wastelanders? I ask because you also get script by doing sbq, abs repair kits which saves you junk for repairs and perk cards. I dont do sbq for legendaries, though indo get nice ones at times. Sbq for script treasury notes and repair kits. Use script to buy 3star armor and weapons, sell those or script those as well
---
I got a junkies +33% +1 agi. I one hit almost everything in vats
---
Bugs and Glitches are not the same thing but YT is the easiest source for both.
---
For starters Angry Turtle has a number of vids on bugged 'Magic' weapons who's issues are based solely on standard ingame mechanics. 
---
There are also several oYTubers who post dupe and similar glitches that are a very different subject. If you are resorting to deliberate mid-action server drops, or seeking out worlds you can't place your Camp to hack displays/vendors, or other salubrious ideas then it's no wonder your posts are removed. Feel free to Glitch but you have to risk the consequences as multiple people have discovered on the past week.
---
My goodness, I woke up this morning, made some coffee and hit up silo charlie. Launched my nuke and went to fast travel... I missed the fissure site prime by about an inch. Finish your coffee before launching missiles y'all. Onto the next silo lol
---
That's because you're not GAAARY
---
adventure pvpers get their shit pushed in every time they play NW, because they don t have their crutches to carry them. when they say they "dont like NW" it means they get stomped on lmao.
---
keep drinking that milk buddy.
---
This guide is SO good. Thank you!
---
Well shit, I did not. Thanks!
---
I concur! only seen one in my hours...
---
I use PA and a mass assortment of Junkie's heavy weapons. With max ranks in Dodgy and Ricochet along with core assembly mod and action boy for added ap regen I'm pretty much invincible. With 5 addictions Junkie's gives 50% bonus damage. I only use 1 rank of each heavy gunner damage perk too along with 3 ranks of bloody mess and I do plenty of damage.
---
I dropped one that missed by about that much too, but I'm 100% positive I positioned it correctly. Wondering if there is a bug that causes the positioning to be wrong.
---
Was only hoarding till I got the gauss shotgun plans but even that I‚Äôm still far (one level away)
---
Well then Your next bet would be to use furious or instigating depending on your weapon choice.
---
Thanks for this. Will do it when I am on üëç
---
I haven't started the quest line for it. I don't know what repair kits are but they sound self explanatory given the info you provided. When I last played over a year ago I participated in sbq but never got any items to drop. Always an empty inventory. 
---
I'll try to tackle the quest. I haven't even completed the main starting quest. Everything I log in Rose from the Top of the world is mad at me. I jjst killed a death claw for her. Died twice to it :/
---
Hopefully wastelands won't be that difficult.
---
Somebody must want their ass kicked!
---
To buy modules? If that‚Äôs the case you can buy and hoard those
---
No probs, just head into the command centre and there is a terminal next to one of the modus terminals, you can ask it to find you a keycard or codes for either alpha, bravo or charlie.
---
Inspired
---
Oh I know. I do the bloodied build as well. I keep several of those on me. Easy to get them for free at West Tek.
---
YES! I didn't want to cry foul but I'm glad you said something to me. Like, I was willing to believe I just missed even though I'm my heart I know I had it selected correctly. Okay, I'll get back to you in ~25 minutes
---
You know I saw that when I was looking for the Missle Silo State holotape down there. I‚Äôll be running a bunch of them on private today. Doesn‚Äôt seem like they should take long, no?
---
I wanna be his friend.
---
Well...  SPOILER bellow (and I do not know how to hide a part of the message on android, sorry):
---
If you do the photograpb os the Crater daily,.sometimes you need take a photo on an unmarked camling side in the cliffs.
---
Sometimes a settler and his dogs spawns there. If you talk to him, he telks a story about the Flatwood Monsters. And, suddenly, 2-3 will spawn, they mind controll the dogs and the poor guy and force them to fight...
---
what exactly are you managing with junkies? you can only lose addictions via addictol or radscorpion egg omelettes and you keep the damage bonus whether you have withdrawal effects or not, so once you get whatever 5 addictions you want there's no management at all.
---
No worries fella lol it was funny
---
I'm not a charity. But I don't hide them away underground or behind walls, and I know a 3* lock isn't unpickable so if you are that desperate then feel free to get a wanted level as they contain nothing that can't be replaced.
---
Tbh it's as much about teaching the kids/noobs that thieving had consequences. An experienced player knows the score but it's funny watching a noob with a wanted level as I peck at them in the PvE wasteland with my weakest weapon, not enough to kill, just enough to indicate they are vulnerable and maybe should think before acting.
---
Repair kits are items that are single use, fully repair beyond 100%. You need to do like 1.2k damage to sbq for credit though which can be problematic
---
Yesterday I found a guy selling serums for 10k each.
---
What‚Äôs the deal with that? I found one outside Abbie‚Äôs Bunker, I shot it once and then it teleported away (like beamed up in a spaceship??)
---
Tameable fox. It has to be alone, and has to be a random spawn.
---
Oh I've already found the Wandering Storyteller random event several times before, about 3, but every time he only talks about Snallygasters, leading to us getting ganked by acid spit from all directions.
---
Ballistic or energy weapons or both?
---
Yeah even with my crap stealth rifle build I'm sure I was getting nowhere close to that. :/
---
Well hey, thanks for your advice/input/info. I really appreciate it.
---
Better stretch out those creamy hamstrings, come on now Jessie, let‚Äôs get ‚Äòem.
---
Depending on your build and how capable you are, it can take about 5 or so minutes to get to the launch room and then I think its another 5 minutes for the launch timer to complete. I don't even carry cards on me, I just go to whitespring and get the mission, shoot down the cargobot and grab the card, then head to a silo. Takes me about 20 minutes total.
---
Did that photo last night. Now I wish I would have talked to the guy!
---
Looool
---
Feel free to add me, I‚Äôll help you with armor, weapons and serums tomorrow. GT listed above
---
Its only happened to me the once and it was a few weeks ago now, but its kinda embarassing, when I dropped it I teleported straight to my tent near the fissure site only to realise I wasnt even in the zone lol.
---
I quite enjoy the Mire, it has a peaceful yet deadly feel to it.
---
This is funny.  Poor brahmin
---
Recall cards for encryptid. It‚Äôs not super expensive but you can buy a few depending on the vendors. Downside is they aren‚Äôt trade able.
---
I used be able to find ammo from player venders all the time now there are hardly any C.A.M.P.S. out there.  I have to server hop to find anything.  I know Beth wants new players but it is saturating the game with too many low levels.  Have you dropped a nuke at the SBQ lately?  Its to the point I am only there to kill what she drops for the XP and don't even expect to kill the Queen since out of the 10 people who are there nobody strong enough to gang up on her.  I am not built to do it alone.
---
You scrap Coal to get...Coal.
---
Absolutely true!
---
Cool! Thanks for the information shareing!
---
Mire camp is where it's at.  So much you can do with lighting because it's naturally dark
---
No need. A recent security assessment of nuclear solos noted that one was was able to be breached by a pizza delivery driver...because the exterior doors were propped open.
---
The Biology section of the Morgantown High Library and Vault-Tech University, they've got a book sharing agreement where you can use your library card at either to check out books. Look in the card catalog, they still use the Dewey Decimal system.
---
Barring that however, go back and read the [release notes postings for the patch releases](https://bethesda.net/en/article/2asdca6YRz43ctgyo0o2d3/fallout-76-wastelanders-update-notes-april-14-2020). They've always got bug reports and fixes in them, I believe most of those are still archived on Reddit- search for them in the box up there in the right upper corner and limit the search to this subreddit.
---
Also, the Prime skins (Liberty, Patriot, Shadow) visor is broken with T65. Every other model works with it, only the T65 is broken.
---
Never actually thought of doing that lol thanks
---
And here I'm reminded that I'd really love a Responder-themed loot bag. Like the red Rescue backpack or something similar just marked "Supplies". It'd make dropping these for people SO MUCH EASIER.
---
And if I‚Äôm remembering correctly, they dint have any weight
---
I have some great photo's, how can get them my from XBox?  Is there a way to download through Bethesda or Microsoft?
---
The light wood one was the first wallpaper set. The dark green one was part of a sports themed set I think

Only ever seen one in my 600+ hours played.

No he hasn‚Äôt streamed all of his gameplay. But he is very anti-cheat so he wouldn‚Äôt have done anything on purpose. I don‚Äôt really care anymore people still downvoted cause they think he was cheating so I might just take the post down. Nonetheless he didn‚Äôt dupe or go around picking up weapons and was PERMA banned but some people don‚Äôt seem to care.
---
To stop people from buying more items from his shop. Once he's at 30k caps, he won't get any of the caps people pay him.

Well i guess that's where the deathclaw spawns. https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/mark-error-404/video/93156600

I mean technically Shaun was just a piece of tech too.
---
It's pointless because you're saying "well these are the rules" in response to a thread that suggests changing them, it brings nothing.
---
Sounds like a great way to give away something for free that would otherwise be paid for. I‚Äôm sure Bethesda will jump right on that.
---
Omg. That is absurd
---
If you do camp fire tales, and use a Tesla rifle or such, and tag as many bloodbugs, thier proboscis give two acid each.

Seems legit

No it Happened when wastelanders came out. There would be no nukes as to before there would be multiply every server. And when someone did drop one it would be me with two level 40s and just wasting ammo. But every server I get on it a nuke was dropped it dropped before I get into server and I get left with just low levels so I won‚Äôt drop one
---
My preference was all polymer scout limbs with a heavy BOS combat chest.  Gives a good balanced DR and ER around 250 of each.
---
One of the next updates is going to add a bonus for having a matching set of armor though so it may be worth trying to get a full set eventually.  The bonus will be either fire resistance or poison resistance.  Not really sure if you get to pick which one or if it's random.  It's currently on the test servers so it may be the next update or the one after where it gets added in.
---
The Bloodied Build meta has never appealed to me; it's not for everyone. My current build is a PA/Heavy Gun build; it can be found here:

---
A few notes on that build:  
---
1. It is by no means a perfect, optimised build. I am still tweaking here and there.  
---
2. Thru-Hiker is standing in place of 'Adrenaline' for now until it is fixed.  
---
3. You may want to swap out something in Intelligence for Demolitions Expert if you're using an explosive heavy gun as that will give you a decent boost in damage output.  
---
Additionally, my main gun is a Two-Shot Minigun (aptly named Tyrant for how rapidly it shreds anything it comes up against). I can solo the Scorchbeast Queen with this build very quickly, so it's definitely a decent build. On a side note, I use X-01 Power Armour and a Quad/FFR Telsa rifle to easily tag and soften things up!   
---
I hope this helps!
---
Omg glad I just read this
---
Happy cake day
---
Whoa.... that‚Äôs probably the rarest mob spawn there is
---
It has a point, this is the reality of what you have. You're not the first person to suggest changing anything in the game, you know? But, until that happens, it's what you've got.
---
You sir are a life saver guess I will stock up on them instead
---
Yeah during the day time, awesome and beautiful. At night I feel like any moment something is going to come screaming out of the dark.

Im not saying you are lying, youre probably a decent guy. I‚Äôm not though, and I know some wont that shout loudest are total bs. If you are anti-cheat he would never tell you because it would put him at risk. You can‚Äôt trust anyone except yourself unless your friends got as much to loose on it becoming known.

Is there a specific dialogue choice for this or just random chance when listening to him? I‚Äôve never seen this happen when I ran into him multiple times.
---
My CAMP is next to a random encounter so I‚Äôve seen it spawn about four or five times, once twice in a day. Too bad it doesn‚Äôt drop any alien blaster ammo/guns or plans related to that.

i am very generous, but the last few shoppers at my camp took the free stuff shot me and gave thumbs down.  i have enough of everything, just saw a pair last night camp hopping and thought how much they could acquire and sell.  if bethesda made resources unpickable, maybe they'd get real "jobs" hahaha

Well my character got stuck emoting, couldnt move even after a fast travel so I'm making the call that it's time for me to do something else. Good to know it was a one-time thing for you

You have fallout first so move your tent somewhere near West Tek. Before logging out travel to your tent.  When you log back in fast travel to West Tek again.  Should prevent the low level mutants spawning outside for more xp.

Fed 76 is a website you can price check weapons and armor. I Usually price my stuff below the minimum price that they give. The purveyor is a mole miner that sells you legendary gear for scrip.  Mr. Fuzzy tokens are rewards from doing the dailies at the Mr. Fuzzy but theme park place. Instead of selling them you can trade them in for a Mr. Fuzzy costume but I already have one so I sell my extras.
---
 As for the plans you can get them from event rewards, treasure map rewards or finding them randomly throughout the world ect...
---
Maybe reloads in general are going off. My railway rifles reload when I think they should but there are still spikes shown in the magazine. 
---
And the syringer is just busted. Fire a shot and it shows a shot remaining. Try and use that and nothing. Mash fire, mash reload, and eventually it works.
---
you've achieved the highest level in the game
---
Ballistic all the way! Thanks
---
Either Fireproof perk or the dense torso mod on chest armor will keep you from blowing yourself up with explosive legendary effects. I was in the same boat until I discovered this lol
---
I didn't even think of the possibility that the ammo counter might be off/bugged. Good call
---
I'm sad that they dont have log cabin themed walls and stuff, the prefab is neat but limited.  Those wooden walls did look pretty neat.
---
I got a bloodied 33 vats hit chance with reduced weight, and I think it's probably the best gun in the game. It took down everything except the Scorchbeast Queen/Wendigo Colossus/Imposter Sheepsquatch in one hit. I one-shotted a Sheepsquatch, Super Mutant Behemoth, Mirelurk Queen, and Scorchbeast but the Scorchbeast had to be on the ground
---
Yesterday I was up at the small camp you have to take a photograph of and there were two of them.  Maybe there is a planned invasion on the next update?
---
Same. Even if the weapon is underpowered. If you want a rifle that‚Äôs immensely satisfying to use then sadly your only option is the Lever-action
---
Marsupial + strange in numbers do that... Try to get bird bones, makes it more smooth
---
I think in some wierd way Bethesda has tied the extra effects on fixers to the unique paint job it has. Thus making it impossible to be changed by players or for them to add a slot. I think there was something similar in Fallout 4, if you used a console command to change a skin to some weapon (i don't remember which it was anymore) it removed the effects on it.

&gt; Why would i keep grinding for the not-so-interresting rewards still left in the season, why not just buy the remaining \~30 or so ranks and be done with it all? 
---
I seriously do not understand this logic. You think the rewards aren't interesting, but you were momentarily willing to spend a not insignificant amount of money to 'complete the board' anyway?
---
This, my friend, is called dopamine addiction and it's exactly the kind of behavior that Bethesda is so disgustingly exploiting. Good for you for not giving in. If only other people were so lucky.
---
Seems like people all have different experiences with vats being a problem.
---
Does one gun srmy stagger the SBQ?  I see some people complaining about her staggering and not landing.
---
Whe knows why you had to go...
---
No it's called "i like to complete stuff and not leave things unfinished if i start them" :)
---
Yet they had the nerve to ask the existing community to put on a good look for the new players indirectly when telling us to sport our best power armor or whatever for the wave of new players.  I see a lot of players dedicating time and resources to help the new players and make them more interested, hope Bethesda is doing their part.
---
I've got a two shot, explosive railway with a automatic receiver. It can throw death at an incredible rate, lol. The key is getting the perk to repair your weapon to 200% and use the perk making guns break 40% slower. This will balance out the durability and make the gun a lot more useful.
---
Hahaha yes!! 
---
The tree in our front yard decided to break apart and crash land on my husband's car...but guess what I found during cleanup!? A rusty spring!

Also, when my grandfather passed and we gathered treasures from the house, I found an old silver punch bowl..

I thought about making a stashbox for our front porch, so when friends come over, they cam either add to it, or simply revel in my insanity lol..plus, they'd make for nice props for cosplay.

---
Goes back to my ES4 Oblivion days where some shit couldn't ever be discarded and made your inventory look like a dogs breakfast.
---
all the caps limit did was give an advantage to people who have mules and multiple accounts, it forced high end trading to external markets, it makes people baby sit their machines so that they dont lose money into toddblivion and irritates people who pay to FT to a camp just to have the seller dip out of the server. its a poorly thought out system that needs addressing.
---
Saw two when the game first came out. But then I haven't seen them since...
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure bethesda has never banned people for exploits so your perfectly fine.
---
The only time bethesda has banned people is for duping.
---
Also I wouldn‚Äôt really call it a ban. The way they do there bans is more of an all out investigation on everyone they have a suspicion on. People just got unbanned yesterday if they didn‚Äôt do anything wrong besides pick up duped weapons. But the people that did dupe...... cya.
---
So yea bro you should be fine bethesda has never banned for exploits although it takes a bit for them to patch em they won‚Äôt ban you for it.
---
That's the only thing I do lock.  Because of how fast it generates 5.56 I switched my fixer out with my handmade and haven't had to craft rifle ammo since.  I don't want someone swiping it.....even though it is giving me more than I use and it's piling up in my inventory lol.
---
Dude you need to look up the definition of an exploit.
---
Making 5.56 a currency is not even an exploit as like waiting for people to drop stuff. 
---
I can see you throwing some true one and false ones.
---
Glitching through a door is an exploit but not a serious one that ruins other players experience. 
---
Asking about exploits getting you banned? The hell you get this idea.
---
I‚Äôm doing much the same!
---
imagine a BMW and the international space station both being $30000 because that the most money you can have lol.
---
I feel nodes go hand in hand with mob spawns.... I steer so clear of that shit it's not funny. Plus there's so few resources needed anymore once you get a system going.
---
It doesn‚Äôt craft a mod like you can find/buy it unlocks a plan when you modify the base weapon on a workbench. Some of them you need perks to create but it‚Äôll tell you what you need in the workbench.
---
Are you seriously trying to compare actions like duping items by abusing the way the game saves NPC and Character data to server hoping?
---
Because people don‚Äôt always know what is good/bad.  For example does the hunter‚Äôs weapons impact the SBQ as she is an animal?  I think it does but you seem to think otherwise.  
---
As for non-legendary for the right price I‚Äôll buy crossbows for alts doing badges so they can be repaired or things like handmades to scrap for mods
---
...when you are over level 100 in Nuclear Winter.
---
380 hours in here and I've probably killed the Flatwoods monster about 8-10 times. I can run into him randomly. I think a mothman spawns beside my house and I've killed him tons of times.
---
Yes it does. And it currently causes her not to land. There should be some changes incoming. When i used the perk (when it worked properly) i didn't wildly shoot at her when she was flying (makes no sense to waste ammo). But patiently waited for her to land so i can keep her grounded with this perk while killing her.
---
Not me, I'm on PS4

I would say that all of these questions can be answered with no, they‚Äôre not exploits. But, when compared with duplicating, isn‚Äôt that something that can be done in game too? I think the thing is, there‚Äôs a big difference between being a sneaky little bugger, and directly making a massive change to the balance of the game by creating 25000 flux, or making a whole arsenal of glitched weapons. It‚Äôs kind of like when someone says ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt touch that.‚Äô And you rob it instead. They didn‚Äôt say ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt rob it‚Äô but pretty much implied with the other statement. Manipulating glitches and hacks to create an disproportionate amount of resources and guns that isn‚Äôt possible by standard gameplay I would personally say is the exploitation involved. Glitching through a door, pinging enemies to get loot etc, all these things can be frowned upon, but that‚Äôs down to a persons own actions, not a previously set out manipulation of things that doesn‚Äôt require actual gameplay to achieve. 
---
I think. Of course Bethesda can say whatever they want is an exploitation, that‚Äôs why they‚Äôve worded it as such; So their own opinions could be completely different than mine!
---
Server hoping. No. They have said it‚Äôs a legit tactic. 
---
What do you mean by inaccessible? 
---
Trading is not an exploit. 
---
Trading to a nuke isn‚Äôt an exploit. You aren‚Äôt working around the limit. 
---
Camping is not an exploit. If you mean placing your camp, if you can place it, it‚Äôs legit.
---
It‚Äôs not an exploit for low levels to do nothing during an event provided they aren‚Äôt staying in the event using an exploit. For example rigging your controls or keyboard to avoid the auto log off to stay in the world and get Fasnacht rewards.
---
No waiting around isn‚Äôt an exploit.
---
Honestly none of these are exploits. 
---
And I kind of think you know that and your trying to get some point across because of the recent band for duper‚Äôs and people that traded in dupes.
---
wym? I have an armor plated SS backpack, a high cap croc backpack, and a grocers blueridge backpack in my inventory right now?
---
I‚Äôm talking about buying the entire pass
---
well, you can buy them again and sell them cheaper
---
I did purchase all the ranks, and now my season is done. Fo1st is canceled. 
---
I'll be back when some new stuff drops, its time for a break.
---
Fix the LAG aswell. This game is a fucking mess most of the time, even worse at events where there are too many players so the server can't handle. Bethesda should focus on single player games from now on.
---
Did you play FO4? Now those were some loading screens! 76 screens last like 30 seconds compared to 3 minutes.
---
I never paid attention to the years or continuity. I started with 4.

---
For anyone that runs silos, I always say thank you with a lunchbox.
---
Oh, and they must fix the bug that trapts you inside your powerarmor until you fast travel (if you are not overcumbered) or leave the server... is ridiculous.
---
I‚Äôm never upset when I see this shared, though I do think there are other choices (though maybe not in your build) that offer better benefits than Green Thumb.
---
I had one pop up last night and glitch out on me at my camp, so I could get pictures lol.
---
My ammo machine is in the heart of my base guarded personally by Sofia... If you can pick a L3 lock while tolerating her mindless dribble you deserve the contents.
---
I never even thought of this.
---
On my phone, you go to the fo76 main page, tap the three dots menu thing in the upper right corner, then pick "change user flair"
---
But if you're asking how to live the mega sloths lifestyle, that is unteachable, it comes from within
---
Yes, I played it. But in F76 these loading screens are nowadays way too longer then before. I don't know why.
---
&gt; No it's called "i like to complete stuff and not leave things unfinished if i start them"
---
Yes, and that's exactly what these types of game pass systems try to exploit.
---
On the bright side, it‚Äôs made the game more fun. Like just last night I got a bunch of new players to help me raid somebody‚Äôs workshop because they were abusing a glitch, and gave them some cool gear in exchange
---
A little advice from another melee/unarmed, if you‚Äôre under 500 damage resistance, do a sneak set up. If you don‚Äôt like sneaking serendipity perk (luck), blocker perk (strength), ironclad (end), dodgy and evasive (agi). Also, get the empath mutation. Believe it or not, it actually decreases your damage taken as well because you‚Äôre part of the team. But still you will die if you‚Äôre not at a minimum 500 damage resistance. And even then you‚Äôre still not safe from a gang of ghouls. 3 is ok. I switched to a sneak build. More convenient, and tons more damage. Flaw, slow af, and other people can knock you out of stealth sometimes and then you‚Äôre fucked.
---
What do you mean? How can you tell an armor piece doesn‚Äôt work because of a weapon.
---
Admittedly, it‚Äôs a pretty terrible name considering you CAN‚ÄôT actually build with public team members, at least at CAMP.
---
What are they for?
---
As a post apocalyptic economist I don't find that solution satisfactory
---
Is this considered proper etiquette through from your experiences? I wouldn‚Äôt want to piss anybody off by joining them literally not doing anything...
---
In that same vein, should I just do this every time I log on and start one? Or is there some reason I shouldn‚Äôt? I‚Äôve done zero with teams thus far.
---
I use the power armor jetpack tricknto do a solo in like 10 mins at most
---
What I‚Äôm trying to say is that when you have the dense chestpiece mod applied, it reduces the explosive damage from most weapons to almost zero. That effect doesn‚Äôt work with the gauss weapons and explosive laser and plasma weapons.
---
Subconsciously I was just looking for a cooler answer then Pip-Boy. Imma just go with that. I knew it was going to be a stupid question lmao.
---
I sold 13x cards in my vendors today- silos were clearly running hot on PS4.

Trashcan Carla won't be born for over a century. Could be her great grandma.
---
Turn the argument around, once they've accepted the payment after banning OP, they are actually in breach of the agreement and need to deliver the goods thus they either need to refund on their own or unban OP so he can get what he paid for.
---
Both sides have valid points and should redress that in small claims.
---
Ahh, you realize Trashcan Carla wasn't born for at least another 150 or so years right?
---
yup
---
Right, I rolled a TS1090 gauss minigun that I think does fine non-primed and  buy every 2mmEC i find for up to 3 caps per.  I own every plan available from npc vendors.  Its hard in high level end game with all the limits they put on us.
---
Indeed man, I never do them and I feel so grateful when Scorched Land spawns
---
I wish to join your religion and receive your newsletter
---
damn old man don't take it so seriously. I hated having to grind a month and a half to unlock the ABILITY to grind for another two weeks just for 2 items, then grind a month for like 3 pieces of armor, and then go grind another month to max out another factions reputation just to unlock the ability to buy one modification for one weapon. an endgame grind shouldn't be waiting 20 hours every day just to turn in for gold, that's not even doing anything I just log in to turn in for my scrip and gold and then log off. Bethesda doesn't know how to make an endgame grind and it's annoying.
---
makes for a nice portable camp.  You probably don‚Äôt even need to use the nuclear generator, unless you have stuff outside you want to power.
---
Mhmm. Interesting.  I use the fireproof perk, with my bloodied gauss shotgun, and I have yet to kill myself or take any damage with it. I never really used the dense mod.
---

*missed connections* you're welcome, maybe. I was buying a bunch of stuff off a player machine and they "max cap ghosted" when I was probably 6000 caps in. I just chucked and said something like "oh shit! I just blew this guy out of here with caps. Whoops."
---
I‚Äôve got an anti armor one and if I fire it too close to an enemy, it kills me.
---
I don‚Äôt think you understand that bethesda doesn‚Äôt ban people unless it ruins others experience. 
---
That‚Äôs the beauty of fallout do whatever the fuck your heart desires.
---
If it ruins others experience though then you and bethesda have a problem
---
All these examples only benefit you therefore no need for bethesda to get involved
---
Bethesda has only banned people for duping thus far nothing else. You will be perfectly fine.
---
Also you gotta realize it‚Äôs an mmo so obviously some things have to be bannable like cheating duping ect ect
---
If you know anyone who plays the sims 4, you should throw them this game

Death claw island has one but I don‚Äôt know if you can tame it and it‚Äôs only a level 21

I used to never see them but since Wastelanders dropped I've seen probably a dozen.
---
Hey you still got them for sale? I would buy some today.
---
You can write notes in this game?
---
Pretty sure they do...
---
No server hoping is not an exploit. No, tagging enemies is not an exploit. 
---
An exploit is making the game do something it‚Äôs not supposed to do... like duplicate weapons, buy stuff for free, etc
---
Omg a death claw gauntlet with a french manicure üò≠üò≠ I NEED that
---
Why
---
I get your second point.  Now that I know of the horrors regarding Radium Rifle mods, I'm vowing to put Radium Rifles up for sale in my vendor when I find them just so people who need the 500+ scraps for mods can buy em.  So yes, some non-legendary weapons have a market and practical purpose.  But most are just storage clutter.
---
Most of my game recently has been trying to find stupid crap to buy.  Was about to hit limit again so blew 10k buying out Whitesprings plans I'll never use, but before I'd even left someone pushed me to cap limit again and I just logged in the middle of them buying stuff.  God this game has so much badly designed shit in it.
---
Last 3 I scrapped said that but when I went to mod the ones I have nothing new. So I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs a bug
---
No, I removed my own posts, it's never been taken down.  This morning I posted about a Line in the sand glitch I'd never seen before, after a dozen "delete it before 'they' see" posts, i gave up.  seems it's a long time glitch.  I enjoy finding the bugs and glitches, it's a game, it's a creation, and it's imperfect, I don't hurt other players, I don't sell things that shouldn't exist, I explore.  Just tired of the flames.

Ah I see. No I haven‚Äôt purchased anything, just hopped on my Game Pass install to see the process for purchasing 1st. Yeah I hadn‚Äôt really seen many questions pertaining to 1st and this new Windows version. I would hope faith could be placed in what the game takes you to, but considering the Game Pass version still has the NoRegionPing issue it kinda casts a bit of doubt on trusting spending money through it lol

I guess i tried by accident and it didnt work. I had to complete 1 daily left before the main phase of farming and they were 10 lvl outside when I ft to my tent and stuck in it. that is why I had to ft once again to West-Tek and the same thing with mobs. So maybe ur theory works but not always. And when i do such farming of course I have my tent in the area.
---
Wait, there are shortcuts through the silos? I've only ever launched a nuke once (and then I got disconnected) and I hate it. My second attempt resulted in me rage-quitting because an assaultron shivved me in the back while I was using a computer and I didn't want to go all the way back from the spawn point.
---
Post a video of placing the camp device and then clicking on your menu
---
Because one took the time to go to school and learn how to save lives and the other is an unskilled burger flipper.
---
 Obviously the person who wants to achieve in their life should live better off than the person with no ambition who wants to flip burgers.
---
Now if the Burger flipper had a cap that was comfortable for the doctor then I'm fine with that but the Burger flipper would never reach that cap.
---
That and whitesprings and the town where the college is
---
I hace recently noticed that all Tv series have tons of fifties looking fans on every scene
---
That‚Äôs why I suggested the purchase. There‚Äôs barely anything easy to buy after you have most or all of the purchasable plans.
---
/u/ladydevann surely you know the struggle of trying to look your best in this wasteland.
---
Pretty drunk NOT to nab that one üòâ
---
So why do you run vamps with full health?  Wouldnt furios or instigating wespons be better and bring some stimpaks? And whats J?
---
Depends on tour goals. Fissure prime+ sundew grove if you want bosses. Whitespring if you want ghouls and flux and flux stabilizers (good for rapid xp) . Harpers ferry if you want ghouls/xp from the burrows. If you're looking for other types of flux look into mappalachia as they have maps for where each color is most dense.  For right now, nuking whitespring is the most helpful for the newbies.
---
poor level 52 over here like "alms for the poor" 
---
\*holds out can\*
---
Did you rank up in the legendary run by pressing the rank up button?
---
Pretty drunk not to nab that.
---
Says a Mr. Fuzzy to the enclave.
---
Bethesda caught so much crap for the fridge when it released.  They will never do what you are suggesting as it would make it pay to win in some people's eyes. 
---
What they should have done was release a rusty/crappy fridge for free, and sell the premium skins for atoms. Then they could have made the fridge at least useful.
---
I hear the feral ghoul officer beeping long after I've logged off.
---
The Sims 4 is a little too involved in the building aspect for me. Also, I get tempted to kill off sims in horrible ways (back in Sims 2.)
---
Junkies, Executioners, and/or Furious are all pretty viable.
---
I always buy the power generators and power armor work bench to pass out to level 1-10. I wish I had those sooner when I started.
---
You will see its not a big deal when you earn more scrips later. I have so many scrips that I now start hoarding legendary modules which weigh 0.25 per module. You will easily reach daily cap just by crafting and selling special armour bought with gold bullions. A little advice, Its a good idea to reach the final quest to start earning gold bullions.
---
I agree, though Exiles does have PVE-RP servers... it's just... you still have times where mobs and people can wreck your base unless you go solo and tweak settings.
---
Ish. There IS a glitch/exploit with power armor that allows you to pass through walls. So there's at least one place in the silo where you can use this to skip a bunch of stuff. I thought they patched that "skip" a long time ago but apparently not.
---
Anyone still doing this? I just got a ridiculous amount of levels from it and would love for someone to do it again üòçü§£
---
the best part of fo76 is the casual social experience.
---
I'm guessing he's a PC player and opens a notepad on his second monitor ;). Or just does it the old school way with a pad and pen.
---
That's all I had today sadly :( But my CAMP is under a cargobot spawn travel path so I shoot them down constantly.
---
Because if you could delete stuff directly from your inventory, someone would screw up and accidentally delete something they wanted to keep, and the crying would be nonstop.
---
1. College isn‚Äôt economically feasible for everyone, let alone the amount of schooling required for becoming a doctor.
---
2. Working at a fast food place doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt have ambition. You‚Äôre providing a service, one that is the basis of a multi-billion dollar industry, and yet you‚Äôre still treated like crap and have no upward mobility in the company because you‚Äôre seen as disposable.
---
3. The idea of a wealth cap would most likely be for the purpose of creating more economic equality, so having different caps for different people doesn‚Äôt make sense
---
SS chest and jetpack is amazingly fun!! Your mobility is of the charts with it. My favorite 2 items in the game for sure.
---
Once you buy those items you can get the rest of the set, which has the best resistances in the game. Definitely recommended! üëçüëç
---
But did you power cycle your console or pc?
---
For me on a solo run I do Morgantown on private server (as Morgantown is a newbie area it's not fair to turn it into a blast zone in public imo).
---
Plenty of fat ghoul packs and lots of types of flux.
---
I don‚Äôt mind if they do the same thing with the scrap kits and repair kits. Either buy it in the atomic shop. Or like they did with the scorchebeast queen. You get some as a reward.
---
Thanks, I‚Äôll add you after the daily‚Äôs refresh Im looking to get to level 50 this weekend if possible. I‚Äôm level 31 at the moment ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
And why do half of you stock thousands of .38, .44 and 10mm?? Nobody wants that sh
---
Np! What system do you play on?
---
Done, I just had to move the stove over a bit. I have the fusion generator to power a resource node and/or a ton of water purifiers depending on where I land.
---
Oooooh lmao I misread that
---
J is junkies
---
And I run vemps so I never have to worry about healing. It's just my walking around guns, makes the game super simple lol. And instigating on heavy weapons isn't great. And I have junkies for damage when I want it. But most everything still goes down super easy with vamps, but you heal so fast you can just take the imposter face blast and live (if you're constantly hitting something)
---
I didn't get any one-shotters in six runs this afternoon on PS4. I felt the community was awesome today!! Had some great fights :)
---
Hmm, thank you, I'll look into it.
---
I play on PC. Well... a gaming laptop that benchmarks below/at the Xbox one
---
I'm always buying stupid shit cause I have horrible management skills with my caps. And I swear to you buying out every Nuka Cola flavor each day is worth it. That's not all of it, but it's the important part.
---
So sadly can't relate to having too many caps.
---
I've tried doing an emote after but the wheel comes up blank. I've had it happen both times without any combat involved. First one was while waiting for a Nike to drop, the other was just after joining the free range ebent
---
I've never gone beyond 8k caps... I didn't even know there was a cap cap. :(
---
What's the limit on maximum caps? 25,000?
---
I have a shit load of key cards but idk wheat to do with them.
---
there would be NO incentive for anyone to be anything other than the burger flipper. if you could earn the same money without having to go to school or work in a job that more complicated, why would you?
---
if burger flippers and doctors made the same, there would be no doctors.
---
They honestly need to add a caps stash for fo1st players
---
you drink from the toilet... and you're not gagging like a loon afterwards.
---
No, on PSN my renewal was listed as being $0, so I let it go to see what would happen. It renewed after I was suspended
---
I was watching the YouTuber angryturtle yesterday farm through West tech...man he was getting 4k pretty much every kill it seemed. Of course he was set up maximum gains. Berry mentats, brain bombs, full builders group bonus, rested 100% bonus from lunch boxes, egghead I think as well, and cranberry relish I believe.
---
I did not, same rank I was yesterday!
---
1.  If you study hard while you're in school you can get scholarships to colleges. If you slack off your whole school career then you will most likely become a Burger flipper.
---
 I didn't go to college and I'm still making close to a $100,000 year because I learned a skilled trade. I put my life savings into starting a flooring tile business. I am going on year 5 and everything is going as planned so far.
---
2.  I have ordered a cheeseburger and they forgot to put the cheese and the Burger on it. I got 2 slices of bread.
---
 Fast food chains have always been meant to be a stepping stone or learning stone for new workers it was never meant to be a career.
---
3. Economic equality is a fallacy.  If everybody was on the same economic equality then why would anybody want to go to school for such a long time to be a doctor when you can flip burgers and make the same amount.
---
 We would have a world full of Burger King workers with nobody to take care of you if you get sick.
---
Smells like socialist bullshit üòí
---
Where did u get your weapons from?  Purveyor, marketplace or vending machines?
---
&gt;Personally I would be too embarrassed for that amount lol.
---
It's all about principle.
---
they go into what I call the magical bit bucket!
---
It literally takes about 5 minutes to get Max bond again. You‚Äôll be fine. Plus. When a pc or console ‚Äúcrashes‚Äù the game doesn‚Äôt recognize it as a crash. It recognizes it as you leaving the game. Whatever the reason is, all the game gates about is that YOU left. So it takes away all your benefits.
---
Whenever i see the event i am there. Took about 3 waves to get it right last time.
---
That sentry bot would sure take care of unsuspecting turrets and traveling merchants
---
Look inside the atom shop to see your current balance. Some people were reporting having 0 atoms but in the atom shop they had their atoms listed there.
---
Would the anti armour effect cause any issues? I guess you could try another gauss shotgun to find out if thats the culprit.
---
I've always wanted to launch a nuke but I can never figure out how to get into the silos.
---
Ngl this comment helped me greatly im level 50 somthing and i have a bunch of low level stuff and not enough caps.
---
I‚Äôm sure everyone of them claimed they only picked up stuff in a paper bag, so essentially everyone was unbanned already lol
---
Can you imagine having an Assaultron and someone is robbing your stuff and it just appears and boom
---
That might be the case. I‚Äôve got a quad that I didn‚Äôt have any issues with.
---
So they said you can play again but your at lvl 1 with all your inventory?
---
I understand that you want an established standard since one isnt hard set.  When it comes to agreeing to terms and conditions, aka voluntarily waiving some of your rights, its importiant to know just where the line lays.
---
Banning and terms of agreement are not a solution to exploiters, they need to pause the money grabbing and actually dedicate to fixing the game. So many people who paid for the game wouldnt have been banned if they just released a solid product from the start rather then driving mass hype on a game they knew was incomplete and giving crappy products that where falsely advertised such as the cheap bags and plastic Nuka dark rum bottle covers. These "smacks to the face" disgruntled customers making them more disposed to dupe because they feel they've been slighted. This is the principle of equity, business 101.
---
the encrypted recall cards are a good cap sink as well
---
It's super easy! Have you done all of the enclave quests? 
---
Specifically gotten up to the quest "I am become death"?
---
All these people urging people to wait til the end of the Season as though everyone plays the same way. What if someone doesn't want to see another Daily challenge in their life at this point but still wants the later rewards? What if someone is going on holiday? What if they want to go play TESO/other MMO for a month or two? What if they just already have the Atoms and think it's a good tradeoff for their time? Hell, a lot of us are already in the later ranks that people were urging to wait for. Some people might not want to get to the end, and will likely be happy with a certain reward they can buy their way to.
---
Correct. I was suspended, then they renewed me 3 days later. My appeal was denied, though they haven't formally perma banned me. For what it's worth, I'm not disputing the suspension or potential ban, I'm unhappy that Beth went ahead and charged me for a service AFTER suspending me.
---
&gt;Greetings,
---
 
---
&gt;After review of the account, it has been determined that this account did in fact violate our Terms of Service.  We regret to inform you that your appeal for temporary account suspension reversal is denied due to the evidence within our system for Exploitation ‚Äì Item Duplication.
---
I spent my caps for drugs üòÇ
---
Unfortunately it's 0 even inside the Atom Shop interface.
---
Extremely easy if you know what you‚Äôre doing. It should take anywhere from 15-30min to do. The longest part to do is where you need to find 15 mainframe cores.
---
Dense mod is not enough. You need Fireproof perk aswell. Dense is 50% reduction, and Fireproof 45%. Equals to \~75% or so reduction.
---
I think bloodied need a nerf
---
I think I have been very lucky with the flatwoods monster. I have only been playing for a couple months and have killed two of them and have seen a couple more who just disappeared as soon as I engaged them.
---
Many photos were had!
---
Just think how much we would charge each other for items if we did not have this limit for items?
---
You can. I've traded Gauss Weapons for scrip.
---
Used to be 25k, then raised at 30k which helped very little for anyone concerned by the cap.
---
I must have tried 1000 times. I still do, because pie.
---
...you can?
---
It's your firewall unfortunately, i had the same issue numerous times, essentially what you need to do is temporarily disable your firewall and then try the verify files option, it should then run and scan and quickly reinstall the missing files which usually may only be around 1 or 2gb if you're lucky. From there once that is done you then want to add the game as an exception, if you're unsure how to do this if you do a quick google search for your anti virus you should find a quick how to video.
---
I did this about a month ago and i haven't had a problem since.
---
Not really. The difference between power armor and normal armor is extreme. Compared to how it was in fallout 4, power armor kinda sucks whenever you can get full sets of uny and then 2 other effects like ap refresh or sentinels.
---
Very true.
---
I‚Äôm on PS4. I recently upgraded my hard drive and my load screens are very fast. It was really my machine that was the issue.
---
This
---
It‚Äôs totally fine. I‚Äôve joined dozens of teams and honestly I think I‚Äôve only ever talked to a couple people and that was super briefly. Just look up right away to start creating bonds and go about your business. It‚Äôs the best of everything. Benefits without distractions.
---
Only problem is if he were to die....... BOOM.  There goes the CAMP
---
Same bug for me
---
yes you just can‚Äôt sell, drop, or trade
---
You get 1400 caps/day just selling garbage to vendors.  It's very very very easy to hit that 1400 cap limit each day.  I usually do it with meat + water.  Today I did it with just (cooked) meat.
---
This sub is getting unbearable with the downvotes.  This guy makes great point to point argument and somehow because it doesnt align with your views on the subject you downvote him.  Way to try to understand the otherside....SMH.
---
Oh I wasn't asking. I was incredulous that they were unaware that you could scrip them.
---
Glad I'm not the only one, I took one in beta and it was so good and basic at the same time I thought it was a default screen. To keep me from over doing it I only take loading photos if it's for a mission and I take them exactly where I am. Too many good places to choose from so I have to roll with it.
---
Close, I use OneNote :-)
---
What glitch were they using? I would nuke greedy players camps that sell cheap stuff with overpriced prices.
---
Of course it got down voted. Everything regarding PvP and ingame balance gets down voted.
---
Did you buy anything on accident?
---
He has 300 he restocks once a week.  It's 6k caps.  He's often buggy and won't reset for people.  Some people he's never worked for.  Bethesda!
---
Huh. I was gonna ask what you sold to get it but since you said that ill instead ask what exactly and where did you hunt? Like what kind of meat? Because that sounds like something really easy to do.
---
I live in New Mexico - I have so many pictures I could post that look like Fallout locations.... taking a walk without being reminded of the game is damn near impossible....
---
I might have to start being more philanthropic. Sounds like a good idea.
---
You can also throw the genny up top, mine sits there with the scavagtron.
---
Event completion. I stack Lunch boxes with canned meat so my guess is yes it will since technically it's a aid item. Also event XP isn't the way to go. Intelligence gives you more overall xp so team building is the way to go.
---
Create a build team, switch it the event team near event completion, then switch back after. Change the team type by:
---
1. Being team leader
---
2. Clicking on your own name in the menu
---
But what about pride in your vault? Vault-tec requires that all members wear their uniform at all times!
---
1. Not everyone comes from the same background or education as you. 
---
2. Just because you got shafted by a service employee once does not mean that they‚Äôre all lazy, unambitious cretins.
---
3. Some people become doctors because they have a passion for helping people. Very few people, I imagine, have a passion for working at a fast food place. Just because someone does labor that you deem unskilled does not mean that  they don‚Äôt deserve to be treated equally to everyone else. One of the main motifs in fallout 76 is the cruelty of rich people/big businesses viewing people as disposable, worth only for the service they provide. How did you miss that?
---
Better yet, build a weak tesla rifle
---
That's only 4 days selling garbage to the vendors.  That must have been a lot of hookers and blow.
---
Yea, true lol
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more. The blue stands out way to much.
---
For events like Rad Rumble the INT team is best. For events with one big legendary boss like Free Range the Hunting team is best. For most other events like Feed the People, the Event team is best.
---
I've heard that you can modify the objective of your public team to get the best out of all situations, like killing the Queen with a Hunting team and immediately switching to an Events Team for double event XP without having to reform the bonds, but I haven't tried it yet.
---
I got this in hopes of making a shop out if it. I currently use a 2x2 split in half. One side is my shop and the other is my generator. Both halves have a garage door.
---
This is handy because I can remove power to the shop and shop garage door when I hit max caps. I used to use a keypad pylon but it seems like public teammates can open without entering the password and just buy 20k past the max caps. Now I just scrap the garage door power line.
---
The problem with the red rocket is it doesn't even need power to open the garage door. Even if I delete the power line, you can still click the garage door and open it. It's not very good to use as a shop unfortunately.
---
Hey there, thank you for the information. There is so much more (to me) to this game now than there was a year and a couple months ago.
---
You give it to naughty boys and girls.
---
I do the quest every day but never seen that tent method until today! Can finally (nearly) change my build
---
I would much rather have an assaultron.... for their combat abilities..... yea that's it.
---
I know i meant scrap.    But they should really increase the cap or maybe have a weekly cap seperate.    
---
I mean did they really think we would craft one peice at time.
---
I only sell decent 3* wpns/armor (let's face it, bloody/uny/vanguards is the only stuff that moves quick and I won't bother with 1 and 2's) 1cap 5.56 by the ton, fusions (50c @100%) and nuclear keys (300c). 
---
....and it's a donut shop sooooo cake and donuts for 5c.... Nukacola is free from the machine.... Vintage Nukashine in the clearly marked keg next to the banjo for those after a good time ;) 
---
Id rather have an empty machine charging way less than a full stash of hideous crap.
---
What is this pein?
---
I feel bad cause I launch nukes to hunt the wendigo colossus for the pride of killing it alone/before the event. Maybe I should get to doing sbq instead for everyone elses sake while the xp event is going.
---
wut.
---
Thats what i mean.
---
My principals are worth a bit more than 12 bucks.
---
I would miss AmCo ammunition construction application, vendors and water source atleast with this one
---
Did you try logging off and on again? I had this bug where it showed that I had a lower amount of atoms than I actually did. Logging off and on again fixed it.
---
Some people like helping people out of the goodness of their hearts, or have a passion for medicine. I imagine, also, if school wasn‚Äôt so prohibitively expensive, there would be more doctors.
---
IDGAF if I run into another teammate during my entire session.  Just get me that +4 INT and we're good.
---
Yup, Handmade decides to reload at completely random numbers sometimes.
---
The same because the only items that would change price would be the high end ones that already circumvent caps and just do item trading to make up for the small cap.
---
I think they want to be able to scrap (not scrip) them for reduced scrip rate or something just get rid of them in a meaningful way faster.  They have the issue I do where when I'm done for the day I craft a dozen gauss miniguns and now I'm sitting on 80+lbs of gun tha install scrip fodder.
---
4 to 6 hits with a plasma caster with sniper barrel, 3-4 if I use my ghoul slayer one.
---
Yeah I was just thinking, what this camp needs is a follower with 76's dodgy NPC AI that shoots missiles at mole rats and explodes when it dies.
---
;)
---
If people aren‚Äôt standing on buildings, idc how long it takes. But I can‚Äôt spend 25 minutes fighting her in the air. I used to drop 3-4 nukes a night. Now I just want to do them private. The last two nights there are been like 10 people on tents and buildings and she would never land. Entire fight lol. I ask them to stand on the ground and they say no. So I‚Äôm almost over pub nukes for a minute.
---
Probably for any other reason to log out. Go to work. Sleep. Walk the dog. Rob a bank. Could be anything.
---
Good call!!!
---
If you nuke the overgrown sundew Grove then that has a chance to spawn a Wendigo Colossus and you can hit fissure site prime. I've personally spawned the Colossus 2 times by doing that out of the 5 times I've launched nukes
---
As a gunslinger main, I would shit my knickers if they added a 1911. Heres my suggestion a few weeks back.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hc3zvo/dreaming_of_a_1911_being_added_to_fo76/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
I pray to Todd they will add it every night. Hasnt worked yet, but i will jeep trying. 
---
*"Our great Lord and savior Todd, please bleeseth thy with a 1911 ,for it is the one true weapon worthy enough to cleanse the wasteland in your name. Amen"*
---
If you‚Äôre trying to get the mutations for free, as in randomly obtaining one by farming rads and server hopping. Then there‚Äôs nothing you can do. Either you get a good one, or a bad one. There‚Äôs no way to increase your luck or get the mutation you want, and avoid the ones you don‚Äôt. When you take 1 rad away it will randomly delete one of your mutations. It could be any of them. 
---
The only way for you to have every single mutation you want, is to go and buy the mutations that other players sell. If you don‚Äôt have caps, or you‚Äôre one of those people that refuse to pay for mutations, then keep trying your luck.
---
Same here. He talked about Ronny arranging Frankie's funeral and him sending money to Frankie's girlfriend after his death. However, the last dialogue option actually acknowledges that we spared Frankie (Beckett talks about how Ronny will kick his ass out the base once he clears his head).
---
It was weird and disappointing.
---
Bear Arms is your new friend.
---
TIL that Squad Maneuvers is useless.
---
They have delivered the goods, in a weird way. The account is only suspended and not terminated or deleted, as such it still exists on their systems, hence why the automated system took the payment and renewed the subscription. The account is likely still flagged as "active". This is fixable by flagging accounts with more tags and withholding payment(s) and subscriptions should it return "suspended" or "terminated". That's my take on it, I am a developer just not for Bethesda so I can't speak for their backend systems. Apologies :(
---
I do agree that it is an awful system, payment should **not** have been taken until the account is officially active once again. I would definitely get in touch with Bethesda regarding it though, hopefully they can shed more light on the situation? Take my up vote either way, has been a pleasure having a mature debate seeing both sides.
---
I run ghoulified lvl 3 and have radway favorited, I just use radway and their rad damage just heals me.
---
That is a terrible idea.  I don't want to have 15 shots left for when SBQ lands and have to reload during the brief window she's on the ground.
---
It's a wake up call a lot of us need in games with things to buy. Mine was the fact that I went to 40/100 ranks before even realising buying rank ups were a thing. I made it this far without buying rank ups and during the initial few missions (before the god send that are the extra missions we have now) and losing some missions to a glitch. I think I can manage the rest of the way.
---
FBI:  Stay right where you are!
---
Yea if it's not too late, grind for that ghillie suit. Started wearing that and I can feel the difference.
---
I'd totally play with that dude.
---
*In small bursts.*
---
Best I can suggest is that if you have the means to craft the more commonly used ammo and sell that in your vendor, go that route. Plans are also one of my best sellers, most of which I sell at half the listed value price. Also, when I'm selling things to train station vendors, I pop on hard bargain perk and I also occasionally use a grape mentats for even better pricing, especially if I also plan on buying some stuff from those vendors.
---
100% my heroes. 
---
It's my favorite thing to do but running silo back to back is not always my thing. These folks take the time so everyone can enjoy.
---
I wish the actual vendors had cap storages up to the current max or something. And you have to empty out the vendors otherwise it just turns off, no more buying from that vendor, and it alerts you to empty your shop. Just off the top of my bead but it'd feel more like what they are. Vending machines pretty much.
---
Really? That sounds very interesting, I may just do that! The other zones I've been hitting have 2 assault RE's so its 2 chances to spawn it. But for now, to be charitable, I think I'll go for that 2 for 1.
---
Too subtle....
---
I'm trying to establish the line between things that will get you banned and things that won't.
---
Explosive weapons are generally trash.   They are a novelty sure but dont work on bosses and are annoying in such ways as you say.  
---
But people fly into a blind rage for saying that like you just insulted their manhood or something.  Fortunately I am a sucker for punishment.   Welcome to the club!
---
I love this man, i hope your prayers get answered, as they are my own.
---
Yes, I'm suprised that while they were taking assets from fallout 4 they left the robot workshop behind.
---
Even if they limited it to one robot and made it take a collector's or allies spot it would be worth it.
---
Geez I'm a lowly level 30 who was happy when my caps reached 4 digits this week lol
---
I've got a bit of spare time on my hands these days. Also, in Canada we're charged $17.50 for Fallout 1st which is in my opinion egregious for what we get but I also knew when I paid for it (originally the plan was for 1 month so that I could load up my scrapbox, but I ended up paying for 3 so far) that FO76 was designed to be the king of late-game microtransaction.
---
I feel like I couldn't switch from hunting to event quick enough
---
I saw a unlocked door on a nearby house. I guess the neighbors don‚Äôt mind me walking right in and taking their shit.
---
I find him and mothman most often when just hiking through to mountains, and I just haven‚Äôt really done that in awhile
---
I'm a heavy gunner with a 12 plus gun loadout.  I have bear arms.  But when I craft them, i do it en mass.  Typically I make 30 at a time and end up with like 200 lbs of gun regardless of perks.  I have the capacity to carry those, but now I cant pick anything up.
---
My average loadout weight, that is weight of my kit without loot, is around 250 to 280 depending on ammo stock.  But I can carry about 550 with being over encumbered.  So after crafting, I typically sit around 500 until I can get rid of them.
---
As a grown ass man, I too think game makers are asking too much of me when they try to hold me accountable for my actions.
---
This guy gets it.
---
Just don‚Äôt do whatever got you banned last time?
---
Are you a gamepass player, someone else with gamepass was having the same problem
---
Man...see this is how we get evil mirror universes.
---
I got a camo ops underarmor from the atom shop a while ago and have favorited that for NW.  I couldn‚Äôt figure out why people were naked when I first started playing until I went into 3rd person and realized I was basically a neon sign.
---
Its really not worth that level of min/max. Just stick to building and have at everything using that.
---
Good idea also, haven‚Äôt thought of it! I guess arrows arrows are cheaper though and wouldn‚Äôt a bow be lighter?
---
See, for me it's the reverse. All my herbivore food can be farmed in about 5 minutes and a couple fast travel points, no killing, no trying to find a target, and much easier to prepare a day's worth at a time.
---
Yes but you CANT stack cranberry with cranberry juice.   
---
Also cola nut triple the xp buff from cola.
---
I am on PC
---
Yesterday i was going all bush wookie, this lvl 1 stood beside my bush basically in the open in his vault suit, i told him to move and he did his question mark sign not long after that he got killed lol
---
I am resources.

---
But like so many things on Reddit, it is only meaningful if you believe in the karma. It has no value, other than what someone invests in it.
---
I lost out on about 5000 caps yesterday because the cap limit.
---
After that I finally invested in a mutation serum and plan on dumping caps into them premptivley when I hit 25k like another poster suggested.
---
I have never been banned. Neither have I duped. I just don't want to cross any lines that haven't been defined and lose all the money and time I've put into this game.
---
Yup.  Most common when I'm in excavator.
---
I think the biggest problem is the reduction in atoms. We may gain more items with the legendary run, but we have no choice any more.
---
1.  You mean a very poor white kid whose parents didn't have much money but still tried to provide the best life they could for me?  A kid who had to work since he was 16 years old to get to where he is today. Someone who spent every dime they had risking starting a new business knowing that most businesses fail within the 1st 2 years.  You mean that kind of background?
---
2.  That was one example almost every time I order fast food those kids mess it up somehow.  If not every time I'm probably going to guess about 90% of the time it's messed up.
---
3.  You must not understand humans. The majority of them take the easiest route possible which wouldn't be going to school for who knows how many years to become a doctor.
---
 I'm not saying there aren't good people that want to heal people but they are too far and too few between to make up a medical force.  When did I say I missed anything on fallout 76? I didn't even realize that was part of the discussion.
---
If you take away the ability to vats grenades then there should be a way to cook them or a perk that shortens the detonation time. There is way too much time to get away from mines and thrown grenades.
---
Love the mire. Lighting. Background music. Ambient noises of insects and frogs.
---
Shame there's fuck all foot traffic though, otherwise I would build there.
---
Good to know. 800 hours in and I‚Äôve seen one. I thought I wasn‚Äôt looking hard enough
---
Unfortunately it is a guaranteed spawn completely tied to the area. If a deathclaw is me too to spawn more than not it is untameable. I‚Äôve already tried
---
Yea, in other games where you can drop items from you STASH box equivalent it's common to see people lose things that are importiant to them. Seen it, experienced it.
---
Does your silo Charlie still show un explored on the map? Mine does despite launching a nuke from it?
---
Back when I first started playing and was trying to construct my first set of Excavator Power Armor, literally every time I saw a clip board in the real world I thought "I really need those springs" now as a Level 300+ player I find myself hoarding those damn things in game. Springs, Screws and gears ugh
---
Your caps disappear 2hat??
---
Well if you dont live in the US you cant do jack squat.    Make a complaint to your government. 
---
Your parents should have picked a country with more rights.
---
Thank you, I did not know it was a double XP weekend
---
I lost 5k because the cap limit and realized I need to start spending caps. I bought a serum to take me down from 30k.
---
Going to follow your suit and premptivley buy them at 25k as well.
---
First world problems
---
I try to gift a full set of modded armor (deep pocket) and a modded pipe rifle/pump shotgun to a lowbie every time I hit a public server.  I'll include ammo, stimpacks, and purified water, and since reading this sub, I'll be adding CAMP plans
---
Once I'm out of nuke cards is when I stop doing em. Until then enjoy!
---
I would like to see it where you srap for chance to get back modules
---
Also. How come when I raise my int I can add more perk cards up to the amount of intel points I currently have. I know it would be. Lot in some cases. But they could just make the ui different, for perks. And have it so if you int drops below the Mlunt of perk cards active they frey out until you int goes higher and can be used, catch my drift?? And make the same thing for other special attributes
---
Awesomely hilarious on point.
---
I have max fireproof and kill myself with my shotgun all the time.  As far as I can tell fireproof does nothing.  I'll shoot a level 5 scorched point blank, it won't die and I'll be killed in full SS.
---
if you're team leader you don't have one on your screen, but to others you do.
---
O i know it completly worthless as currently used.  You can just go make a middle of the road comment on another sub and have enough extra to last a week of saying horrible things.  The point i make is that doesnt encourage the spread of ideas.  It isnt just reddit where a simple click up or down is us signaling the other point was never needed from the start.  Now if you say dumb incoherent things that are off topic then all means.  I just think a sub about a game we all enjoy and play differently you should be able to escape the downvoting.
---
I find using Chinese stealth armor along with pick locking 3 and hacking 3 is extremely helpful because many of or all of the rooms you have to do something in has turrets, Turning off targeting restrictions makes the turrets focus on all robots and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen a turret get killed
---
What would the 33 ranks in Atoms (so I can convert to dollars) cost you?
---
Aye least a few eyebolt guards patrolling would be fun.
---
Lights are not %10, according to both my experience and the link you shared. Certain lights (specifically, the big construction lights) are %1, the rest are %0.5. And personally I keep a turret or two mostly to indicate I am being attacked by one of the quiet attackers like the mole rats. If I hear them go off, I know to investigate.
---
Just one of the things I wish people realized. The game is in a much  better state now but sooo many won't bother with it cause they still think it's a mess.
---
Well, I already had serendipity as part of my high survival shotgun build and I already had 5 intelligence for gunsmith originally.. so now I have 3 nerd rage and 2 batteries weight reduction at the moment which is perfect for my bloodied tesla rifle!
---
I added agility for 2 in sneak and 1 in escape artist.  I may move 5-6 more from strength for adrenaline and maybe 1 more in sneak?  Not sure.
---
I do the same except I wear my clown outfit.
---
Good point about it not encouraging the spreading of ideas. Sadly that‚Äôs exactly what the internet started off for. But it‚Äôs quickly become a haven for people who only want to share with people that think the same as they already do.
---
YESS!
---
I would love a bank of sorts to keeps all the caps, without limits
---
Maybe even add something fun like stocks to invest caps in
---
Force vsync off and set max framerate at 60fps. Make sure your power profile is maximum performance.
---
It seems we fundamentally disagree on the function and nature of humanity.
---
I have heard many who have been banned.  What proof do you bring?
---
I haven't had this problem yet but I have seen quite a few people post about it.
---
It's definitely a glitch of some sort, so we'll have to wait for Bethesda to sort it out.
---
There's a good chance it's just a visual glitch. Keep track of the amount yourself then try to buy what you want when you should have enough atoms.
---
If it works it's definitely just a visual issue, if not then it's up to Bethesda
---
Where do you cap frame rate in the prefs ini?
---
"...just to call their teammate was an idiot&gt;"  
---
They may have been onto something.
---
So do I, I live just south of Albuquerque. I often think that some of the Fallout TV shows and movies they talk about you be filmed out here cuz you can get everything.
---
Most of the Book of Eli was filmed here in New Mexico.
---
I‚Äôve tried forcing vsync off in the ini it becomes more stable but less smooth overall.
---
True that.  Have a great rest of your day my friend!
---
Yeah, several dupers who had fo1st got banned.
---
I don't really follow your logic, items stashed in world containers on private servers are whiped after about 10 to 30 minutes of logging off
---
I saw someone selling purified water for 38 caps. I turned on my mic. And laughed in his face.
---
Slowly getting progress. Now if they can actually come up with some unique stuff for PA, I'd be happy.
---
Poison Resist will go a long way though.
---
Sounds like a great time!   Hope you keep running silos.  The first 4-5 times can be confusing.  But eventually it becomes a second home.  
---
I started out exactly where you are.  I found a pride in watching the missle leave the silo...then watching everyone come to the fight and pitch in.  Feels great!
---
Last night I launched three nukes on the Queen, and one of them spawned a Collassus.  It‚Äôs one of the things that just hasn‚Äôt gotten old in this game.    Sharing it with friends, or just like minded people, makes it even better.
---
Where can I buy these? I've lost thousands already to this stupidly low cap limit. I just don't get it's need.
---
33 ranks x 150 atoms each = 4950 atoms. Atleast in europe 10e gets you 1000 atoms. I believe it's the same with dollars.
---
This is my point. You‚Äôre not going to get anywhere near that XP if 5 other people are there
---
These need to be official load screens
---
&gt;Your parents should have picked a country with more rights.
---
All I had to do was look at your post history to see the cringe and realize I'm not going to bother with you any more.
---
The cooking of grenades would be a nice addition, great idea dude, take an updood :)
---
To the right of top of the world, there are 2 lakes. One of the lakes is a guaranteed spawn for 3 brahmin. The other lake has an acid vein that you can put an extractor on. It‚Äôs 20s by foot/1cap away from a station.  Fantastic view. It‚Äôs where I camp lol
---
Oh so it's a flat rate despite each level needing more XP. It's a lot less than I expected. Thank you!
---
Personally, this is why I only team up with friends on Discord.  I never use game chat or team up with randoms.  Don't sweat it too much, they're just butthurt they died and lost all their junk, all because they got in over their head and expected you to bail them out of a situation you were unaware of.
---
Glasses caverns just has a lot of Scorched with a legendary SB at the end
---
Post of the week, take a bow dude..take a bow.
---
Fo1st private world isn't permanent. they give you a 15 or so minutes window to log back into the same world, in case you crash or something.
---
in my experience it's more like 5 minutes or less. but still.
---
Sorry a bit new to the game, but what are "recall cards"?
---
By yourself right?
---
Well if you don't believe all humans should be wiped off the face of the Earth then yeah we disagree. We are a plague growing faster than any disease in human history. We are Earth's cancer, the only cure for cancer is to get rid of it completely.
---
 As much as your utopian fantasy sounds wonderful it will never happen.
---
Lmao
---
When you look at buildings and think: "that looks like fallout"...
---
When you wish you could sell your used crap around the house for scrap...
---
You think: "I wonder how bad it would really be to eat dog food"...
---
Wondering if you would go full Hancock for biological immortality...
---
Wanting to try a cola drink with high levels of radiation..
---
I like this game, I could go for hours really...
---
What are you talking about?  Sure we get a world that really was someone else‚Äôs world as that is why areas sometimes don‚Äôt have your own level.  And when you log out for more than 5 minutes anything you stuck in any container, not in your camp, is gone.  You can‚Äôt even log back into the same world.  Nothing is ever there that I drop or leave unless I can right back in any any workshops are wiped out in most cases, even on a crash where I get right back in. Also I have never found anything in a container that was player dropped when I log in.  No blue suitcase of legendaries at the train stop.  Maybe I am missing your point as in the end if we wanted to keep it, it would be on us or in storage just like everybody else.
---
That private server/world isn't infinitely persistent and static.
---
It resets, sometimes after 24hrs sometimes, and if the game crashes (which is a common occurrence) it can be a half hour or right when you're switching to a second character.
---
That is my experience as a 1st member.
---
 I transfer extra legendaries and scrap to my mule account via suitcase at Charleston train station but it's not safe leaving items in world.
---
Yes, that's why you see lot of people telling us to buy the ranks on the last day, since you get "more bang for the buck" then.
---
These are all my interpretations. If you want an official answer, ask Bethesda directly. 
---
&gt;Is server-hopping to farm items and events considered an exploit?
---
**No.** It is a normal game function to change to a different server. 
---
&gt;Is sprinting into an area before everything loads to gain an advantage or to access otherwise inaccessible areas considered an exploit?
---
***Probably not.*** The game needs time to load assets.  You‚Äôre not controlling the loading of those assets.  Depending on *what* you‚Äôre trying to access and *why* could make it an exploit. If running fast enough into the Vault 76 door before it loaded got you into the developer‚Äôs room ad you‚Äôre doing so to access non-authorized game assets, then yes, that‚Äôs an exploit. 
---
&gt;Is trading in 5.56 rather than caps so you can go over the 30k limit considered an exploit?
---
**No.** You‚Äôre allowed to trade whatever you‚Äôd like, for whatever reason you‚Äôd like,  if it‚Äôs a tradable item. 
---
&gt;Is trading to a "mule" so you can work around the inventory limits considered an exploit?
---
**No.** You‚Äôre allowed to trade whatever you‚Äôd like, for whatever reason you‚Äôd like, *to whomever you‚Äôd like*, if it‚Äôs a tradable item. 
---
&gt;Is camping at the spawn points of enemies considered an exploit?
---
**No.** You‚Äôre using personally or externally acquired knowledge and then interacting with the game. At *worst* it‚Äôs meta gaming. But so is being more efficient during a quest with your second character, because you know the steps and don‚Äôt have to figure it out a second time. 
---
&gt;If a low level rando goes to a high level event and simply tags enemies to get the xp and loot without meaningfully contributing to the event, is that an exploit?  
---
**No.** The game system awards XP to anyone that contributed damage to the enemy. 
---
&gt;Is hanging around after Scorched Earth waiting for players to drop their unwanted items (plans, legendaries, ammo, etc) that were not "earned" considered an exploit? 
---
**No.** You can trade or drop or pick up any discarded items. 
---
&gt;What about if it's a stack of 500 plans and you pilfer through it finding all the ones you don't know?
---
**No.** You can trade or drop or pick up any discarded items.
---
&gt;Is looking up the launch codes online rather than doing the quests and cracking the codes yourself considered an exploit?
---
**No.** You can use knowledge of the game regardless of how you acquired it. In the early days, we used to share info directly with peers and teammates. Using [NukaCrypt](https://nukacrypt.com) is no different. 
---
&gt;Is taking a shortcut through the silo considered an exploit? Will it get you banned?
---
**Technically yes, but unlikely to get you banned.**. The game does not have this shortcut as an intentional function, so you are exploiting it. It‚Äôs not like bypassing the reactor room using lock picking; that‚Äôs an intended shortcut. However, this is somewhat similar to making an underground base, in that you‚Äôre clipping through an intended barrier. I‚Äôve yet to hear of anyone getting so much as a warning for doing either. 
---
&gt;Will clipping through a locked door because it's faster than switching out your perk cards get you banned?
---
**See last answer.**. Technically an exploit but unlikely to get a ban. 
---
&gt;Will asking questions about specific exploits be considered "promoting" that exploit and get you banned? 
---
**Unlikely**. Sharing of information is not inherently negative. I believe what they are talking about is actively encouraging the use of an exploit. Having said that, the method by which you communicate may matter. Bethesda has the right to determine what is appropriate to discuss on their forums. Reddit has the right to do so as well, with similar (but with less authority) right granted to subreddit admins or mods.
---
Oh ok. Sorry didn‚Äôt know never tried to tame any animals in game. Probably should give it a try tho to see how it is. Again sorry
---
Awesome way of making a blanket statement with no facts to support it.
---
I know of a few people that have FO1st and after advising them not to, they dupped weapons and guess what???
---
They got banned, not temporarily, permanently banned.
---
So most of your statement seems to be misinformed and misleading.
---
What a chad
---
I goot a a instigating power 90% Sledgehammer a long time ago but it is a great back up
---
So colored poker chips would have been a better sort of currency basically. Hehehe ;)
---
Yeah, I figured. I appreciate your reply! I'm making it work with what I have available as of right now :)
---
I‚Äôve also heard it was 5 minutes.  Do we have any Reddit post or Bethesda comment that tells the exact time?  Just curious.
---
What‚Äôs the going rate of sale on the keycards?
---
My ass.
---
Got a two shot -90% weight exactly for that job
---
Didn't he threaten to funk your mom too? Disappointed.
---
I have FO1st, obviously I wouldn‚Äôt say what happens if I didn‚Äôt have it. I know what the time is where they get wiped off, and you could easily play or stay playing or even log out for few minutes. 
---
That‚Äôs how I move stuff around with my characters.
---
Jesus
---
Right. Like, I said many who did not know how to do it or have done it on their actual account.
---
i'll look into those perks and see if i have them
---
still haven't done the thing where you can keep mutations but i recall reading about it a long while back
---
And for the most part we haven't run into many bugs really, the biggest thing I'd like to have looked at is the frame rate dips. Going into city areas tanks the frame rate into the teens sometimes. But as far as anything being broken in our playthrough it's been pretty normal.
---
bookmarked
---
Mine is that way as well.  Been that way since forever.
---
Have you tried calling the state department?
---
you can by them from the vendor bots i think they are called assualtron recall cards.  They are 2K and they start the encrypted event the impostor sheep squach(spelling) is an assualtron
---
Or just photo mode through the doors. Takes five minutes
---
I found this one easy. It‚Äôs a murlock baby. I went and killed all the undiseased ones. Left one that was diseased. Made sure I was hungry a little. Had no special perks that would prevent me from catching anything.  Don‚Äôt take any anabiotic‚Äòs. Check your stats to make sure you don‚Äôt have anything preventing you from catching it. Then stand there and let the baby keep biting you. Oh make sure you have stimpack deluded on your person. You will have to use them. But let your heath drop to at least half way when it‚Äôs biting you. Good luck. Also there‚Äôs a cool down between diseases. So if you just cured one with a diseases cure. Leave the server and come back. Also if you‚Äôre mutated it may harm or kill the baby. So make sure you Don‚Äôt  have any.
---
Because Dense adds radiation resistance. Padded adds explosive resistance.
---
you find me a real economy that has a wealth cap like in this game. ill wait.
---
it doesnt exist, because its nonsense. why would  a highly specialized, highly trained professional who does incredibly important work, make the same money as someone who walked in and started flipping burgers, its pure nonsense circlejerk that doesnt exist in the real world.
---
Those of us who do run the silos get the XP from the silos. Those are max-levelled robots :)
---
Nixie Lamp and Scarecrow plans for 2k a pop. Sold about 100 of each.
---
You can definitely log back in the same world. I literally have FO1st and I do it all the time, I leave stuff around for my other characters to come and grab em.
---
Send who a message? Bethesda? The people you left while they were shopping or?
---
Thanks!
---
yeah i've been playing it safe rather than experimenting because of what i learned about the respec system but then i ended up with a weak character anyway
---
I have noticed the PvP /Nuclear Winter players are a bit more toxic than adventure.. soo much so I turn off all voice chat and take my mic off if I'm going into NW.
---
I don‚Äôt think that a wealth cap is the way to go.
---
Found one yet?
---
 No, lead liner adds radiation resistance. Dense is the advanced version of padded
---
Good for lower levels
---
She has a flat 75% dmg reduction.  
---
You are suppose to use consumables to break thru that.  Bobblehead magazines foods chems.  
---
The fact that everyone is lazy and doesnt and would rather waste 5000 ammo isnt Bethesdas fault.
---
Then ask your self the following
---
Am I playing the game as it was designed and intended.  Leaving a sever and joining a new one is how it was designed and intended, they even made changes last year to nerf some of the server hoping, if they felt server hoping was too powerful they‚Äôll nerf it again, but changing servers is as intended.
---
Trading with other players, that‚Äôs as designed.  Picking up things people drop, that‚Äôs design (though if people are dropping things that they duped then you can get caught up in that)
---
Using PA to bypass things, that‚Äôs not as designed.  There are perks and challenges there to unlock doors or make the silo runs harder. So yes, those are exploits.  Now if Bethesda thinks it‚Äôs worth keeping logs of a person getting from point A to point B without opening door C is another story.  But yeah, you could potentially be banned for it.  
---
Just play the game as it‚Äôs intended and steer away from stuff that looks obviously fishy
---
Yeah just from farming that I got to around level 25 before I started focusing on the story
---
My entire life has been a lie. Brb going to kms.
---
Well played!!  I love how these PvP players make sure they can never be retaliated against. They will tank you if you take a workshop. First they put you on block so you can see them near you on the map. They sneak in and attack you from behind. 
---
Then they log off or go into pacifist mode. 
---
They claim they just want PvP. But they won‚Äôt play NW because they can‚Äôt have all their gear and armor.
---
I‚Äôm a new player, and honestly, the bugs have been the reason why I‚Äôm not recommending this game to everyone. FO76 has been up for. What, two years? And yet, the amount of bugs is astounding. I really hope the focus on bug fixing now that the game is more popular
---
actually, the "correct" way to do Radiation Rumble for maximum gain, is to not deposit ores initially. You just collect them and farm ghouls until the last 30 seconds or so, then deposit them all at once.
---
this prevents the spongy and high dmg enemies from spawning.
---
honestly, the rewards are not worth it for maxing out the ores and prematurely ending the event. Farming ghouls to the end of the time limit is where it's at.
---
it also increases the chances for legendaries to spawn
---
I'm just a sweet transsaultron, aahh cybersexual Appalachian.
---
When you go to a hardware store. Hmm adhesive. springs. Screws. Acid etc etc.
---
I passed the ship yesterday and with Line in the Sand (more like Fish in a Barrel) and a crap ton of xp boosts, I feel I can make it. Provided I don't get banned for farming that event. I was getting 10k a wave in xp last night. I'm genuinely concerned I'm getting to much.
---
This are some tactics beyond human understanding.
---
I tried calling the President directly but he angrily hung up on me saying "I don't want to talk to you right now Justin". My name isn't Justin.
---
Yeah,I couldn‚Äôt get all the numbers right if I was losing buffs constantly. But yeah you‚Äôre not only killing sentry bots lmao. You want the ghouls at white springs too, but the sentry bot is more important 1 bot = 6 ghoul.
---
Also, if you get the Marine Tactical Helmet plan (from the world or a player vendor): easy caps. 
---
https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gg4v48/just_an_fyi_about_marine_tactical_helmets/
---
No....stop....come back
---
I get that. Even my Gauss Shotguns start to add up. I‚Äôve just been scripping the untradables and dropping the others to my wife or my alts to get scrip for them. 
---
If I get above 500 scrip I just buy 10 modules. 
---
If there was a way that you could trade/sell the bullion items, even just to another player that unlocked the plans involved, that could be helpful. Maybe even force all the modifications to go back to default so there‚Äôs no workaround for getting the mods unlocked personally.
---
YOOO elaborate on this for me lol.
---
The first time a player killed me was when he was roleplaying as a cannibal and it was both awesome and scary. I love it when I meet players that do this kinda stuff.
---
Does inspirational perk work for Solo even if i alone in public building Team ?
---
Lots of bot vendors have these. I've seen these on almost all vendors. Including Grahm, etc.
---
In all honesty you are better scraping that all with scrapper perk. 
---
Steel doesnt have a cap in 1st.
---
Probably. But you‚Äôll need to try this question in another sub. This one doesn‚Äôt allow bartering posts.
---
Cant even imagineü§£ü§£
---
Look it up on YouTube - you can clip through the two storage area doors to get to the control room right away
---
Always wondered what those were for.  And I did encryptid once wondered why it was called imposter sheepsquatch and then shot me with an assualtatrons laser lmao
---
You need the bloodied grognak axe
---
Ah OK thanks
---
Thanks for the reply. Is that why some of the text is green, and some of the text is white, for the resources. I assume the green text is for resources that the workshop is providing, right?
---
You're the man, thanks lol
---
Sorry about that that seemed to go off the wrong way. I was just saying the mechanic behind how the taming system works. I came off aggressive in my last comment. Sorry about that
---
lmao exactly its absolute smooth brained, they clearly dont work or pay bills, or understand the concept that noone is going to sink 8-12 years of their life just to get the same compensation as a the guy fucking up their order at mcdonalds.
---
but no... everyone should be an altruist and work for next to nothing lmao.
---
Wait, it shows where we should be at this point? I didn't even notice!! Gonna have to check.
---
Just tell them you are from a Charity and Justin will sign you up.    Talk about a corrupt leader than kind of BS would never happen in the US.  Trump is a model citizen in comparison.
---
You don't. I use Nvidia control panel for that. Not sure what the AMD equivalent is, but it should have a similar option. There are third-party apps like RivaTuner that have max framerate options.
---
The servers are thinned out a lot with so many new players.  So your exposure to the ‚Äòevil dupers‚Äô is going to be reduced.  Also, players are looking for XP...you need mobs for that.  Killing the Queen quickly is counter productive.  
---
My team has observed this.  Putting survival tents out around the perimeter of the battle zone seems to give the Queen room to land.  The straffing runs are still RNG, but she does seem to land more.  I launch 1-3 nukes on her per night.  So, while my observations aren‚Äôt scientific, they are based on experience.
---
It's actually easier alone, spawns less robots
---
A few months ago, I found a single fox near the gold vault. That time I did not have the perk card. But I dont find anymore sadly :(
---
I wouldn't reccomend wood, but if that's all you can get right now absolutely go for it, but at such low resistances I'd say get 1 or 2 bolstering pieces to get better resistance, I started my bloodied build at around level 58 or so once i just had a few UNY leather pieces lying around and actually got a full set, I do suggest trying to get combat armor or try to grind SS armor, since it has insane resistances to everything including radiation, I currently have 2 UNY pieces and it has almost double the resistances of my old combat set
---
 how many dupes have you made?
---
Very true, but it‚Äôs just a suggestion since Ik a lot of new players are coming in
---
First world problem...
---
Perhaps enabling Pacifist would make your gamelife easier.
---
Chill its called in AMD, but it supersedes anti lag which i find actually works very well.
---
The game was trying to tell you something. They weren't worth it :)
---
Either we get more meaningful cap sinks such as Smiley‚Äôs gold bullion buy to make it difficult to hit the cap *or* we remove the cap completely and allow the market to Do Its Thing.
---
normal armour or legendary?
---
Just normal
---
I always save my morbid crazy stuff for last.
---
Tell you what.  We will give you your 12 bucks back but we want that Chinese Huawei spy you are protecting.  
---
Pretty certain I could get the US state dept to agree to this.
---
I‚Äôve been REALLY struggling lately with enemy health rubber banding lately. It wastes way more ammo and it‚Äôs frustrating as hell! I hope this is on the list for the next patch.
---
First few times I saw it, it just vanished whenever I got too close or hit it once. Last few times though it attacks me and comes up close. Allows for some good photo shots!
---
The most I encounter is a invincible enemy that just stands there.
---
oh yes, i remember ... scrounging for every piece of scrap you could get... and the second character just walking around and breathing it in, hauling tons of stuff home...
---
level?
---
This information is really helpful, thanks guys. 
---
Any other ini tweaks? like maybe reflection MSAA to get rid of the wastelanders uber shinyness?
---
It‚Äôs literally just some notes you can find in a bunker that just seem to be place holders for storage some survivors left behind
---
That used to be my go-to. I even wrote up a detailed description for that plus Mothman Egg Omelets. 
---
Now it‚Äôs all about the Treasure Hunter Hats. 
---
144 Cloth and 48 Oil = 1392 caps. 
---
That‚Äôs assuming I don‚Äôt have 280 spare Purified Water to sell, of course.
---
I love this. I hope your prayers get answered, as they are mine as well.
---
Preferably below 35
---
Absolutely nothing
---
While I understand the 'being forced' feeling, you are actually forcing yourself of course (not someone else or even Bethesda). So you also have the option to stop forcing yourself. And save yourself some money, should you find yourself into this situation again in the future.
---
same.
---
Thank you for your reply! I‚Äôm doing some other challenges to get atom now to see if it‚Äôs just a visual bug, Im trying to get 200 more atom cuz that will makes sure I have at least 1260 atom to get that power amor skin. I‚Äôll definitely reply you if that work!
---
It‚Äôs not a bug.
---
You don‚Äôt wear your backpack or armor in PA.
---
Why not run a nuke?
---
Santa Fe here - and I totally agree.
---
I have a bloodied super sledge.
---
Whitesprings is the only place I‚Äôve ever seen one
---
In unfortunately there are ways to kill people through pacifist. One way was a nuka mine but that was apparently patched. The other 2 I know of I‚Äôm not gonna list since the patch notes said nothing about them.
---
I'm a Melee build so my go to for tagging enemies is my exploding automatic 10mm.
---
Its low weight, ammo is plentiful, and I have no perks for it so its plenty weak enough to spray a crowd of enemies or a legendary and not worry about killing anything.
---
GT: rammadeus 
---
Camp is near top of the world. I'll be ni a building team if you want a free fast travel. I can hook you up with some free.
---
id settle for that skin just having a functional front sight
---
 You‚Äôre absolutely correct the ones in green are the workshops resources
---
I wouldn't know because I don't sell chems. I do however find it very useful when I am crafting things that I need because I get twice as much.
---
Here is how to solve that. 
---
1) Use barbarian outside of PA with chemist pack. 
---
2) use Trav pharm perk inside of PA and swap out Barbarian. 
---
This synergizes well since neither works in both situations.

*Excuse me, the subreddit is for posts about Fallout 76 only. Perhaps you should visit r/hasbro instead, OP, lolololtrollolol!!*
---
In all seriousness, your post gave me a good chuckle, and was a very clever analogy!
---
Uhh I know you‚Äôre supposed to pop consumables that‚Äôs why I pop all different versions of psycho. Meats. And sometimes bobble heads and (maybe) will do 250 dmg. Nothing really helps because people e guns do like 500+ per shot
---
Yeah, he's also complained about his dropped marine armor
---
apparently patch 21 (i think) its getting fixes i just heard!
---
Where do you even get nuke cards? I‚Äôve always bought them from people‚Äôs vendors.

long before getting to know fallout i learned my job in a hardware store. especially the tools and plumbing section made think alot about how to make weapons out of tools and pipes and such... the shaft of simple pick is a tool of destruction already... add some screws to its head... bam! the "lead pipe" in the game, a lead pipe filled with concrete, is not sooo far from reality.
---
Jeez. I only call people idiots when they decide to focus all their energy on killing me right after downing me, getting domed by my teammate ‚Äòcause they weren‚Äôt paying attention.

Thanks everyone for replying and the suggestions. I was able to quickly finish the Challenge once you helped me realize that the mouse over existed and I could build everything in one instance. üëçüòé
---
If you get more melee damage, i want more explosive damage. My two shot 40mm auto launcher wants to slay scorchee queen too
---
I probably didn't explain myself well. I understand how that works but my issue is that if I don't have the backpack with the mod equipped my weight shoots to over 700 even though prior to that I only had 200 lbs worth of stuff on me.
---
So with the backpack/mod equipped I have 260/295. When I remove the backpack I have 725/260. See what I mean?
---
0.1 if I'm not mistaken or 0.5
---
The only one still working that I know of (other than the legitimate Wanted or Workshop methods) does so little damage that I would be surprised if Josh was able to kill two different players. 
---
Also, OP stated he ‚Äòsought revenge‚Äô which I assumed meant he made that selection upon death. I‚Äôm pretty sure that the exploit workarounds like the Nuka Mines didn‚Äôt give that as an option.
---
It takes practice to run the silo efficiently, you just have to stick with it.  Eventually you learn every door, every dead end.  Then, someone points out a short cut to you.  Next thing you know, you‚Äôre running three silos a night.
---
Yeah, you know what the backpack mod does, right?
---
Reduce the weight of your food and drink.
---
Take it off and everything weighs what it does normally.
---
Naturally i'm not being forced by anybody but myself. But i'm a completionist when it comes to video games. It's hard to leave something midway when you start it.
---
I miss that gun lol. Was my favorite from new vegas.

"Thanks for your patronage, now get the hell out."
---
I hope it works :) good luck
---
Are you in PA?
---
Not to sound harsh but two-handed Melee sucks against the queen. Super Sledges and the like are just too slow. Your DPS is always going to be crap.
---
Question from a newbie. Where can i get the gold bullions and where to spend them?
---
Damn was gonna give ya some armor or something if we were on the same console
---
I didn't catch the name, but if it was you, thanks for the laugh and creep out.  You do good work.
---
Basically no difference. It's already heavily discouraged due to low interest rates meaning you lose money to inflation if it sits in a savings account. You're basically forced to funnel it into the stock market, 401ks or assets if you want to save the value of your money.
---
Propaganda fliers weigh 0 I‚Äôve sold 3 for 30k
---
Thank you so much, this fixed my problem completely!
---
I use a 1 star bloodied mole miner gauntlet and hit her for more than that without chems or alcohol.
---
The only buff I use is glowing meat/Deathclaw meat and I stealth/power hit her for 4K. My regular power hits were 3k and my basic attacks were hitting for 1k.
---
Do you have the right perk cards equipped?
---
Only on pc. There are hacked 3* power armor pieces that can give same effects as regular legendary armor.
---
For real? Oh my God. The other players could hear that too, right? ü§£
---
Maybe save that stuff for a therapist.
---
Congratulations, you have struck solid mold.
---
You know my bad you are right. I forgot that I didn't have the perk equipped at the time because I only just learned it was redundant. Then when I went into the power armor I forgot that the perk goes away when the pack comes off. Thanks for snapping me out of my moment of stupidity xD
---
Happy to help mate.
---
when u start cooking food and try to go through the wall
---
 I have seen one at Thunder Mountain power station a few times as well.
---
I'm also a Melee build as well but carry a handmade or combat rile (depends on what I have ammo of) for sour of the moment scorched best events so I'm not SOL waiting for it to land 
---
For SBQ I'll pullout a minigun, lmg, or Gatlin gun. 
---
When shes flying I use my minigun, but as soon as she lands I switch to my death claw gauntlet and and am smaking her in the face.
---
For me it's the only way I can guarentee getting my 1000 worth of damage in on her.
---
I‚Äôll be launching one in abt 2 hours if anyone‚Äôs up! I always check if the servers are populated enough w lvl 100+ players so we can all enjoy the plunders
---
Try useing perks like inscior or and your damage perks foody
---
No problem. You asked a legit question.
---
Happy to help.
---
Why not both? Get some ASSaultron action and a badass Sentry Bot.
---
I got that once.  It said something along the lines of "new crafting item unlocked: " and nothing changed.  I already have all the mods for the gatling gun so I was surprised to say the least.
---
I know the last update they tweaked the perk to only eat humanoids
---
The ammo converter really needs an option to exchange more that 18 FUCKING ROUNDS AT A TIME LIKE DAMN MY A BUTTON IS DYING HERE STOP
---
shh man beth gonna fix this.
---
Yea naturally as it was on adventure mode :D
---
These are my favorite kinds of people. I had encountered a guy who spammed bagpipes with the name "ThePipesOfFreedom" in another game.
---
That said, I've thought about sitting down in my CAMP (Or near the Wayward) once I need a break from the grind, and just playing my steel drum through my mic. I dunno though.
---
It's for companionship more than anything. Don't you hear that voice and just think: "That's hot."
---
Yesterday I was doing my best bush-wookiee in my Ghillie suit in NW, and by a stroke of luck I ended up out-lasting everyone except the final other player.  Then I heard the mothman dance emote music.
---
I was already in 2nd place, and was bound to get some decent XP, so I crept around looking for him.  I could still hear the music.
---
As fate would have it, when I found him, he was also dressed in a Ghillie Suit, and unarmed, just standing there dancing.  I have no idea whether he deliberately unequipped all his gear, or if we were just two bush-wookiee soulmates who got lucky and all the actual PVPers got killed by being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
---
Anyway, I figured what the heck and charge up, fists flying.  He stopped doing the mothman dance and started punching back.  It turned into a fistfight duel to the death, and he won, then continued doing the mothman dance.  I guess the guy just wanted to dance in peace.  There truly are some weird and wonderful people in this game.
---
I salute you, ghillie-suit bush-wookiee pugillist dancer!  A victory well earned.
---
I upgraded to SSD on my Xboxes to alleviate some of the load time.
---
there's still space on top and he said he put in the S.C.O.R.E. sink which is a water source
---
I have a full melee build obviously I‚Äôm gonna use perks like incisor.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.

Also, cave crickets, yaogui, and smellygast drop acid.  Any horde event for them is an easy 50 or so acid.

This was my first interaction. Didn't see another until about ~600 hours and another at ~750
---
Swap weapons.
---
Make sure you‚Äôre fully bloodied make sure ur strength is 15 plus the unyielding effect on your armor then eat sheep squatch cooked meat or glowing meat steak and a death law steak pop a strength bobble head some overdrive and physco that should add a bit more damage
---
At you got a response, I‚Äôve heard nothing and I replied to the email immediately
---
You‚Äôll probably get the same thing.
---
Uhh duh? Yes I have all the right perk cards. I‚Äôm fucking level 115 rn. My weapon when at the right amount of rads for bloodied and nerd rage has a base damage of 1400. And hits for 3.5k+
---
Umm if you hitting for only 200 with psycho buff, overdrive, yao guai roast, melee bobblehead and whiskey then something is seriously wrong with your build.   
---
I use a bloodied fss pickaxe and am hitting her for 1k+,  2k on sneak attacks.
---
If you have in fact been wrongfully banned, I feel for you. Whatever the case may be, however, you cannot expect them to forego investigation and lift the suspension just because you said you are innocent. This is not how any of this works. Be patient and the truth will shine.
---
I think you‚Äôre right unfortunately. Oh well, this false flag has allowed me to discover ESO so I‚Äôm having a pretty great time without fo76 anyway
---
Great resource saved that image for future use.
---
My strength when unyielding, bloodied, nerd rage, solar powered and radicool procs in about 30
---
To much info
---
Nope , just ended up being the buggy game as we know it!
---
Contemporary, hands down
---
You need to complete the main story. I don't want to spoil anything. It involves either siding with raiders from crater or settlers at foundation. Just follow the questlines until you finish it. You will know when you can earn gold bullion because the quest reward is gold bullion for completing it. Do it quick as possible as you won't earn treasury notes to trade for bullion until you complete main quest line.
---
It may be set up to automatically renew at start of each month on when you bought it. If it‚Äôs monthly.  That‚Äôs how mine is. I didn‚Äôt do anything to set that up. Maybe it does it after you buy it couple months.
---
[Fisto liked that]
---
Hmmm I‚Äôm a shotgun build when I‚Äôm full bloodied my strength is 33 if you‚Äôre always in public teams get herd mentality it adds plus 3 to all stats
---
Only sometimes in large pvp battles. Or onced when I soloed the Queen.
---
I have 40% faster and 60% faster for all weapons. No way I‚Äôm swinging to slow.
---
I only ever use them for the ‚Äúuse X amount for 40 atoms‚Äù. I think it‚Äôs 20
---
What if the cap were very high? Or like FO1st, where you can pay extra for a bigger stash? this is silly but fun
---
You keep whatever exclusive goodies you got during the membership (emotes, outfits/skins, atoms) and you keep the scrapbox. You won't be able to add materials to the scrapbox once your membership expires but you can still use the stuff that's in it. The tent and private server go away when membership expires.
---
Leader for the +5% XP, Intelligence for the +2 intelligence - both when grinding XP  and big guns for increased damage from heavy weapons for queen/encrypted
---
Firsts weeks he was so gentile and helped me with the mainframes, one day he teached me the trick and I don't wanna say more xd
---
Well I didn't got the 150 atoms from the pass. 2 days later I got the atoms. Took some time but I'm happy I got them at all.
---
Agreed
---
I‚Äôll use charisma and intelligence when bargaining and scraping weapons and armor.
---
Oh yeah I know based of if I say I‚Äôm innocent but  it‚Äôs still heartbreaking having one of my chances being denied. It‚Äôs like Bethesda is bullying me. I got wrongfully suspended, 4 days later after trying to contact and get denied and now I have to wait again probably for my final outcome.
---
Pick axe man i swear it where its at.  
---
Says Slow but they swing way faster than super sledge.  And sharpened mod has AP on it. 
---
Spears are also a highly underrated 2h as they swing fast too.
---
I‚Äôm gonna be honest I‚Äôve been playing since beta so I know what I‚Äôm saying if you‚Äôre gonna run melee you should use a death claw gauntlet if you can find bloodied faster swing speed pair that with iron fist and incisor and you‚Äôll be doing 1k per shot in the sbq
---
Well on Xbox you can cancel subscriptions so at the end of the month it ends. And I'm going todo that too see if its worth it. So I was asking to see what happens so ik if I have tobe careful.
---
Have you finished wastelanders? If so start working towards Secret Service armour peice plans.
---
Pretty simple to grab all the weapons from the mole miners in uranium fever an waddle your overencumbered self to the train station to clear the poor vendor out of his caps.
---
I also sell all the food and chems I'm not using, like I don't need 200 purified water and 300 diluted radaway, might as well sell it to free up some space.
---
It spawns at least once every 3 days at my camp for me. Mostly when I'm AFK. I can hear his attacks from my TV so send my team mates over to save me haha.
---
Had the same issue with 5mm, I use a gatling so I don‚Äôt go through it quickly. Once I hit about 15,000 I switched it to 5.56 so I could start putting it in my vendor.
---
Those dont stack like that. There is dimishing returns.    
---
With FSS you should only use 1 rank.   
---
I am beginning to see the problem.
---
Just one of an endless amount of shit caps, limits or just general ideas utilised in this game
---
My uncle said they plan to allow us to have unlimited caps with f1st in the future
---
Full melee with a bloody weapon and your only hitting 250 cool fake post go to a different subreddit
---
No need for PA or a jet pack. My run is down to 9:35.
---
you need the right perks tbh
---
Here I just want one fixer plan just to have the gun lol. I‚Äôm level 120 and still don‚Äôt have a fixer and when I try the event is people just farming and leaving before it‚Äôs done.
---
Sure some of them.
---
And Crystal!  I have over 600 crystal I never use and was pleasantly surprised to see they're used for making some mutations..
---
But here‚Äôs the issue. I‚Äôm not going to level up 50+ times just to use a gauntlet for a specific enemy. I‚Äôm running a two handed build not a one handed build.
---
I was genuinely shocked at how fast it makes my 5.56... definitely a good purchase with my bullion
---
What perks tho
---
Bobby pins on the ground. I actually have to stop myself from picking them up IRL.
---
Ha!  So I forget howto start it but I know you need those cards
---
Ok dickhead. If you can‚Äôt help then go to a different sub.
---
That remind me good old days, selling Civil War top hats to vendors. 1cloth = 150 or 200 caps, cant remember üòÇ
---
I am pretty sure all the vendor bots sell them
---
Well I‚Äôm sorry but I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll get the dps your looking for then good luck in the wasteland
---
I fixed this by going back up the elevator, it marked it found for both me and my friend that way.
---
They are meant to break thru boss resistances.   Thats it.   Save em for boss fights and make sure to equip curator.
---
When I'm using my vendors  for sales  I dont  exceed max caps. If I have 15k caps , all my items in the vendor combined will be below or close to 15k worth. With a little planning you won't have to rush off a server . I havent had vendor issues since I started  this.
---
When I'm max caps I usually just vendor  hop myself looking for nuke cards, a little bit of aid or a lucky weapon or armor find.
---
Maybe in the next stage they will change the quest and at least have a cheeky joke that she now has millions of the tubes
---
Ha ha ha that‚Äôs funny!
---
Doesn't help you right now but if you're going for a shotgunner build bank 3 level ups for hitting level 30 and max out Enforcer. Doesn't matter how crappy your shotgun is after that as you'll cripple anything with leg shots in VATS. I was doing that and finishing higher level mobs off with a bloodied fire axe until I rolled a decent shotty
---
While thanks is appreciated, it only takes 10 minutes or less. So no big deal.
---
I'm set up to run silos and it's way easier for me to do it solo.
---
Wlel if you're going shotgun then you want STR and shotgun perks. but at lower level you don't have access to most of them. If you struggle to kill things then go elsewhere. Or make a better weapon. scrap weapons for mods. mods make weapons better.
---
No cap
---
I regularly run with a dude who does three every day.  I regularly drop him Nuke cards.
---
I just pop the broken ones off and repair them at the workbench.
---
Ok thank you very much. I was just worried what would happen.
---
How about stop likening to make yourself sound unique and shit. Youve been told what to do from numerous people here but your claiming you already doing it. I have a lv 52 without a finished build I hit her for almost 900 so either your not doing something wrong , lieing about what you use. Or tour just lieing in general. before you try to correct me there is a video on this very subbreddit where captinnood solos the queen with and all rise and does way more than 250 a shot.
---
I just started about a week ago (lvl 8), and when i found you could buy from players, i would check them and buy stuff. A few times right after i bought one thing it disappeared. The guy was just there.... but this makes perfect sense. I wouldnt want to lose out on caps either. But now i know this is probably why, i wouldnt even be mad. I feel ya tho on this.
---
It‚Äôs as ridiculous as letting it bug you that they did something you disagree with.
---
Well, you should at least use one of each kind for the challenge that rewards atoms. Although be careful, there were other posts today talking about bugged challenges not rewarding atoms.
---
Ok im gonna see if i can make anything good
---
Gift them to any dude who drops three in a row.  They‚Äôll appreciate it.
---
Still figuring mine out a little. Full strength so flip between shotguns and melee too. Might change some points in intelligence, thinking I may have a little too much weight reduction, but I've only just started using PA and find the weight management the biggest downside. I play junkies, on the hunt for an LMG at the mo. Good luck.

---
As long as they gave us the Atomatron workbench and allowed us to create a combat ally that could follow us around &amp; fight, I'd be A-Oh-FUCKING-KAY with this :)
---
You can go in the Enclave bunker and use a terminal to start Seek &amp; Destroy. This will locate a secure cargo bot (the ones with three escorts) and you shot it down.  You can do this as many times as you want if you server hop. 
---
You can also find them just randomly in the wild. They will always be the ones with 3 escorts.
---
Are you a base builder? My ‚Äúyou‚Äôve hit 25K go treat yourself is plans and often from the Whitesprings.‚Äù
---
Ok I'll do that if i go with a shotgun build
---
More than glad to join!
---
Would it have been it was my mouth harp?
---
Perhaps that is the case. I should be more zen.
---
That's awesome! It takes me more like 15 to 20 min. That's with bypassing the vent repair. Well done on such a fast run.
---
I think I know the one you‚Äôre talking about. Got it in a wallpaper bundle with the flowers and yellow print (hunting design?) a long time ago.
---
Careful with those suggestions. Bethesda might create an escrow system like SWTOR where you'll have to buy atoms to buy escrow tickets to get your caps back.
---
Why would I lie you asshat? I‚Äôll go fucking launch a nuke rn and I‚Äôll fight her. I‚Äôll send hard proof that I don‚Äôt do shit in damage. I don‚Äôt care if some other random guy does 250 plus IM NOT DOING THAT. That‚Äôs the fucking reason I made this post ü§¶üèª
---
Explosive weapons are boosted by Demolition Master in Intelligence.
---
Finally someone realizes how to place the tents.  In response to the op, there were many high level players banned that had Nothing to do with duping, also they patched God mode last week so now no one is stacking bobbleheads for ridiculous amounts of damage.
---
I've also noticed, through people asking for help, that many builds are pure trash and this is why people have a hard time with the queen.  No one is obligated to take their time with a large boss fight, if your build is right you don't have to hit them much to get the reward.
---
I still sell at a steady rate, when I have them, so someone's using them ;)
---
As far as I can tell the only downside is the inability to use the Lone Wanderer perk.
---
try using sneak and melee to open a fight.
---
I know you‚Äôre frustrated but I‚Äôm attempting to help trouble shoot your issue with not a whole lot of information on your part. Toning down the condescending attitude will go a long way.
---
I think I‚Äôll hop on and run one right now!
---
The send you a note with a handprint and the words "We Know".
---
The raider punk ally gives you random missions to take out the flatwoods monster and mothman. I got a couple last week.
---
I think without vats, grenade damage is reasonable. It should be devastating when being used compared to being shot.
---
Look up photo gl#tch, it's been there since day one. Bethesda has turned a blind eye to this one. I do recommend everyone do it once all the way through  to realize the grind. Then skip that sh#t from there on out.
---
Take a look at what is weighing you down the most that you aren't using and lob it at your nearest npc trader for an easy 1400 caps every day. 
---
As for player vending, I seem to sell a lot of ammo and ammo crafting mats. If your not using the ammo and have space in your stash, it might be a good idea to sell it, especially if it is a popular round. For example handmade rifles, fixers, flamers, mini guns, and gauss weapons seem to be pretty popular as my 5.56,.45,5mm,fuel, and 2mm EM cartridges sell pretty fast compared to 3.08 or 10mm.
---
Empath is still only good if you have actual teamwork.  Herd Mentality on the other hand could be very useful now.
---
I use the Big Guns and Energy Weapons ones pretty frequently to supplement my Plasma Gatling obsession
---
I used the neon blue letters to name my collectron and spell out Fisto on his pod.
---
Always a pleasure bringing some fiesta to the server /explosivediarrhea (nuke a lot)
---
Furious. Two shot mostly sucks.
---
Then your character is bugged then thats the only reason. Also people come on here and make up shit all the time
---
Everyday we stray further from Atom's light.
---
1 yes bloodied if you want to maximize everything really. People may not like it and mock how it's become so popular, but it so for a reason. Also if you go bloodied and use unyielding, you wil lbe maximizing stats and XP earning for the legendary run also (if that matters to you). There's no real downsides and it beats out everything else by a fair distance, sadly. 
---
2 They're viable but I haven't really every worried about it. Legacy laser weapons are another matter but we won't worry about it :D
---
3 for bloodied those are the better ones yes. If you go class freak full perk then it matters less as a lot cancel out the negatives. For instance I currently run scaly skin, heath regen, speed demon, marsupial, adrenal reaction, herd mentality (a must for any build as if you just form a public group on your own you get the benefits and no downsides), bird bones, carnivore and egghead off the top of my head, and can still hit 40 or close to it in any SPECIAL that matters with relative ease.
---
Two shot was nerfed into the dirt plus it damages weapon 2x faster.    
---
Explosive is by and large just a novelty explosives dont damage bosses so no Explosive weapon is an end game weapon.  Just good for killing trash which you can do with no legendary. 
---
*queue the explosive fanbois flying into a rage.
---
We had a very good server today, in the space of a few hours we got to take down the SBQ twice
---
Also based on your other responses you defiantly dont know what your talking about
---
No I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs been fixed yet
---
Furious is better on all most ever thing half the time with two shot the second shot misses
---
Yup and just did it again with the same result
---
Well, he had a 30 day head start I think as he probably moves once a day and the season lasts 70 days.
---
Nope.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve got all those. That was my first stop even before serum recipes.
---
Oh Also two shot is NOT double damage.   Its roughly 25% more BUT the bullets have a spread and both do not always hit.  
---
Shoot at the ground it makes 2 holes.  They dont land like robin hood arrows.
---
I've been lucky to avoid most of the bugs n issues I think and the ones I've experienced haven't put me off.
---
Ive played on PS4 (friends said they play, they got bored) then over to XBOX as its usually my main machine. Loving it and have just done my second redesign on my camp by Charlston. Enjoying the SCORE addistion and starting to look at pursuing the Possim challenges while staying away from the main quest. Lol.
---
Have gotta start getting my ass into the Scorched Earth events soon and get up to trying a nuke launch. Lol.
---
I think its a good game. Not great but its Fallout so I'm happy. Lol.
---
Well check your dms. I‚Äôm completely open for help but I‚Äôm being asked pretty vague questions like ‚Äúdid you eat meat?‚Äù Like of course I did. I sent a pic of my current perks
---
It sucks that I'm too low level to do scorched earth without dying endlessly
---
Explosive is bad specifically on scorch beasts since they are resistant to explosive damage. Tbf, sbq is the only relevant end game boss these days. In general, explosive on weaps is not as good as ffr, with the exception of legacy explosives.
---
HoW dArE yOu!
---
Actually did not know that so I appreciate the tip.
---
And dang did not know that damage part, sucks cause a lot of my good legendaries are two shot like my gauss rifle and grenade launcher and rocket launcher.
---
There's a magazine that when you use it, you get more scrap from weapons. Guns and bullets #5 i believe, correct me if I'm wrong on the #.
---
I want a Colonel Gutsy in my camp, just for the dialogue.
---
Somebody utilizing an exploit generally is not doing so because they're a victim or a martyr, it's because they're a cheater. It undermines those who play through the game or product in a legitimate way. 
---
Equity, business 101.... that's like saying McDonalds gave me the wrong meal three times so they offered me free upgraded meals anytime I came to their restaurant. Instead I jumped behind the counter and made the food myself, prompting them to ban me from the establishment.
---
Fast Firerate/Automatic Weapons - You would probably want to go Furious Explosive
---
Slow Firerate/Semi-Auto Weapons - You may want to go with Two Shot Explosive but note that the accuracy is greatly reduced. Also Two Short makes your durability a lot weaker
---
Hope this helps :)
---
100000% this. I‚Äôve been saying for ever that we need either a cap limit increase or a escrow system where our overflow caps go when we reach max.
---
Glitch still works but seems a bit more finicky than before last patch.
---
Jesus your starved for attention. Either help me or don‚Äôt. End of conversation
---
Spoilers: in the initial quest the guy is a taxidermist. He is trying to find a real sheepsquatch. He manages to get his hands on an assaultron. He programs the assaultron to act like it wants to mate. The goal being that the assaultron will attract a real sheepsquatch as a mate. He can then capture the real sheepsquatch. However things go sideways as the assaultron tries to mate with him killing him in the process and escapes out into the wild. The recall card tells the assaultron to return home, so you can stop it.
---
+10dmg on aim is great on right build too.  Non vats commandos.
---
Nope. I‚Äôm seeing more and more posts about it after the patch. Also the patch seems to have broken the atom challenges so those aren‚Äôt being awarded for now.
---
Yeah, it's a waste of precious stash space at this point! But I would guess it's WAYYYYY down on their bug priority list.
---
If they're selling serums for more than 300 or magazines for more than 30 I don't buy anything from them. Especially if they think a perfectly preserved pie is worth more than 1 cap when there's always a free one on top of West Tek just sitting on a plate.
---
I have the same problem. But is was worst when I used to play GTA 5 and after wards I went driving.üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
It resets in 17 minutes, I usually log in about 20 minutes after that
---
The real map. Thank you. What are the 2,000 cap recall circuit boards for??
---
Good question. Strange nothing can be done with it. Other than wearing it like it is on current power armor. Of all the rare masks from the event I got none but two of the Winter Helmet.
---
Request - if you didn‚Äôt launch the nuke, please don‚Äôt kill the Queen in the first 30 seconds.  I do launch the nukes, and I like a good fight.  Others like the XP and legendary mobs.  If you want to help the fight along, great.  But please, don‚Äôt feel any moral obligation to ‚Äúwreck‚Äù the Queen.  Some of us see it as a dick move.  Thanks üòä
---
Wait until about 30 min from now
---
Definitely. I prefer Faster Firerate or Explosive, as it helps boost the DPS, but +10%dwa is still good.
---
Meh any FFR will beat any legacy.  
---
Thats why they were left in.  They dont unbalance anything.
---
I finally scrapped it for stash space
---
They usually go for 300-600 ish caps each in player vendors or if you have the flux I can make them for free.
---
I got the winter helmet and the crazy guy but I traded my crazy guy for the father winter mask
---
Furious caps at 9 stacks with a maximum bonus of 45%
---
Two Shot does 62.5% per projectile (a bonus of 25% damage per trigger pull essentially)
---
If you‚Äôre killing most enemies in one shot with a nonlegendary, then Furious is the better pick as you‚Äôll be getting your mileage out of it in SBQ fights.
---
If you‚Äôre not killing most things in one shot, Two Shot might be the additional damage you need to do so.
---
What ‚Äòmystery item‚Äô are you talking about?
---
I'd love an Assaultron sentry for my camp, it would go great with my deathclaw, Commander dagueres, and &gt;!A. T. H. E. N.A!&lt;when she shows up.
---
I thought I was the only one having this issue! I wanted to use it as a locked room for expensive trades!
---
I wish this was a thing, but we can't even lock weapons and armor so don't hold your breath.
---
Todd shows up at your home in the dead of the night with some goons and tells you ,"It would be sad if anything happens to that excess adhesive you got there."
---
Ok simple switch to a better dps weapon the hammer is good but your doing something wrong so you arnt getting all your damage. Have you tried taking advantage of the huge jump in power unarmed weapkns get
---
I wont even try to help you as you are toxic ü§Ø
---
I don‚Äôt know why but I don‚Äôt like spending caps and I‚Äôve been hovering around the max for a while now. I suck it up and buy bullion now though. The other day I had someone buy a few of my items and I just saw Max, Max, Max pop up on my screen. Felt like I had a session with Fisto.
---
There were reports that Beth maybe found out what‚Äôs causing the problem and probably will release a hot fix soon.
---
Source: Juicehead news video
---
The best part of this game is the social element. It‚Äôs what‚Äôs kept this game alive through all of Bethesda‚Äôs middlings and whatnot. Sure, you are entitled to your opinion, but I think your missing the point.
---
This, 100% this. Its really annoying to see your cap got 10k to max on your the middle of your screen while your in the middle of radium fever. Either I stay and complete and lose out on caps, or bounce and lose out on potential legendaries. Why is there even a cap limit? Is it to control pricing so players won't ask for 1000000 for a bloodied fixer? Why not make 30k caps the max amount you can ask for in the vendor or personal trades?
---
Wow the other day I was on i legit would log on do a couple things a nuke would launch run do the sbq, log off for like half hour hop on to a new server, and another like 5 times I did this. Was excited. When I first started I didn't know that the nude would launch that event. Does scorched earth only happen if you nuke fissure site prime?
---
I disagree. Was able to loan a be gat plas from a buddy who is now kaput (rip). Goddamn it SHREDS. I have a b2525 gat plas and I‚Äôll take the be gat plas any days tbh. Only situation where the be gat plas was worse was with the sbq. But everyone has their own niche ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
They can code in a tax on the sale but not a check to see if vendor caps is maxed... that‚Äôs straight up genius-ness at work boys and girls.
---
Rough, I see what my future looks like haha. One day I will have all of the plans and my new caps sink will have to be buying the overpriced stuff the noobs sell to give people my money.
---
Just to clarify, you mean one at a time, correct?  Like, use the Leader when you have it and the Intelligence one when you run out of those.
---
‚ÄúThis Vendor has closed for the day.‚Äù
---
EVERY time you hit max caps. &amp; it should go over up to 3k ‚Äòovercharge‚Äô so you can get all the caps if you have 26 and somebody buys something for 6 or 7k!
---
Well I still very much appreciate the offer. It's incredibly kind of you.
---
He thing about two shot with explosive is that your durability will drain 4x faster then normal.
---
Furious on a explosive weapon is actually useful because your hitting twice with one shot so getting to 50% dmg bonus will be faster.
---
It's supposed to be on Sunday.
---
That said, there is a bug that causes him not to reset. People say it's from going to the wayward in between resets, but it's not the only cause. I was steadily getting gold, going to him at the same time every week, and last week he stiffed me out of the blue.
---
Now do you understand why people having kittens over Bethesda saying they were "temporarily" disabling vending machines and display cases a while ago? üòÇ
---
Give him a Handmade, bows are pretty weak.
---
I don‚Äôt have any unarmed perks.
---
I never had an autocomplete and I log off 30 mins before the reset and 15 mins after and also do the NW challenges when the other challenges are fully completed
---
I always try to pay it forward, the community both reddit and facebook community are actively helpful and kind
---
Shared xp for all kills would be a godsend to AFKs. Just create a team, spin in a corner doing nothing for a few hours, and still rank up as the other team members do the work and take the risks.
---
There is only 1 iron fist
---
I‚Äôm 15 ranks away from the end to be able to play twice a week after tomorrow so if I didn‚Äôt buy them I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to finish but I got to level 45 without paying
---
I see them pretty often too.  Have killed several and am only 500 hrs or so in.  Same with Mothmen...see them quite often.
---
It should be every Saturday at 8pm Eastern Time
---
Todd Daddy~
---
I‚Äôve lost score hours after rest. It‚Äôs at 12 est. I log in at 3pm est and 4 times I‚Äôve lost all or most of my score for the day. The reset isn‚Äôt the root of this issue anymore.
---
Thats the point.  
---
Its not like you need the help killing trash stuff and super mutants.  Can it, sure .. Thats why its just a novelty.  Its nice but in no way classified as end game. 
---
The bffr is better hands down all day long.  It just uses more ammo. 
---
Maybe its the MMO player in me but only boss damage matters.
---
I appreciate the information, it seems like info is kind of hard to find and what you do find is old and doesn't really apply anymore. I feel like im doing it wrong and im pondering which way to run next.  i'm about to launch nukes but i'm having to run around in PA constantly just to survive carrying a lvl 30 laser gat and a plain jane lvl 50 super sledge. I've got about 4k caps but i dont wanna waste em and have no clue what i should buy or if my char is royally screwed. pretty sure my perks are all f'd up too lol. seriously considered rerolling my char.
---
Where's the bar?   :)
---
Yup! Vendor selling has a daily limit of 1400 caps. 
---
Cook meat, sell food. Sell any aid you don‚Äôt use. Sell grenades. Sell outfits. Sell er‚Äôthing!
---
Bethesda: we hear you loud and clear. Here is another revolver skin.
---
Sorry they need to give the lever action another 100 skins first.
---
But then they'll get right on it!
---
(i'd like a rusted tesla look btw)
---
at least give me a winterized paint job
---
Yeah that would be cool and some fixer skins would be great too. Or at least let us use the combat rifle skins for the fixers too.
---
I run three big gun builds and none use demo. I wouldn‚Äôt use it. I think it‚Äôs a waste of perk cards or points. I run bloodied, junkies and a medic healer big guns with flamers.
---
Legacy explosive.  
---
Its a novelty but no good on bosses.
---
An explosive flamer shoots like that
---
Yes. You can still finish it as long as you play daily. You can maybe still miss 10 more days and grind minimally for exp.
---
Damn, I haven't had it happen so I guess I assumed that was why, hopefully they get it sorted out
---
A rusted tesla would be cool too, honestly id be happy with anything thats not just yellow
---
Ok thanks a lot for the answer
---
Yes but take advantage of double XP weekend and try to do the NW challenges. Most of them are really easy
---
Sure but it depends how much you play after this. By the generalyl accepted table, you have to be at level 45 by the 20th. 
---
You're not far away, but also the 2x Xp is on right now until then, so you can catch up much faster than ordinarly, and also there is a double score weekend coming also.
---
Again, it depends how much you wanna commit now and for the coming weeks. Mathematically you can do it fine, but it's in your hands :D
---
The grenade launcher still benefits form 2x dmg from two shot as like the missile and mini nuke.
---
Fixers:  We stole your role and now we coming for your skins too. 
---
Combat Rifles:  /wrists
---
Hack two terminals, make one power armor glitch, defend for 10 mins, ez
---
Yep...in order to start Scorched Earth you have to launch a nuke at fissure site prime. That's tge only way to trigger Scorched Earth! And ascof right now, it's the only event that is triggered from launching a nuke at a specific area...that is, Until they add in "A Colossal Problem" and then it'll trigger an event with a Colossal Wendigo.
---
üëçüèºüòÇü§£üòÇ
---
Don't be in a server with a hacker.  
---
Got down to final 5 and suddenly I'm dead, kill cam jumps to some twat running around in the clouds.
---
THIS!. I've also notice that people will join an event until it's almost done and It's unfair doing an event just for a random to come and kill the legendary and me getting nothing out of it
---
Better yet get rid of the "&amp;" replace with "n"
---
Stop n Shop.
---
I wouldn't have a problem communicating through text chat.
---
 Hearing other people's voices on games completely ruins the entire experience for me.
---
So I don‚Äôt get it. Why should I trade out my two hand perks that all equal to about 162% more damage for a singular 20% more damage? Are own hand weapons just better? It seems like a trade off for nothing.
---
Fixer to combat rifle: ‚ÄûMom said it‚Äôs my turn to play with skins now‚Äú
---
Look.. people are gonna complain no matter what happens. Remember all the complaints about AFKers at Fasnacht? Or people complaining about high level characters "leeching" off events and not helping, and then straight after about them one-shotting everything?
---
Personally - I'd love to see exp sharing, and quest progress sharing would be great if it was *optional*, but people are gonna want the opposite no matter which path they take. People care too much about what other people are/aren't doing because they are worried that they are losing out somehow because of it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I suppose they could play it safe and add a "Sharing" group to allow both of your suggested options though, and keep both sides happy.
---
I spend most of my time farming mobs and events. I rarely nuke or do sbq since it‚Äôs not fun when you do it alone since me and my bros have different play times. I‚Äôd rather spray west tek in 5 mins then the queen in 5 mins. But yea I do have a hard time picking between my be 50 cal and my b2525 gat plas whenever I do a run.
---
Exactly. I've had that so many times too. Same with my wife.
---
Yeah, I think you can only use one at a time.
---
That's a very one sided way of looking at it.
---
Not entirely incorrect but very one sided.
---
Isn't Anne one of the random corpses that starts the camera quest?
---
Just make a very small required distance you need to be from the person doing the killing and this would completely negate your argument.
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fixed
---
I'm having the same issue, finished The Motherload, have the key card and nothing. There's a internal glitch, Bethesda is working on it.
---
Never said it was the right thing to do or the sole cause. I dont exploit or support it, so dont put words in my mouth. There is cause and effect to everything, you can ignore the underlaying factors out of blind rage towards exploiters but that changes nothing, only through understanding can corrections be made.
---
 In your scenario your suggesting Bethesda gives overly genrous "free upgrades" in response to their mess ups, $5 worth of atoms hardly qualifies as an overly generous correction of cheating people out of quality canvas bags when they've paid $100+ dollars, mind you further correction only came after law suits forced thier hand. No action was even taken in regards to the Nuka Dark. Game refunds where also denied untill they were again forced.
---
And yes, the principle of equity is a thing, do some research.  This is how many employees justify slacking it or stealing product.  If you feel treated unfairly your more prone to take what you want. This is taught as standard in college courses and deemed fact.
---
Just because you dont feel influenced by this doesnt mean others are.
---
Nope, you're good until patch 21
---
Same here. Gets very frustrating. Yeah my shotgunner guy has no problem at all.
---
They already stated they want all event players to get all drops.  
---
However given this is Bethesda it will take a million lines of code and 3 years of testing to accomplish.
---
Meanwhile I only have 1k caps..
---

She‚Äôs a tourist with a camera that you can repair and then use to take photos with a quest attached called Bucket List. The camera is also used for a daily overseer quest and completion of these quests will reward you with a lens mod for it.
---
Just wear a strangler pa...
---
I've seen the body of Anne at other places (Colonel Kelly monument and other places), and the body of a man (can't think of his name) in the same various places as well. Both of them are dressed like tourists.

PS4.  
---
Due to work schedule, I‚Äôve been logging on about 5p each day - all the dailys have worked as expected for me this week.  
---
Last week/weekend, I was login on about 12.15p - dailys worked as expected then, too.
---
They said to enjoy it while you can until patch 21
---
You cease to exist in real life.
---
Ok one the powerfist, meat hook, and deathclaw gaunlet etc. Arnt one handed weapons they are unarmed. Second yes there base weapon values are way higher and have faster attacks and most of them have some inate armor pen
---
Do you want a whole bunch of useless players on your public team who just stand there and do nothing and get all the xp? This is how you get those players to show up. It's already an issue at public events where people hide in stealth the whole time and do nothing. 
---
For me this is a problem that the game is too easy. 90% of players shouldn't be able to one shot 90% of the enemies. This game sorely needs a balance pass and hopefully one Wastelanders actually does that and doesn't just make it worse.
---
As for the quest goals, yes, all team members should get quest completion if they are actively working on a quest with others and haven't completed it yet. I believe it used to be that way before Wastelanders and it makes no sense for them to change it
---
I think it's ok got grenades to be OP. They're designed to fuck your shit up.
---
Yeah thats true.
---
It's not the root, just one oft he known precautions you can take. I did everything right yesterday and still got boned.
---
&gt; People care too much about what other people are/aren't doing because they are worried that they are losing out somehow because of it
---
And this is why we can't have nice things.
---
I'm a solo player but since public teams were introduced I've only been on teams and I have yet to interact with anyone. It's worth it for the bonuses.
---
I also agree, that contemporary bundle is pretty sweet.
---
Broken for sure
---
robot crafting from FO4. the parts are all in the files btw.
---
"I can tank 3 to 4 hits from a Grenade Launcher. Wich is also quite op,  if think about the fact that the enemy dosent have to give you direct  Hits."  
---
This would be true if you were talking about the gauss shotgun, which should be nerfed or made a gold weapon, but 3 to 4 shots from a Grenade Launcher is a long time to take someone down in this game.
---
Grenade Launchers and Grenades are very strong, but have nothing on Gauss shotguns, or even Handmades really, which can drop someone in a second with good shots.
---
They maybe a bit too strong but there are several things in NW that would be ahead of them in needing to be made less powerful.
---
I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôm receiving the atoms just not receiving the pop up on the screen.
---
You can buy the plans at white springs
---
Have you thought of getting *better gear?* ü§î
---
I like those carrying a little bit of weight ghouls.
---
You get one card in the initial quest so you can recall and stop the assaultron. However as they made it an event like the SBQ fight you have to make an investment. Otherwise people would just spam the event back to back. Most of the player triggered events have some limitations to prevent spam. SBQ requires a nuclear card which requires killing vertibot swarms. Encryptid requires recall card, which you purchase. The defend workshop events have a one hour timer.
---
Yeah I agree.
---
1 is ok if they find a way to detect wether or not you are actually participating and not just idling the event.
---
2 is, I'm sorry, absurd. Why would you want to punish high damage dealers? Plus, if you solo an event for whatever reason it would take longer and more ammo. No.
---
No problem.
---
Why is there a cap limit at all though?
---
There is a 'One Wasteland' change due around same time as Season 3 that reworks the enemy levels and player damage. As it stands it will in effect change damage from points to percentages evening out the damage dealt when low + high level players face the same enemy, although the individual rewards will need remain to show the difference.
---
Explosive weapons dont work on bosses.  Legacy included.  
---
So we can both one shot a super mutant.   Stop the presses. 
---
What is this highest DPS fantasy you have.  I assure you its just in your head. 
---
Ffr &gt; explosive all day long.  Thats WHY they were left in. There is no unbalance.
---
I was lucky to find one within the first month of gameplay, seen maybe 3-4 total thus far. But the nice thing is Bethesda added a new raider ally that has you hunt down cryptids daily. And wouldn't you know, my first daily was a Flatwoods monster. Good to know for anyone else struggling to find one.
---
We really need either account-wide stash or trading within the same account, as that'd solve this and so many other issues.
---
I just got the beanie
---
Power armor is useful early on for melee since it buffs your strength until your strong enough. but I feel it falls off late game as unyielding is where all the extra damage is at. You'll also be restricted from one handed fist weapons like the mole miner and deathclaw gauntlets, which hit fast and hard.
---
As for builds, I use incisor, martial artist, and blocker as the main cards. I think most legendary prefixes should be good enough with bloodied and furious being some of the best.
---
Perhaps they could shift the loot from the legendary enemies and reward it to those who have been a part of the event, at the end? I'd take anything at this point, because seeing all the lower level players, who are within the events required levels, get screwed over by players in the 100/200's+ who will scrip fodder it off, is really sad at this point.
---
This is a glitch.  I wouldn't recommend doing it.  Not worth a ban.
---
daily and weekly challenges award SCORE now, not Atoms. the season pass is in effect. only way to get free Atoms is to complete the other challenges, the ones in character, social, combat, etc.
---
So would a bloodied unarmed weapon with only one perk card have a base stat better than my current bloodied? Just curious?
---
People exploiting a glitch.
---
Only been a week since a ban wave? very smart... ^/s
---
It‚Äôs a glitch. Just ignore them. There‚Äôs no need to do it since ammo is plentiful as is.
---
Its a new glitch involving blueprints.
---
Its a glitch. Something to do with workshops
---
To answer who Anne Litzinger is she's a reference to the real life photographer Annie Leibovitz.
---
Its an exploit.  Screenshot and report it.
---
I blast human NPCs in front of the new gamepass players and I make them watch me eat them
---
Or to care the cow
---
&gt;A good player using a commando-only build will lose to a low skill player with an explosive build
---
Only if that person with an explosive build is lucky enough to have  all the right equipment spawn in all the right places.  The likelihood of that happening is extremely  low.
---
Update: I  was just killed by a guy with a grenade launcher.  He killed me quickly so I am guessing he had a perk load out similar to the one you recommended.  He died seconds after I did. He was gunned down by a guy with an automatic rifle. Tell me again how commando builds don't dominate nuclear winter.
---
This sounds a bit daft, but where in the build menu in the garage? I can't find it
---
When you want to grab a fan irl.
---
I had one in West-tek once all the super mutants where glowing purple I had no clue what was going on until I went into the locked section and it attacked me.
---
No, it's daily
---
You're welcome (I still have 17 damn nuclear keycards to use. 
---
Why do they have to weigh a pound each!?)
---
Dude you could have a bffr gauss gat and still miss out on kills at events.

Have you even ran an event lol.

Nope it‚Äôs only 150 a day

Nope. I got the elf jacket last night. Was a pleasant surprise.

you‚Äôre welcome :)
---
How do we buy ranks??? I figured it would be simple Nd be like click the next lvl you have avaliable and hit enter to purchase. But no dice for me. Figured they hadn't started it yet
---
Joke's on them anyway, the extractor takes up a lot of budget, can't be moved and can't be scrapped. You're stuck with it unless you move your camp and even then I've read that it stays stored in your budget but is invisible and can't be placed again/deleted lol.
---
No matter how tempting this sounds just don't do it.
---
Mothman‚Äôs light.
---
All of the perk cards that add +5% or +10% to damage. Start with 1 star expert shotgunner plus one star shotgunner and then 1 star master shotgunner under strength. Don‚Äôt start ranking the cards up until you have all 3. Rank up bloody mess under luck, and(when you find a good full auto like a submachinegun, handmade, etc) get commando under perception and Gun fu under agility. Any time you go out getting into trouble, equip all these cards that you can. Get in the habit of clearing hostile first, then looting and scavenging because you will probably need to switch back over to some perk cards that will help you manage your carry weight. Go home, scrap and store, repeat
---
Nope it still talks
---
And here I am, running silos all the way thru.... level 336 and still haven't found a faster route
---
At least his death would destroy all the resource generators so that way the player who was trying to pick the lock would not be able to get anymore resources.
---
It ultimately comes down to a big game of hide and seek
---
The caps overflow goes directly into Todd's account.
---
I get about 10k xp just running West tek
---
Exactly my point.  Its a novelty.   Clearing west tek 30 - 60 seconds faster gets you exactly ...sweet ... Fk ...all.    You STILL have to wait for it to respawn.

Yea I would like the rest of the unstoppables but I already bought grognak when he was on sale and I‚Äôm not buying a full price bundle when I got 1/4 of the bundle..

You can earn more scrip by doing a daily quest.
---
what‚Äôs the other side? please tell us so we can
---
compare the other side of the argument
---
Depends on the weapon but ibknow the deathclaw and meat hook get well into the thousands
---
I use an mix of pistols and shotgun I'd say for tapping anything it would be the shotgun from an distance if not my western revolver would one shot anything
---
Then you just AFK in a corner at the event limits - Fasnacht v2.
---
If people don't truly engage, ie hit the enemy, they should get no credit for it full stop. I don't enjoy it when I miss a boss and xp/rewards but that's life.
---
Hold V to enter build mode.
---
I believe so, it says on the store page for it all the ones it works for
---
THIS ALL DAY!!! üôèüèº You are my heroes!!
---
I was thinking about what I loved about the older games the other day also......and what I feel like I've lost with 76.
---
And for me..... Its the exploration, in fallout 4 I was always going around different places looting everything and finding cool stuff.
---
But because of the way 76 is built, all I'm doing is visiting the same areas and killing the same enemies over and over again. Doing the same daily quests etc......
---
And because I don't want to miss out on things like the legendary run and the gold atm, I don't have time to play these old games anymore. 
---
Just makes me a bit sad really.
---
Molotovs
---
This. I'd honestly call it an essential purchase.
---
Fallout 76 Call of Duty DLC lol
---
I kid I kid! üòÇüòàü§ô
---
Free market, don't buy. Don't get so wound up about it though.
---
the luck of the draw perk has a chance to proc on each hit. so TSE weapons have 4 times chance to proc. helps a lot
---
I did the same and wasted bullion on the deep pocket mod only to then realize can't user it with the jet pack... if they would have had limb deep pocket mods i maybe wouldn't have made this mistake... wish I wasn't rushing so much.   I guess I'll double check before each purchase.   I think I'm moving on to the weapons and giving ss armor a break
---
Read what I said, as I said you can do that, but it is timed and this persons post was like we leave things in containers so no one checking our storage could ever find them for like days and days, to get around duping.
---
Junkies is for if you want less stress. You don‚Äôt have to have perk cards for it and you don‚Äôt have to always watch your radiation and health levels. That‚Äôs why I picked it, I wanted to not worry about that stuff and just get a nice buff
---
I get mine around sunshine farm or north of abbies bunker.
---
[Use this map to find where tameable can spawn] (https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/d/d7/Mappalachia_random_encounters.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190626174620)  any red dot has a chance of spawning a tameable random encounter which could be any of a number of animals.
---
And just to make sure, you have the right perk, (animal friend i think) equipped?
---
It can't be deleted?  This is the funniest thing I've read all day! Guess that would be karma lol.
---
they tone down the xp to prevent farming, not worth it
---
Was just about to say the same.
---
The whole point of atoms is to get you to spend real money so this will never happen
---
That's my full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and j for big fights
---
Edit, as for your second question. Are you referring to legendary guns with the explosive effect? Like a Tse 50 cal for example? Because those are effected by the heavy gunner cards. The explosive heavy weapons it refers to are thing like the missile launcher and auto nade launcher
---
Still baffles me why they did that. Makes all the ones in machines pointless the instant you know.
---
I agree that the grind was done poorly and with too many time gates. I also did nothing else but the dailies and then logged off. There just wasn't anything else to keep me occupied.
---
I seemed to receive mine but they were gone when I logged back in.
---
I didn't. Blood pressure is now settled. Fentanyl laced chai ftw.
---
I‚Äôve always thought there should be the option of locking or booby trapping doors and gatherers. 
---
I mean I if I *know* someone‚Äôs gonna come for it it‚Äôs good design to give me more defensive options than scaling locks.
---
On top of what everyone else has said I'll add one of the live and love mags gives 5% xp in a team.
---
I got the skeleton outfit and beanie yesterday
---
Bethesda should either Increase cap limit (pls) or stop people from buying from your store when u reach cap limit
---
Aaaahhh so you didnt read my question then. No worries, you could try again or leave it to some helpfull folk in our wee community
---
The downside of everyone getting exploding plasmas and B2525 fixers. Events became a free for all.
---
Well for example, the people that I play with who use dupe cheats do it so they can gain access to legacy weapons.
---
Legacy weapons literally don't exist anymore the ONLY way to get them is to find someone who just so happens to have had one before they were removed and have them dupe it.
---
Luckily all the good one have been duped by now so it's not as an impossible task as it sounds but... it's still kinda bullshit how these really powerful weapons that no-one can now get legitimately are still in the game.
---
Personally I like to just have them as like a top tier collectable but some of them have insane PVP potential and are just unfair.
---
No, but do events and you will get some
---
To eleborate daily quests give between 3 and 8 script depending. 
---
Also you CAN have a mule use the machine too.  Really only helps id the mule is 50+
---
[Here are some more maps that might pique your interest.](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Mappalachia)
---
Yeah the comments in youtube videos about this are pretty funny. Tons of people saying they did it and only a handful saying beware of all the bugs related. All I can say is RIP to their budget. Can you imagine if Bethesda never even fixed this? They'd literally lose like 10% (or more if just 1 machine wasn't enough) of their camp budget permanently.
---
&gt;Do you want a whole bunch of useless players on your public team who just stand there and do nothing and get all the xp?
---
I mean, if you don't want those you can simply kick them from your party.
---
As long as you cut power doesn't that keep them from buying anything?
---
I've had a visual bug before where it say's 0 Atoms even though I had 3,000+ a quick reboot of the game fixed the problem.
---
Also though the last few days people have reported losing 100's or even all atoms permanently so I wouldn't be surprised it's a new bug caused by the duplication hot fix we had around the same time people started reporting this.
---
Yeah the legendary run ghillie paints are pretty disappointing across the board. Even the backpack, which I was really looking forward to.
---
Yes I‚Äôm talking about things like the TSE, makes me feel better to know they‚Äôre not affected!
---
Not meant to punish, it was just a quick thought, based on how many others are participating at the time, so if you're solo, you get to do all the damage all the time, probably should have fleshed out the suggestion more; my apologies!
---
Elf jacket? You mean the fur-lined jacket and jeans?
---
Either this, or simply don't accept those people to your team.
---
It should have been a PA helmet skin for all PA variants IMO...
---
I miss the purveyor scrip bug ‚òπ
---
I agree but this is Bethesda we‚Äôre talking about. They seem to lack common sense
---
Bethesda PLEASE ban ppl who always cry on reddit
---
So the solution for every single player, is to be BIS? Because that'll solve the 1-2 tap of legendary mobs? Not to mention the fact that having to constantly hunt for the legendaries and stress if you get a kill in, is NOT fun.
---
Vendors and amco on the roof, and put water outside in the dirt anywhere. Scavenger can kiss my ass he can live down a cliff where I can't hear him.
---
My job done farmed both to MAX. Never again
---
Gives dirty though
---
No one knows how the rebalance work yet.  Not even Betheada.  
---
However I highly suspect it will work like ESO.  Where low lvl players get a passive scaling buff and are doing similar damage as high levels players.  
---
Its a bit strange when youre lvl 1 and your armor says its over 1000 rating but it actually works pretty well in practice there at least.
---
Cutting power just takes your vendors off the map and reverts your camp symbol to the default one.
---
Players can still make a purchase if they manage to get to your unpowered vendors.
---
For me its quest design. I just think Bethesda's quest design has been steadily getting worse. Well since Skyrim really. Probably alot to do with their focus on repeatable quests. By their nature they will be simplistic and will get tedious. But it feels like there is such a focus on them now. 
---
If you look at Fallout 4, there wasnt many interesting big side quests tbh.
---
In 76 the only one that stands out is the order of mysteries.
---
Funny üôÇ
---
And some people say bloody has no downside, is too meta and needs to be nerfed. We can lose everything just by being healed inadvertently. 
---
I don't hold it against people who share perks that heal/remove rads though. I'm certain that 99% of them don't know how bloody functions and just have no idea what they're doing.
---
With so many people doing bloodied/high-rads/mutations builds they should add a children of atom theme set of items, including these skins.
---
Couple skins for radium rifle, gamma gun, some radiation-emitting CAMP items, children of atom decorations/tattoos from Fallout 4/Far Harbor etc. Very low effort pack.
---
Also would love to see a ‚Äúclean‚Äù radium rifle skin. Something that looks like a prototype and maybe has warning/hazard stickers it.
---
Very spooky, and very scary
---
I got it and started the day after it got one gamepass ( the no region ping glitch on gamepass, the multiplayer profile glitch on gamepass slowed me down) and I‚Äôm level 50 now, other than stability the game is great
---
How much time do you honestly take monitoring the activities of your public team members?
---
Why you crybabies dont wear a strangler pa?
---
Could use a stack of those little blue vault tec generators for vendors and lights, open up a whole wall of space.
---
I was holding off buying it but I think I will now good idea.
---
maybe it was a nocturnal explosive broadsider? broadsiders could drop with explosive as secondary effect but beth removed it. 
---
so now they are legacy items. 
---
shitty weapon, but collectors are collectors.
---
maybe that was the case here. 
---
if not he‚Äôs just not seeing the market if trying to sell a shitty 2* for 7k.
---
You can, they‚Äôre called repair kits.
---
You get them from atomic shop or SBQ
---
That guy is either the best troll, or is just trying to be helpful. Either way, that guy is my idol now
---
I did the same thing when I got the grocers backpack lol. I was so confused. Ended up deciding to just leave the perk on instead and go for the raiders backpack plans
---
Equip and share Sunkissed instead. 
---
Then they have no idea why rads are fading as it doesnt proc and show an animation and most players dont pay attention to who is sharing what. 
---
I mean if you are gunna troll you might as well do it right.  
---
#downwiththebloodiedbourgeoisie.
---
And then there's me. I spent a ton of caps on a Fixer plan, then got one in a drop 2 days later. I listed it in my vendor. I'm hoping im not the only person that will spend what I paid for one. I just want to make my money back.
---
Anytime you want to move your actual camp structures as a whole you MUST remove ANYTHING hanging on walls or from roofs/ceilings. That is what is giving you the "can not place, item needs support" error. 
---
Chairs/tables/beds and most crafting will be alright but, personally, I'd store the furniture and decorations and THEN move.
---
Ahhh ok then leave the PA
---
Over the last couple sessions, I‚Äôve gotten the wreath, presents, and tree, so it doesn‚Äôt look like it. Get em while you can!
---
I was born and raised in Summersville, WV, then we moved to the Charleston area when I was going into High School.  I thought it was really cool when I started playing FO76 in January (I bought the game just because I had heard it was based around real West Virginia locations and legends, even though I have never played a Fallout game before).
---
During the Cold War era, the bunker in the Greenbriar was one of the worst kept secrets in the world.  It was created to house members of Congress, in case Russia decided to drop nuclear bombs on us.  It was a "secret" bunker, but everyone knew about it.  LOL  :)
---
The most amazing thing to me was when I stumbled across "New Gad" in the game, just outside of Summersville, in the dried lakebed of what used to be Summersville Lake.  Many years ago, there used to be a small town named "Gad", just outside Summersville.  When the Corps of Engineers built the Summersville Dam, that created the Summersville Lake, which completely submerged the town of Gad, which has only existed for decades at the bottom of the Summersville Lake.  Not many people even know about the now submerged town of Gad, unless they are from around that area.  I thought that was one of the most amazing inclusions in the game.  :)
---
When I was a young child, Grandma would sometimes drive us out to the scenic overlook, to see the New River Gorge Bridge being built.  It spanned about halfway across at that time, so it actually kind of looks in the game, the way it did when I was a child and it was still being built.  Every year in the fall, they close the bridge to traffic for one day, for the annual "Bridge Day".  The place is extremely crowded with visitors, many of whom are base jumping with parachutes from the bridge, and things like that.  They used to allow bungee jumping, but I think they stopped allowing that a few years ago, because of people getting hurt or killed (I "think" I heard they no longer allow bungee jumping from the bridge, but I may be wrong).
---
Years ago, when I was in my early twenties, I used to work as a Security Officer for the state capitol in Charleston.  They do have a replica of the Liberty Bell in the rear courtyard, in real life.  I was surprised to see that replica bell at the state capitol in the game.  Another nice little detail thrown in there.  :)
---
Of course, anyone from West Virginia is very familiar with the stories of the Flatwoods Monster and the Mothman, and cryptid enthusiasts around the world are also familiar with them.
---
Beckley is close to Summersville in real life, so I have been there many times.  It is also where the West Virginia Military Enlisted Processing Station (MEPS) is located, so I went to Beckley for my military in-processing, years ago (I am now a retired U.S. Army Master Sergeant).
---
Geographically, a lot of the locations in the game are located in entirely different places, in relation to where they are located in relation to other locations, in real life.  However, they did a great job of creating buildings and landmarks that look very similar to the real life things.
---
No like have you cancelled it now
---
What's a plasma splitter? I don't think they exist for plasma guns... The flamer barrel - it does have a high RoF, so does fit better with commando / modern renegade, sure... But those things aren't well thought out by the developers... Like shotgun barrel on Tesla - also uses rifleman..
---
I know, but to have the ability to use similar weapons or just regular junk straight from your inventory without having to use a workbench or repair kits would be neat.
---
Its not uncommon for people to get a month or 2 of membership and cram the scrap box with as much junk as they can to last a few months and then cancel
---
Might be a medic build and doesn‚Äôt know the ins and outs of a bloodied build. Plus he won‚Äôt know what build you are
---
Yeah, it happened bad to my 1st character who I stopped at 49 and don't care to play anymore.  I just give him all the extra stuff and ammo now for when they fix the ammo computer thing.
---
Empath will cover yourself as well, more than covering the missing lone wanderer buff.
---
The "modder patch" is just an value set to 0 in .ini file, they can patch it, but the real issue is the game engine that can't handle a lots of effect like this (especially during the SBQ fight) so you can complain about this but fo76 devs can't do anything because they're not working on the engine, it's another team job, and they just did a major update as we can hope for TESVI.
---
So i guess they don't want to remove particles effects (that stupid but they have some reason to keep it) but in meantime that the only way to fix it.
---
m8,
---
do those rare outfits also have a chance to drop from events like it‚Äôs a trap or irrational fear? or only dailies/public events?
---
Oh good to know! I'll be locking them down w regular garage doors from now on!
---
though the LMG ingame is the predecessor MG42 and not the MG 3
---
Then why were they duping B2525 Fixers?
---
Sounds like you're a little bitch with a terrible build blaming people who just want to help
---
Wow thanks for putting this on a completely wrong sub asshole what r/really didn‚Äôt want your post shit head
---
The guy is hallucinating as its nowhere near the highest dps in game
---
That would defeat the purpose of having repair kits in the game.
---
I just think the events are a lot more fun now. The battle wins actually feel hard earned. I didn't know about the bobblehead stacking thing.
---
Lol exactly! Can you imagine playing monopoly for like 3k hrs and then one day letting a friend that's never played before start with an extra $100 so they have more fun and get interested in playing?
---
Even though the monopoly money is fake and there is no victim, I would hope(pray) that the makers of the game ban everyone involved from ever playing monopoly again!
---
"You can't just take fake money out of a fake boardgame to have FUN and not expect consequences!"
---
-Pol Pot
---
Yeah, I guess you‚Äôre right. It would be cool, though.
---
I'd like this, so I don't accidentally scrap the Decontamination Chamber someone gifted me for use on my CAMP. :D
---
I‚Äôm a little confused. 
---
You currently are able to repair weapons and armor with junk at a workbench. 
---
Are you saying you want to be able to do that but not at a workbench?
---
Truth hurts I guess
---
What? A wanted player can turn on the pacifist mode??? üòÆ
---
I haven't tried a bloody build yet, is there a reason you asked to be resurrected and didn't just respawn?  If there is no reason, then that's all on you dude - you're the one with special needs, you're the one who should address those needs.
---
Yes you are on track
---
*dude runs up with a rifle covered in 3 rolls of ducttape with screws hanging out and falling off*
---
"WhErE iS aLL da LeGeNdARiES"
---
Would like to see those too.
---
They could even add the modding options for the Garand so you can mod it into a carbine too which would turn it essentially into two weapons, similar to how you can craft pipe pistols into rifles by modding.
---
Never played in public teams so far, just with friends.
---
But if you don't care what they are doing anyway, why do you care if they leech XP?
---
Yeah, but also take them off the map too lol. It's a dick move to lock them and leave them on
---
Shotguns?
---
Look under the floor/ vendor/ floor decor lights/ wall decor options tab and scroll left to the right to see the options to select.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm starting to realize how stupid it sounds.
---
I‚Äôd gladly spend my whole 30,000 caps for some C.A.M.P. budget space. Even if it‚Äôs only 5% more. Sigh...
---
They're from the Wayward questline mission in Gauley mine [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/ADD\_FOOD\_HERE](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/ADD_FOOD_HERE)
---
People have been doing it for awhile and ill agree that its old as hell.  I play with a guy that has a melee build and he burns the queen in 3 hits.  I get enough damage with my level 20 character so I dont understand how people don't get enough damage in when they're 200+
---
Shotgun or mule/foodbuild üòÇ
---
Ikr
---
Maybe a team medic build? Stealth build?
---
Yes, I have noticed the same on PS4 for this challenge.
---
Also the same for the Revive Players challenge under the Social group, for me.
---
I have not completed either challenge yet, at 17/76 for the Repair Swords and 19/76 for the Revive Players challenges.
---
Have you completed either of these challenges and did not actually receive any reward?
---
Strictly power armor only is something I'm considering.
---
Literally you're not allowed out of your camp without it on.
---
Yeah, I don‚Äôt do exploits.
---
I got to that point(like 27k)but found a dude who was selling a pink asylum uni for 15076 caps in a vendor. So I don't gotta worry for a while.
---
Great story. Thanks for sharing that.
---
The developers are very good at capturing the atory, history, and geography of a region.
---
If you feel like expanding your Fallout experience, pick up Fallout 4. 
---
It takes place around Boston.
---
Although I am in and from Canada, I have made many trips to Boston (Go Bruins).
---
They did a fantastic job recreating the Boston area. They transformed Fenway park into a settlement and did a great job.
---
If you're on PC DM me, we'll work something out.
---
Because that's what people want.
---
Duping is a tool, different people are gonna use it in different ways.
---
Not all good but if it accomplishes what they wanted then what's the difference.
---
Some people dupe a quintillion presents.
---
There are many ways to break the game.
---
300 a serum means the seller gets 270 caps due to the void tax. Quite frankly, I'd rather sell to the bots and get around 420 a pop before I go below the 330-380 I sell them for (depending on the kind of flux that's needed).
---
You got a lot of 5mm kicking around? ;)
---
Visited Hoover dam and my first thought was ....this looksblike new vegas...
---
Ahhh thanks. I clearly didn‚Äôt notice
---
Great story! 
---
Honestly didn't know the flatwoods monsters is supposed to be rare. I must be some kinda magnate for it 'cause I even get him spawning at my camp occasionally.
---
You're welcome
---
Oh yeah, I believe you're right, thank you! Let's hope they bring it back.
---
With how worthless caps already are, and considering most of the high-end gear is often trade only, they could afford to drastically increase or outright remove the caps limit. Honestly, I got so tired of dealing with the various currency caps, that's why I stopped playing.
---
Stealth Rifleman build?
---
Yeah, I just snip the power cable to the garage door. That's been working
---
Harsh language
---
Food build.
---
You are only allowed to use food / weight perks and a pitchfork.  
---
Go.
---
Sounds like a you problem
---
Yeah the heavy was a shotgun build in the earlier levels as they're easy to swap out.
---
Which is sad, because I have one character totally full of various God roll items I collected over my play time, and they just sit there collecting dust.
---
They misunderstood, no need to be rude about it. 
---
Anyway, it‚Äôs at the end under Misc Structures in the menus.
---
Even more relatable than constantly clicking and backing out of conversation with Ward because no matter what he won't say anything more than "Finally, someone with the guts to help"?
---
I was scared of silos but recently Im practicing it and run 3+ per day. Last night I had a guy in PA keeping the queen in the middle of the nuke zone and later an other guy that dropped a nuke on top of us while we were 5 mins into the fight. Don't be those guys, it's really demotivating running the silos for everyone to enjoy and wasting time and effort only to have that guy ruining it for everyone. 
---
Also, the queen will not land if everyone is on top of tents/fences etc, the fight lasts forever and it's not fun, let her land so we don't waste our time/ammo. I think if people knew how to behave more people would drop nukes but sometimes it's really demotivating after the first one and you have to jump servers/do something else instead.
---
I have neither and I'm not seeing hordes of people running around with them. Not doubting a massive influx but the claim that they're everywhere seems to be, a bit, bold.
---
Haha crazed farmer build
---
I've bought them for as much as 10k,although I've seen them cheaper lately, lowest was 5k. IMHO they will always be somewhat valuable, might be a bargaining chip for trades.
---
You fast travel to Mount Blair Trainyard. Go towards the building that has the train cars being loaded with coal. Go to the left before actually entering that building and hug the outside wall. Go up the first set of stairs and into an office like area. It‚Äôs in there ;)
---
I don‚Äôt regret mine. But I‚Äôd love it to be snappable, wallpaperable, and floorable.
---
I've done one violent night with this guy and he played the whole time, it was on ps4
---
Easy, same switch cuts power to the vendors and doors.
---
If you already have these things it‚Äôs just a waste of time. Bethesda needs to loosen or remove item caps.
---
Oh I truly hope this is all true.
---
Honestly, I was tempted for about 5 seconds to do the exploit. Not worth a potential ban. And definitely not if it gets stuck in your C.A.M.P. budget.
---
You shall get perma-staggered.
---
Looks like I know which perk cards I'm grabbing next. Thanks for the heads up.
---
I paid 10k. I hadn't seen them listed very often so I kind of jumped at the chance when I had it.
---
Old man build. Walking cane as a weapon only.
---
I had this mindset:  melee, rifle, heavy, pistol, shotgun.
---
Then i went a different direction.
---
Full health clean str, full heath junkie str, bloodied melee, bloodied range, full healthy junkie ranged.
---
As one can float heavy/melee/shotgun I‚Äôve found this mindset gives a lot of variety for what I want to do.
---
Yes, I‚Äôve been playing this game too long.
---
Good idea, rough in the early levels before any PA perks but could be done
---
If you‚Äôre having any difficulty I have the powered door set up at my base with a pressure plate allowing exit (there are two power connectors....the obvious one and another direct power link hidden immediately above the door opening). My GT on XBOX is the same as my username here....so assuming you‚Äôre on XBOX....
---
You made me spit out my drink, thank you
---
i mean that in itself is more reason to showcase its strong, because you are happy to literally be playing on low health because of how strong it is and how over performing low health perks stack up together, especially godmode serendipity
---
Charisma at rank 1t so you can share Adrenaline ranked at 5 is an interesting one. I know it's broken, but once it's fixed, your team's damage is insane. It's fun to have to have a build with that and endurance at 15 just for the hell of it.
---
By the end of the event. I rank up twice, I'm a level 350.
---
Nope, I log in 15 mins after every single day. Today 2000 score worth of challanges auto completed. I hope they fix this by double score weekend.
---
Same. 10h in it came at my base and poofed as soon as I shot it, I considered it a bug since I was min a private world, alone, and hadn‚Äôt set off any nukes or anything.
---
The bar itself is under floor decor, if you own the fancy bar set, you need to find that bar and then scroll to the right.
---
Agreed, every other mmo can do this just fine. People complain about AFK players but it's as easy as having a distance limit on the shared xp, this would make playing with friends so much better since we can all play the game without waiting around for people to tag all the enemies it's a chore.
---
Hope so because you want everyone to be able to earn their score, or hope so because scrolling past posts you don‚Äôt like is hard?
---
Seems to be a lot of the latter on this sub, and not much of the former.
---
That would make me never do it. I drop all three in row no problem. If I had to do it all....F&amp;$K that.
---
Why not both?
---
25k is basically my new threshold.  As soon as I get there, I just remove all expensive items from my vendors.
---
Can you perchance make a short video of your toon completing one of the atom challenges and upload it?  Show the challenge screen before completing, go kill whatever you got to unlock it, then show the challenge screen again.
---
PA shotgun  build

---
I use PA to tank in battles. That plus two handed melee and a couple heavy guns is some of the most fun I‚Äôve had playing this game. Not the best dps so I run junkies to get that extra boost and I can easily hold my own against bosses. Just costs a lot of bullets so I keep only 5mm and plasma cores and use ammo converter on anything else
---
aye. seems daft when they've just banned a load of players
---
Hahahaha no chance sweetheart.
---
Thanks. Then I skip it.
---
Do you forget this is Bethesda we are working with?
---
I logged in 15 mins after and lost 2000 score, so no. Anyone know how to summit a ticket on Xbox?
---
They‚Äôve issued a [statement](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2Oabso5vKN6XF3xr1AL6Ag/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-challenge-update-community-showcases-and-double).
---
Apparantly that quest can complete when someone else you are grouped with drops a nuke. Assuming you did all of the enclave missions to become a general, then you just need a keycard and a launch code and you're good to go.  [nukacrypt](https://roguetrader.com/#/)  lists all new codes each week.   
---
Find a silo (check your Missile Silo State Holotape to make sure the silo you choose is not on cooldown) and progress your way through it, initiate the launch prep and once completed, you scan your card and enter the code, then select an area to drop it.
---
I actually do this on one. 
---
He wears no armor only PA.  Heck I didnt even bother getting the backpack (until the mothman pack then I just used the free one). 
---
And then you should see his camp.  Not a single wall or floor.  Just a bunch of workbenches right on the ground with a bed and cooking station.  I swear some people wander into my camp waiting for the rest of it to load.  Jokes on them there is nothing else to load.
---
Ouch. /thread
---
The same way they‚Äôve been doing since launch. More specifically, they‚Äôll probably end up making the game backwards compatible. As we know, the xbox is making every game backwards compatible right iff the bat.
---
Looks like contemporary it is, thanks! Not gonna lie, I've been itching to design some nice porch/deck combos after seeing some of these camps.
---
EXACTLY!
---
make at least 1000dmg in under 10min, survive.
---
I'm a Bloodied Build and I would just be grateful that someone took the time out to revive instead of ignoring like half the world does.
---
Its a risk/reward build and dictating the perks of other players, especially those not necessarily on your team in a public event, just so you can maintain your +80% damage is selfish
---
but it's *still* water, you didn't say 'clean' water source
---
I have definitely not been getting all my challenge atom rewards since Tuesday I think.
---
I'm hoping a fix is incoming.
---
This would be fun if if it added a "Redneck Squatter" effect. Your weapons could do like 10% more damage, but broke 40% faster. ü§£
---
You already can. 
---
As its components.   
---
Cloth and Acid.
---
Lol crossed my mind to do an old prisoner build. Lives in a 2x1 box. Dirty bed, toilet, sink only. Barred security door.
---
Actually, that would be kinda neat!
---
I'm pretty sure it's not there now, after the Wastelander's update
---
So by your argument stealing irl is a tool to get what you want - duping is against the rules and banning/suspensions is their way of putting that account in jail.
---
but you cant turn gunpowder into cloth+acid
---
The auto complete has been a bug way before wastelanders dropped!
---
Does anyone know if the mothman eggs moved anywhere? There are none in Point Pleasant anymore looks like.
---
You‚Äôve got plenty of time, especially with the two bonus daily challenges (which they may do again) and a Double SCORE weekend coming up.
---
I miss the beta lighting so much. Look how the sky matches the scene before it just becomes blown out.
---
I have that and more, this game is a joke still.
---
Do you mean the elevator that ends in a porta-potty?
---
True. Honestly I get so much water just from other people's camps I shouldn't even bother with water at my camp.
---
Tameable foxes are some of the rarer ones I've seen when grinding for tamebles. Could also just be the locations I'm farming. I farm the cranberry bog and the mire for high level tames, but I know some guys who search the forest and they get rats, brahmin, deer, foxes, cats, and dogs.
---
Yes, they do.  And It's a trap always counts as a mire region event, regardless of where it actually occurs on the map (same with Always Vigilant.)
---
No the one you go down in the beginning.
---
Employees justify slacking or stealing... Again not a justification it's an excuse. You can call it whatever you would like, principle of equity or whatnot. I would call it grounds for removal or a criminal offense. I'm sure colleges teach this as a standard and fact, it doesnt negate business owner/manager and employee/subordinate roles. Were humans and we make independent choices and take actions, each has a consequence and reaction. 
---
Free DLC to a massive game is pretty extraordinary (free upgrades), I hadn't even considered free atoms so good looking out!
---
Also I dont believe I accused you of exploiting or put words in your mouth. I took your comment which seems to speak on behalf of a group and responded opposing on behalf of another.
---
I dont have blind rage for exploiters I just dont like them. I think it cheapens the experience and immersion. Like you I'm also not so blind to think that unhappy customers are the sole reason for exploiting. To me saying that you dont support exploits but going into great detail about how some justify it (very passionately if I may add) seems counterintuitive.
---
Best not to drop them.  
---
They are highly sensitive.
---
I‚Äôve noticed the farther I am the less damage a gun does. If I am up close and personal the TS minigun shreds through tough enemies. May be a glitch.
---
Stealing is theft of property.
---
Duping isn't stealing because nothing is lost your argument and analogy are lazy.
---
I suggest working on both before we continue.
---
Thank you, Ill try there.
---
Really? I've been doing events non stop since I started this game (I'm only level 70) and I haven't gotten any from them.
---
They already fixed it so this post wast a waste of time
---
They duped the B2525 Fixer because that is one of the best guns in the game, and they then used those duped Fixers to trade for anything they wanted, including legacy items. Of course, the trade value of bloodied fixers was destroyed because they were duped more than anything else, but the dupers got what they wanted before the value crashed, so nevermind that they cheated and screwed over a bunch of legitimate players.
---
Does strangler pa have an area of effect on its acid? I‚Äôm just starting to buy the plans with my bullion and would be very excited if that were true
---
Ah damn. Got a bloodied one with 10% damage when aimed in and thought this is my time to shine :/
---
When is the double score weekend?
---
So basically I miss out on that story piece because someone else completed it while I was in a group? And the only way to experience would be a new character correct?
---
I dunno, is there any solid evidence of this?  Obviously you run with Class freak so the +33% damage becomes +8%, I don't see any reason to doubt that part.
---
The rest hinges on the -25% damage applying to you even if you're on your own in a group or if you're the only one in the group with that mutation. (both of which, honestly, would feel like a bug to me, or at least not intended design, which might get patched out at any time, but that's another discussion)
---
Is there any hard evidence that this works?  And even if it does,  then that should come to -25%+8% = -18%, unless it's doing some more funky way of applying the percentages.  But -18% is is less than Lone Wanderer and doesnt come with the bonus AP that Lone Wanderer does.
---
Is there something I'm missing?
---
Good job reporting them!  We don't need people like that playing on our servers.
---
You should've pressed "Give up" the moment you were downed, then they wouldn't be able to revive you and you'd just respawn normally. You're not entirely blameless here yourself.
---
Make it a weird key like the * on the numpad. No way you press it by accident
---
Welcome to the club.  I been saying since launch its much easier to break down ammo than a microscope IRL.   Heck ive done it out of sheer boredom before.
---
Wait, what? 
---
Your VATS ain't broken with this shotty?
---
YESSS! I do this on Xbox although its usually modded armor, water, food, and some nukashine. And any extra plans i might have.
---
I'd love this. But. If we add more bots, we need a way to turn off their chatter. It's bad enough with the Slocums vendor and collectron going off at the same time, plus your Ally.
---
It is a world event and will pop up a notification for Scorched Earth in the upper left corner of your screen usually right after a nuke drops. If you see that, check the bottom right of the map for the event and join.
---
HOWEVER: Low Level players need to be aware that it is usually in or just outside of a Nuked area and you could be spawned IN the nuke zone. Also there are lots of high level mobs so be careful! Its usually safer to fast travel to a location just outside of the nuked area if you have any of the FT points, otherwise FT to a friend/team mate if you can!
---
Right. Like I said, avoid overpopulated events. Solo is literally the exact opposite lol
---
Hybred rifleman/gunslinger with a pipe revolver rifle.  They utilize both perks.
---
I have A blast with mine.
---
If you're the only one with the mutation you count as your own team mate, so that much counts for yourself too at least as long as you are in a team, it is of course better if you are in a team with someone else who has that mutation.
---
Look up the video "Angry Turtle" did on the mutation with public teams!
---
If your stressing just to hit that legendary have an small crew, one of you have 1st and do the event = profit no stressü§î
---
No they didnt.  
---
They added logging.
---
Yes! I applied the raider waister skin and the spotlight comes out of my right arm. I also cannot play first person as the arm takes up about 1/3 (if not more) of my screen when I use my 50 cal.
---
Edit: /u/Ladydevann can you pass this along and the comments above?
---
Gamepass is on pc too.
---
FWIW as a steam player I'm having this issue too.
---
I wish I could give the OP more than one upvote!
---
July 23rd.
---
You should get a little vault boy perk popup and noise when you look into a container, at least that is how my butcher perk works with animals.
---
Haven't seen *eVeRyOnE* having them any right build you could wipe any enemy
---
Exploit*
---
You got it.
---
Yes.
---
Same here, level 22 and enjoying the game a ton. 
---
Though without the wastelanders content I‚Äôm not sure I would have had the same reaction
---
Yep. Even on my quad tesla it makes me reload early. Hella annoying.
---
I don‚Äôt understand how they can‚Äôt fix this
---
You get 180 rounds of 5mm per craft (average of 210 with super duper). It‚Äôs pretty easy to make a lot of it. 
---
Plus if you set your ammo machine from the Raiders on 5mm, I‚Äôm getting to the point I don‚Äôt need to craft it very often at all. I use Gatling gun, so it‚Äôs pretty efficient compared to a mini-gun. 
---
I wish the 2mmEC was as easy!
---
Haha well I appreciate it!
---
This would be great. I always pick up gunpowder and it's usually the source of "where is all my carry weight going?" when I look and have like 700 of the stuff.
---
Aight thanks. I was wondering if you were talking about different rewards haha
---
For low levels, if the event pop up fast travel to it, but make sure to use a power armor or a hazmat suit as it will probably spawn you near or inside a nuked zone. If you join a public team with high lvl players they will most likely be there, so you can fast travel to them as well and be outside the nuked zone. After that just try to do as much damage as you can to the Queen.
---
Man you just don‚Äôt pay attention they said the logging tools allowed them to find a potential fix, hotfix already came &amp; another is coming within the next couple days if the issue isn‚Äôt fully resolved. But yeah no they didn‚Äôt dude nice oneüëçüèΩ
---
That is just a display bug the ammo itself seems to use the right numbers.  
---
You can easily verify this by checking your fusion cores you should not have a bunch of 9-10% cores which you do when you reload before empty...i use an ffr gat plas and noticed this too but my core count is accurate.
---
I always wondered why it was less expensive for Bethesda to allow mules than to allow even double limit on everything. 
---
They have to store assets for a completely new character and everything just so they don‚Äôt double storage space or whatever else. 
---
I‚Äôm just assuming each character has an overflow after a certain amount of stash which is the real issue - poor memory management on the dev side. Who knows, though.
---
It's been easier just to jump server... Means I miss out on social xp though.
---
Found a fix though through the audio tab :)
---
Absolutely golden
---
I thought that when they remove them they usually inform people it's leaving, so I was sad to find it gone, too.   Hopefully it comes back soon.
---
Edit: just saw it's going to be [on sale Monday and Tuesday](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4RgOXIZbtqAdvRTL7bdHzE/atomic-shop-weekly-update-july-14-21).
---
Or you can spend the caps at other player‚Äôs vendors, break down the goods you received into junk, sell the junk to other players and get caps from them.
---
Circle of commerce.
---
You cant be that new if you grinded max rep already.
---
So that's where my goatee came from!
---
On top of the that theres bug where my Gat wont auto reload without me spamming the buttons. 
---
They just keep stacking!
---
Yes it does
---
People keep saying they‚Äôve fixed it but we get 10 or more posts everyday since saying it‚Äôs still happening. I‚Äôve lost since they fixed it so I gonna say my self that they didn‚Äôt fix it.
---
Still building my rep for the ammo machine. Can‚Äôt wait.
---
Sick thanks
---
I didnt think of that! Thank you. Its better knowing its all visual.
---
I put scrip fodder and useful legendaries up for sale, usually at a fixed 12-15 caps per scrip. I live a short jog away from a train station so I decided that if you need the 3 scrip from a 1* armor piece, here ya go, 45 caps. You see my 3* unyielding robot left leg for 400 caps and want it, congrats its yours.
---
Don't forget that you get enough Atoms for doing the run to skip the last 10 levels so you only really need to worry about getting to 90.
---
Wondering, isn‚Äôt the map four times bigger in 76? Isn‚Äôt there more to explore? Or at wasn‚Äôt there more to explore until the point you have done it all. The map can‚Äôt feel new for two years. More stories should help keep the map fresh. I wish they added new content like Wastelanders more frequently; but I imagine it‚Äôs expensive to do so.
---
I watched it a little while ago actually, but I got the impression from his video that it goes up to -33% only when there are other empaths on the team?
---
Again, unless I am missing something, it is still (slightly) inferior to Lone Wanderer unless you have other empaths on your team.  Hence my initial comment.  But would be happy to know if I've misunderstood anything!
---
I tried to run the silo for the 1st time in a year or so. I failed. Took almost 2 hours &amp; when I got to the end I had to log for server maintenance. So thanks to those who know what they are doing?
---
I have searched reddit for this exact info.  Thank you so much!
---
Getting hit will stop gat plas from reloading.   
---
Its annoying AF,  you learn to always walk backwards when reloading it.
---
It's no problem it's just that people can't agree which is best, personally I believe unyielding gives enough agility to where you're good to go, but if you're a high health you should definitely go Chameleon. Heck when a weightless set is good as a place holder while you fix your armor up.
---
You mean the duper loses nothing, but the legit player traded good gear for a cheated item that was rapidly losing value. I think you are the one only looking at this from one side.
---
At the very least, give people some time to tag the thing.  
---
Last time I was doing a Queen fight, I was running up to her with a Cryolater and she just got evaporated.  Like...goddamn, you couldn't give us 10 seconds?
---
I've been dreaming about farming power armor sets. I've been trying to get a t60 lvl 50 helmet for days. 
---
There are worse things to dream about but its a little mundane that I'm not then dreaming about *using the power armor*
---
PvP isn't skill based what so ever. So they play dirty and have specific gear for it. It's not really anything more than a waste of ammo and time. Just keep pacifist mode on and avoid toxic players. 
---
Legitimately the only times I've been in PvP is people griefing over workshops before I got 1st, and when I wanna test out a weapon on my friend who has really high damage resistance to see what kind of outputs I get.
---
Ohh i didnt see this, so your tellin me your fat? Ok nacho libre whatever helps with your online ego. Boy why would i give a fuck if i met u in real life, aint no man talm shit on reddit on roads. Bucket, tell yo auntie i dont go change for the 100 so she gone have to take it in the ass. Fawad to my ends tho
---
Because it makes our numbers look good and who knows, you might find that dude who runs with a hunting rifle and somehow ran out of .38.
---
Also I'm too lazy to put it into the ammo converter until the make the changes to it.
---
Going against the grain, I hate the contemporary. It too clean and nice. I like to build camps that look like they are part of the game and surrounding areas. Things that should be build. For example I built on the train tracks and have a train base. Pretty sure if you check my posts you can see it. Built around it i used dingy scrap metal as that seems easy enough to find and filled it with some boxes and other things. I'd say their is no best camp bundle and it really comes down to what you personally enjoy and want.everyone uses the contemporary house and I cant stand it. Some people may hate my train. The only camp bundle that I can tell you not to get with 100% certainty is the new bungalow camp prefab. That thing is just hot garbage.
---
And a great one at that.
---
I've not had a chance to properly test it myself under all circumstances, but combined with other gear such as bolstering armor or power armor and nerd rage, it's more than enough even with low health bloodied build!
---
You don‚Äôt store the junk in the workbench, it‚Äôs on your person or you put it in your stash.
---
Check your junk tab.
---
It's a mod that turns the plasma into a shotgun semi auto
---
Yes, unfortunately that is the case. Honestly though, once you get that mission, you are done with the enclave, its just a quest to get people to nuke fissure prime so that the queen comes out.
---
That worked! Had to go back and get another key, thanks!!
---
Everything you do (build) at a public workshop is lost when you log out. Not a workbench
---
I don't mean the junk, I mean the components you get from dismantling the junk
---
Oh no, I get it. Believe me. It's only recently that I learned to let that completionist thing go and just enjoy a game for what it is. And I'm absolutely not judging you or whatever, but I do think that telling yourself that you are being forced instead of acknowledging that you are forcing yourself, does make a difference. Psychologically speaking.
---
Y'know I'll probably get some hate for this, but personal opinion, I think New Vegas is very overrated and never understood why people seem to rate it so highly. Had alot more glitches and problems when I played that game than this one, and Appalachia is WAY more interesting than Vegas. Tried to go back to NV to replay recently and couldn't even do it. Fallout 3 is my favourite in the series!
---
Wrong thread reply or just questionable reading and comprehension skills?
---
It‚Äôs still junk, just weighs less.
---
Oh yea, you're right! Totally forgot about it...
---
Thanks folks
---
Nah
---
It's Nerf or nothin
---
That goes into your inventory, which you carry, until you deposit in a stash box
---
No, the one side is when people assume everyone who cheats is doing it to be evil.
---
Some people just want access to what is in the game but not legitimately attainable.
---
I'd die for a French manicure skin.
---
The only way to have every player level seeing the same enemy as the same challenge is to have a standardised scoring system, hence my 'effective oercentage' analogy. Of course that would have to be based around a complex framework that needs to encompass several variable - not just player level but likely base weapon damage, max weapon damage, temp)/perm bonuses...in essence a random player would start at say 50% and it would either up their effective danger, or on the flip side affect the taggers resistances.
---
Whatever the exact chosen method it'll need to be complex, most likey have a love/hate reaction as some win and others lose, and will be broken either by a bug or by some complex glitching.
---
Can't wait for the mess to start.üòÅ
---
Another thing I forgot to mention, shadowed works everywhere, even broad daylight because the skybox doesn't count as a light source, but be careful of turrets and light sources, light sources are like a death trap because if anything happens to be close to see you in one and it's instant detection.
---
Yep sorry, misread that.
---
You got some for dailies?
---
Fair, that‚Äôs what I figured. I‚Äôm thinking bloodied with PA will help with the stress part! Still gotta worry about rads though...
---
If your numbers look good on the map and I spend 10 caps to come to your camp looking for ammo only to find the useless calibres Im unlikely to buy anything from those vendors. And only pipe pistols take .38, hunting rifles take .308.
---
They did an automated search of people server hopping, repeatedly, over and over. They did not check weapon ids until people were flagged
---
 [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html) 
---
You do the math.
---
I don't doubt it is good!  If you're going to be on teams all the time, giving you the team bonus, other team perks and so on, might as well take it!  I'm just not convinced that it beats Lone Wanderer, without the right team.
---
Don't turn Vault Dweller into marketable figure!
---
Agreed. I had a BE handmade on my bloodied commando at one time, and after the first point you get really finished returns on the damage increase from demolition expert!
---
Yeah it might help. I‚Äôm not as in the know about bloodied builds. Word of warning tho, some bloodied perks like serendipity don‚Äôt work in power armor. That‚Äôs the reason I didn‚Äôt go for bloodied because I love PA in all of the games
---
In my opinion the exploration in 76 is better than any in the series, I find alot of Appalachia to be very interesting and think the map/location design is the best Bethesda has done - probably the best thing about the game as a whole. 
---
I kinda get what you're saying but Fallout 4 wasn't built as an online game that's supposed to be lived in for a long time, so of course you're visiting the same places in 76 because the game is meant to be played for an alot longer time period. You'd visit places in FO4 once because you'd have no reason to go back to them, you do in 76.
---
Ive ran out of plans to buy, including serums, a long time ago. At this point i can find enough stuff to buy and have to resort to buying ammo from players just to keep from capping. Ammo that i dont really need as i have 10K Lead in my Scrapbox and 6K 10mm and 556 on my character. At least i wont ever run out of ammo for my primary weapons.
---
With public teams and the experience boost from the builder team you should really be in public teams all the time now.
---
Nah, it's just a fancy countdown timer. My wife was panicking, thinking the same thing.
---
I used to get one constantly spawn by my camp in the bog, recently switched camp location and I've only seen one which was fighting a scorchbeast and sheepsquach
---
* Explosive (Greandes and Mines with Rocket Launcher/Fat man)
---
* Medic/Support Build (High CHA with various healing perks and focus on weakening enemies for allies to deal with)
---
* Stealth Assassin(sneaky melee with knife)
---
* Beserker Unarmed Build that used Booze (Drunken Monk)
---
* Scavenger (Endurance perks and perks that let you find more stuff)
---
I love how these stories always have a "Guy just kills me, idk how, I seek revenge" moment.
---
People  also seemed to appreciate when a friend and I dropped on Whitesprings yesterday. Plenty  of people  running around  smacking the Green Ghoulies. Lol.
---
From what I've read, seems they'll add extra dailies to make up for lost Score
---
That's interesting. In whitesprings on the south golf field is a bear cave that spawns one regularly. I know this because I built on top of the cave and they respawn frequently.
---
If I wouldn‚Äôt get banned from the subreddit for saying their names, I‚Äôd bring up a few I know of.
---
I‚Äôve sent in four tickets from lost score. Not a single response so far. They aren‚Äôt going to give us free stuff.
---
Tell me more
---
You came here asking for help, I offered a way to diagnose your problem, you acted like a petulant child.  Good luck with the rest.
---
this is FYI, actually there is. 
---
1) create Fallout76Custom.ini in Documents\My Games\Fallout 76
---
2) and add these lines,
---
[General] 
---
bSteamEnabled = 0
---
Yeah exploration is great in both, its just that I'm fallout 4 you had time to explore.
---
If you want to get everything in 76 and you're not blessed with loads of time.... You never get to just explore anymore.
---
I have a quad crossbow with the explosive mod that I explicitly aim at the legs and it launches things into the air when they die.
---
Before the last patch a group of giefers kept attacking my friend with tesla after a sbq fight so I zeroed in on their legs and launched them all into the air multiple times while chameleon. They had no idea what was going on and kept using tesla but couldn't find me. After a few kills they eventually found me but it was glorious seeing those Chad's go flying, especially the power armor guy.
---
They‚Äôd just make new accounts...
---
Ive only played about 30 hours collectively but ive seen a couple. I killed one yesterday and when it vanished I just kept shooting at where it disappeared and it came back into view and teleported behind me
---
I really want the asam a giant missile launcher would really tie my camp together.
---
Flare recipe /s
---
(I like it, it has a spot on my favorites wheel next to my flare gun. But just like my flare gun it serves no practical purpose)
---
played armored warfare for a while and realized someday, during my drive to the supermarket, that i was checking my field of view for red contacts, which would indicate enemy tanks...
---
You can give hardware bans and ID bans.
---
Good to know, I actually didn‚Äôt know about serendipity not working in PA, doesn‚Äôt say on the perk card
---
The first fifty levels are trial and error, especially if you didn't have a build planned out in advance. Do activities that award scrip and you can spend them at Mama's for good legendary weapons and armor. What perks do you have, what build do you prefer, and are you okay with using mutations? I might not be able to help you with reroll, depending on the build you prefer, but others might. I personally run heavy armor rifle build with certain mutations to help that build plus some medic on the side.
---
Which means it‚Äôs not a 100% fix. 
---
*‚ÄôOur data show that this fix has addressed the* **vast majority of instances of this bug**, *and we are pursuing* **a more complete fix** *in the next few days.*‚Äô
---
They‚Äôve made progress. They haven‚Äôt confirmed it is fixed yet. 
---
Until the glitch is completely eliminated, this is just an improvement, and of course a welcome one.
---
where did you heard that?
---
Not the game I‚Äôm thinking of but it did pull something close to that
---
My Seszchuan-SCORE Rick Sanchez character now uses this for his garage. Easily moves from resource node to resource node as needed. Currently getting set up on the lead/acid location. Garage can't fit though :(
---
I thought it was changed , daamm thanks for the heads up
---
I've found that I can scrap and rebuild the Ally station, and they'll come... but if I just enter the game, they're never there. Not even at the bottom of the mountain.   
---
Oh, well. It's not like I get any predators there. But some company'd be nice.
---
I don't like preparing haha. Feels like a chore in a game of chores. I just go out there and play and do quests and eat meat off the bodies haha. There is always glowing meat around.
---
Haven't but I was just wondering, I keep on getting dumb legendaries, haha.
---
ah, yes, power armor... one day i was outside on campus, heard a woman screaming nearby and felt my thumb twitching towards the space bar to trigger the jet pack to jump on the roof to get a better view... well... :D
---
So, what you are saying is if you want something it is OK to break all the rules and cheat people to get it, even when it is something you don't really need.
---
I would recommend bringing a ton of ammo, as without guns that have some kick, you will be chewing whatever you brought.
---
Also, be on the lookout for mirelurk as they will screw you up.  Everything there is high leveled so focus on staying alive.
---
The fact that it wasn't a plan infuriates me honestly. Like it dropped on all my non PA toons, but not my PA one.
---
I agree with you, Fallout 3 is my favourite in the series, and I tend to agree that NV is overrated. Just couldnt get on with the whole wild west type vibe it had, or the gameworld outside of new vegas itself.
---
It‚Äôs because the community allows them to. Mods have carried their games with Unofficial patches etc but now it‚Äôs just them
---
Explosives are slightly less common, that is if you don't include grenades. If you do include grenades, explosives are by far the most common weapon. 
---
Let's not include grenades, having a tiny advantage in the first minute or two doesn't make ARs dominate the game mode. What other advantage do ARs have over explosives? I wrote a full guide on how you can dominate with explosives with little to no effort. Make your case for why ARs dominate NW.
---
The current fix has been pretty recent. And they aren‚Äôt claiming it‚Äôs a 100% fix, but it has been improved. 
---
‚ÄôOur data show that this fix has addressed the vast *majority of instances of this bug*, and we are pursuing a *more complete fix* in the next few days.‚Äô
---
They‚Äôve made progress. They haven‚Äôt confirmed it is completely fixed yet.  Anyone presenting it otherwise isn‚Äôt reading or understanding that passage I quoted.
---
It ends the 20th I think and I‚Äôve lost 2 days worth of that score also.
---
There are usually plenty of Mothman eggs at the marked locations where the cultists have taken over.
---
I have a punch bowl full of Vintage Nuka-Shine next to my vendor bot.
---
To be fair there's a LOT in this game you don't need.
---
Also it's a video game so even more so.
---
Kinda funny watching people get so triggered from fucking software.
---
I like this. Thanks for the laugh.
---
Did the math. It turns out I‚Äôm still correct kek.
---
Wheres that ego tho, is auntie really a trick or did mummy take a couple too many double shifts and left his baby boy @ home wit the scary uncle? Also are you the broke back mountain kinda cowboy or the kind that hates blacks with his friends but loves watchin his girl get railed by them? Or none of the above and u fuck cows? Werent you gonna come fuck me up big guy?
---
I get that. But I‚Äôve lost score two days in a row now. Doesn‚Äôt seem very fixed from my perspective. I‚Äôm seeing just as many posts about too.
---
The most annoying bug currently (other than quests being really slow to update) is that sometimes VATS just...doesn't work. Otherwise, it's in a pretty good state. 
---
Most of the complaints you see is due to the game time over game experience approach that the devs are taking for the end game.
---
Snitches get stitches
---
DAMN IT! I have made changes to my stop and shop a few times and I keep accidently putting it backwards. Thanks for pointing it out so I can fix it.
---
No. Occam‚Äôs razor. The best solution to the problem is the simplest one. You have a problem with being at the cap currency limit and losing excess currency. Rather create an escrow feature that could potentially bug out and lose you currency or be exploited by players to somehow dupe currency (Because when has a new feature not bugged out or get exploited?), you could just spend your caps, reinvest in the player economy and continue business as usual.
---
You're probably not going to be able to loot the queen, as you won't do enough damage.  I think you'll still get the event rewards, though.  What level are you?
---
Energy weapons go against ER. If an enemy has low ER, energy weapons are more effective. 
---
There is a perk called Awareness that will let you see an enemies specific DR/ER. However, with time and experience (or some research online) you‚Äôll come to know which is higher/lower for the enemies.
---
No I mean just yesterday a CM said they would continue adding extra dailies to make up for this in the future 
---
It was in reply to some random comment though so nothing actually detailed
---
Edit...spelling error...story, not atory :)
---
Ghoul bear pretty common in whitesprings bear cave. I might be predisposed to seeing them more often because I live on top of the cave (I put a mothman hanging, a campfire, and a radio in there for him)
---
For me it's been the flatwoods monster. I've only fought one, nowhere near its namesake, it was mythical or fabled, don't remember :( I was less than 15 hours into the game at that point, didn't expect it, but it was a fairly easy fight as it was in its 20s I think. Fwiw I had just seen (or not seen rather) my first mothman, it was in the dark and out of the corner of my eye I saw a puff of smoke, didn't even notice it watching me as I had just AFK'd there. 2 cryptids back to back, pretty happy about that.
---
I've been assaulted too many times by Vengeful mothman while on low level toons, just ran away from them :-/
---
Vendor at Pleasant Valley has one
---
I'd like to second this. As a freshly hit 50, I just figured out how to trigger the enclave questline to even drop nukes. I wouldn't be able to fight her if it wasn't for everyone else's contributions.
---
Yeah its from the game pass, I've just tried to launch it again today, but its still not worked. I will reinstall it later
---
I dont even check vendors anymore...
---
No worries. Thanks for the apology tho, but I didn‚Äôt take it the wrong way. All good
---
The flesh feels most excellent.
---
The reply was saying they would add an extra daily to make up for the missed extra yesterday (since we only had 8 not the promised 9)
---
Edit, not sure if they will add more than that. But the comment was on my post lol so I remember it pretty well
---
From your perspective, sure. And as I said, anyone presenting the hot fix as a complete fix is wrong. 
---
It‚Äôs unfortunate you‚Äôre still encountering the issue. Hopefully you‚Äôll still be able to make reasonable progress with the added Daily Challenges and the Double SCORE event, along with other improvements they may make.
---
Go to events!
---
Imposter sheepsquatch will give you loads of people to revive, SBQ , line in the sand, radiation rumble
---
Pretty much most high level events that have mobs will have people die ..
---
Heart or the swamp is also a good one
---
I agree. I do wish it scratched that ‚Äúpermanence‚Äù itch more tho, I‚Äôm addition to the two you listed. 76 does lots of things very well but the way it all disappears and reappears when you log kinda dampens the other ‚Äúimmersion‚Äù features for me. 
---
Ex: someone‚Äôs in my camp shopping, I have to reconsider logging
---
Or
---
Ex: I meet one of my neighbors, and I have to remember they‚Äôll be gone in minutes, never to be seen again. No reason to memorize that their base is up the road from mine.
---
Don't forget the roof, I made a pretty nice Becket's bar there
---
If you go through Morgantown airport, there‚Äôs a small back pack plan inside an overseers cache. It can hold you over until you‚Äôre able to get the standard pack. 
---
Just in case you didn‚Äôt know :)
---
Well if it does continue till a true fix is put in place. That‚Äôs something at least. Gives me a chance rather then monotonous grinding for the repeatable. Hitting the 10000 repeatable when double xp isn‚Äôt going is not enjoyable.
---
Don't collectrons fight off scorched and things that show up?
---
Yeah. I knew that. I guess I just misunderstood how he said it and thought he meant energy weapons go through armor. 
---
It was a Rifle Gaming vid and he was talking about legacy weapon and he said the explosive effect coupled with the Gatling plasma energy melts through heavily armored enemies.
---
I‚Äôm trying to find good semi-educational YouTube vids on FO76 but most of the people I find is about builds (I‚Äôm mainly looking for weapon ins and outs)
---
I'll log on in a few if you need it.  My name is the same as here.
---
And they‚Äôve said they are considering extending the extra daily challenges past or after July 20 as well.
---
They did. They just can‚Äôt fix things in any sort of timely manner.
---
I respect your opinion but disagree. Starting this game from scratch you can completely take your time and play it like any other solo fallout game and get the same exploration experience. Aside from certain events that don't effect exploration there is nothing time gated that effects the game any differently than other Fallout games I don't think.
---
I get your point after the fact of exploration when you've discovered everywhere and doing the same mind numbing dailies and stuff, but starting the game from fresh and just roaming the map is the best exploration experience I've had in a Fallout game.
---
The dupers were so "triggered" and salty that they started a petition. If you don't like the rules of the game, go play a different game.
---
To deal big damage with the Handmade or almost every assault rifle as well as every heavy guns requires aim, while grenade launcher only need you to shoot in the enemies direction. You can also try to find cover if you get shoot with anything but explosives. 
---
____
---
It would be a good idea making the Gauss shotgun a Gold and the m79 grenade launcher a purple weapon. 
---
I never had problems with the Gauss shotgun, since most people only trust in the explosive damage. But direct hits deal significant damage but it's technically a smaller DPS then the one of the combat shotgun.
---
___ 
---
take an updood for participating in this discussion buddy
---
Have you asked for Atoms since they can‚Äôt award SCORE?
---
Right, let me just conjure up a vending machine from another player instantly within the 30 seconds it takes for someone to buy stuff from my vending machines and put me over the cap if I sell more than a few items at once.
---
I'm just gonna interrupt everything I'm doing to instant transmission and spend my caps because we shouldn't change existing mechanics out of fear an eViL dUpEr finds a way to abuse it for the thousandth time.
---
And how do I know I'm reinvesting those caps into the economy, I might be buying something and boom I just put that guy into max caps territory and half my spending vanished. A++ idea mate
---
They have had months to fix this. They chose to do it after the season was put out. That is 100% on Bethesda.
---
Rifle can be a bit vague sometimes in his details. Usually he has good info. 
---
For strong details on game mechanics, check out Angry Turtle. He does in-depth analyses.
---
The protectrons in whitespring
---
They could port the Robot Workbench over from Automatron into 76. Label it as an "Ally" CAMP object just like the ones that already exist in the game now. Let us literally create our own allies.
---
I‚Äôm playing fallout76 right now and it says that the severs will be shut down for a update, hope they can fix this bug lol
---
Ah ok. Thanks! I‚Äôll check him out.
---
Those aren't pvp players, a pvp players would have engaged until they ran out of ammo or stims
---
Thanks for the clarification, I play Melee so the only ammo I care about is for my back up shotgun.
---
I know it's a scummy tactic but it pulls people to my camp to buy the smaller amounts of the more popular ammo that I put up. Like not many people are going to come to the camp selling 5,000 ammo even if it's mostly 5.56, .45, 2mm, and some others, but people will come to the camp selling 20,000 ammo. 
---
I'll probably convert most of that ammo later when they update the ammo converter.
---
If Bethesda posted a 'It's Fixed' notification can you link to it because I haven't seen one anywhere, only the ones effectly saying 'we are still working on it'.
---
If it's at a workshop though how do you know the player owning it did the glitch? What if a different player did it and the owner simply claimed it and discovered there are ammunition factories at it? Just speculation cause I saw an unowned workshop with a couple of the things at them.
---
It was, now its about spamming colas.
---
Where am I debating this at all?
---
My comment was specifically about whether to call it a full fix or partial fix. 
---
I‚Äôm not interested in a gripe-fest. I‚Äôm simply interested in future fixes and improvements. 
---
Have a good day.
---
Watch juiceheads video I‚Äôm not doing your research for you
---
They haven‚Äôt responded to any ticket since the first one. I send them in with a picture each time it happens and that‚Äôs all. They have never once sent a response asking for any more details or saying they would do any thing. Even the first response seemed to be an automated message.
---
Search for bloodied build on Google, use bloodied weapons, Unyielding armor, adrenal reaction mutation, nerd rage perk... cmon, dont be so lazy
---
Thank you but sadly I‚Äôm on Xbox and low on caps since I needed to buy the herbivore serum for xp on my second character lol. I will just keep playing the vendor hop lottery.
---
Lol, this is the first I'm hearing of a petition.
---
But like all petitions chances are high it was started and signed by whiny bitches.
---
I can agree if the Nuke Grenade is always a clean one hit, singe it's litterally the holy hand grenade of this game lol, but even Pumpkin grenades are often one hits. 
---
___
---
Plasma, Cryo and Impulse Grenades are more or less fine since its the damage over time that ends you. I think you can lower the damage by 30% but make this damage over time effect like 2 seconds longer, to put preasure on your foe, other then obliberate him lol
---
I replied to the wrong thread like a dumbass
---
If it‚Äôs still happening it‚Äôs not fixed. Just because the hole in your roof is smaller doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not going to leak.
---
Too bad you weren't banned as well.
---
Even more relatable than your daily Settlers quest being so bugged that you never actually have to do it and only have to turn it in but can't skip the dialogue because Ward will gently break and you have to do the dialogue again so you can get rep?
---
What the fuck that sounds like a good way to get ribeye steaks fast
---
I'm not sure you read the post, I'm puzzled at how broken the damage is after witnessing a dude melting SBQ in 3 seconds.
---
might as well die in water in case they want to do swimming
---
Nah a group of ferals carrying you like a king
---
Kind of like those people that whine because they don't legacy items. =(
---
Lol he didn't ask how to make one, he even said he made one himself. He was asking why Bethesda thought it balanced to have a build so crazy op in game
---
Read the whole post man. Cmon, don't be so lazy XD
---
I see you already got an answer, but I wanted to add that the different barrel attachments make this gun almost useless unless it is legacy like mentioned. The vapor attachment makes normal flamer essentially melee range.
---
I was told otherwise a few days ago
---
Someone had the dope idea to cook the grenade (hold it to make the timer until explosion shorter.
---
Hehe, I suppose that was a disappointing moment.
---
That was the plan üòÄ
---
Are you sure he was bloodied and not just using a magic weapon?
---
So that's a no then.
---
Just go and shoot. That‚Äôs it. You‚Äôre probably going to die. Wear power armor or some hazmat suit as you most likely will respawn inside nuke zone. If you have a gun with fast fire rate it‚Äôs probably your best option. Don‚Äôt bring a fat man or missile launcher as they‚Äôre more of a distraction than anything. Focus on the queen as you‚Äôll probably need to hit as much as you can to get loot. Also, it‚Äôs ok to die as you don‚Äôt lose your junk during the event, but as soon as you see it‚Äôs over stash what you got. A group of enemies spawn after she dies and it‚Äôs easy to get killed if you‚Äôre not paying attention.
---
Hopefully!
---
There's a lot to explore, but once you hit the end game there's only a few areas "worth" visiting due to the spawn levels.
---
Also i can confitm the faster swing speed is a fucking perk mate just accept the fact you got owned
---
Wow, did you just have a stroke?
---
Sweet thanks mate I didn't know the exact reset time for Smiley as I usually buy gold on Sundays.
---
The disadvantage is you can get one shot by a glowing cricket if he sneaks up on you
---
I hear people say yes, when I try it, it doesn‚Äôt.
---
So I say no, for me on PS4, none of the perks or mutations work when i‚Äôm solo in a public team
---
With shotguns just use VATs. You will one shot nearly anything. I don‚Äôt have any Perception but use VATs with my shotguns on my toon when I was leveling up yesterday. Went from a 6 to 28 in two hours just running ws with a shotgun and VATs
---
Both companies have said that xbox and ps4 games would work on the new consoles. Also pc works on any computer no matter the parts so it can't be that hard to release a patch that would make the conosle versions work on the new consoles
---
My fault üòÇ. Well, that guy probably uses a magic weapon (angry turtle has a nice guide). Also, dmg output its big, but not everyone manage to play that way. Instead nerfing bloodied, they could boost other legendary effects
---
To be fair, how else are legitimate players going to get their hands on items like that if it wasn‚Äôt for dupers? You think the dozens of legitimate ones would be up for grabs if they were only obtainable through RNG? Yea you can say they crashed the value. Good! Now they‚Äôre affordable and everyone can have a chance to get a decent item since they now have an achievable value.
---
Hows the gunslinger? I would like to build one next.
---
If the roof leaks *less* than before that‚Äôs a **partial fix**.  
---
If a wound has been staunched and the bleeding has subsided that‚Äôs ‚Äòpartial healing‚Äô. 
---
If the radio signal is clear enough to hear words but still has some static, compared to nothing but white noise, that‚Äôs a *partial signal increase.*
---
Should it still be happening?  No. And nowhere did I say it should or excuse Bethesda for not addressing it sooner.
---
It‚Äôs not a complete fix. It s a partial fix. 
---
If there were 20 subroot causes and they eliminated any number of them from 1-19, that‚Äôs a partial fix.
---
You‚Äôre debating with faulty semantics.
---
üòÇüòÇ agreed with the last part
---
The person I have to dip out on,  I always feel terrible :/
---
Camps should have nuclear deterrents today prevent ppl attacking them
---
I don‚Äôt keep enough bullets to do both the silo and the beast. So yes, thank you
---
I'm assuming that's a jab at me.
---
But it's not a very good one since I didn't whine about it.
---
I got them, regardless of what whiny bitches would think I did what was necessary to squeeze the last possible ounce of value out of the game.
---
I'm just here so the echo chamber of "dupers bad" knows there's at least one legitimate reason to do it.
---
Hmmm have u not done the Queen recently or line at the asylum. Can‚Äôt hear yourself think for exploding plasmas lol
---
Correct. You used to be able to eat anything that was scorched as well, including the SBQ. I assume because it is scorched that it is cooked...?
---
No it‚Äôs not because the problem is the leak. If it‚Äôs still leaking it isn‚Äôt fixed.
---
Also, is bugged, I made like 10 meals for nothing...
---
I ran all three in one sitting (solo, always solo) yesterday for the first time. THAT was fun! :D
---
I'm gonna assume they'll put it atoms between the end of season 1 and the start of season 2
---
That‚Äôs true. I just wonder how the hours compare to an older entry in the fallout series. For example, I think I spent 100ish hours in F4 before I ‚Äúbeat‚Äù the game with the Institute. Then Far Harbor came out and I did another 20 hours or so. 
---
So far I‚Äôve over 400 hours in 76, and just now feel like I‚Äôve ‚Äúbeat‚Äù the game. Still haven‚Äôt soloed the queen or Colossus, however.
---
Thank you!!
---
Thabk you forbthe ibfo!
---
Drove by a lake the other day and caught myself looking for mirelurks in it
---
If you drop your health to 19%, use the Nerd Rage 3 perk card, and Adrenal Reaction you‚Äôre going to get much better damage out of that 2 shot Minigun.  Fortunately, the ammo is cheap to make (compared to other ammos) and is almost weightless.
---
You are lucky dude
---
bethesda thought bloodied would be high risk high reward since you have to have such low health but I honestly can't remember the last time something killed me that wasn't myself, I have the damage reduction perks, max ironclad, almost full UNY on the secret service armor, I'm literally unkillable and I see how you could say it's not fun to have no risk but I just love going around melting anything and everything and never die, because it isn't *quite* cheating, if I had a god mode glitch it wouldn't be fun, but having god mode because the game let's you? it entertains me
---
I just started launching nukes again. I‚Äôm not doing them in 10 minutes but it‚Äôs a win win since I‚Äôll take the lead from the robots I kill. Always check the players in the world though, I‚Äôm not OP enough to kill the SBQ on my own.
---
Nice
---
It‚Äôs was at a camp, not a workshop.
---
you clearly need the blocker perk
---
need more context because yes it works. Did you have a workshop?
---
Agree. My camp is getting too damn loud
---
Why should i put pacifist mode on ?
---
Just because i dont go round griefing for PvP.
---
Dont mean i wont have a go if someone attacks me.
---
There are many players like me,
---
Someone literally did this yesterday and it irked me. Like I understand the flux but I have missions to do in there.
---
Yeah, I understand and support the glass cannon concept. But why such an insane boost to damage compared to non-bloodied builds? Why is it possible to melt a SBQ in 2 seconds? I would understand if bloodied builds did like double the damage of other builds, but insead of a geometrical boost, it's practically exponential.
---
Tried it on Xbox
---
Did not work sadly
---
Cool cool. Thanks!
---
That's just the nature of minmaxers, they find the best way to abuse the game because that's what they find fun. You are not wrong if you find this unfun, it's just that you find your fun somewhere else. Your satisfaction might come from winning a hard fight by the skin of your teeth, theirs comes from ending that fight before it even began. 
---
Personally I use a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet when I'm exploring as I want to experience the ambience of the world and not spend too much time fighting. I even run wasteland whisperer and animal friend so that I can avoid fighting sometimes.
---
Home defense lvl5 should also let us build those beefy red missile turrets you find at the firebases in the bog.
---
What I would give for 1 or 2 of those..
---
Lately he has been glitching and not resetting. Happened to one of my characters last week. Bethesda said they were investigating it last I looked into it.
---
Yeah, that's super presumptive. Not every endgame player with powerful weapons is a dick. Kthx.
---
Duper gets the pooper scooper.
---
That is debatable lol i never get anything exciting from imposter or queen EVER ;_;
---
This vv
---
His Camp was totally trashed. :-)
---
The logic of these griefers is hilarious.
---
I did have a workshop captured, does that completely remove the protection, even if they aren't contesting the workshop?
---
Good map, is it updated?
---
Because some spawn points have changed since wastelanders
---
how the hell do you get that many caps
---
Got the same problem.
---
I cant replace a item so i build my camp New.
---
After 3 hours of work my camp dont Show on the map :(
---
If you avoid workshops. Mostly yes
---
You‚Äôre dealing with the word an absolute. I‚Äôm not. That‚Äôs why I have said ‚Äòpartially‚Äô. Show me where I said ‚Äòit‚Äôs been fixed‚Äô. 
---
A 100 milliliter glass with 80 milliliters of water is not full. It is **partially full*. It is also *partially empty*. 
---
Stating that it is either ‚Äòfull‚Äô or ‚Äòempty‚Äô is incorrect.
---
Nice! That‚Äôs where I found the guy being chased by the chicken.
---
If you're on PS4 I'd gladly buy it
---
Haha bloodied build go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrtt. 
---
Joke aside it balances extremely low health for extremely high dps, but with solid perks for much better survivability. Stealth just amplifies it. I enjoy  playing stealthy type characters in other mmorpgs so naturally this fit the bill for me. High damage per shot makes ammo consumption less of a hassle, rarely need to repair my armor and only need a small handful of diluted stimpacks for sticky situations. Makes the game easier, yea, but thats part the reason I do it; I use that character to farm/buy/trade for items for other characters that rely more heavily on certain gear other than some random unyielding pieces and a 1 star bloodies handmade.
---
Highly doubt it. They won't be giving away "free" atoms anymore that easily now that they got what they wished for without an public outrage. I hope they do! But i doubt it. Also, someone would have posted about it already if that were the case as there are rank 100 people around already.
---
r/ihadastroke
---
Well, you summed it up, the game literally lets you have god mode. Why is that a thing? I understand you enjoy it, why wouldn't you? I just can't wrap my head around Bethesda looking at this and thinking "yeah, that's fine".
---
appreciate everybody about to go farming for stuff to scrap
---
Yes, it basically opens you up to PVP.
---
Pacifist just means you can‚Äôt accidentally trigger PVP with another person (in other words they can‚Äôt intentionally run in front of you to start PVP), but if you start a PVP action like take a workshop you are open to PVP
---
The melting of SBQ is not natural, the person who did that rather has magic weapons or some grazy legacies +buffs he might be using, if on PC its potential that it's a hack, I play on ps4 and I never seen a single person alone melt the SBQ, I have seen a couple of people bring her health down pretty fast tho
---
I‚Äôm also working through power armour plans as don‚Äôt know what to spend caps on otherwise.  We need some new items for cap purchases
---
Yes it does. Either you were on a workshop ground, had a bounty, played the Event Monster Mash or you were in the Hunter/Hunted Event Quest.
---
Pvp can still be activated via aoe mutations if you have pacifist off. I was afk vending on my melee toon last week and some fool broke into my house and murdered me while I was afk and he also destroyed my house. I had gotten back right when it happened but there was nothing I could do at that point. I know the risks of owning the mutations but didn't think someone would go through the lengths of actually picking a lv 3 lock to kill an afk player, sleeping nonetheless.
---
as the messenger always counts for savage divide. interesting. 
---
tks for the heads up. being skipping those.
---
You can click the claim workshop button from anywhere in workshop space to initiate pvp ot make a claim on it. 
---
Dont even need to click the workshop bench.
---
Pacifist only stops you from doing damage to other players. It does not stop PvP from activating in normal circumstances, like when entering a workshop. I've no idea if you need to contest it or not to enter PvP as I don't do workshops, but from everything I've read on here and elsewhere, this is most likely why he was able to engage you.
---
It's more the synergy the build has with gear, perks, and mutations. At 19% hp bloodied is only an 80% boost by itself. Not so giant of a difference right? But throw in adrenal reaction, there's another 50% boost. Then nerd rage is another 20%. That brings your total up to 150%. Not to mention the boosts from uny if you use melee, and all the other bonuses it has
---
But if you just look at the 80% boost compared to junkies 50% boost the numbers arnt that bad haha
---
FYI I have actually already seen JuiceHeads Sat 18th video and I suggest you watch again more closely. At c3mins he clear states that Bethesda has "...addressed several of these issues..."
---
What he Does Not say is that Bethesda has Fixed the issue completely, and the onscreen text from Beth's post confirms this, only that they have made progress.
---
Yes they are.
---
I literally made a post yesterday about making free Fixers for low level players on Sunday but I didn't see any of y'all giving props then.
---
If it was literally 3 seconds.. Or at least very quickly they were likely using a bugged weapon and it didn't have much to do with the bloodied build. People can and do take out the Queen in under a minute legitimately, but it requires stealth bonuses which you can't really get on a public server and really good RNG behavior from the Queen .
---
As a melee player this hits too close to home, I become overencumbered and look at my pipboy.
---
70 40mm grenades
---
10 mininukes
---
25 missiles 
---
1000 gunpowder
---
I'm like that's where all my carry weight went.
---
"But I had '*' hotkeyed to my push-to-talk!!! I was chatting with my friends and accidentally deleted all the legacies that I duped!!!! WAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!"
---
Ah, curse the daily SCORE quest for making me use them.
---
Personally I like having a reason to login every day and things to do. But also I dislike how it‚Äôs turned into a job more or less. Like I feel like I need to grind as much as possible this weekend just to catch up because I was on vacation last weekend.
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YBhLUia9uf-gkuFZD0koAY4M0DuHFC0FMqPkM6R13io/edit#gid=0 I have been using this spreadsheet some cool dude made
---
Not having to craft and scrap 20 light sources is its own reward.
---
You‚Äôve put into words what I couldn‚Äôt when arguing with someone who didn‚Äôt understand my point at all
---
makes sense. 
---
What about bows?
---
They added archery perks so go play skyrim as yet anther stealth archer.
---
Could be someone transferring caps between different accounts (buy something dumb that is expensive that will always be there waiting).  Sure you lose a slice of the caps, but it if you really want to mule some caps that would be how.
---
Here is another doc, but idk if it is up to date considering the increase in challenges for a couple days. But it can give you an idea of how much xp you should be grinding each day https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/score.html?
---
surprised they haven't nerfed it. or at least buffed everything else, I'd love to do a naked berserker build but the damage isn't even close to bloodied, I feel like berserkers should do so much more damage considering you have to have such low/no resistances for it to buff you. same with junkies, it's the only rival to bloodied but still is worse than bloodied, also nocturnal? absolutely useless, I think every legendary prefix should be re worked and/or buffed. there isn't a rival to bloodied and junkies, if you arent one of those two you simply arent going to be as good as everyone else. that is literally it, you *WILL NOT compare to everyone else's damage output if you arent playing the meta* and it is annoying as I want to try new things but what's the point if I can just go bloodied and kill everything in the game you know?
---
If you have issues with someone damaging you in PvP to the point where you complain about it online, then enabling Pacifist is a viable option.
---
If both parties have Pacifist disabled, it takes both of them to engage in PvP (other than Wanted or Workshop scenarios). 
---
Therefore, it‚Äôs not griefing.
---
I'm lvl 27 or 28. I just wanted to see what it was like.
---
The Gauss rifle isn‚Äôt generally a close quarters weapon.  Try a non legendary Fixer and stealth for those ghouls.
---
I just claim it, then leave the server

I always wonder why people afk, I always log out when I have to take care of something.  I mean sure some people have tons of saved up food, but I don't want to have to eat 15 boxes of cereal or 6 tins of Cram to get my food back up.  Plus I get a new world with new camps to visit when I log back in.
---
 It is funny to go from 10k caps to 28k from one person just buying out your machines, I always rush back to my base just to shut them off as I have them on a separate power switch.  I have only lost around 10k caps one time as I had a rush of sales while I was completing the Last Wastelanders quest, and due to how long it takes I cringed each time I saw my caps go from MAX to +x then back to MAX.
---
The key phrase there is ‚Äòyou have pacifist off‚Äô.  
---
Turn it on and there‚Äôs not an issue.
---
Only time i've knowingly put someone over max caps was when purchasing the croc backpack plan - she had fast traveled to her camp and somewhat urgently said "i'm at max caps, i'm at max caps" just as i purchased it.
---
I felt kinda bad about it, i was going to drop some stuff as a sorry but for obvious reasons she disconnected before people could buy more stuff.
---
There have been numerous times i've purchased something expensive and was like "countdown to disconnect in..." and sure enough 9/10 times they're gone in seconds xD
---
Yeah, minute is okay, I wouldn't be here asking questions if it was a minute. But dude, she literally disappeared. I'm using an AAE lever, I had time to fire literally 2 shots (not an exaggeration).

---
Also, Juicehead didn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs completely fixed. He essentially just read this same article I shared. 
---
It‚Äôs been improved. It hasn‚Äôt been completely fixed.
---
Right. I guess my comment was directed towards the other commenters mentioning workshops. I did read a post yesterday about how a newer player accidentally added a random to his private team and the guy had built one of these machines at op's camp and op was unable to remove it. So there's that too... I'm just saying some of these people don't hesitate with that report button. Hopefully Beth figures out a way to fix this glitch as well.
---
Before the recent dupe wave, you could trade high-end weapons for legacy items, but now I don't think that is much of an option anymore considering how much these high-end weapons were duped. Right now people seem to be mostly trading duped legacy for duped legacy, so I have doubts about many of you claims. Regardless, though, just because you want one of these legacy items (which really are not that good) is not an excuse to go dupe. There was no legitimate reason to dupe, and we all knew it was against the rules.
---
I doubt it will give you anything
---
Hell no.
---
Every time I do that someone steals my camp space.  
---
Not falling for that again.   You will just have to hunt around for one besides thats half the fun in finding a good location.
---
Exactly. You listened to what he actually said instead of only hearing what you wanted to hear. 
---
It would be nice if everyone did that.
---
Definitely a bugged weapon then
---
You‚Äôre out of context. If I paid you to fix a door in my house and you only fixed half of it than would you be paid in full? No because it isn‚Äôt fixed. It‚Äôs still broken and not working as it is intended. It‚Äôs the same thing of paying Bethesda and having a pts where they told them for months shit was broken and they waited until after the season was out to fix it. That‚Äôs sloppy work. It‚Äôs been like this since beta.
---
Ok..so other than being a smart ass, do you have a useful contribution?
---
YouTube is the best. :)
---
Are you ok
---
Give me nuke cards, I'll run them all day. I need the robot kills
---
yes, until patch 21. Just got the halloween costume today
---
It is a holdover glitch from Fo4 that's never been patched out. If you buff your jump ability enough you'll "snag" in the air on the way down.
---
I'm melee so cards are a challenge to get. I have 3 left
---
It might have been a magic weapon, I honestly didn't have enough time to check the dude out, I was disappointed after all the work for the nuke not to get any loot. I take it this is a bug?
---
Sure.  Do Operation Tidy on your way up there.    Its super quick and easy and will pay for your ride plus a chance at possom badge.
---
Also Heart of The Enemy and Bivs daily works too.
---
That's me! Feel free to hop on with me when I'm running, just please don't use a glitched gun that takes away my tag (PSN: ComradePrime)
---
Because you don't have fallout 1st?
---
Try playing mutation free, using no perks to mitigate radiation or give unique abilities like underwater breathing and just rely on armors and PA for resistances. Or try a nocturnal stealth build, that's what I'm using right now, it's not crazy OP but it's fun to mess around at camp during the day and then go cause mischief at night.
---
Right. It really is as simple as that.
---
1. Open settings and select game
---
2. Turn on pacifist mode
---
3. Profit
---
Only if it believes it is a cow
---
I only listen to cheaters excuses in game.  So if you banned I won‚Äôt hear your cries.
---
It takes like 3 minutes max to find ingredients if you go to the mire.
---
I'm on Xbox. Thanks for the offer.
---
I cRaFtEd 20 liGhT SoUrCeS 
---
Im HeLpInG.
---
Otherwise you spend a lot looking for youtube videos or fallout 76 wiki to know where to start
---
No problem :D
---
He possibly does it on purpose. I do it just to not waste good items. I don‚Äôt need anymore armor or weapons, so anything trash goes to scrip, anything else is just a caps sink for players. I actually put some items in for 30k just for shits and giggles and the same dude bought all of them in one go lol. I couldn‚Äôt have spent 90k in a day but I‚Äôm glad I actually got rid of 100lbs or so after hoarding them for a year. Normally everything is 300 caps, doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs a god unyielding or bloodied. But I had to try 30k once. Sold in like 30 minutes.
---
Jeez calm it i was just asking for some help
---
Is problem of the seller, you should know what you got on sale and your caps
---
Also I always find ammo at 1c, what do you mean by below 3? And I also sell all ammo at 1c
---
You don't have to do it.
---
Also, plant some crops at your camp.  It took me 2 minutes to do this one, it was the first one I did.
---
Just in case you don't know. Turning the power off just takes the icon off the map. People can still buy from them.
---
It‚Äôs not out of context. Your cited example is a limited situation that has a clear ‚Äòtrue/false‚Äô condition.  Either the door works *exactly* as intended or it doesn‚Äôt.
---
And yet, you said ‚Äòfixed half of it‚Äô. Indicating that even in the example you tried to give, it is half-fixed. Perhaps there were two subroot causes here; the door wouldn‚Äôt lock because the mechanism was jammed and it wouldn‚Äôt close properly because it was off-plumb. The repairman fixed the plumb issue but needs to go get a replacement lock. 
---
The door is partially fixed. One of the two subroot causes has been rectified. The door will now close, but it can‚Äôt be locked. 
---
**Partial fix**. Job isn‚Äôt done. And I never said Bethesda‚Äôs job on this wasn‚Äôt done.
---
Have they? I know they added events to each category but I know nothing about if they moved/deleted/added any locations. I just pulled the map from the Mappalachia wiki page.
---
I get where you‚Äôre coming from on this. I love 76, but it definitely feels like it‚Äôs missing some of the charm and even mechanics of the older games. I just started a new FO3 play through for the first time in years. Sure, it‚Äôs clunky compared to the newer games but everything just feels so...thoughtfully built. There are a lot of things that 76 could adopt from FO3 that would be huge improvements. 
---
I love that so many things happen or exist and have no quest markers. It‚Äôs either drop what you‚Äôre doing and do it/explore it now, or risk never finding it again. It makes subsequent plays more interesting, as you find things you missed the first time. 76 sticks a quest marker on everything, it feels desperate for you not to miss things.
---
I love the edgier dialogue options in 3. Sure, Wastelanders has some‚Äîyou can be a real dick to Ra-Ra, and WL as a whole has better dialogue than FO4‚Äîbut FO3 goes much further. I like this because It gives the world a more lawless feel. It makes my choosing to be friendly or helpful feel meaningful, not just like I‚Äôm clicking ‚ÄúAccept quest‚Äù. 
---
I miss the randomness of the FO3 wasteland. It always feels like anything can happen. 76 just feels so predictable. It‚Äôs always the same enemies at the same places doing the same things. Sure, there are random encounters, but you know exactly where they‚Äôre going to happen and what can be there. Adding randomness to random encounter spots and enemy/NPC spawns would be a great move. 
---
Add to that, the enemy AI in 76 is terrible. Forget not as good as FO4, FO3 has smarter enemy AI. I‚Äôd love to see an improvement there.
---
Op talking how it was done in Fallout 3 and New Vegas, where you can repair a weapon on the spot without the need of a workbench.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/f292ql/broken_legendary_weapon_effects/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Yeah. Some effects on a gun with a rof around 200 proc a crazy damage bug
---
Yeah, I figured, it's okay! Seems that the concensus here is that it was a "magic weapon". Watched the Angry Turtles' video, it does seem similar to what happened. Erratic drops in the health bar, like super crits or something.
---
I grabbed 5 carrots from my camp and made soup - literally took 30 seconds.
---
No camp? i'm sure that Flatwoods being a low level area is full of veg, maybe increases the task to two whole minutes?
---
Also you making food or drink - e.g Tato Juice wouldn't count as it's a drink.
---
Give a man a fish....
---
Did this happen at spruce knob? I may have witnessed this on the map yesterday.
---
I was at 22k and someone bought the tattered Field outfit from me for 15k. I seen it and got a buzz then realised it's 30k max cap limit which I didn't know. I have no idea how I got tattered Field outfit but seen it was rare and thought I would chance my luck. (It looks sooo bad visually regardless of rarity).
---
"I'm doing my part!"
---
Not getting a picture from your link
---
Wait, isn‚Äôt step 3 always ‚Äò?‚Äô and step 4 is ‚Äòprofit‚Äô?
---
Oh, right. In this situation there‚Äôs no questions or unknowns. 
---
You hit the nail on the head, friend. You can avoid about 99.99% of PvP in this game.
---
Whitesprings 2: Ed-e Strikes Back
---
you just go to the ammo factory, build something near the ammo factory itself, and blueprint it. and you can go place it anywhere
---
Finally, someone with the guts to help.
---
Legendary Run Season 2 baby. But literally, that‚Äôs it. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre giving big breaks between them like some games. I think seasons are going be super steady. They‚Äôll probably just remove them temporarily until the next one starts. Or maybe some xp. 
---
Yeah, checked calendar. Four seasons a year with a couple weeks in between. Probably just some bonus xp.
---
The Halloween costume, you
---
Mean the glow in the dark Skelton?
---
I'm not a meme scientist, but yes it works in this case.
---
I was driving through a nearly Fallout-level run down town a few months ago and saw a gumball machine on somebody's porch.  My first though was "I wonder if there's a plan for those."
---
And he‚Äôll eat for a eat Teach him how to fish and well..
---
A kind of a usefull glitch in silo runs ( till they fix it)  
---
I mean,after launching 100 nukes... it gets boring doing the same thing over and over and over.  
---
Guess,since its on their end ? it aint bannable ?
---
What are they going to do between seasons then? The next season doesn't start immediately after this one ends.
---
Read what you posted buddy, it makes literally no sense.
---
I dont even know where you get the 10000 .38 from. Like are you guys just running through Morgantown airport 50 times a day for a week?
---
That‚Äôs happened since game release. Seems to occur after a nuke at The Whitespring has timed out.
---
there isn't much you're missing out on man, just the quest I am become death completing. once you enter a silo the same repeatable quest comes up and it walks you through the nuke launch process, you didmt miss much, just find a few friends, or if you're feeling tough, go and launch a nuke from any of the silos :)
---
Yea, it has happened to me 3-4 times since launch of the game.
---
Yes.  It seems to happen when transitioning back to normal after being a nuke zone.
---
when you claim te workshop, pay attention to the green line showing the edge of the zone.  Head to the line, but do not cross it.  As soon as the worshop  claim completes, the green line goes away, step over (outside) the line and exit the zone.  
---
  You still own the shop, but cannot be PvPed to contest it unless you step back over where the green line was (renter the zone).
---
  If you have a decent rifle, you can defend most workshops from outside the zone.
---
So - get the credit for taking the workshop, leave the zone, but hang around The area for a couple of minutes - use the time to find a nearby elevated spot - usually, by the time you do that, the defend even pops.
---
Snipe the NPC enemies, compete the event.
---
Even if someone shows up to contest the workshop, they will have to take out the NPCs - if they do, It helps you complete the defend event.  You still get SCORE.  THen you can leave the area and let them have the workshop.  Then they get score, too.
---
kind of a win-win at that point.
---
Yep nice! Like the drunken monk idea
---
So you want to mute it for yourself but force such horror onto your potential customers?
---
You monster.
---
Heh... heh... heh...
---
Omg I didn't know I needed some dumb goofy sh7t like this but I do.
---
Also seen it full of protectrons and assaultrons
---
legacy explosive flamers are great for pvp
---
Wayward has corn. There‚Äôs glowing fungus in the creek. Snaptail reeds as well. 
---
Corn Soup, Fungus Soup, Sugar should all count. 
---
I‚Äôm going to test this myself in a few minutes.
---
Edit:  Corn Soup, Fungus Soup and Firecap Soup count. Sugar does not. 
---
This challenge can be completed in about three minutes if you‚Äôre near Wayward.
---
They‚Äôre just happy SOMEONE is playing that mode
---
The one where you can use traps to reset item inventories
---
Pick 5 cranberry‚Äôs and cook either cranberry cobbler or relish for that daily. This is also good as helps with XP. üëçüèº
---
I was just being feciously humorous that camps spots are pretty cutthroat. 
---
No one likes loggin in to 'your camp could not be placed'
---
Bad little boys and girls.
---
A little frustrating that you can't dual wield, seems like it would make sense. But it's fun, agility tree is crowded because I wanted stealth perks too. Plan to take gun fu and adrenaline for quick killing.
---
Not bad. Have you thought about:
---
- Placing the generator on the roof
---
- Putting the short red toolbox (or equivalent) under the weapons workbench with the help of the rug glitch
---
- Using the military cot bed as it has a smaller footprint
---
- Placing the scrapbox at the head of the bed to save on wall space 
---
- Likewise, on the back wall have the work benches perpendicular rather than parallel so it uses more of the middle space
---
Might give you enough extra space to fit in the ammo converter or brewing stations too.
---
I read and see nerf neelrf nerf. That's not a good design.
---
Just add fireproof perk
---
I sell my legendaries for 12-15 caps per scrip so I bet some people think their getting a steal on any good pieces and hopefully aren't thinking the less nice scrip fodder isn't a rip off.
---
You can line up behind me with my ultracite laser that can‚Äôt take the inventor atom shop skin...üòÇ
---
People sometimes don't follow the rules, they even have what's known as "house rules".
---
Also if you do daily quests you end up with like 50 purified water. Absolute nightmare.
---
The machines are adorable. It is people who say otherwise who are the real monsters.
---
Oof.
---
You should drink some water I'd you've got that much salt in your system.
---
Interesting. I‚Äôve not seen a launch in days. I‚Äôll have to start doing the run so I can do it quickly. Last time it took me a while, even with my buddy. Thankfully someone joined our team and roared thru it.
---
Wait which one? I just grabbed glowing fungus by flatwoods and boiled it. 2 minutes to complete.
---
This is one of the easiest challenges out there.
---
Yes, sorry. I apparently finally earned the points for it
---
I recommend that you go to Watoga Transit Centre
---
Got em all thankfully
---
I'm not on PS4 but there is alot of good spots. There is alot of YouTube videos that show u spots with resources you can put extractors on.
---
So you burn colas.
---
Yes, had the same idea, but the perk is sadly bugged in adventure mode, resulting in being 100% immune to all explosive damages except the one of Legacies and Plasma/Impulse Grenades. I know what the trigger is but won't name it.
---
Have you seen the roadmap? The only new thing in summer is the colossus event, then it's the new questline in fall and then dungeons for winter. They can't just bang out content in a week, hell that content might not even come this year.
---
Sorry officer, I was hunting and seriously couldnt tell the difference. He should have had an orange vest on in this area.
---
Agreed. I do keep pacifist miss on, but workshops are auto PvP you don‚Äôt have a choice
---
I want access to queen Elizabeth's crown, because it is a very nice crown but sadly some jackass decided not to mass produce them and make them dirt cheap. For that reason I will steal the crown, and replace it with a paper party hat. 
---
Don't blame me, I just wanted access to something not legitimately attainable.
---
You have to, or you will lose the chance to get Legendary Run level 100. Is like a fucking job. Thank you, bethesda... fuck them.
---
We do not have any paitnjob to the gatling plasma neither... :)
---
Too many of the good flat spots are taken. I suggest creating a stacked foundation camp or Floor/Wall Clipping camp.
---
If you have fallout first look at the stash box as a bank. Invest your caps in flux. Buy up as much flux as possible (you can store). You can always sell flux back for caps or make serums and sell for more than you paid. Don't look at caps as the sole place of investment. Look into wasteland commodities. Or as others have said buy plans and the likes.
---
Yep, xbox as well.
---
Who knows. Maybe nothing? Should ask around / look for a person who is rank 100 already. If they would give atoms between seasons (after you get rank 100) people would buy rank 100 straight away when they can, since they would easily earn most of the atoms back doing challenges during the season and before next season starts.
---
üòÇ I have the same problem with a lot of games.
---
You could just do the repeatable a few times.
---
How do you go underground?
---
Thats nothing. 
---
Try and inspect a weapon while at queen to repair.  I can go make coffee and hit the washroom.
---
When did you not whine about it? You said it was basically Bethesda's fault that they removed legacy weapons from drop tables?
---
Again though, bad analogy.
---
You high horse types always make the laziest analogies.
---
How do you earn it?
---
These brahmin are laboring under the misapprehension that they are birds.
---
Just tested it myself. It didn‚Äôt seem to work. Same for Strange in Numbers. 
---
Herd Mentality does, however.
---
Its easier to solo it.   Less spawns at the end.
---
The challenge you are complaining about takes 2 minutes tops lol
---
Give me a better analogy proving your point.
---
I've been collecting since I started the game back in beta. Since I have no use for ammo it just builds up. And since the less popular rounds don't sell they build up even more. 
---
When vendors first came out I think I made over 30k caps in under a week by putting all my ammo in the vendor for 1cap.
---
If it's taking you that long just grind XP, its double xp and won't take you long.
---
And if it's like a job to you maybe you should step back and do something you enjoy.  You don't need any of it and no one is forcing you to play but yourself.
---
Is stating facts whining now?
---
They removed them from tables, so I got them through methods that don't require said tables.
---
Y'all the ones whining about the method here.
---
It's a really fun battle! I had it happen yesterday.(it  wasn't my nuke tho) Trying to fight the sbq and the Colossus at the same time is crazy haha
---
Glad you enjoyed yourself!
---
Now get ready for the slow mind numbing grind that is ahead of you! The rep grind is real
---
Be pretty funny if he only beat Cranes Treasure and thought that was the main quest. 
---
LiKe I DiD tHe FiRsT dAy.
---
Ah ok
---
Man if my ally repaired my camp I would scrap them haha. I have a few wall that I destroy on purpose to make a nice fire place
---
Better state than the initial reviews but let's be honest here, it's still a buggy mess.
---
A lot of the bugs are tolerable or can be worked around but the problem is that you have to tolerate &amp; work around them. Even basic shit like the vats or fast travel bugs or simple stuff that never should have happened like all the problems with the screaming eagle skin or red rocket garage door always being closed when it isn't.
---
Well the Plasma Gatling already looks pretty awesome to begin with sooo....
---
it was 5.556 and .50 cal rounds were for 3 caps each 2mm ec rounds 10 each lol
---
Grocer's mod on the backpack makes that only 2.5lbs!
---
Screw that lol I wouldn‚Äôt pay money for an In game weapon
---
I'm kind of glad they make noise. I have spent so much time running around some camps looking for the green glow of a vendor only to hear that damn song telling me that I'm not going to find a normal looking vending machine.
---
It really is! I should max out settler rep today after many weeks of hearing. 'Finally someone with the guts to help' Ahhhhhhhhhhh. Preston Garvey vibes all over again.
---
I have so much junk (FO1) and other stuff to sell but can't coz of cap limit, I only play one character so I'm always having to turn my caps into junk from other players or magazines as a way of a bank account, If I need a top up I sell some junk etc, but It feels like being a millionaire with a debit card I can only get ¬£20 out a day with......like a 100k limit would easily be more feesible, but then we get tards asking caps limit for whatever gun their trying to sell, so It is kinda between a rock and a hard place.
---
Sorry, bad habitü§£
---
I posted the same yesterday and got shot down. Double checked today and I was right after all. Last Laughs and all that...
---
2 FPS constantly
---
You kinda can't TBH.
---
Duping is something that doesn't exist in the world.
---
So the best analogy is person one wants to share an item with person 2.
---
But doesn't want to lose out on having said item.
---
So they duplicate it for the further benefit of both parties.
---
Kinda like a bastardized version of all ships rise with the tide except people gonna nag about not being able to sell water anymore.
---
To add to that, with public teams, those on your team can see your camp, regardless of power to the machines.
---
My usual plan when at or near max caps is immediately disconnect, go into a private world to remove power to the machines, then go back to a public server (without joining a team) and find stuff to waste caps on, usually overpriced flux.
---
My camp is very isolated in the middle of nowhere so I've never had an issue of someone randomly finding it during that time.
---
Man I got so lucky and mine glitched out so I didn't have to do that quest. Just had to turn it in every day
---
Gold grill bear arm would be glorious
---
Hell we been asking em to make nuking other fissure sites worth it since launch. 
---
Like one could do a behemoth boss and another a suped up deathclaw etc.  I mean how hard was that.
---
You can lock the garage door. Not many people will get a crim stat just to shop.
---
Funny story when I joined a public team running a silo. Apparently, I was the only one actually aware of the Power Armor glitch so I defended the bots by myself for 15 or so minutes.
---
Then when that whole thing was said and done, I realized I didn't have any keycards on me
---
So I had to spend another 10 or so minutes waiting for the rest of the team tp fight through the bunker the old fashioned way
---
Yep I'm just going to bury my head in the sand and pretend I didn't hear that.
---
Nothing like strolling through the wasteland with theme from SWAT.
---
Yes, I make sure to lock the door when I turn them off, luckily I haven't had anyone make a purchase after turning them off yet. 
---
I did have one player do everything he could to get to them when they were off though.  He stumbled upon my camp and jet packed around the outside of my camp and onto the roof, found my switch and constantly turned them on and off, then squeezed his way into the center of my camp in front of the machines.  I acted like I was afk, watching him jet pack and jump everywhere in 3rd person, until he got out of his power armor and started to spam emotes.  I then proceeded to give him a thumbs up, and I logged out.
---
And a level 6 with a vertibird
---
Do you have the resource node map? There's a few decent flat spots on it. Add me and I'll show you a few. Psn is kit_cloud it's a bonus if you have a mic, but I can always pin a spot and message why I did
---
One machine is adorable, four of them making noise at once is the stuff of nightmares.
---
Idk if it has or hasn‚Äôt been duped but the majority of all the good weapons in the game have been. Probably just got lucky with who I found in game because he was just dropping everything from his stash but said he wanted to come back to a fixer if he ever played again
---
Ok ill add you now
---
Or when you look at paintcans and immediately think "hmmm i can scrap that for some lead...."
---
Mistress of Mystery:  Me.
---
No thanks, I don't really need to find a note with "go f\*\*k ya mum" or some such rubbish, coz thats all we would see unfortunately :(
---
When you wish you could fast travel to work...
---
KK, I'll be on in about 15
---
A silo can be ran sub 15 minutes if you know what you are doing tho
---
Lol I missed it rip
---
Yeah I usually just sell plans and some ammo now. I'm usually server hopping to spend caps. Have not sold anything besides plans and ammo ever. I just never had the caps room to sell stuff.
---
1400 a day from vendors, plus I sell at a very reasonable price at 4 vendor stations at my camp, so I sell a lot.
---
Is your game also on an external drive?
---
Nothing.
---
Good luck sleeping at night next to that generator without sailing off on Calmex!
---
what do you sell to vendors? guns?
---
I don't think vault tec would care if you felt isolated honestly
---
The innocence of this post hurts me
---
Plans mostly.
---
True, I know with certain camps repairing objects would be a problem.  They could just give the Ally a new dialogue option "Yes, please repair my items while I am away" and "I don't need you to repair anything currently, I will let you know when to resume".  Or something like that, allowing us to toggle the ability.
---
Nah, something this obvious, fuck'em
---
This makes the most sense.
---
get the plans from events and such?
---
Fact or random guess? :D
---
Just power one only
---
I'm on Xbox and if you want the weapon I can gladly make you a fully modded Fixer.
---
Hmm, first place I looked, not there! Have to contact Bethesda support I suppose. 
---
Thanks to all for letting me know I do indeed have an issue.
---
Cheers!
---
Well can I join the Enclave? I need some RP in my life
---
Fact - finished it 9 days ago.
---
Sadly it seems the opposite is the case, they delayed wastelanders by 7 months and the content it provided was 10-15 hours of story and then another grind. People who still play the game want something real to do other than time gated grinding. All their focus seems to be on the brotherhood story now, they can't even bother until the end of the year with something like a perk loadout that a modder put out back in 2018
---
Some, but I go to spawn points for rare ones too.
---
Wow i would be so frustrated. In this situation, the team I was watching had 3 people and there were 2 other people in the match. I assume the 2 were a team since they died at the same time, but I‚Äôm not savvy enough to know how to tell for sure.
---
Can you not do the quest line and get it via the Lowe Downe and A wolf in sheeps clothing?
---
Ok thank you. Very disappointing.
---
ah cool thanks always struggling with caps
---
it would really be a pay to win mechanic then if I could store unlimited amounts of gunpowder.
---
Just tell them your her debugger
---
Report him. It‚Äôs a hacked weapon. Not bugged. These players are cancer and if there‚Äôs only a few players at SBQ her health is scaled lower, and if she lands, it‚Äôs very possible to delete her with one.
---
Na I am on Xbox.  I was making a humerous reference to that quest line.   I wont spoil it.

---
What about sexy Codsworth?
---
I can only assume they were cheating some way or another since they weren‚Äôt anywhere to be found. It sucks that you have to figure out the cheats in order to kill the cheaters.
---
I do my silos with my Troubleshooting explosive minigun so it‚Äôs pretty easy. But, you‚Äôre welcome üëçü§ú
---
I'm pretty sure that it was said some time ago now that they were looking at making this the case, if I remember correctly. Caps aren't too hard to come by (at least enough to negate fast travel fees) but it would be another small incentive nonetheless.
---
It‚Äôs a slog, but it‚Äôs just by earning XP
---
Amazing analogy! üòÖüëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº
---
I'm probably gonna poke around a little more and figure out how to build a melee character and roll a freshy, if i cant get it all figured out i'll hit you up. im in no hurry though
---
I‚Äôm baffled how peeps have finished- was at a level 119 player yesterday who had finished.  How?  I‚Äôve not missed anything and levelled about 30 times and only 40/100
---
Thanks! Any suggestion for high dps for rifle that's not bloodied?
---
Pretty sure they care that you DO.  As in they want you to and to analyze the results. 
---
That was the joke.
---
I dont know, i think thats something you might want to ask yourself: "Do i want more ghillie weapon skins?" And then really think about it.
---
Youre welcome bruv. However i burned up my keycard stash, gotta hunt for more
---
I would bet a small sum of money that those will be next season score rank rewards
---
It‚Äôs a hack weapon. Just report them. Bloodied can‚Äôt do this no matter what people say. My junkies ultracite does more damage than the best god tier bloodied build in the game right now and I can‚Äôt do this. And if you don‚Äôt believe me just look up angryturtle or whoever tested it. Quit the hate on bloodied, when it‚Äôs very obviously hacked weapons.
---
Imagine a .50 cal that does 5k damage with every bullet spent. Now imagine it as a 4x shot, ffr, explosive, shotgun, laser sniper, orbital strike, Tesla, etc, all combined. that‚Äôs where you guys are experiencing this. Not bloodied lol.
---
If duping existed in the world, you would not need an analogy for it, and I have already come up with another that you may prefer.
---
You download a movie/game after buying it
---
Your friend would also like to see the movie/play the game but doesn't want to or can't buy it
---
You upload it to the internet for them
---
When people search to buy the movie/game, your download also comes up and so revenues decrease for the company, meaning that there work is now devalued
---
You get confused and start whining when copywrite infringement shows up at your door after they tracked your IP.
---
Still a trash analogy admittedly but one that tries to take in both sides.
---
All weapons skins for the next 6 months should ONLY be radium rifle skins. 
---
Paybacks a bitch.
---
I keep mine in a 1x1 room, and just flip the power switch before turning the door into a wall
---
It‚Äôs the workshop in this case but there are other ways to trigger PvP with pacifist active. Some of the mutations also were effecting PvP. Charged isotope would activate if enemies attack you, n would discharge a small amount of damage around you including any other players nearby you. Not sure if it‚Äôs fixed yet, I lost track of all the issues n fixes n if they actually fixed the issue. Hopefully this is helpful.
---
By using exploits
---
I‚Äôve filled my stash after level 20 also . Scrapped everything and picked up usual stuff you would on a play through of fallout 4 . Easily Done and I have hardly even scratched the surface of what I wanted to have hoarded .
---
I‚Äôm at level 45 today. But with this xp weekend and the full day and half grind I‚Äôm going to start tonight I‚Äôm hoping to be almost 60.
---
A Sentry Bot should require Home Defense 3 to 5 depending on if the devs want to alter the current perk cards and Robotics Expert 3.  Could introduce the other robots like Protectron for Home Defense 1 and Robotics Expert 1 and Robobrain for Home Defense 2 and Robotics Expert 2.
---
For that matter let us store all the ores in the junk stash
---
A group of us on PC launch over a dozen each day, so you're very welcome.  One crazy person did 18 in one day.
---
The only thing two things we ask:
---
* Please don't melt the queen.  Let other people tag it and get credit.
---
* If you're using a hacked weapon, please don't bring it to the queen (see #1).
---
Ahaha that's irony right there. Love it.
---
Max vendor prices are 30k tho
---
Use R_ight M_ouse B_utton  on the item you want to inspect ... :D
---
There just needs to be overflow.  Like most/alot of games have an overflow inventory so if your full you still get quest reward items etc but have to clear inv space to get it.
---
It is a grind and I got lucky and raider rep had a glitch and got that quick but man settlers took me forever but it is worth it for that bloodied 2 star guass shotgun I got on first roll :)
---
I feel this post. I literally just made a post about hitting max caps. This game is sad sometimes.
---
With Legendary Run board on your screen at the bottom it should say Rank Up. It‚Äôs ‚ÄúX‚Äù on XBox.
---
Robot
---
Which was apparently at one time a pleasure model.   No wonder they are so pissed.
---
That's unbelievable. So sorry that happened to you.
---
That‚Äôs fucking awesome, I ran across a post last night and it had a screenshot A guy standing at the edge of a camp and it looks like there‚Äôs 20 ammo factories in the camp, Guess that dude Is screwed
---
You get an actual gun from the quest, but not the plans. You need to know the plans in order for legendary versions to appear in the drop table.
---
The plan has a 10% chance of dropping from encrypted, and AFAIK that's the only way to get it other than buying it from someone for 5-10k.
---
As of yesterday it did
---
Bruh ur the fallout Darwin
---
I was hoping and trying not slow the grind any more than it already is but thanks.
---
Thanks for the map! Very useful!
---
Cryptid if I remember correctly
---
Right.  I also see the problem.  You ask questions and are too stubborn to listen to people that know better.  There is a reason NOBODY goes to scorched earth relying on a super sledge as a main.  Tyr finished the SBQ in 41 seconds using a fixer.  How does that compare to your math? Good luck.
---
I have been experiencing this as well. Hopefully the loot system gets improved soon. Or people learn some manners.
---
I just sell everything really cheap so I never get above 10k caps
---
Personally I‚Äôd rather be able to start listing items on my vendor for gold bars.  
---
of course that causes all sorts of issues due to the dupes
---
I wAnT rEwArDs FoR nOt PlAyInG
---
Or you go gather corn and flowing fungus near Wayward, then go to the Overseer‚Äôs camp and use the cooking station, and complete this challenge in less than three minutes.
---
That's just the imposter 
---
I think lol
---
&gt;People care too much about what other people are/aren't doing because they are worried that they are losing out somehow because of it
---
It's an issue of ego &amp; self-righteousness because they "earned" their event rewards (no matter the actual contribution, legit or just tagging) &amp; the leechers didn't.
---
They are probably the same people that complain about people not contributing enough to the event, either just tagging or being too low levelled.
---
So long as the event completes successfully, who cares. 
---
It's silly if you think about it. You can have a group that all contribute to the event's completion. That's fine. However, add one or two leechers to that same group &amp; suddenly it's not OK. You get the same reward either way. You don't lose out at all.
---
If not enough people contribute &amp; the event fails, that's different but Fasnacht &amp; SBQ event demonstrates time &amp; again that enough people contribute. It's just people with weak egos that have a problem with it.
---
I‚Äôve had the Flatwoods Monster appear at Scorched Earth and take over the Queen. I didn‚Äôt even know that was possible.
---
Just make it as you need it? I never pick up gunpowder and have 5k+ acid and cloth in my scrip box just from picking up stuff randomly. Its really cheap to make gunpowder and with super duper its not even an issue.
---
I have two industrial water purifiers in my Camp. Selling spare purified water after a couple of hours playing if enough to easy get ~600 caps. I also keep only 10 granades with me, I sell the rest. Also I use Chemist and Super Duper Perks to make Diluted Stimpacks out of the Stimpacks I collect (this makes a lot of extra caps) Sell all industrial food and spare cooked food as well. Psyco, Diluted Rad-X and Super Stimpacks are also a standard selling for me.
---
Ok man you‚Äôre mad you‚Äôre wrong. Please chill. I have gotten the solution from someone who‚Äôs more intelligent than you. Have a good day!ü§£
---
But have you actually checked :)
---
What a truly extraordinary scrotebag. Block block block.
---
this.  
---
also, please stop this "tax" or what ever it is called. i dont get it: i built the camp, i set up the machine, running on power i built, selling my personal item to someone, standing personally in front of it, who throws his caps in the machine. why the fuck do i only get 90% of the amout? is there a little leprechaun in the machine, insisting on his cut? it just makes no sense...
---
Xbox here, that happens to me while in a world. Can barely move and have a heck of a time trying to claim a reward. If I'm in the main screen, not loaded into a world, it's not like that for me though.
---
The fist of the northern star??? A good show.
---
FYI...i did check it wasn't a Fake Sheepsquatch.
---
Test..."Do you have a sense of humour?" 
---
Answer - 1* Nocturnal Shovel (really, that was its drop!) 
---
Yup, definitely not a robot!
---
Jeez i just did the nukashine quest as a lowly level 15, blacked out and ended up in the cranberry bog, almost immediately killed by a dang radstag
---
I agree.  I dislike having to micro manage my vendors.  Then removing higher priced items so I don‚Äôt hit the cap 
---
My gripe: accidentally storing them removes all of your items for sale.  Happened a few times when I stored the building my vendors were in.
---
That is so sad. I am positive you are neither fat nor a bitch.
---
That's interesting it happens to me regardless of being in a world or not.
---
Isn't it obvious that the Sheepsquatch is a mirelurk!
---
Steps:
---
1. Set up a regular vendor somewhere so people know your camp is a vendor (even if it‚Äôs inaccessible to them)
---
2. At the main vendor (the robots) hook them up in such a way that people need to stand on a pressure plate to shop
---
3. hook up the power so when they are shopping, the vendor is active and music plays
---
Makes sense
---
An incredibly rude douchecanoe.
---
I was more talking about when the season ends mid September. The next season is said to start in the fall, which would fit with the first season ending in September. 
---
But if it doesn't start immediately after this current one ends, will they bring back atom challenges for a week or two?
---
I‚Äôm only on rank 39. Finally got the stupid sheepsquach plushie though! It‚Äôs so cute!!!
---
I dont anymore because we just know all the codes from online sources
---
But i remember hunting them down in the beta, i hears that beep in my sleep
---
I think what you mean is anything you build at a public workshop is lost. Workshops are basically temp camps, they public and go away when you log out, this is normal and expected.
---
Workbenches are no different than in your camp.
---
Ah you are correct. Regardless, the ceiling should be higher than the max purchase/sell limit.
---
How hard is it to make gunpowder to order? This really is a non-issue.
---
Use up all the gunpowder you have to clear up stash. Use up all the new gunpowder you make for each ammo crafting run &amp; the problem literally doesn't exist.
---
And how much building do ‚Äòbuilding‚Äô teams do? It‚Äôs time based to get affinity, not topic specific...
---
Place a foundation, place stairs going up, place down a floor mat, then place down either the my personal terminal or the bass (I‚Äôll just say terminal from here on). Put the terminal on the floor mat, then pick up the combo by grabbing the floor mat and place it on approximately the 6th step from the bottom (that can vary based on your foundation placement and the terrain). Now grab the stairs and move them so they‚Äôre facing down into the ground instead of going up. Now when you go to use the terminal, it‚Äôll place you underground. Then just build a walkway or camp down there
---
Yes a claim box or mailbox perhaps with its own limit.
---
What the fuck has it got to do with you how I play the game? 
---
It had zero impact on any players, just means I could scrip all my weapons as once rather than the 150 a day timegate bullshit.
---
Your all welcome! I run an average of 5 nukes a day on the queen and I love seeing everyone come together to destroy the queen together as a community!
---
Aliens have been in the game already. The Flatwoods Monster is a Zetan. 
---
And the assets for regular aliens are already in the code. The Vault Dweller‚Äôs Survival Guide actually has some details, but they weren‚Äôt implemented at launch.
---
Did you have a source beyond your speculation, perhaps something announced by Bethesda I missed, that supports your belief that more alien content is planned for release?
---
Yeah. It was taking hours for my gf and I to: distinguish, scrap/keep, price check, add to vendor; all to repeat the process when they wouldn‚Äôt sell. It was costing us hours. So we decided to just give em away. So don‚Äôt feel bad. He prolly wanted you guys to buy his 200lbs of nonsense. In all honesty, I know dudes who bought second accounts just to sell their junk all day long, and I have also used macros to stay logged in for vendors alone :p
---
May not be stupidity or someone turning a profit. Sometimes if I need scrip and happen on a good deal I'll just empty it to scrip later so I don't have to grind.
---
Dirty robosexuals.
---
I want a bear arm that has googly eyes that move around each time you swing.
---
It‚Äôs only fair
---
Id be happy if Beckett would stay outta my bed.
---
Or one that uses your hp as ammo for more damage
---
It's pretty nerve racking running a silo to have level 30 to 40 show up at the queen and end up being the highest damage dealer there....
---
Right it's supposed to be a tax for simply using vending, but still ridiculous. Maybe add some lore explaining that vault dwellers donate the 10% to helping rebuild Appalachia. Or choose to donate it to a faction and we see those faction areas slowly build up over time and clean up the trash and dust on the floors of their settlement.
---
I just wish the dark matter skin was like the dark matter from BO3üòî
---
Eh?
---
Lolwut
---
Were you able to spectate them when you died?
---
No thank you, I won‚Äôt be signing into my Google account using that link. 
---
Please share using something like Imgur instead.
---
Yes, of course. In my opinion they could add a zero on all limits.
---
He doesn't have a camp anymore, only more ammo than he could ever use lol.
---
You can change the color .there are 2 options and it changes it from forest  to urban
---
You need to be on constant lookout for desk fans...
---
Yes. Medicine and -25% damage against robots when doing encrypted solo. And big guns on the sbq.
---
As much as I dislike bloodied builds, I have to agree here. They trade surviveability for damage.
---
I got the glowing skeleton costume today, as well. Got the NW beanie two days ago, so xmas rewards still do drop, too. Looking forward to getting the ghillie suit tonight, and the fur-lined jacket should be close behind. 
---
Disclaimer: I only started playing NW for the legendary run score, and I don't exactly like or enjoy it still. But I might be hooked enough to slowly grind all the way to overseer rank 100 now.
---
Well. You've already invested those points into strength I imagine. So heavy guns is the way for you. Otherwise you've gotta transfer those points from strength to perception.
---
Oh sweet summer child
---
Genius.. I should've thought of this.
---
I hope this subreddit doesn‚Äôt start shaming those who buy rank up lol
---
Yea but I‚Äôm on the team that waiting til the end to buy them. I‚Äôm glad u didn‚Äôt buy it
---
Thank you, I figured that was it. Looks like this was a communication gap. I meant when they were *last* in the atomic shop
---
Cheers for letting me know bud
---
There‚Äôs a building/workshop in the cranberry bog near the Pylon you can fast travel to. If you‚Äôre fast enough you should be able to climb the fire escape to the top and drop down the elevator shaft. There‚Äôs about 20 screws or so in there between the globes, fans, and typewriters. Once you get in the shaft you‚Äôll be protected from all the mobs
---
Did you power it?
---
How about you read my original post..slowly this time. Perhaps you will understand it this time.
---
You'll probs hate me.
---
But that sounds actually rather nice. He is such a noisy cunt. But i love the cosmetic of the vendor.
---
I‚Äôve seen a wiki page that tracked that. If I find it I‚Äôll share it.
---
Fonding
---
Take it your camp is in prime a prime location?
---
And then it glitches and destroys your camp in minutes
---
Good suggestion, but OP is asking about areas in The Forest region.
---
Nah, but they have begun rollbacks so, to quote Samuel L. Jackson in Jurassic Park, hold onto your butts!
---
This is why are toilets are cracked. You keep hitting them.
---
Im fond of screws.  Also cant edit the title
---
be warned, it‚Äôs difficult to avoid falling through the map without a jet pack and if you do there‚Äôs basically a 50/50 chance you‚Äôll encounter game breaking glitches when you respawn
---
So they are U banning people?
---
Did the email say permanent ban/suspension, ban/ suspension awaiting overview?
---
Did you go overboard?
---
Basically, its dumb.  I wish they'd fix it so you can't stack them and then it would go back to a measure of skill and build quality
---
Look at [this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic) for places to farm stuff.
---
It‚Äôs alright but the song seems a bit too heavy for the trailer but that‚Äôs just my opinion, it syncs up well in a few spots but just seems a bit much for the whole thing
---
No it doesn‚Äôt.
---
Yeah, I know. But I believe you can get through there without needing to take on all mobs.
---
The Responders one is excavator armor that they made after they got a hold of the plans for. 
---
The Raiders like to personalize power armor to fit their characters.
---
State trooper??? There's a new skin called that?
---
Every game I play that has daily quest has atleast 5 quest per faction.. this should be Bethesda goal and maybe rising the rep requirement for rank up to balance it out
---
Add more stuff to gold bullion vendor etc etc
---
Technically, but what's the fucking point in reinstating a husk of an account? They might as well just permaban us üòÇ
---
Like maybe cross this new divide by Linkin park would work better but that‚Äôs just off the top of my head
---
On the PTS. It looks awesome
---
Thanks for letting me know. I'll shall do my best. Just really want the wendigo colossus. I haven't seen it yet.
---
Unfortunately...everything was jacked once it loaded. Bear collection...gone, Mr. Fuzzy collection...gone, robots...gone, random ammo and weapons on display in cabinets...check
---
Tbh i don't find them hard the silos only frustraiting bit is patching up the pipes!
---
I have an ammo bag from my service in the army. Looks exactly like the ammo bag you get ballistic fiber from. Tempted to shred this thing and put it on some metal armor.
---
also timeline issues. but it syncing up in a few places is exactly what i thought the first time i played this over it.
---
Well, do you or don't you?
---
Account suspended pending investigation, I got the email 4 days ago
---
Almost every time I come back to my base I have a Trader on my Mr. Fuzzy Ride, Sofia on her Terminal, and ATHENA Telling me she found another Bird.
---
Good point. It has no perfect compliment like bloodied or Berserkers. It should be called "bastion or unrelenting" but that sounds similar to unyielding. Great point though.
---
Get me more pictures of spooderman! (Basically I want to see it please)
---
When you craft repair it will pull from inventory then stash, displayed items are in stash, then scap box. A lot of people loose the robots making ammo/repairiring gear. The bears usually if you are making gunpowder
---
good luck my friend! just keep nuking and you‚Äôll see it eventually.
---
If I were to hit cap I‚Äôll just buying popular ammo at 1cap each to hold value and resell 30k each 
---
But with the ammo converter are ammo going to lose there value too?!?
---
True but I got 1600 hours on it
---
Correct
---
That's really terrible and we know Bethesda have no interests or 'ability' to help customers recover from the loss.
---
Is this because the numbers are just to vast or they really have no method of accessing player's characters and reimbursing them... who knows?
---
Actually. It does. Have done it myself multiple times. Only thing? Once you change it, you can‚Äôt change it back. Unless they fixed it.
---
I've just been trying to catch a good photo of the thing for a loading screen, the usual nuke spot I have would make it appear in an abandoned town which would be great for the photo op. It would look like something out of a found footage film, monstrous creature found in empty city, that aesthetic is the stuff I live for. Its the same reason I hunt mothmen, I love these 2 creatures designs because they unsettle me and I've always wanted to fight something genuinely creepy in fallout for the longest time.
---
I‚Äôm not sure if they were suppose to have one or not, but I‚Äôve seen someone with a ‚Äúpet‚Äù sentry bot that followed them around. I think it might be a random encounter, not sure if it goes back to your camp.
---
Been trying to change the color. Doesn‚Äôt work
---
Depending how much you duped they may just unsuspend it after a month. Maybe less if you contact support. If you were small scale duping you will probably get it back sooner than later.
---
Yeah I know better but got tired of attempting last night while trying to jump on to finish the dailies
---
Oh ic, it was obvious, by brain was in a fog üòÉ
---
I need a Bessie bot. To hear those sultry tones, "MooOOoo". 
---
mmm.
---
I haven‚Äôt had anything fix it for me.
---
Wait, they carried them all over?
---
All I want for christmas is radiation rumble :( Played 3 days for 6h each and NOT A SINGLE ONE started
---
Thanks for the information man üëç
---
Same here , mostof the time i try to buy something fast around me.
---
Heavy guns all the way, baby! Plus, you can swap out the Heavy Gunner perk cards for Slugger cards whenever you want to use 2H melee.
---
You too!
---
Ah dang.  That sucks to hear.
---
Or PA clip through the walls. No jetpack needed
---
Seriously? I bet powering up Poseidon popped up twice every hour. They need to just get rid of that. Nobody does it.
---
If you know how to do that Power Armor clipping glitch you can run the silo solo in just the time it takes to get to the final robot prep and complete it.
---
Shh, don't let Beth fix that bug! Foundation is my favorite stop on my dailies grind because of that.
---
I never considered this but this makes a lot of sense, unfortunately. Good to know in case I ever run into similar "Windows" related issues myself later down the line. Many thanks.
---
Scanned this thread to upvote.
---
Ur welcome m8
---
They implemented a hot fix that has helped some, but not all situations. Hopefully the full fix will be here soon.
---
There's also a weird bug with armour pieces with 15% less damage while blocking just now. If you equip a piece with this effect any shotgun will shred in VATS hitting much harder than the damage figures. Out of VATS damage is normal
---
I get 1 shot and 2 shot by M79s on the regular. Anyone defending M79s is either ignorant or an explosive whore.
---
Lmfao, you just made me remember when I was doing that mission when my grandparents were over. That was some awkward shit( especially because I accidentally pressed the option to use fisto)
---
Yup, seriously. It's always Tea Time and Feeding the Hungry for me :/
---
You level up way faster doing the white springs sentry run.
---
The farm area* by the vault. 
---
You can build your camp there but it get attacked so a few turrent are needed
---
Figured it out im on pc its R, so I bought two lvls to get the o nslaught armor for excavator lol. Only armor I use currently lvl 75, finally got calibrated schools for ultracite, so I'll be switching soon since it'll be the same carry weight just a better set of armor. Will wait till last day or week of the season and buy the rest. With it only being 150 a lvl, with the 3,000 atoms i have currently, i should be able to not worry as much and still finish. I see my getting to around lvl 70 before having to buy. Good thing I have fo 1st and get the 1650 atoms a month.
---
Nuke the border between Savage Divide and Ash Heap just south of Foundation. There's two Assault Nodes there within a minute of each other; check one, kill whatever's there if it isn't the Colossus, check the other, do the same. Should be able to just run between the two points until you get it.
---
That‚Äôs interesting
---
it wouldn't be impossible to limit a transaction to be 30k caps max AND have a 100k or infinite cap storage ammount tho.
---
Well technically if you nuke the overgrown forest with fissure prime a collosal wendigo spawn in the middle.
---
I need it
---
3 * too. Every time. That mf has some health tho
---
If it does for you please share. Anything to get my point back lol.
---
I'd be more tempted if the background window where you purchase had Todd Howard wearing only tiger skin printed speedos laying on a deathclaw rug, and singing Country Roads.
---
It coming in the fall update
---
That person was probably my friend. We were in chat when it happened.
---
I'm at 25% before my PA even returns. Pop a stealth boy and you'll start out at 50%.
---
PA + jetpack is the faster method
---
Those monthly atoms are the best for this. I still have not gotten the calibrated shocks for the ultracite to switch over to that power armor. I think I have every other plan.
---
Especially when I see desk fans in other games... I instinctively try to pick them up.
---
Thanks for advice. I'll try this out.
---
Hopefully, never really been a ‚Äútorches and pitchforks‚Äù kind of guy, but it just seems shady to me with all this.  Since the path to success is unlocked primarily by challenges, nope, sorry, autocompleted with no reward, but you can ‚Äúbuy‚Äù your way through.  I know they‚Äôve made some questionable calls in the past, but I sincerely hope this isn‚Äôt intentional or genuinely neglected for the sake of making people pay for atoms.
---
Yeah but not everyone can afford a jetpack when they get to the silos for the first time
---
I mean yeah that is technically the solution, but not the point.
---
Dark Knight yes yes
---
Really?? Do you have some evidence?
---
Stay away from the 6th hole it's mine üòÇüòâ
---
All yours buddy
---
I‚Äôve seen around 6, 2 in the wild and my camp must have a spawn for them because I often come back and there‚Äôs one attacking my stuff
---
Glad to help. I dont condone duping, but hope you get it back. There was too long of a time of dupes without punishment, and a lot of people said fuck it. No one saw the hammer coming.
---
So great, but youd only really see that if it was being swung at you right?
---
They delayed the ‚Äòbuy ranks‚Äô option as well for a day or two. If it was some kind of intentional scam, why delay that option at all?
---
Why even have a two week delay?
---
It‚Äôs 14k for the Halloween/Christmas event ones.
---
The wastelanders one (2k each and 25k for the gillie) is glitched as well, although they are locked behind an invisible xp gain. So you won‚Äôt know exactly what rank you need to get it, but there‚Äôs an official list of Overseer XP ranks awards [here](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer_rank)
---
Scraptron: it kills, then it cleans.
---
I was tracking how many atom I actually get after the bug, it seems that this bug cause me have ‚Äú2 different count of atom‚Äù. After I get atom from challenge , the bug appears and the number of atom changes to another. For example: I have 1060 now shown on my account, after I finished a challenge, I get 40 atom, then the number of atom change to 300 and will change back to 1060 shortly. After that if I did another challenge and get 40 atom, the number will change to 340(300+reward of the challenge I just did), and few mins later it will goes back to 1060 again. I did a lot of challenge after the challenge and I‚Äôm sure I had enough atom to buy that skin but when I tried it still said that I need more atom and ask me to buy it. Like I said in the discussion if I bought something in the atom shop both number of my atom will goes low. I tried to reinstall, switch the language or anything I can think of, it just a bummer that I spend a lot of time to finish a challenge and get nothing.
---
He's saying if you get unbanned your account is still gonna be whiped and all characters and progress deleted 
---
You'll have to start from square one
---
Edit - if you've been banned 
---
If you're just suspended I have no clue what they usually do
---
The Xbox LFG. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villiany.
---
No. Raider Punk is annoying as hell.
---
I nab the fans, hot plates, and assaultron heads. Oh and the globes + typewriters.
---
I wish. I was stuck spectating the other team. You spectate the team of whoever kills you/the team of whoever kills the person you‚Äôre spectating, which saves cheaters like this from being figured out because they don‚Äôt actually kill anyone.
---
Give me an Eyebot stash box!
---
They could have had a friend log on who wanted a spot in the team. Happens to me all the time, but I dont boot anyone, I just leave the team and start a new one woth my friends.
---
Is that rare? I was at some cultists place and the guys were killing that thing while I was looting their house, I was wondering who were they shooting at, then I saw the purple thingy and when I shoot him it disappeared o.0
---
I came across a vending machine with two very good guns for 9K each.  I wanted one, my buddy wanted the other.  I went ahead and grabbed both guns quickly in case this guy leaves the server after a single purchase, lol.
---
Bro I‚Äôm a lvl 80something and I‚Äôve never launched a nuke. Only SBQs I‚Äôve beaten have been from random server players. And even that I‚Äôve only done a few. I mainly play solo so I need more people to play with.
---
Just give me a robot companion when I‚Äôm adventuring alone.
---
Yep fair enough I have definitely learner my lesson and if I get my account back I'm sleeping with rosary beads
---
It's double xp weekend and I am power leveling. Rolled one character a couple of days ago and I am past level 50 now. But next week I'llbe doing quests again.
---
Yeah. It sucks we have to do it that way, but its that or miss out
---
Just happened to me as well. No XP for the kill, no loot from her, and only 4 treasury notes as a reward.
---
Well it doesn't sound like 4. Theyre all synced to one tune. It's not bad for the customer who is only there for a few minutes. Just the constant repeat of the same tune and the "come on yall"  kinda toys with your sanity when you hear it 30 times a day
---
You are falling asleep and right before your consciousness drifts away....."[POP I didnt know the gun was loaded.... POP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vSfqR3Hyxc)". That or [Butcher Pete](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGNjugb1dKQ)
---
Been staying up way too late playing recently and been unconsciously humming 50/60s pop songs. Its not even a bad thing either.
---
I‚Äôm fine with whatever honestly, I‚Äôm not strictly trying to do the quests first
---
You must like repeatable riffs.
---
I'm not talking SS jetpack. I run t51 on all mine
---
It's all in you head. The servers have been smoother than ever for me. In nuclear winter and adventure.
---
It happened to me once and I never stay logged in at the time of the resets. It didn't bug anymore. Yet...
---
Temp bans in games usually make people less likely to repete. If you send a ticket dont keep adding to it, as it will push it to the bottom of the list as a lot sort by oldest date of last message from open tickets
---
But if there was ‚Äúmore health = more damage‚Äù then you have a much higher survivability than bloodied. It would have to be like, only 75% the damage of bloodied so it‚Äôs not abused.
---
That's the team bond.  Once you've been on a team for a while it improves the bonus
---
I run bloodied stealth commando and the stealth boost is a good one for a rifleman
---
Originally, the plan was to have players do minimal damage to others *until* the other player shoots back. Then people started running TSE bloodied builds that killed people *with* pacifist enabled in a matter of seconds. And Beth never actually addressed the problem.
---
You need Crystal for the camera film too.
---
You have do do 1k damage to her. Doubt you can hit it at 37 with a 4 man xp farming
---
They are all annoying. This time around though I can't even get Daguerre to leave the abandoned bunker so I abandoned her to her fate. Instead I settled for the drugged out hippy guitar girl who spend most of her time as far back in the camp as I could squeeze her chair.
---
PLs Bethesda, can we just get at least one new one who's less annoying, or even just a mute option?
---
Happened to me as well. Twice now.
---
Put her in the rocket girl outfit and just walk around behind her for a bit.
---
It was definitely duped if he was dropping it, so you can‚Äôt really complain about dupers if you‚Äôre benefiting from it ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
This bug has been around forever. I've triggered it accidentally numerous times. Guaranteed crash.
---
Tormentor in luck for stagger
---
Tank killer in perceptiom for armor pen
---
i keep a responders backpack and always give stims to low levels when i come across them. throw the extras in the vendor for cheap.
---
There's still no in game equivalent to the scrap kits.
---
I had a great beginner camp for newbies that needed good plans and free armour for 1 cap each. 50 yards from the wayward.
---
Took me sometimes 8 or 9 logins to get my camp. What was more of a sickener was that people who had camps where mines was well let's just say it's offensive to use the word camp to describe it üòÇ
---
For us, the event itself was not triggered. We killed her and no quest rewards at all. No XP, no flux... but I was able to loot her (some assaultron blade). Strange.
---
He had a thirty day head start and by now you should be at him or past him, because eventually at the end, doing every daily and maybe a weekly or two wont bring you up a rank.
---
Concentrated Fire at least rank 1, Tank Killer 3, for low health Nerd Rage 3, Sneak, Covert Operative 3, Sandman, Escape Artist, as much Adrenaline as build allows, Bloody Mess.  Luck has a variety of perks if you‚Äôre a vats player like Better Criticals, Four Leaf Clover, and Critical Savy for instance.
---
Till the brotherhood arrive just when you thought you were done, have another grind sir lol oh your too kind lol
---
Max caps is not pointless, it's what gives you low levels a chance to not give up on the game. If we didn't have max cap it would be almost impossible for low lvl player to get on the trading level of a high lvl player. It would break the game economy, players vendors would become pointless. 
---
Ammo is basically like caps, you can always sell out fast with popular rounds like .308, .45, .50, or .556. So when you're getting to your max caps, look for player camps with lots of ammo for sale, buy and store them until you need more caps or some players will trade for ammo straight up.
---
Will do üôÇ
---
I meant I just did it with 3 other players and still got the repeatable done 3 times, and you didn‚Äôt state it was due to overpopulation in you‚Äôre original post
---
Ya thanks. Been playing for 700+ hours and have yet to launch a nuke. It just seems like to much of a hassle.
---
I did with 3 other people, completely the repeatable 4 times, 400+ xp per ghoul with constant spawns for 9 mins, it‚Äôs a no brainier
---
Anyone with a camp at goodsprings I just run straight to vendor and don't bother exploring it. Sadly the game is far too laggy around there for some reason so I can't be bothered to hang about. I have an rtx 2080ti and an i9 processor incase anyone thinks it's my pc.
---
Start a public team and use your mic to say Hi.  You never know.
---
I didn‚Äôt say there was an equivalent. I said you can obtain them by buying them. Or getting them as a reward when you kill the queen. And that it would be cool if they did the same with the lunchboxes. Buy them at the atom shop. Or get them as a reward when you kill the queen.
---
Well I don't think players should be "millionaires", but the cap system should be more forgiving.
---
I would strongly suggest using your next few levels to acquire important "swap in" perks. Gunsmith, Ammosmith, Super Duper, Scrapper to name a few. 
---
After that, your best bet for switching to a gun is either shotguns or heavy guns, because both of those primarily use the Strength you've already got built up.
---
I would use [Nukes &amp; Dragons](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) to both plan your build and identify which "swap in" perks you feel you need to have.
---
Not disagreeing with your other strategy but 10 mins is not a lot for that much xp, even when there are other players there, and at the moment the servers are overpopulated with low level players so it‚Äôs not as much of an issue
---
That's exactly where I was when the double xp event started. Took two days to get to 62 but I didn't no life it since I didn't want to get burnt out.
---
I‚Äôll happily play with you! I‚Äôm fairly new too but don‚Äôt know any friends that play. Add ‚Äòshoooops‚Äô
---
Fetch something, kill robots. Repeat 25 times. Get a level 20 weapon as a reward.
---
Wanderer is the most annoying. I make it a point to drop garbage onto the chair she plays on.
---
I‚Äôm aware of slap damage. I‚Äôve been playing since beta. 
---
Bethesda did address it. They removed slap damage so it couldn‚Äôt be exploited. They‚Äôve modified PvP flagging so your teammate engaging in PvP doesn‚Äôt automatically flag you as well.
---
my friend got a message back, after 4 days., saying account\* will not be unbanned.  After review of the account, it has been determined that this account did in fact violate our Terms of Service.¬† We regret to inform you that your appeal for temporary account suspension reversal is denied due to the evidence within our system for **Exploitation ‚Äì Item Duplication.**
---
Sorry meant to post here, you on now?
---
Alright give me just a second!
---
Bottom of the line is people are wondering why you'd buy them NOW out of all times. You can use your atoms however you want but it's way more logical to just play the season out and buy them with a few days remaining.
---
1. You might actually achieve a rank you want and not even know it because you buy them early. 
---
2. Ranks scale up by 25 score, so you're actually losing a lot of atoms out now if you say buy from 60 to 80 for example as opposed to 80 to 100. It's small but you could have easily shaved a few levels off just by playing.
---
Consider yourself lucky üòÇ
---
Just added you
---
I hoped they would make them tradable by now I've got 4 of the buggers wanted raven and crazy to complete my collection but no rng just had to stick it to me
---
Haha yeah got to vault 79 and all that. Man was it annoying tho
---
I need my chemist mod to stop my chems weighing 700lbs.
---
it does work. i have multiple scout sets and gave a set to friend. made it all forest for him.
---
I agree, i shop faster with thoses.
---
How?
---
I can feel the FPS dip in this photo
---
A person has to put enough damage into her in order to reap the rewards. there is some debate about whether it's 1,000 or 2,000 damage into the scorch beast in order to be able to loot her.
---
They definitely give out the xp man.
---
It would get you through the run 19.4 times
---
im at work right now, but when i get back home ill get back to you. what are you on? if not the same ill snap a few pics for you.
---
How do I get in on this? Only been playing about a month now. Thanks!
---
I remember I played Fallout 76 for 19 hours straight and I could still hear Appalachia radio playing while I was showering. My Xbox was off...
---
I play on PS4üòÖ
---
I wandered across BigWendi on my own before I even knew about it being added to the game, talk about a surprise!
---
Snap pics
---
So much fun. Better entertainment than SBQ for my money (time).
---
Explained number of times on this post already. And i'm aware.
---
My theory is that it's server lag. I have had it happen once or twice Also try diff weapons. I am stockpiling Molotov s for this.
---
When that happens to me I generally just allow myself to load into the world completely and I do a couple things and then I switch servers and that usually does work for me. And I do see numerous vendors coming back today I guess after the ban people aren't as nervous as they were.
---
Yeah if I didn‚Äôt have to work this morning I would‚Äôve grinded a whole bunch but stupid grown up problems got in my way lol
---
I do molitovs and its worked fine
---
At your level it would take about 40k to level up once, and then the same amount plus another 200 to level up again. 
---
That would have been around 10k levels, I think.
---
56 i think
---
Can you craft the assaultron mask
---
I ended up getting everything I needed anyway without him.
---
Mine auto completed for the first time today too and it also crashed when it first started! I logged out of adventure mode last night and logged into advendure mode 15 mins after the reset this morning. It crashed sometime during the loading screen to go into the server. Logged back on and 7 out of 9 challenges were completed. The crash before hand can't be a coincidence. I'm on Xbox. I don't even know if I can summit a ticket..
---
Great for marking at line in the sand. Just don't aim directly at themüëç
---
I'll try different weapons and mr.molotovs. Thanks bois.
---
I really appreciate it when they set the nuke off at a point where people with sucky power armour or bad rad resistance can come and fight the queen without having to step into the radiation.
---
You guys are legends:)
---
it was an additional part to an outside structure but it's not aligned so.. i would have to delete the whole camp.
---
43
---
I bet that was fun and filled with expletives.
---
Wow, just found a radiation rumble. Guess how it went. Right, the two ret4rds that were there first just started it WITHOZT waiting and all the scavengers died :)
---
I haven't had any problem getting exp from this when it bugs.  I don't always shoot them though, I normally have 30 Molotov's on me and just chunk one when they land.  I end up getting exp for them all, while barely damaging them for others to kill.  When I'm out of Molotovs I do use an executioners Tesla and still get the exp for it.
---
Yeah, that happened to me last night (also on Xbox)
---
I‚Äôm also on Xbox. So we might be on to something
---
O wow thanks! Lots of goodies there
---
about 700 score from 57, will probably go for 60 tomorrow
---
You really should fine a ticket. I know they added ‚Äútracking‚Äù but tickets are a good way to make sure they know the severity / frequency of the bug.
---
Well i completed a few and did get the atoms =0
---
101
---
Yeah I'm glad that wasn't actual XP haha. Thanks for the math.
---
63
---
Awesome! I‚Äôll be on tomorrow so hopefully will get to team up if you‚Äôre online üòÅ
---
That‚Äôs true. Hopefully they can fine the problem and fix it
---
Had this happen twice one night. Event never activated but I was able to get the loot from her body. I was mad, I want the flux and everything also
---
DUDE! If anyone plays CoD Warzone, the Desk Fans are the exact same model! All I think when I see one if, "OHH Piece of Candy!"
---
But you  know enemy assaultrons and sentry bots ruin your life, but as soon as they become good guys they'll be getting one shot slapped by level 48 ghouls.  &gt;:(
---
So to get the last rank is it 21k (14+7) or just 14 total (7+7) to unlock the last rank?
---
Yeah I‚Äôll be on! I‚Äôm on now as well or idk if you will be on tonight
---
The brotherhoods ground to air turrets would be cool as well.
---
This sub acts entitled af, it's embarrassing.
---
I completed one and it didn‚Äôt award the atoms - the create 76 Molotov one.  Thought it might be glitched as it was showing the items being created even after logging back to the main menu 
---
Submitting a ticket seems pointless as they just direct you to submit a feedback form which doesn‚Äôt provide a ticket # or get you a response
---
Also have several that are bugged and won‚Äôt complete; the Discover Locales one and the Rank Up 7 Perks
---
When I launched it, I was level 100. I'm now 104.
---
Oh fair! It's just a heads up haha! Don't want anyone missing out on Atoms haha
---
Well that's good news because that's what I was worried about. I have fomo lol
---
I doubt it would be intentional, just saying.  It‚Äôs more of a passive ‚Äúshucks, I guess they‚Äôll have to spend more money now kind of thing.  Especially since they straight up said they can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt award score or atoms on autocompleted challenges.
---
No people would complain as much as they do know
---
Don't use tesla / plasma / anything that ashes or turns to goo. Get yourself a normal explosive weapon, equip grenadier perk (perception), remove like 75% of your damage perks and enjoy all the XP rolling in.
---
Whoops wrong subreddit
---
Just wants to be the same as gta, we get to set the bounty on their head and it comes out of our cap balance.
---
If I want to put 30k caps on someone's head, I should be able to lol
---

---
I was wandering south of the lucky hole mine after killing a random sheepsquatch and the thing attacked me I got two good photos and felt pretty good then I murdered an insult bot
---
People would just pull a white springs. Kill robots for xp then server hop to reset hostility. If the bounty stays i would just farm a small town killing respawns all day lol. Humans are way easier than a pile of robots
---
I believe it‚Äôs 21k total. There‚Äôs a specific reset formula someone found out floating around. There‚Äôs many of these threads asking this question.
---
51. Only play couple hours a day if that and haven't bought any ranks.
---
Don‚Äôt feel bad! I have done this before too haha.
---
ESPECIALLY CHARRED GHOULS
---
I don‚Äôt know how to get the nuclear launch codes fast enough, else I‚Äôd love to do the same
---
Usually only happen max 3 times for me
---
I've got a pet Megasloth, his name is Marvin, after the paranoid android, if you stop by and see him, give him a wave, he likes that.

It turns into a sniper rifle
---
God I hope so
---
This would never work on me lol. I could be in ANY event, thrown around by a lvl 90 albino death claw ‚Äîhell even actively fighting a queen and I‚Äôd still check to see where a nuke is dropping. Can never be too careful.
---
I saw a YT vid for negative range or accuracy the other day and the guy basically had a combat shotgun now functioning as a sniper. VATS hit chance was 95% up to 30-40ft. Still took a few shots to down a mutant but it was interesting for sure.
---
Breaking the ToS you agreed to. Scumbag.
---
I got loot from here. Vampires broadsider üòÇ
---
Can I summit a ticket on Xbox too?
---
You actually don't even need the code pieces. You just need a nuclear key card and you can look up the solved code easily on nukacrypt.com
---
I got the loot from her, vampires broadsider üòÇ
---
Probably not. I scrapped it. If they want to make it a worthwhile item they can readd it properly. It's so useless and rare at the same time in it's current state that it's probably just a low-key fallout 1st advertisement to people who play a lot. Like they're trying to waste space on purpose to strongarm you into buying it.
---
It's the balls
---
I saw someone glitch their windmill's blades through their walls which made a functioning elevator :D
---
You‚Äôd be annoying if you‚Äôd been floating around in space forever just why.
---
Well I'm about to find out if this is still a thing
---
There‚Äôs also alien script somewhere and old professors at VTU who were studying it. It‚Äôs safe to bet that at some point in this games life there will be aliens to fight
---
So you have what is called a comm ban. Or communications ban. You can check these by visiting https://enforcement.xbox.com/enforcement/showenforcementhistory
---
Alternatively lfg is bugged which happens far too often...
---
If you were in a group then a team mate hit the damage needed and you got loot from team proximity. If it was just the broadside someone might have not looted it cause weight lol
---
Yes. You need to go to their support website though
---
I think it might be a coincidence. Or just crashing cause your issue today. But every time I log in I‚Äôve had no error or issue when I‚Äôve lost 7/9 score for the day.
---
How do you get minus range? Not a shotgunner myself
---
This would be the best solution
---
Ok so basically go hard at it durning double xp and when i get the haloween. That‚Äôs everything unlocked...
---
yeah you didn't miss anything, you can go and launch a nuke at any time as well :)
---
I like the idea of the storage box, especially if other players can steal from the box. Imagine a daring heist against a camp with an absentee owner!
---
I play almost solely on my own and I love it! Some things may require some help like launching a nuke of you‚Äôre a lower level but mostly I adventure on my own!
---
Gun Fu could be a mod for PA helmet. Maybe something like a laser cannon mod for the arm or some kind of granade launcher or something.
---
I'm not a shotgunner either, I was trying to get a 0 AP VATS shotgun, and I somehow modded mine into -6 range haha.
---
W H A T. I HAVE LIKE EIGHT NUCLEAR LAUNCH CODES, AND IM JUST NOW FINDING THIS OUT?
---
I look at is as ‚Äòwhen this happened before we could credit Atoms to compensate, so it wasn‚Äôt an urgent fix‚Äô and now it‚Äôs ‚Äòwe can‚Äôt add SCORE so we need to prioritize this fix‚Äô. 
---
The activation of the ability to rank up via Atoms and the first hot fix to address this issue happened within a day of each other, IIRC.
---
Haha weird how that can happen, you had a chance to use it yet?
---
With a bad receiver and barrel + a suppressor I believe it drops to -6 or -9
---
I do the same
---
lol trade survival they take so little damage it‚Äôs like they are at full hp anyway
---
Yes and holy fuck, it's a sniper. I might try and record a video because holy shit
---
Oh ok. I've never had it crash first log in of the day before so I joked to myself, "gee, I hope that didn't screw up my score, haha". Jokes on me i guess. Lol
---
Use the **Missile Silo State Holotape**.
---
Nah, was whole thing plans etc.
---
Damn, want one even more now ü§£
---
I'm assuming that's a glitch, surely?
---
I thought I was the only one, it's unreal
---
I play mostly on my own i have done since the beta. I would suggest you join a new public team for the added benefit it gives you, but you are still able to adventure alone. The best team to join is a building team believe it or not as this will help you level up quicker as the higher your intelligence the more XP you get for anything you do.
---
Vampire and Instigating weapons work well for a full health build IMO.
---
Because at some point people may buy it. 
---
Part of the problem is people needing to drop caps quick. I've bought out vendors just to drop caps as I'm selling stuff to advoided going over 30k.
---
Second is people just not knowing what the prices are in the economy. It would help out heaps of there was some input and the default prices from say stim packa and junk reflect what the avarage cost traded is.  A script to monitor sales, and have the real market value reflected in the item box. Then have the trian vendors keep there above market prices. 
---
A handy guilde for pricing legandary items based on rarity could be a great addition and maybe some data center for pricing could be made in to game.
---
Otherwise if I price shit high, typically at 30k, I don't want you to buy it. I want to light a spot in my vendor base card. So stop asking why I have a can of dog food that expensive.no I don't want to sell it
---
I think they gave up on lore in this game
---
Silly idea. It would make every single item/prefix in game obselete. And there would be no reason to play anything else. It would be totally out of balance.
---
In a sense yes. After I unlocked the beanie I got the Halloween outfit. Still working for the winter coat. Got everything else
---
Absolutely nothing I‚Äôve recorded and reported we all have they don‚Äôt care
---
Would be nice to have that robot modding station like the one in Fallout 4 to craft some defense bots.
---
Portable tents! Gotta love‚Äôem
---
Wait, what? Sorry, I know this is an old post. But it‚Äôs under generators and says it produces 12 power. That‚Äôs the whole reason I bought the damn log cabin pack.
---
But yeah. Mine are spinning but there‚Äôs no way to attach any power connectors or wires and it‚Äôs not proximity based, I put my water purifiers right next to the mills as well as tested with a light. What fucking bullshit.
---
I have one that attacks my camp almost daily lol. If I fast travel to my camp and see all my turrets glowing purple, I know he‚Äôs around somewhere
---
Ehhhh depends on your definition of a glitch I suppose. The algorithm that determines VATS accuracy is an equation or series of equations that values such as accuracy and range are input into to determine your solution (aka VATS hit chance). That equation(s) more than likely ‚Äúbreaks‚Äù and is no longer ‚Äútrue‚Äù when you start inputting negative values because you should never have a negative range or accuracy.
---
Edit: to answer your question more succinctly the equation used to determine VATS accuracy is breaking. To fix that the entire equation would have to be reworked to cause the solution for all negative inputs to be zero. I personally wouldn‚Äôt say that is a glitch. It isn‚Äôt something that was done wrong when the game was made imo. That algorithm was never meant for negative inputs so this unexpected effect is the net result. Some may disagree with me though ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
The silo is stupid easy. Anyone can do it SOLO. Get yourself some garbage trouble shooters armor an weapon. One shot everything / launch nuke / repeat
---
Was he on ps4?
---
I had no idea what they did opened 3 and then logged out lol
---
46. I missed half of last week though.
---
I play only solo and strictly self-found. All my gear I found or crafter myself. I never bought or took anything from other players. I never sell anything to other players. I do public events like Scorched Earth and Encryptid with other people though. I'm level 360. Been playing for 6 weeks.
---
The brotherhood of steel are coming to appelacha fully in December 2020
---
All Bethesda should be concentrating on is the broken perks from update 20! ü§îüëøüíÄ‚ò†Ô∏èüí©ü§°
---
***It feels like I need to build around the broken perks and VATs (Bethesda just admit this issue which will take a significant amount of time for them to correct it.)
---
I‚Äôve been basically playing on my own since I‚Äôve got it and it‚Äôs been a good time just relax and chill. Yesterday I was able to launch a nuke solo and that was pretty fun so I mean it‚Äôs pretty fun solo
---
Ahhh, got ya. Yeah I‚Äôm sorry, I feel your pain.
---
It's a known bug that's probably very low on the fix list.
---
So they stack then? Like you have to get 28k to get the haloween and the jacket?
---
Same here. I posted about it yesterday, but I think we are too few for they to notice.
---
I second this. I usually play solo, but thanks to the public team benefits, my first action when I join a world is to join or create a building team. You never have to actually interact with your teammates if you don‚Äôt want to, but I would recommend sharing a perk if you have at least 3 in charisma. Others often share one as well (when they‚Äôre able to) so it‚Äôs a win-win. It will help you level up far more quickly, especially combined with the inspirational perk card.
---
I saw a flower today and immediately thought of a flower in Fallout.
---
I play 80-90% solo. It‚Äôs fun solo and on a team. Most events will have other players there, but you don‚Äôt really need to interact with them.
---
6 weeks, level 360?? Wtf
---
üòÇ I use it as a bar man.
---
Exactly, yes there are workarounds but that‚Äôs not what the OP wants to address, gunpowder should definitely be considered junk as it‚Äôs more of a crafting component than an end product.
---
What‚Äôs that do?
---
I've seen a lot of new players set prices based roughly on what the robot vendors charge. Maybe they learn, maybe they don't.
---
Yeah :( 
---
I do often wish I could write people a little note that says ‚Äúcool camp!‚Äù Or something to that effect
---
On the other hand, reporting people who send threatening notes would be pretty easy
---
I just got to 42
---
I paid 350 for a fixer plan.now i make them at different levels and find a player just about to hit the level and give it to them free.i even mod the hell out of it for them.
---
Not bad. You can still create your own team for a specific bonus.
---
Is it permanent or is it just a visual glitch that fixes itself?
---
As opposed to being able to store unlimited amounts of acid and cloth? Yeah, I fail to see the difference here.
---
I hate the "no witchhunting" rule here, all I wanna do is spread awareness, if someone decides to report them that's up to them, but if the name could be dropped at least people can say "oh I'm spectating the supposed cheater, I might be able to get more evidence on him or he might be innocent"
---
I was just singing with you! ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I give them away.
---
How???? Cause they allow a crafting material to be stored in a crafting material storage unit??
---
It tells you when the silo is open and ready for you to prep and launch it
---
6.5 mins
---
That's awesome
---
I was just going through my notes and learning a bunch of plans, and noticed I had it. Tho I don't have the stable Flux to make them yet.
---
Optical illusion
---
I‚Äôm not saying that didn‚Äôt cause it. I had it crash loading  in sometime this week and my score was ok. I thought that was going to cause another issue. I‚Äôve tried everything people have mentioned and I keep getting bugged score.
---
Pretty permanent lol. It used to long wrong before anyway. It was too big for your character's head. I think they tried to fix ut and forgot to add the texture.
---
When you need one screw to fix something in your house and you buy a hundred just in case. Lol
---
Yup! It basically turns you into a bum
---
The older games were open world rpgs, fallout76 is more of looter shooter.
---
These are nice most of my loading screens are the Easter eggs of the teddy bears/gnomes pretending they are people
---
Totally agree I have inspiration 3 and depending on what the other players are sharing I usually share strange in numbers, tenderiser or travel agent. Most people seem to make event teams bit I much prefer a building team personally.
---
For them, 80% of the players would be also too few! Haha
---
I want a hand pupet that swears when you hit something.
---
My guess is we‚Äôll have to wait until next spring for them to address any issues with the helmet.
---
I just stored mine on an x-01 suit I never wear.
---
Explosive weapons also ‚Äútag‚Äù all enemies you fire at
---
I would love to see yes man bots protecting my camp.
---
One of the pure hilarity moments for me was a player entered my camp, blaring Scatman (the song) over voice, left a bag with toilet paper, and 1 fertiliser on my bed.  Then run back off through the door out into the distance still blaring Scatman.
---
I saw one but the guy used small letters and said "sheepsquatch ate my mother's ass"
---
Hollllly shit a French manicure death claw skin is the best idea I‚Äôve ever heard!!!! Love it üíÖüèª
---
Do you recall which challenges?
---
The problem comes after buying literally everything you can. Bethesda should just change this and add some sort of bank as your said. Other MMO games have this, and this have been an issue from the start in this game, it's disappointing honestly. They don't even bother saying "we'll pass this on to the team", it's just a "we will ignore the fact players need this"
---
That‚Äôs an easy fix. Participate in Scorched Earth a few times and you will be flush. 4 Stable Flux drop each time at my level.
---
Most atom challenges are impossible to complete due to being bugges
---
These prefabs are awesome for portable camps. I love it. I started using a bunch on my camp and the building limit thing dropped like hell, amazing stuff.
---
Theres only 100 ranks..
---
Home defense lvl 10 for a vertibot would be awesome
---
You can get one set in the atom shop if its out or the other set from vendor bots
---
As in what you use it and it shows if any silo is on a countdown, it one time use thing?
---
I do have to nuke cards. But I don't have unencrypted codes. Tho there is a website with the decrypted codes.... I'll probably be running a couple later on pc
---
Had the pleasure three times already. First, I ran like hell, the second my turrets did the dirty job of killing him and the last time I finished him with my shotgun. Forgot to make the picture though.
---
Angler and mirelurk hunter poison destroys me this is fantastic
---
IIRC, yes. But they won‚Äôt show in the rewards unfortunately. They‚Äôll unlock when they do.
---
41 gah its really hard to find event public teams actively doing events and not sitting in their asses
---
From which bots
---
Sutton Station. It is random in the bot's inventory so you may need to server hop. It like 9k for the plan.
---
I had this event crash the game twice yesterday.  I think too many blood piles in the middle.  Game really lags when you have all these explosions and flying corpses
---
That being said, I just spray the enemies.  I think being in a group really helps as your teammates tagging seems to help.
---
It's all fun and games until the bot gets buggy and attacks your own camp LOL
---
The in game ones robot vendors will sometimes sell them. They are called "signs and letter" and cost around  10000 caps. There is also a pink one that comes and goes on the atom shop.
---
Did you ever figure out the wendingo bug? I‚Äôve served hopped 5 times and it still won‚Äôt come down.
---
Idk that specifically just go to the whitesprings resort
---
You can. It will still say the color it was before switching paint.  You have to equip it to see the color change.  I‚Äôve done it multiple times to match the forest scout look.
---
Nah just become the ultimate jack of all trades lol
---
Everyone went for expensive and protective legendary armor but I collected a set of 5 "food, drinks and chems weight 20% less" pieces instead. It caps at -90% but it's absolutely amazing. Screw DR, weight reduction is everything.
---
Aah. Dont worry. They will be fine!
---
I have fallout 1st gold. We get extra ranks.
---
Until you get a one star
---
Explosive gattling plasma is mostly for tagging multiple enemies, it does shit damage against the Queen and is outpaced by a gattling gun!
---
I am trying to sell a bloodied shotgun with bash damage at my vendor. It's only level 20 and trying to sell for only 9k which is cheap considering it's broken. You can turn it into a sniper rifle which one shots things because the bash damage is bugged too. I'm not interested in exploiting it myself though.
---
Right? That will be my go for perk when it's out. That and the ammo one.
---
Scrap clothes, scrap hats, mod pistols, mod rifles, mod melee weapons, claim different workshops. Maybe I forgot one or two
---
Maybe instead Bethesda should rework it so playing the objective is actually better than going for kills. In the meantime I‚Äôm going to continue to go for kills
---
There is no difference, being able to store unlimited amounts of acid and cloth is a pay to win mechanic and you agree with the parent comment.
---
I'm rank 50 atm
---
Would you mind explaining how bash damage is bugged? Is it the same kind of overflow issue?
---
Thank you =)
---
Those stimpacks are dense!!!
---
Holy fuck thats a horrible builr imo especially since you involved nerd rage,  non automatic weps dont tend to go well with bloodied
---
Well for some reason the bash damage increases range damage and applies a furious effect lol
---
Or one shot everything because you have a decent build!
---
Did you start playing when Wastelanders was released?
---
I suggest getting tank killer and marksman 3 expert marksman 3 and master marksmen 3
---
And at least one point of concentrated fire
---
awkward. very very awkward.... :P
---
Does it work for the mask?
---
I just got in a match with the same guy, and his "teammates" which all look like him and have similar names (I know you could say they're 4 friends but) they all just stand still and do nothing while his main guy is shooting everyone and finding them instantly like he has UAV from CoD.
---
I have, several actually. I'm currently level 67 on the SCORE board so I do get around quite a bit.
---
None of the queen fights ended with someone melting her and at LitS, well, everyone uses some sort of explosive weapon or a normal tesla to tag all but there is no one who insta gibs all the scorched.
---
The only time I saw someone with a magic weapon was during Scorched Earth when a Collossus spawned in the woods and since that thing is a bullet sponge galore I wasn't unhappy that a face melter was there. They didn't use that thing during the queen fight and told us all to come over for the Collossus. When asked why not for the queen fight they answered that they are not interested in ruining the event for everyone.
---
No idea if this is a timezone thing but I can honestly say that I have not noticed this supposed influx of exploding plasmas or BE Fixers. 
---
People are welcome to keep downvoting me for not falling in line or whatever this is about but for me there is no noticable difference. Same for the apparent fact that the weapons are in every vendor for cheap.
---
52 here
---
In the Enclave Bunker hit up the red terminals and look for the option for the cargo bots. It will show where the keycard is and you can shoot it down. There are a few sites that have the decrypted launch codes as well. If you were on XB1 I would totally help.
---
I would suggest finding a favorite weapon and making a build off that. If not that path, look up general guides on builds
---
Pc problems
---
Only 27
---
Must be something with the new gauss weapons the shotgun does it too. And only being able to reload whenever in the hell IT wants too, and missing a lot of shots in vats, no fast travel...
---
&gt;awkward
---
oh yes! had this moment in star trek online, wondered why there was no prompt to pick up coffee pots from a table... o.O
---
Unfortunately I can't afford to do that since I just spent 10k on one. It is awesome that you are able to do that though. I've only been playing for about 2 months.
---
I just want wall mounted turrets
---
I'm sure many wish they had that problem.    
---
I have roughly 250 of Regular and Diluted and I use them somewhat often for a quick heal.    
---
I'm on PC and dropped off over 50 plans to two players both under level 15. This game throws so much at you.    
---
Take gear mods. I'd rather scrap them than sell them b/c no one buys them even at 1 cap.
---
Very interested in the answer.
---
HOO-RANIUM FEVER..... \*sing\* :D
---
I have a full set of weapon weight.  Fully modded mini fun with all the bells and whistles weighs about 4 pounds
---
Hate to see her go, butt love to watch her leave...
---
No. It‚Äôs not a one time use. It‚Äôs perpetual and reusable. 
---
It shows you how much cooldown time is left in each silo. 
---
[You can buy one from the Enclave bunker.](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Missile_silo_state_holotape)
---
If you‚Äôre a sniper you‚Äôre either running instigating or bloodied. Those 2 reign supreme.
---
Mini gun.
---
40 as of today. No way to get a level today. I've been putting in the minimum amount of play time along with buffs needed for extra XP.
---
yep... Before I bought the game I used to watch some streamers and youtubers and I was like "Damn, this guy level 250... he must be playing a lot". I never knew how easy leveling in this game is. With current double xp I level up from 280 to 360 just in two days already. This is without any xp glitches or anything and without Unyielding armor. I play PA Heavy gunner build.
---
Lets clear something up u show up in my runs start shooting at her in the air ill launch the next one on ur base if u dont get a tag on her its called git gud lol do ppl dont get it u cant cripple her anymore dont try to be a hero cause ill one tap her if u show up an shoot her in the air
---
üòÇ
---
I‚Äôm level 38 and have done only solo the entire time.
---
Only time I group is for the daily SCORE quests if it‚Äôs required.  Maybe some day I‚Äôll team up more but I‚Äôm not the most social person in games.
---
Have you just been doing the dailys for xp?
---
Pendleton in whitesprings and the vendor bot at watoga shopping plaza are the 2 places I've seen them 9800 caps
---
Did you pay for it though?
---
Yeah but this takes flux does it not? For me and my friends flux is hard because all the level 300 guys take out the rad enemies before we have a chance so unless we launch nuke ourselves (without JP) we can't get the material to build JP
---
I have seen people running around and fighting but their name never turned to gold during the event like everyone else there. I think it might occasionally happen when you fast travel to a person or place and not the mission marker. Just a guess but it happened to me and I just "fast traveled" (quotes because it placed me a few feet from where I started from) to the marker and it entered me into the event.
---
Here's some photos and video from my 5700 XT. Everything reflective is zebra-striped!

I had someone message me when I put them over. I stopped, we chatted, and then, after spending money in my vendor, we do some trading junk for flux, then, he gives me like 20 serums. (No duper, I watched him make them.)
---
All out of the kindness of his heart.
---
I love this community.
---
Not selling em, just dropping them to help ppl out :) I have plenty of scrap lol
---
71 I believe, a whole lotta XP grinding included
---
Hey, I'm also there!
---
I'm on PC.    
---
My main char is level 79 and another is 28. I don't play the last one often and it might be a test char.
---
This could work. Have an on the fly repair function that lets you repair a broken weapon or armor to 75% with junk you are carrying and workbenches are used for modding, repairing to 200% or crafting legendary items. Keep the current repair kits for 100 or 150% repairs.
---
I'll try to FT to the event in furtue.
---
Yeah on PC they can't message me at all though. Or visa versa
---
I got that new Wastelander's Starter bundle with the Piper outfit and 300 extra atoms a few days ago with money left on a gift card. No problems there.    
---
How long has this issue been going on?
---
How about they start with fixing broken perks
---
You free to play now?
---
Actually if you add me I can do you better how about a underground base you don‚Äôt have to worry about flat land if you build under ground and you don‚Äôt have to worry much about exterior looks but if you want flat land Ik maybe 4 spots in cranberry bog
---
I didnt see it once since launch and now in the past couple months ive seen and killed it at least 5 times, did the up the spawn rate?
---
Lmao exactly
---
It‚Äôs fucked up to punish everyone for the mistakes of some people, if someone is not doing their part, just kick them
---
Yeah, so daily/weekly challenges for the points. I've only missed one day due to the auto complete bug. The rest is XP. Since double XP I've been popping cranberry relish, well rested, brain bombs and lunch boxes, plus level three inspirational. I'm full health so no crazy intelligence boost from unyielding armour. But, with all that the XP is great. I love running Whitespring, not so much for the ghouls but the bots... Sentry bots give me 4k XP, running the whole grounds you can usually find around 6. Server hop and repeat.
---
Tag for Search in the crafting options. Limit which items you're looking for.    
---
Boxes of many scrap are lying around and are labeled. Go to the wiki and find the list of items they contain. The Tag option is your best bet while playing but some have compiled a list of farming spots.
---
Does being on a team, whether it be builder, or hunter, etc. negate the Lone Wanderer perk?  Asking for a friend. LOL.
---
Edit: punctuation.
---
67 and I'm honestly considering a break once it's over.
---
Exactly what a loot goblin would say.
---
you can just ignore people you know
---
50 right now,  I bet with the double score mostly everyone will get past zorbo
---
My camp is in the cranberry bog legit just far enough south of the watoga station to place my camp, the cargo and vertibots come by usually once every other day to fight the assualtron lol.
---
They are over 9000 caps it‚Äôs kind of ridiculous
---
If you have speed demon I believe that‚Äôs as fast as you can sneak so there isn‚Äôt another benefit with the sleek modification. Right now I think custom fitted is the only good option until they make a deep pocket or ultralight version
---
Bethesda doesn‚Äôt care about cheaters. They only did something about duper‚Äôs because they want people to keep logging in and grinding to get legendary guns so they don‚Äôt lose revenue.
---
They would have to make some pretty solid 4 and 5 stars to actually combat legacys cause i cant see 10 points of cryo damage overpowering the fact my flamer can reach a scorchbeast from like 50 meters away and do like 80 to 100 per shot.
---
Damn, grinding for the next 2 days then...
---
Hopefully Bethesda‚Äôs added tools will fine the answer
---
My PSN is priest1503 should be on in 17 hours
---
Maybe it‚Äôs me but I feel like you shouldn‚Äôt be able to put a tent down in a blast zone
---
Sorry, no. It was hot as F outside earlier and cooler enough I have to finish some things. My user is: DocB30tn if you wanna send a friend request.  
---
I'm on CST and usually play after lunch for a short bit but more often later at night roughly anytime between 7p.m. and 11p.m. CST and maybe later depending on day.
---
People keep talking about xp farmers but honestly it doesn‚Äôt really make a difference, people will always find a way to cheese through. It‚Äôs unfair to punish those who are trying to play the game the right way. God, there are SO MANY solutions to this problem, but y‚Äôall prefer to whine about AFKs.
---
100 atm.
---
Yes please
---
Sounds good I‚Äôll be on tonight and all say tomorrow as well, I‚Äôll add you on social
---
You're no flake. I'm impressed.
---
I've tried that but I don't think many are using the chat option. I'm not going to waste ammo by shooting at a paper bag. Besides I'm seeing less players who are below 20. I put a level 30 Fixer for SUPER cheap in my Vendor thing.
---
Not while they're chasing me. I don't want to be rude to people so something to just people know to not bother people who have the flag on their GT would be nice is all I'm saying.
---
Funny, how all the dupers got banned, but the same people, who harass PC players in nuclear Winter for month now get away with everything.
---
Bethesda should rethink their priorities
---
Yea they nvr rlly give us an opportunity to earn them outside of challenges and legendary run
---
Today I learned something. I was wondering what this thing was for
---
"Does anyone else get a ton of lag"
---
-lemme stop you right there, fam.
---
75
---
Ok this is a serious issue.  I just competed another challenge (learn weapon plans), screenshot the atom score before (was at 5050) and after.  It said it awarded 80 atoms.  Went back to check and the atom score was wayyy lower than it was before (from 5060 to 450!! - it should have been 5140.
---
Quit the game, booted up.  +80 atoms WERE NOT awarded to me and I was back at the original amount of 5060
---
PROOF:  Before,  After completing with glitched Atoms,  Relogging in to see same atoms
---
https://imgur.com/a/LETuLfE
---
For me it was take photos, kill 1000 robots with pistols and such
---
How about a vertibird landing pad and some nice explosive turrets to go along with that
---
57, passed Zorbo up 7 levels ago and I‚Äôm 2 levels away from the dark matter skin for the combat rifle (And hopefully the fixer eventually.) and 5 levels from my Ghillie scout skin. Two things I wanted the most from the run. Week 3 of 10 and I‚Äôm 57% of the way done.
---
That‚Äôs awesome. So you have the perfect spot to farm keycards. Is it by the Survey Camp Alpha?
---
Don't you need blocker on one of your armor parts for that to work?
---
Yeah because people would take notice of that. 
---
i just flash them the thumbs down emote and move on. That's usually enough to get people to move on.
---
Ok you I genuinely believe. Other than the dailys how have you been leveling up? Just by smashing the repeatable 10k xp one?
---
I would love a dog house that came with a guard dog.  Or something that spawned ‚Äúrecalibrated‚Äù Liberators that patrolled on a wide circuit or had long aggro range.  This would help me out a lot with the ‚Äúdefend the workshop‚Äù events when part of the enemy wave has hidden themselves or run off somewhere.
---
It's funin public servers, even more fun playing alone. 
---
Events, hoarding, legendaries.
---
Fo1st is a must if playing over 75% alone. That unlimited scrap box is too sweet.
---
Well instead of killing innocent sims, you now can kill innocent players! What fun!
---
If you do the photo mode glitch through the two doors to get past the reactor room and the room where you have to find the mainframe cores it makes everything way easier and faster. We‚Äôre talking like 7 minutes max it should take you to run the silo ;)
---
Take this logic and apply it to every recipe in the game, 90% of which the materials can be stored in the stash box. There is no reason other than oversight gunpowder cannot be stored in the stash box.
---
I can usually only find 3, where should I be looking for the sentries?
---
If you have speed demon, you cannot benefit from any other speed boosts. Fall damage can stack to 100% though for complete immunity from falls.
---
Currently at 43, hoping to get to 50 by the start of the new week.....honestly I just really want that door.
---
Happened to me today too. Xbox. 7/9 completed when logging on 15 minutes after the reset.
---
Close to 50.
---
Lol you right
---
Nice! Thanks for all that, that's brilliant.
---
I second this, I got a really good weapon at around level 80 and switched my whole build. It‚Äôs really not too bad switching it up, just go for the perk cards that support the weapon of choice first like heavy gunner or commando etc. then get bloody mess so you‚Äôre maximizing damage with that specific weapon. Then you can slowly move all the support perks around as needed, it becomes pretty clear what takes top priority once you‚Äôre getting better damage
---
Did my second nuke launch today! (not technically "mine" but helping other people get through). I started with one teammate who had the nuke card, but they quit mid-way. I was super nervous that another teammate that joined mid-way wouldn't have a nuke card, because I didn't. Luckily they did and it was successful! Still takes a while to get through, but it was fun to do it again.
---
I'm currently watching alot of YouTube videos now and what IV learned so far is I need a mass overhaul
---
Nah... I don't mind dying for that view \^\_\^
---
No. I just learned that advanced power connectors can pass through floor/ceilings. These would prevent them from being used.
---
Just to add to the chorus--and silence doubters--here's some screenshots from my brand spanking new RX5700 XT. Hideous Beetlejuice cubemap.  
---
The secret fireplace door?
---
Lol, i toatally agree
---
Its further from alpha than the station legit I can run the the station in about 5-10 seconds
---
And i didnt know the cargobotnhad keywords in it. Until they came by my camp once and I hit them, and they attacked so I killed them, and then got the key card
---
48
---
I have one and it‚Äôs awesome, it‚Äôs like 1000 caps at the enclave bunker and it saves a lot of time fast traveling to multiple silos just to find out they‚Äôre all on cool down.
---
Edit: it‚Äôs a holotape so you just pop it in the pip boy whenever you want to check. If the timer on it says 0 hours and 0 minutes you‚Äôre good to go.
---
üòÇüëåüèª
---
I always go kill the Grafton monster in the ditch next to the Poseidon plant.
---
But it is made from junk material can you name another storeable junk item that is made with compounded info
---
47
---
52 too
---
Well i think if they made an entirely different server for it with different rules and progression. I dont think it would be a good idea to be able to port your Meta build into there. I would want no legendaries in that mode.
---
Same man
---
I start today at 44 I need to do some more xp buffs today......
---
same!
---
Says the man who be like why is everything so bullet spongey
---
I usually kill the wendigo at the antiques stores
---
Yes. Cran relish, brain fungus soup, berry mentats, well rested and a Bobblehead, should I find one.
---
Lunchboxes for events to buff the XP% even higher. It's a slog and I'm finding myself at a point where this is seriously not fun anymore. If SCORE wouldn't increase every damn level it wouldn't be *that* hard but I will say right here and right now that if this is how every season is going to be, they can shove 'em. It's ok once but twice or more? Nope, not doing that.
---
Nah, on PC, but glad to see Bush Wookies everywhere are supporting each other.
---
They said nothing about that infact it hasnt even been implementd they mentioned perks with fallout 1st in the future but right away?  No
---
Something tells me robot workshop will find its way into 76.
---
The game is basically a solo game that let's you do solo things with other people. There is some events that require multiple people but they are optional.
---
I was 42 last week but I quit. Not worth the time investment.
---
Time to spam Burrows i guess
---
This will never happen because you can bet that people will shove porn or gross stuff in their Pics folder just so they can feel badass.
---
I'm with you there every level the xp required increase but yet the weekly and dailys remain the same. I'm not looking to complain but that is bullshit.
---
"Finally someone with the guys to help" is the equivalent of "another settlement needs our help"
---
Only if we get to use the sheep squash reprogramming holotape for uh... Research
---
You got... style I can respect, if you know what I mean.
---
The whole shiny soaking wet texture looks bad imo.
---
Well I don't think there's a chat option on Xbox so that's why I posted here lol
---
Everything wiped as in the duped items or entire character progress?
---
I'd rather have a giant bin of "stuff they need" and you can increase your rep and get reward at your own pace
---
Happening since NW started. Was much much worse. Aim your sights on top ten not overseer and try to find moments of fun. It's not easy.
---
Yeah! I have a locked ‚Äúbedroom‚Äù in my camp where I afk so a secret door would be pretty cool for that
---
Are you on Bethesda launcher? Or steam/gamepass?
---
I think you're gonna enjoy it a lot more with public teams being around
---
And cheers for the pointers  appreciate those. I've only been sleeping and getting the well tuned buffs.
---
Xbox one =0
---
Ok then maybe an Empty pockets emote.
---
So there's two out the front of the main resort building and one round by the launderette area. The rest spawn in (randomly) including the main road entrance opposite the station and at the gaps/entrances around the perimeter, if you go out the back of the golf club and head over the course until you get to the fence, run along it. You'll come across multiple groups of bots, won't always gave a sentry, but there'll be protectrons/gutsy's/assaultrons at least.
---
I mean that would be cool but it would just turn on you and attack your base just like all the other protection stuff. Ever time I am on the game my missile turrets and machine gun turrets attack my base constantly.
---
Pc or console?
---
It's a secret. SHHHH! I'm not supposed to tell people. If they find out they'll take away my gold privileges
---
Hahaha I like it.
---
From most of the reports it seems to be affecting pc players who play on the other launchers.
---
Lucky that you're not affected :-/
---
How do you have that much acid? I don‚Äôt seem to build up acid like that. I do a lot of smelting.
---
When I was a real early level, prior to 25, I saw the Vertibots and I had to take them down and the cargo. Naturally I wasted all my ammo at that time. Worth it.
---
No problem, should have said... With the cranberry relish and brain bombs, they're doubled with herbivore and boosted further with strange in numbers. Also utilise the building public team, even if on your own.
---
lol that message is great, I bet he felt 10 feet tall.
---
It is. Linear growth is a bad idea. I'm now level 487, that right there means that I need 77,800 XP to the next level and it never flattens out. Ever. It constantly increases...
---
I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs the tesla weapons that have a bug and stop rewarding xp, try switching to a different weapon for this event
---
Somewhere you must be able to get it free too. I have one and pretty sure I never paid for it. I'm cap poor and rarely have 1k caps.
---
Good to know! I actually gained 50 levels in about 3 hours, but thanks!
---
There are other post about not getting atoms from challenges today. I would stop completing them for the time being.
---
flux.
---
Boobies
---
That‚Äôs all I do, and have ever done. Just like playing solo. Not to mention using lone wanderer. Playing since launch, level 451 here.
---
Yeah last 2 days, 1 fully auto completed, one only gave me 4 total challenges with 3/4 complete. This game doesn't even want you to play it anymore it feels.
---
They can be installed at workshops....
---
35ish
---
Idk it‚Äôs like the first quest to build a camp
---
I forgot I havent made any in a long time
---
Yeah I feel you was at the same situation, actually still at the same situation I‚Äôm level 72 and past 10 levels I was fixing the mess at my Special
---
It is , I wouldn't recommend it 
---
Il get a BE fixer from the purveyor in my own time .... eventually üòÇ
---
Agreed, the fall damage doesn't really do much at all either. I'm dying for UL to drop.
---
Level 42, close to 43. The double xp weekend is really helping. I buff up INT and take some xp bonus good and a lunch box and probably get the repeatable 10,000 so bonus a lot. Probably at least a ranks worth over two days from that.
---
Looking forward to double score weekend.
---
Did your game crash at all when you launched?  I have noticed Tuesday and today the common denominator for me was a crash to home.  It‚Äôs happened in the past and was fine, so not sure if that made any impact.  Just to add, I‚Äôve had more crashes and ‚Äúsomething went wrong‚Äù errors these past few months.  Literally about 50-60% of all attempts.  Resetting my console completely today to see if that helps.
---
Console and hopefully when I played it was just buggy, with nobody around so I found myself migrating back to fallout 4, than restarted new Vegas
---
if i am kind of a new to fallout 76 i have owned it since beta but never liked playing it but with wastelanders it feels more like a fallout game now what is the best way to power level
---
Line in the Sand is crazy amounts of XP
---
Fun fact. Fissure site prime's marker on the targeting map pulses if your nuke is within range to spawn a queen. Check before you hit confirm launch
---
Every character he had on that account were deleted
---
I got 4 total challenges yesterday AND the day before. It didn't even give me all 9. 3/4 were even fucking completed for me. Ive sent pictures, they respond with generic garbage about them looking into an issue NOTHING like what i described. Than they just blatantly disregard anything you say in response to send THE SAME FUCKING COPY PASTE AGAIN.
---
I was using dual R9 290s up until a couple of weeks ago, and everything was fine. Upgraded to an RX 5700 XT, and now this...  
---
I had a great day with it too.   Someone(s?) launched all three, and there were people there who could actually kill her despite the no-crippling feature.   It was so much fun, being part of that.     
---
Then they ran Encryptid.  :)
---
A) no clue why people are downvoting this. B) I have speed demon and I used the mods. I see a big difference in my sneak speed. I'm curious if I need both to keep the speed or is it worth it to change one out.
---
Yes, please! I hope with BoS update ASAM plan will be a BoS reputation reward.
---
Yes sir.
---
I played fo76 then a lot of Warzone and then back to fo76. Several times I jumped from heights trying to pull that damn parachute lol
---
GT Nova Drone, I'm not on now bull I'll wander with you
---
Well yeah, I specifically avoided mentioning that part so people wont get ideas.
---
if you get stuck emoting, try sheathing/unsheathing your weapon? Works for me every time (PS4)
---
I see you in here buddy, stealin' my ideas... ;)
---
Totally agree! Bethesda needs to sack up when it comes to going after hackers. That, and blocking needs to actually *block* other players. In my little mind, if an account suddenly gets blocked and reported by more than half of a lobby, that should be an immediate 30-minute timeout on playing NW.
---
I believe it I was 99 when the legendary run started i just hit 222 when i finished my dailys today
---
Just join the the new public teams, it's easier to fast travel to locations and actually participate with other people in events
---
Wrong. That is a rash generalization based on ignorance. I play both and regularly make top 5 in Nuclear Winter. The reasons I like adventure PvP are; junk to loot and stash, builds and perks, respawning indefinitely without waiting through lobbies and loading screens, and disliking battle Royales in general.
---
I, as well as many others want the open world PvP that was advertised to be a part of the game. I want to use my build and gear. It isn't about "crutches" lol I could probably clap your food build ass over and over on my level 35 character.
---
What? Armors never make enemies less bullet spongey right?
---
Sure bro, I‚Äôll add you, what‚Äôs your level?
---
At Least you have proof! Thank you.
---
What about the inherit sneak speed from The Fixer?
---
Yes it did. I'm on xbox and it crashed the first time logging into a server. Full dashboard crash.
---
76, but i am definitely an outlier because i have been grinding the XP repeatable using every possible buff there is. Its an extremely tiresome ordeal, and I dont recommend it. Tbh, im so tired of gridning im probably gonna take a break after today.
---
The sneak speed from the fixer is also wasted if you have speed demon.
---
Humm, wonder if that could have made a difference.
---
Burrows has always been one of my favorite due to fixed locations and decent legendary drops.  Once you get a pattern it is a fairly clean run through
---
Guided Meditation, with a long range heavy, has proven very fruitful. You can solo it standing on the structure just outside the courtyard.
---
I got one 177 and a lvl 36 I'll use
---
Well I think they didn't know about the strange in numbers boost.
---
Yep. 
---
Kill Grafton monster
---
Claim Charleston landfill
---
Defend landfill (sorry fallout 1st privledge)
---
3 challenges down.
---
I would not mind that either
---
It says 'press' on the cap, that's it?  
---
It only has Piper's name on it in the menus, are you going to tell me menus are lore now? xD
---
TLDR - Piper's outfit its just a coat and hat that could feasibly have been put together by anyone. Laser Muskets meanwhile are specific to the Minutemen much, much later.
---
I haven‚Äôt tried the mask yet honestly.  I already had a forest scout one.
---
This doesn't sounds that easy at all. Picking up one piece of vegetable at your camp and making a soup from it plus one-tap killing a low level crytpid at Charleston is way easier than dealing with the mirelurk hunters to kill a wendigo an pick some fungus.
---
Sneak stacks. However. If u have the sneak perks 3 your already at 75% out of the 90cap. Add in the agility u have....I‚Äôm hoping more than 10 points. And your at max sneak already. I run the perk 13 in agility and full uny sentinal and can literally pet mutant hounds withought coming out of caution
---
Not a bad idea. If they do run with this then no need to do 1% per hour, why not significantly higher like half of the broken stuff every half hour up to completion if you have the materials? 
---
Make it fun/useful.
---
I have 850 hours in the game and maybe my 4 characters combined are that level lol. I think 360 is still impressive. I‚Äôve gotten 15 levels in 2 days though with all these boosts so leveling now especially with public teams is much easier
---
Moderators have confirmed it will be fixed in a ‚Äúfuture patch.‚Äù
---
Yep, exactly what I did today.
---
You're mistaken, you do not gain any added sneak speed boost from the armor mods if you're running speed demon. It caps out at 20%. This has been tested quite a bit. Even angryturtle has a video about it.
---
Alright, perfect. I added you, if you see me online just send me a message/invite.
---
Here's another gallery to use as evidence: [https://imgur.com/a/t3Nx0l8](https://imgur.com/a/t3Nx0l8)  
---
What does the "no Enlighten" workaround affect?
---
Awesome.  I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve encountered a trap base.  I‚Äôve seen underground glitched camps, but not something specifically that felt like I was being trapped - unless spawning into a rock face counts.
---
Cool üëç
---
I hate people , espesially playing with other people . 
---
You can do fine by yourself
---
Lol too bad I‚Äôm at a hockey tournament this weekend and can‚Äôt get any XP üò≠
---
Coughs in unyielding with my 33 strength
---
I wish there was a "you are scum" emote for ppl like that.
---
There was another post I commented in earlier today that also had someone who had challenges auto completed and crashed the first time they logged in too.  How do you tag those dev people? Lol they should at least see this.
---
Locked doors are a deterrent; not a guarantee that someone won‚Äôt get in.
---
I feel ya haha was kinda hoping for more style inputs on different bundles too. I've been in a cave for awhile so used the surroundings some there. I do like a nice wrap around porch with a view but I agree I wish it looked more damaged and worn. Thanks! Will have to check out the posts and will definitely stay away from the broken bungalow.
---
That was a noob to have such an easy access to his trap camp I have three trap camps and good luck ever breaking in without PvP lol I watch the map for player icons and teleport there immediately
---
You can already stash it in the box.
---
I think you mean three molerats in a trenchcoat
---
I know the feeling.  Switch to 1st person view - a bit less distracting :).
---
Imagine having such a hard on that you cannot focus on a video game.
---
They are pretty rare. I've been killed by one only once, and it was a 'cliff hanger' base. After that, I've always been wary about any camp that looks sus. All in all, out of the hundred of camps I've been to, maybe only like...3 percent or less are trap camps.
---
That's not how power armor works. It's not a junk stash.
---
Because i have ultracite PA as my primary PA, I almost never have skins available to put on. Finally saw this skin was available for mine and immediately pushed full gear to get the atoms free to buy it. Couldnt be happier, and the comments it makes now always give me a little chuckle.
---
Solo silo runner, two door photo mode user. It is getting the nuke cards the hardest part for me. Damn vert. PC user fo1st. BOS Responder hit me up CuningLinguist. Thanks Nukacrypt.com
---
Closed
---
You cannot store in the power armour. Only a stash box
---
Its not for storing. You can put power armor pieces on it but its not a stash box.
---
Oh damn
---
The interior lighting is truly truly awful. Why are all character models slimey?      
---
     
---
Pretty sure even Fallout 3 handled it better.
---
I'm not using the sneak perks, just 15 agility and the covert operative perk.
---
You can always sell off a few to the closest bot vendor.
---
You can only store Power Armor pieces (one of each slot) and a fusion core onto a Power Armor frame. 
---
What caused you to think otherwise?
---
Depends on the level of the pieces, they generally start at level 25, so you can store pieces, put the pieces in and let your inventory store it, after 60 seconds.  So you can't climb into a frame with pieces which aren't your level.
---
Raider PA start at level 15, so you could level raider or wait until you level 25. Excavator and T45 start at level 25
---
Ohio River Adventures has extra raider rep you can get daily if you bring them Mirelurk queen meat
---
To be fair, I think they just forgot to lock it. It wasn't an obvious outer facing wall or anything either, I actually had to look around for a bit to find it. Still, as clever as all the trap layouts were, I was surprised they left such an easy opening for someone to sneak in lol
---
I'm 70 and let's just say I'm going to be here for a while by the time I'm done I might be screaming into the dark corners of the room
---
people know. people were still stacking them straight after the update
---
u/ladydevann
---
Get yourself a couple of sneak pieces then or a chameleon sneak piece is very nice if u don‚Äôt want to run the sneak perks
---
Glad you're enjoying it. I've been playing for a couple of months and I like it. Sure it's buggy sometimes and if you look at this sub you'll see more people complaining about it rather than enjoying it but to me it's fun and that's what counts.
---
People are already aware.
---
This.
---
bonus today was the defend was 3 waves of liberators, so I got the kill 10 robots challenge, too :)
---
I solod it and leveled from 115 to 120
---
I had this happen with a deathclaw of all things. 
---

lol, who hurt you?
---
Can you use the secret door after settings the clues properly to get back in? Once you do:
---
Use Assembly Platform &gt; Status Reports &gt; !!! - EMERGENCY CHECK-IN - !!! &gt; Download Coordinates.
---
https://guides4gamers.com/fallout-76/quest/the-lowe-down/
---
So if you let yourself get killed via a camp owners punji traps, does it make the camp owner wanted?
---
Wow, sorry about this post guys. I thought i can store it. Sorry again :c
---
You can have wallpaper on a wall and have them clip through still completely usable. Ceiling would function no differently.
---
Yeah I've gotten hundreds of legendaries, mostly garbage, but got one BE Single action revolver, and a sent assassin piece.
---
It's amazing how you can server hop and hit the burrows up and never run into another player, but west tek always has either no spawns or someone else clearing another part of it.  I can get all the group buffs on adventure mode and hit burrows and get half a level each run.
---
Don't think so, same way if you get killed by another players flamethrower or radiation trap, they won't get wanted.
---
Monster mash is a shit ton of xp. I go every time it pops up. Test that one out please and thank you
---
You get one for free somewhere along the questline. Though it doesn't tell you what it is so people often lose it because holotapes are usualy lore scraps and not helpful after the quest.
---
I'm talking about the third star. All weight reduction effects come third.
---
Nah, you are not that late - I just cleared 79 earlier this week.
---
Yes. I bet they would work the same
---
Flexes in sentinal
---
I‚Äôve seen some amazing camps! But also a lot of stinky camps.
---
Hollywood wets streets to make them look better and brighter (it's a lighting thing). Bethesda took this idea and went hog wild, and it doesn't work. I hate it.
---
Was at 29k when someone bought an item for 15k. When I saw what it was I just laughed. Portable Power Pack 16500 caps. Someone either knew what it was and was burning caps or didn‚Äôt know and just lost a shit ton of caps.lol
---
And awesome work by the way, my brother and I‚Äôve been grinding 8 to 10 hours a day since the double XP started and I Haven‚Äôt gone to line in the sand or surface to air. Pretty sure he hasn‚Äôt either. but we will
---
If he was unarmed he probably took the bobble head, mag, 2 foods, and nukea shine, you can get like 12k or more a hit on her
---
Oh thats all? Lol thanks. And thank you lady for taking a look.
---
Check the holotape before you go, lol
---
Yeah but I'd rather help some new players out and give them away if they need them
---
I think you mean getting back in to the secret room in the basement of the taxidermy shop. It won't let me in. I've tried several times.
---
Ran my first silo a couple of days ago solo and spent an unholy amount of ammo and meds to complete all the objectives (I went in blind). By the time I fast-traveled to Fissure Site Prime, there were like a dozen high-level characters who annihilated everything (including the queen) in mere seconds (which meant no loot &amp; XP for me). It was a terrible experience that taught me to never run silos again.
---
Not sure, I personally have a few that i got before the exploit. But I‚Äôm positive they are not as rare or as valuable as they were before the dupe glitch
---
Cran relish and Brain Fungus is for Herbivores. If you've got the Carnivore mutation you'll have to eat something else. No idea what, though. :)
---
Defo, especially if someone has placed their tent in the right spot AND everyone is tagging and not going for the kill
---
I just do West-Tek and, server hop and repeat. I started this double XP weekend with level 375 and reached level 506 so far (so 131 levelups at the moment). Also my SCORE jumped up to rank 91.
---
edit:
---
Update: I reached SCORE rank 100 with Level 543 (from Level 375 before the weekend). So I did 168 Levelup since the start of the double XP weekend. It was a heavy grind especially from SCORE rank 94 when all my lunchboxes were gone. After the sunday daily cChallenges I then grinded my to rank 97 to get another 9 lunchboxes which took me to SCORE 100 (still have 1 left).
---
That‚Äôs better than doors but some will still get in before the walls spawn
---
Your compensation is the extra 2 dailies.
---
They are addressing the problem right now.
---
Time to break out the FF7 combat music I guess!
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs weapon specific, happens to me all the time and I don‚Äôt use any gauss weapons
---
76 now
---
Ran with Guass weapons for last 2 builds with the shotgun and mini. Only needs steel and lead and i dont go to mines
---
Hunter skin for what?
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vzVkeEXjaxg
---
Thanks, quite the impressive Discord
---
Hey I‚Äôm kinda late but I have just one question 
---
What I‚Äôm getting From this is they removed duped and reset you levels, but it doesn‚Äôt say anything about your legitimate items so you still have them right ?
---
They addressed it in this week's inside the vault:
---
I do runs everyday. It‚Äôs all I really do. I don‚Äôt bother with side shit. 
---
3 on weekdays 
---
More if I have time on weekends. 
---
I buy cards 100 caps max
---
Msg me here then add me on PC
---
mrjoeyhollywood
---
There is for doors etc but not traps. Go to the item you want to lock. I think the letter is f on pc
---
Wow I thought it was just me, I was completing challenges last night and wasn't receiving any atoms. I hope this can be fixed for everyone
---
Just have a Sentry bot torso with Assaultron legs.
---
Please lol.
---
but majority of players are over level 50 so if anything it helps newer players catch up.  
---
The pay to win people are the ones who played at launch
---
What's the point of doing so?
---
No. It's probably better we don't encourage Bethesda to give advantages to Fallout 1st.  There's already theoretical infinite storage for most junk items that it pretty much invalidates being intelligent with gathering, don't need that to apply to gunpowder too.  Just make it as you need since you already have the room for the cloth and acid.
---
For a couple extra walls? A wall is so little in the budget you wouldnt notice.
---
I would add him!
---
Atleast I'm not the only one. It's kinda a bitch to get the gold stuff to buy the ss power armor plans tho
---
Yea, I know. At one point, I had upwards of 300 of each, so I had the same dilemma.   I gave some way and sold some. 
---
Still try to give away excess if I can; I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve also experienced low levels either run away or thumbs down the offer.
---
  A few that have had mic‚Äôs told me they would rather do it on their own.
---
And how this is not lore RELATED, they just put Piper's name there to get more sales from people who know Piper , Preston outfit doesn't have his name on it. They did a twist with supermutants and bos, so why not invent laser muskets, dunno what you arguing here
---
Good luck to them! Its way underbudget and the walls load in instantly. Running a minimalist CAMP till I decide what kind of CAMP I want. My main build camps maybe have 1 vendor and 100 caps worth of items to be a quick fast travel point
---
Probably more to do with the thousands of psychobuffs!
---
All Bethesda did was remove the most commonly used mechanic, not make a party of the end of griefing forever. Some seem to miss the subtle difference. A workaround was announced on day 1 and isn't news.
---
Todd Howard and Pete Hines
---
I wonder if you could join someone‚Äôs game that has it open and then have them transfer team leadership to you.
---
That console downstairs is your next step.
---
It's very peaceful with moments of adrenaline fueled, "how the fuck am I going to get out of this alive?"
---
Some people said different prices I bought them for 9k in whisperings, just don't forget hard bergain perk and some karma nectars first, you will save some good caps
---
To kill other players and take junk.
---
I have recently encountered a bloodied-hater. They are out there.
---
Personally I don't think the UI would be so bad if it was actually fluid. I can't do something as simple as open my pup boy or map without the game taking a shit and locking up for several seconds. Even just scrolling through my stash or inventory with the vendor is a fucking nightmare. Same with the game board.
---
Its an exploit. Its exactly the same as the ArmCo ammo machine anyway.
---
Remove the cap on bottlecaps already.
---
Anyone I can add to my FL to join?
---
Ty.
---
blueprint em at the factory and take em home
---
Interesting idea for a work around. It's frustrating because I'm so damn close to finishing.
---
Yeah don‚Äôt do it!
---
Hey I'm pretty new too, lvl 29. My in-game name is Dionysus09
---
Well I jus discovered it I already had punji stacks before the update so I never removed them but now on my new character I can build a trap too
---
Please! Especially with those glow in the dark star wallpapers the Season added - they're okay on walls, but would be perfect on the ceiling!
---
You online now?
---
Look in Kwanha County Cemetery (which now has...something...growing or built from the steeple of the church, which is pretty cool looking) or the various cultist locations, should be some there.
---
Huh. Maybe you should put in a ticket. You never know what bethesda can screw up. There definitely is a precedent for bethesda screwing things up on individual accounts.
---
The Mire is the best region in the entire game. Everything about it is awesome.
---
Quick question for myself; do you have to have 3 points in Charisma for every 1 card you want to share? Yours for example, when you have level 3 inspirational, do you have to have 9 in Charisma?
---
The fence issue is brutal. I don‚Äôt understand how people don‚Äôt understand it. It gives you zero advantage as well. I see level 300+ still on fences. Blows my mind
---
48 with lots of time spent on the repeatable xp challenge.
---
I wear the glowing skeleton outfit and give out normal skeleton outfits since I have the plans to craft both pieces in mass quantities.
---
I'm level 122 or so and I've yet to reach cap limit. Werid how people hoard different things.
---
There is the "Elder Battlecoat". But it was part of a atom bundle about a year ago. Hopefully you'll see it in the atom shop at some time. Maybe with the new brotherhood faction and questline coming.
---
Yea. I had already earned the Chinese suit, I was just holding off to try and get more rep before doing the raid.  Finally decided to go for it anyway - bouncing off the script limit and wanted to start getting T-notes from events.
---
Cleared the vault, not lacking caps, immediately visited Smiley and bough a weeks worth.  Will wait and get another weeks worth, then  hike back to the vault for some plans :)
---
Queen run is good,especially now you get some stable flux for beating her,and for getting raw flux to make more of your own. But to make your own, you also need the High Rad fluids and Hard and Glowing Masses. A Whitespring drop is great for farming those.
---
Any links?
---
Armco machine won't break your camp budget though.
---
Oh.that is why.sorry.I've been playing for a year and a half.
---
Im completely self sufficient and reliant.if you are on xbox and need help or anything.im NVRanger74.always on patrol.üòâüòä
---
I mean don't. That'd be dumb.  If you buy them now, you're paying for much lower levels than you'd get later.  You literally get better value for the ATOMS by waiting until the end.  I will probably end up buying the last 10 levels on Atoms I have already saved up.
---
I think the Discover Locales.challenge has been bugged since whenever it was added. Once or twice Bethesda has done something in one of their patches that completes it if you've discovered all the necessary locations, but its a one time fix, not a permanent one. This was the only way I've been able to complete these challenges.
---
I am never online for the daily reset and have never had a problem. You should try that
---
It depends on the type and platform alot of them were rare to begin with so duped less maybe and the ones that were duped last dupe wave were duped again so are as common as any I have myself alot that I traded for before the dupe so I didn't dupe any of mine or trade for them during either but I know there were dupes made of some previously in the last dupe the ones that were hard to find were the double and junkies variants double because of the double legacy effects and junkies because they weren't good last dupe this time the junkies got duped alot I saw even though I held onto my 2* one and didn't dupe it someone else with the same one did I have TSE BE AAE FE and JE laser with explode and it depends as well on the third perk too some rarer variants were held by people like 25 less vat
---
Woulda been all good but they were all gamepass new there was 2 other high levels but they both hide on the tent
---
Definitely rather have sentinel, I only have 3 uny sentinel pieces but it‚Äôs on SS so I‚Äôm nearly invincible just standing still. Can‚Äôt wait until they release the legendary perks for matching armor sets
---
That's what me and the crew ended up doing last night. Especially since most of the NW experience comes from time survived, and we're able to stay out of sight for the most part until at least top 20. 
---
Unless Douchebag McDoucher comes flying by at Mach 2 with an automatic crossbow and decides to headshot us all instantly, lol.
---
Of course it's choice.
---
You're welcome to make the dumbest decisions you like.    
---
And it's dumb to buy them now.
---
[Hey fam so I just tested this. You dont need to do the clues again just hit the calendar and the secret door will open.

Or possibly get you banned for some quick ammo. Not worth it at all.
---
mothman hunter skin, its been datamined
---
This made me smile haha
---
same day delivery with no need to leave your plague shelter.
---
For what weapon? Or is it power Armor
---
To be clear, I cannot even get into the shop let alone the basement.
---
Well yeah, that too.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox
---
Yup, just joined this week also and still getting acquainted with it
---
Nothing is wrong with you, you just don't like boring real world crap. If Home Goods sold robots and weapon skins you'd be jumping to go there.
---
A few weeks ago I saw a roll of grey duct tape on a bench and without thinking I instinctively got excited and was about to pick it up and put it in my pocket. 
---
That was definately a moment where I thought "jeez I should really take a break from 76" But of course, I did not.
---
The game is here for 10 weeks of 2 and a half months.
---
what happens when you try to use the door? Does it say locked or inaccessible?
---
The game mode is the most fun I've had in a PvP game in a long time. I've played a ton. When you get a good squad and no hackers you can have some amazing fights. Hopefully they take the cheaters more seriously.
---
hide in a bush without any under armor on (no vault suit)
---
I'm for at my computer right now, but i think it says something like "not accessible at this time."
---
I wasn‚Äôt online for the reset today yet lost it anyway
---
That's not an opinion. It's objective fact. 
---
And it's VERY fixable. Their devs are just not good with this engine.
---
We had a mothman release a couple weeks ago.
---
I think Modus gives it to you when you become a General. I stored mine in my stash because I has no idea what it was for the longest time. My friend dropped his an had to buy a replacement from Modus.
---
The pain is real.
---
I follow your logic and that sounds like an efficient way to get the tags. From what I‚Äôm seeing in events it‚Äôs the people lobbing grenades, slinging mini nukes, or mowing down spawns with their explosive autos and heavy guns that are taking opportunity away from others. 
---
Again, it doesn‚Äôt affect me because one well placed flaming arrow can tag a whole spawn cluster and only do 2-4 damage. I can easily tag 90%+ of line in the sand or guided meditation spawns with under 30 arrows. 
---
I just feel bad for the folks that hardly get anything in because of the tanks mowing down everyone with their TSE autos and heavies. It only takes one hit to get them the xp so why waste their ammo?
---
Also, it‚Äôs probably a minority of bad actors doing these kinds of things but they‚Äôre taking opportunity away from EVERYONE when they do it.
---
Guess who visited the second time today
---
I leave it on the normal. The extra scrap is more useful than the others to me. The communist one collecting food wouldn‚Äôt be terrible if you were into it.
---
The good ole cargobot?
---
It‚Äôs always advised to check the map once a SBQ fight is over, to see if someone is making a subsequent silo run.  Triple silo runs on a server are among my favorite things to do.
---
Thank you friend
---
As a melee character, I take all of the gunpowder, turn it into ammo &amp; sell it. Problem solved for me and problem solved for the person buying it ü§ó
---
To be an un-original "troll"
---
Seriously, "trap campers" git  gud.   think outside the box,  never gonna be a legend or be respectable like catapult camp and deathclaw maze with braindead spam
---
Two pieces make you immune to all fall damage. I wouldn‚Äôt call that ‚Äònot much‚Äô.
---
yea but im talkin like everything
---
Is that the Xbox game pass version?
---
nah, its an outfit, looks nice tbh
---
That's the legendary effect not the mod
---
Thanks for the offer. I'm on Xbox as well. I will add you. I am doing pretty well. There have been 2 double xp weekends since I started so my level is pretty good. I am 134 and I have completed both main quest lines. Caps are still a premium for me though. Ive just barely broken the 10k cap mark twice. I had about 100 caps left after buying that Fixer plan. I'm grinding to complete Unyielding and get a good Bloodied weapon. I'm getting there.
---
I've not checked myself, but I don't suppose they lowered the coin cost for the level up's did they?
---
There‚Äôs a mod that reduces fall damage?  I didn‚Äôt realize that.
---
Edit: Cushioned. Never used it personally.  My mistake.
---
I don't know what that means.
---
ah, allegedly you can fix it by server hopping until it works:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgs90q/van_lowe_taxidermy_is_inaccessible/
---
Otherwise the other poster's idea of being given leadership to someone that has it is a good idea.
---
Good luck!
---
I bought it when caps were hard to come by thinking it would get you through a silo faster and was all wtf when it didn‚Äôt serve that purpose. Glad to learn it‚Äôs not worthless.
---
like, every mothman bundle
---
I'm a Bethesda mole. PM'ing you now.
---
Exactly, it's just like the old saying, time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time.
---
Steam (migrated from Bethesda.net)
---
I mean does it weigh that much?
---
Haha. You're right. I might even (can't believe I'm saying it) wait in line...
---
No
---
I mean the explosive energys arent even supposed to exist
---
No worries
---
I mean a level 5 perk would be useless since you don't have to keep it equipped after you build it
---
Again, we had a big atomic shop release a couple weeks ago (I think it was around the same time as the irl mothman festival in Point Pleasant) that had the backpack and the wallpapers and the jetpack.
---
They had the previous mothman atomic shop items in the shop at the same time in the other sections.

I actually have to craft gunpowder. I'm a melee character &amp; make tons of ammo to sell so I regularly run out of gunpowder. On a Sunday I normally go to a private server &amp; farm Acid, Steel &amp; Lead for the day. I smelt the lead, make the ammo. But I end up crafting GP. I'd be happy to take any GP that anyone wants to offload. I'm on Xbox, come find me, drop your hundreds of gp &amp; I'll be happy as a fly on cow poop üëçü§óüòÅ
---
The only place to buy it is at the enclave vendor or player vendors who probably most likely bought it from the enclave vendor. I bought one from a player vendor for 500 caps but I‚Äôve never seen another one
---
I only have 4 points on charisma and I can only share a level 1 card so I believe your correct but I cannot be sure tbh
---
Use the wookie if you have it unlocked.
---
go slow and hide the game gives xp the longer you survive.
---
Stacks of punji boards is not a trap.
---
Toxic Larry's and the Watoga trainyard have Snallygasters, which count as cryptids.
---
I started right when it was put on gamepass (maybe a week ago?). (Edit, I've also played the PC version on some free weekends pre wastelanders)
---
I'm getting that too.
---
damn, I kinda figured, but worth asking anyway, thanks
---
Yeah, cushioned.
---
Dad?
---
Personally, I have a switch behind a keypad door that turns off my vendors. If I'm ever past ~28k (everything I sell is cheap), I just turn them off until I can move caps to an alt.
---
No. Atom Shop purchases are not shareable by any means.
---
If you are on Xbox you can join my team I won't bother you gt is same as user name
---
Why isn't it like this? There must be a reason.
---
My camp is on the small river next to top of the world and I can confirm it spawns at least twice a week usually my camp is glowing pink from his attacks but now I kinda feel bad killing him looks like he just wanna chill at my camp

---
important that you add the three separate one star rifleman cards before leveling each up. do not level up one card and move to the next. it will cost you damage pts as one 3 star card does 20% more dmg, while three 1 stars total 30%.
---
Yes thank you.
---
Anybody with power armor can get in without any trouble at all.
---
You can be whatever you want just not a furry
---
Does that allow for like 400+ like a character would have without it? I want the protection of power armor but hate having the significantly lower carry weight
---
It do
---
Of course they did, but that's not a lore break. Adding Laser Muskets meanwhile, is a bit more dodgy.
---
Piper's Coat: Could be made anywhere by anyone just by walking into a clothing store.
---
Laser Musket: As far as we know is unique to the minutemen centuries later and was presumably invented by them.  
---
It's much more of a leap.
---
Oh thats why... It's because of that stupid thing Bethesda made called "we can't transfer your atoms and F 1st subs". Basically you got 2 different wallets of atoms... one from Beth laucnher and another from Steam and they didn't stack.
---
It not supposed to show you how much atoms you have on you Beth account if you are playing via Steam and all your atoms should go to your steam wallet but I guess something bugged up and some atoms go to you steam wallet and some to the Beth launcher wallet.
---
That's why you have two different amount of atoms.
---
Spend your caps so you can sell the weapons/armor you don't use. Easy way is to buy plans you don't know, encrypted cards, the 6k you can spend a week on gold bullion.
---
Trade weapons for rare items or buy them.
---
Pretty sure there are Skyrim code/files in the game. Not a surprise that the dragons and Scorchbeasts have pretty much the same flight animations and mechanics.
---
lvl45 I will go as far as possible before I use atoms.
---
Make a pvp arena and the winner gets a legendary or find more god tiers
---
Mine can carry 420
---
Phew, coz I'm more fluffy than furry. Thanks Dad.
---
Vendor hop and buy any (reasonably priced) plan you don‚Äôt already have. Doing the Santa Claus thing is pretty great, too.
---
These have been fixed the mutations don‚Äôt initiate PvP anymore.
---
Also nuke mines / grenades no longer deal rad damage outside of PvP.
---
I‚Äôm already heavily mutated except for ones that would reduce my weapon damage
---
It's almost as if they expect the game to work as intended
---
I'm not that guy, but I did come across one in the sundew grove near the sbq. 
---
It was level 100, and you're right, many expletives were uttered.
---
I‚Äôm mid level of the 200‚Äôs and have most plans in the game except for random weapon plans like for the 10mm or something else
---
The game tracks the last 255 items you looted so server hopping doesn't really work for looting junk.
---
I had a guy today floating in the air killing everyone with his crossbow... The game ended in a draw 3 other people hid and survived.
---
great vid on spawning enemies and loot  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUGQ0xvqT-0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUGQ0xvqT-0)
---
enemies respawn when hopping but loot doesn't
---
Not a problem, remember furries are heresy and what do we do with heresy
---
I've taken a newbie under my wing and hand him my mediocre legendary gear. You could sink caps on serum recipes, power armor plans, scout mods, or neon letter plans. This is basically where I'm at too, and now I have almost all power armor plans learned on my main with no need to learn them on an alt, and I have the mutation serums that I use learned on my main and 2 alts so... I feel your pain. I was buying ammo from other players, but I have a metric ton of ammo now that I can't seem to use fast enough. I also buy treasure maps that I never dig because they are weightless.
---
For aluminum there is the place that have like infinite amount of it. Doesn't matter if you looted it 1 minute ago and server hopped it still be there.
---
180.
---
Okay got it, im fairly new
---
Cool
---
Word
---
Yea it‚Äôs a TIL on that one, I didn‚Äôt even know what it was for until this thread
---
So you'd rather not get xp/loot yourslef than someone got them for free? Man thats pathetic...
---
Cave Crickets in the tree at Tangra Town in the Mire, the 3 Snallygasters that spawn right in front of the FT point at Toxic Larry‚Äôs, coolant/antifreeze/makeshift batteries.  With a little research and planning, you can determine a farming route that gets well 100 acid.
---
And to address the OP topic: I only create gunpowder when I need it.
---
God I wish I could get chat to work.
---
I‚Äôm mid 200‚Äôs and have most plans, mutations and I never see the few things I need like the Crocolossus Bag plan or Circus Cage it‚Äôs rough
---
Well don't worry, bethesda's fixing it
---
Sarcasm does not translate well online, nonetheless thanks. Although it's not in the misc. bit. Thought there was a bug or something I'll need to check later to see if it there now.
---
That was good fun to watch! I picked up the game just before it hit the game pass, but I don‚Äôt have any regrets in the purchase I must say. Just wish I knew people who actually played it lmao.
---
I was going to say the same thing, you can switch to heavy guns very easily. My 2nd character is an unarmed but I can swap in the heavy perks and I‚Äôm a heavy gunner, I don‚Äôt even have to change anything else really
---
Or a casino. I've seen somebody do it before and it looks kinda fun
---
My main weapon is a bugged vampires limb damage reduced weight combat shotgun and it's healing me just fine.
---
That‚Äôs cool you‚Äôre helping out another player, it is fun to watch their excitement when you drop a rare weapon or plan for free cause you don‚Äôt need it
---
Frog Legs
---
I understand what you‚Äôre saying, you mean how are they going to pay out for the dailies we do. Because we don‚Äôt need score since the run is over...They‚Äôll probably put out season two
---
Never did understand why it's a misc item
---
Take Hemlock Holes - 3 Acid nodes yield about 90 Acid per hour, might be more than that but I think it's 90 per/h. If you have Fallout 1st, do it on a private server coz I guarantee someone will try to take it from you otherwise. Alternatively, pull an all-nighter, not many play after around 1am. In my experience anyway.
---
Calibrated shocks. +50 carry weight for each leg. Or excavator armor gives 100 carry weight
---
It‚Äôs hilarious that the CEP of that weapon was within the minimum range....
---
Absolutely!! And that's why I'm doing it. I've done this before with other newbs, but some of them beg and expect you to do it every time and that just isn't cool. This guy is different though and I think he understands that it really is a gift and not a handout.
---
I've JUST noticed this problem, recorded a video and posted it in YouTube a minute ago:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTZz3dADbQo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTZz3dADbQo) 
---
Also posted it here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hto1g4/video\_atoms\_from\_challenges\_not\_adding\_up\_to\_main/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hto1g4/video_atoms_from_challenges_not_adding_up_to_main/)
---
Let's just go for a whole other perk in DLC that lets us build robots from eyebots on up with the ability to hoover up the goodies from anything that dies from our defenses while we're not there harvest our crops/repair camp objects/operate as a vendor/etc depending on the type. It would clear up a bunch of meat and robot scrap piles for me since my favourite spot seems to attract low level harassment from the local wildlife. Could just use the present build limits to restrict the load it would create. Like sentry/assaultron equal X turrets, robobrain equals vending machine, whatever.
---
You have to do 1000 damage to get to loot her, I believe. This just applies to the SBQ, not all legendaries.
---
Need to do about 1k+ damage to get loot from her
---
Exactly, people just forget to look in their Misc section when storing stuff!
---
On the queen I believe you have to actually do a certain amount of damage
---
There is one coming watch a YouTube called JuiceHead he recently did a video and showed some images that people have data mined
---
I ran a lvl 30 through the burrows, and I wish I had an emote to say GTFO your not safe here...
---
Then he followed me for the day. He got a mutants explosive pump, anti armor combat, and the BRC outfit
---
Edit, and 60 radaway, another player got a few free legendaries
---
They just did a datamine, and they found 2 prefabs they're coming out with. One is a blood eagle prefab base and the other is a bunker prefab. Along with those will most likely be a few wallpapers and couple other camp things. Just something to keep an eye on since you're in the market for a good camp bundle.
---
I have ran afew myself using the power armor glitch though the doors.
---
That would be good too
---
As a loyal PA user it really needs buffs to say the least. I'd love bethesda to implement some of the ideas you've said above.
---
There's way bigger issues they need to address first
---
I haven‚Äôt yet. Working on it though
---
I‚Äôve noticed a decrease in vendors and I hardly see anything rare anymore not sure what happened
---
If someone made a Stardew Valley FO76 mod I would be so happy
---
I'd buy a desktop again for that shit
---
We nuke it?
---
How are you destroying your own walls mine won't even scratch from a full exploding shotgun mag
---
 That's what I thought, makes total sense.
---
Yes, your mother would be so proud of you
---
I find super mutants to be the best resource for gunpowder, so you could try farming guaranteed super mutant spawns.
---
You only get the extra carry weight for the excavator armor if you register it after you craft your first set.
---
Nope you cannot. There are a few exceptions
---
Ah Dad, you such smarts. Me learnded so much from you!
---
Xbox putting 76 into their game pass has added a great many new players which has diluted the player pool. Each map can only have up to 25 players at once. Most maps now have a lot of low levels without the resources to buy or sell quality items in vendors. Eventually it will shift back.
---
What happened was the ban wave.
---
Ve gat plasma works a treat, levelled up twice last time I did it.
---
Good I am much smarts but you is bestest daughter.
---
As a legacy modifier the explosive will not get fixed for energy weapons.
---
Server hop to Grafton Steel. You'll be overcucumbered in no time! Plus it'll net you a ton of steel &amp; plastic too.
---
I try to grab vast quantities though so technically it's less time consuming for me to craft it.
---
Calibrated shocks and excavator give you a bit of carry weight, but unyielding armor and a high capacity backpack give you much more. On my melee guy I've got 400 carry weight without unyielding.
---
It's dumb.
---
It's that high of a drop rate?  Thought it was lower but guess not
---
Everyone got banned, you are the last man standing. Turn the lights off when you are done üëç
---
Well, that's exactly the problem! The "store all junk" function doesn't store your gunpowder.
---
Been getting this on a lot of weapons and armor lately.
---
As much as I like more container space, gunpowder is a finished product, not junk.
---
Its not so much bloodied being strong as the fact that so much synergizes with it the real culprit is unyielding.  Anyone with a full set of unyielding can turn into a vats stealth monster with minimal effort just because their base stats are obscenely good.  If they were to add something where having full health with no rads or mutations that gives the same unyielding plus 3 to all but end bloodied might actually have competition.
---
The raider collecting chems is great for making caps as long as you keep emptying out the junk booze and bottles. Chems weigh almost nothing and sell for a lot.
---
Yep it's never completed for me after 100s of queen fights, even a handful of solo efforts
---
So far fallout first skins have not repeated. They should sell them for atoms to fallout first members who have ot active on past ones they missed
---
The main issue I encounter is weapon swaps will take forever for no reason. Swapping from a rifle to a revolver? Here‚Äôs a full 15 seconds where you are completely unarmed and unable to do anything.
---
255. science has been done
---
Do you think they care that much? The whole point of dailies changing was so players could not earn as much ATOMS, they never gonna give free atoms to anyone.
---
I found a new one (to me) yesterday. A scavenger had a protection break down and I fixed it for her.
---
Slag didn't even give me a reward, she's lucky I didn't explode her body back to my camp.
---
I had 6 go off in 1 server while playing for 4 hours.
---
I‚Äôm sure it is. I hope you can find a way to do it. Good luck! I‚Äôd offer to help but I‚Äôm on PS4.
---
:)
---
The only way I managed to complete it was constantly fighting deathclaws and mega sloths. I don‚Äôt know why but it just doesn‚Äôt seem to work with the queen or any regular scorchbeasts.
---
I know *nukes Dad &amp; claims all that amazeballs inheritence along with his Unyielding Left Leg* üòã
---
There is an elder paint for t60
---
Pretty sure the 450 you saw is the amount of atoms you have earned while this is bugged and have yet to be credited. I noticed it today after completing 3 of the 40 point challenges. After the second I saw 80 and then my current account sans 80. Same after the third, 120 but then the amount without the credit
---
Majority of players are not over level 50. 
---
And paying to ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù. Is pay2win. Period. 
---
More like whole extra suit waiting for marriage
---
And while we're at it stop making everything fit in one container! I would love to be able to build my house up without having to worry about what's in my store! The displays should have their own weight restriction. The stores too! It turned from being a MMORPG to a weight reduction game. I hate those games

Where are you going to fit your car?

I‚Äôve heard 1k dmg but in my experience, while playing 1 handed walking a baby around the room, if I hit her before and after she mutates I generally get rewards

How rude of her! I didn‚Äôt have the stuff on me for that one and umm made the robot explode... so you did better then me
---
You could buy something. I tend to vendor hop whenever I have too many caps, and buy ammo, cosmetic items that I'm missing, or legendary items (despite being more or less finished finding legendary items, I don't have everything yet).
---
You can obtain more for trading. Surely someday there will be new items to obtain, possibly a 4th or 5th legendary effect (as hinted by the 3/5 stars maximum on every current legendary item). Having some good rolls could go a long way for trading up to those, if they turn out to have desirable effects.
---
You could also save your caps for event items. If there's an event you miss or just don't care about participating in, you can get most of the rewards (excluding those that aren't tradable) from other players.
---
Or you could always give them away. New legendary drops take up valuable stash space, and if you have no room or other use for them, they might as well be dropped.
---
FINALLY got it to work. It let me in the shop!

This is one of the most shared docs in this sub.

Please provide your resource that contradicts theirs.

I can only hope I have a military base set up by the rr tunnel and it would look great in the roof

It's unfortunate when others see people exploiting and think it's legit game features

that can't be true most active player i see are always over 50

That‚Äôs the exact document that cites 180, not 255.

Ironic that you shared it.

OMG, Dad came back to haunt me üò¨ Did I... did I turn you in to a ghoul, Dad?

Yes. It takes 3 charisma for each rank of the card you are sharing.

That would be fine also but as someone who cant even equip it it's just endlessly annoying to not have

Something like 0.05 I think. It adds up.

Lol wtf? Ban wave I'm guessing.

Well, I hope Bethesda takes this game as a wake up call and builds a new engine for their other games.

no

I absolutely despise the Fasnatch collectron, it‚Äôs singing is so awful it makes me a want to nuke anyone that has one in their camp.
---
I think that they're saving that challenge for the final queen. The real queen. The big boss at the very end of the game.
---
Or maybe it's just bugged.
---
Seriously, people keep going on about free travel.  I honestly couldn't give two shits about travel cost. If your vending machine is selling what people want at the right price you honestly have no worries being charged 50 caps every time you fast travel.

Thank you for the purchase, though I was near max caps and that was the biggest insult of all. I've gotten plenty of hate and love from other players about this camp but overall I'm very happy with it. How did you get in the box while it was closed off?
---
Yes. Same here. It feels better when you've put in some effort, always does.
---
What happens when people sit on tents and fences? I never heard of this before.
---
Turn off team chat, and thumbs down/no when they try to trade. If people follow you start jumping around.
---
Here is a trick to make it faster. Do a run or two where you pop them off and pick up the spare ones, keep the broken ones and then repair them after you are done. Next run you just walk right up and pop off the broken ones and just replace with the repaired ones from your last run. No more running around to workbenches or finding spares.
---
I agree. At most I‚Äôll switch the group goal to event while I‚Äôm in it, but I go right back to building when it‚Äôs done. I don‚Äôt think most people realize the event groups only help with XP during active events. The building group earns no matter what. It‚Äôs better, I think, especially since the events seem to spawn a bit less often than they used to lately.
---
I‚Äôm assuming that one of you clicked revenge or something it appears after you die to him/her If this isn‚Äôt the case then it‚Äôs very weird and unheard of because it‚Äôs not possible to attack someone or their structure without them firing back.
---
What workshop were you at?
---
If you mean the 1-100 rewards, there is no indication that they will change. I would like to see a prestige system with a second tier of rewards though because right now there is little incentive to play above 100 (I am only 64 though)
---
buy out everyones junk. Excess script material gets put on mules or dumped.
---
You've just become my hero üòÇüòÇ
---
This is a bad idea. Nobody wants this. Paying money for buffs is pay 2 win. Simple as that. Paying to have an advantage over non paying players. 
---
There is a reason no one agrees with this.
---
I didn't know that, thanks for the info.
---
My husband and I have started saying, ‚Äúhey, can you scrap this?‚Äù instead of ‚Äúcan you throw this away/recycle it?‚Äù
---
Crap it could very well be our friend click on it. If we are on a group would that matter?
---
About 40, but I‚Äôm going to finish it tonight.
---
Wont stop them implementing it
---
Really? I watch juice head but I haven‚Äôt seen that video yet.
---
The queen part of the challenge has been bugged since the beta.
---
Exactly. if people camp the tunnels the enemies spawn further back and that means less kills per event.
---
Man hunt if you have full event for 1 mins work give 4000 xp with all buffs 6000 I got other day for mins work
---
Gauss rifle is my baby. But I'll agree VATs are still fucked for them.... But then again. Who needs vats when the damage is 2.4k üòé
---
by that logic flux is also a finished product yet is used in crafting mods and serums.
---
The shiny texture thing drives me crazy. It looks like everyone decided to slather themselves in baby oil before they ventured out into the wasteland.
---
If you actually want to play and not just hide in a bush you can read this
---
I have two playstyles and I switch between them depending on what weapons I get at the beginning. Speaking of weapons at the beginning, for your first few matches spawn in different locations and try to get an idea for what level crates spawn where. For example I have a place I spawn in Morgantown that I run where if I‚Äôm lucky, three top tier crates spawn for me. If I‚Äôm unlucky I usually still get one. Also make sure to set your perk cards to what kind of weapons you like. At the moment, I have damage buffs to automatic weapons and explosives and I love it. 
---
First playstyle is defensive. I do this most often. After the initial drop, if you do not get weapons and armor that pleases you, find somewhere to sit that is slightly hidden and wait for a lone player to walk by. Jump him. The surprise should give you the advantage and voila, you have better gear. Side note, make sure you do not attack a full team. It is near impossible to wipe a squad if you‚Äôre using a kit that you aren‚Äôt strong with. Once you get better, two people become manageable and three if you‚Äôre lucky. 
---
Second playstyle I have is the offensive one. Say you spawn in and get a kit you really like. For me, if I find a .50 cal or Gatling gun or a auto laser rifle, I am good to go. So now that you have weapons you feel comfortable with, go for the throat. Stick to cover and look for people to pick fights with. This tactic is really only viable if you have teammates nearby so keep that in mind. If you get into trouble and are going to die, run towards your teammates. Most of the time they‚Äôll come back you up and while they‚Äôre firing you can heal in cover. 
---
Another tip, grenade launchers are awesome. If you‚Äôre able to get one early on, go to the circle and sit right at the edge and as people come towards the circle you can shoot them with that. I‚Äôve wiped a whole squad that way without them even getting me below half health. 
---
Some more tips
---
Power armor is very situational. If you have to hide or anything that round, don‚Äôt take it as it‚Äôs very loud and very noticeable in the bushes. 
---
Final tip and it‚Äôs one of the most important: positioning is important. stay near the fire and move in with it. Don‚Äôt go straight to the middle as it opens you up to attack from all sides. Keep the firewall to your back so that no one can come up behind you. Obviously don‚Äôt stand directly next to it before it moves as sometimes it moves faster than you but try to stay near it. Your positioning also matters with where the circle goes. If it contains part of a mountain in it, you want to be on top of that mountain. It‚Äôs much easier to fire from the high ground than it is to fire at the high ground. 
---
Sorry this is so long but it‚Äôs most of my NW tips that I tell people normally. I have found a lot of success with these tips but they may not be for everyone. Final note, if you get to the final circles with no teammates, hide in bushes. It extends the time you‚Äôll be alive and you aren‚Äôt likely to be able to take out whole teams until the circle is at its smallest because they will see you walking around before you see hyphen usually since they have eight eyes to your two. Normally I dislike bush Wookiee‚Äôs but if it gets to that point it‚Äôs always a valid way to stay competitive when all else seems lost
---
Add me on Xbox. My homies and I love playing this. 
---
FLASH SiXX
---
Negative we weren't at a workshop at a time. At least not me I was by my base near the Morgantown airport
---
don‚Äôt accidentally drop it, like I did. Even after I had launched a nuke and used the damn thing. Dumping holotapes one day that I didn‚Äôt think I needed. I went to launch, prolly a few days later, and I didn‚Äôt have it. I was unaware I could buy a duplicate at the time so I said fuck it I‚Äôll just run through there... Luckily I didn‚Äôt lose a keycard as well, some level 300 something was already in there
---
I agree. I‚Äôd be more than willing to pay atoms for it, just need the opportunity
---
I run excavator + calibrated shocks on each leg + motion-assist servos on the chest which adds an extra 2 strenght.
---
That's 210 extra carry weight.
---
Yep it does to my knowledge. See problem solved for next time and I hope you have a better experience
---
It bugs out the queen's landing script. She targets an individual player to begin her landing sequence, but if that player isn't on the ground, she wont land. If everybody stays on the ground, she lands much more often.
---
I have pretty much every bloodied weapon you can think of and a few nice AA ones and a good amount of legacies, been playing since beta and like to swap builds around all the time lol
---
If you don't have lightning reflexes and a crack shot or 2-3 other people on voice to team up with you're basically never going to be able to compete against those types. Hide in a bush, let them kill everyone else and then run into the fire at the end when it's just you and them left so they don't get any XP for gangbanging you. You'll make loads of XP and unlock anything you're after eventually.
---
He is talking about the combat challenge not the weekly. 
---
And FYI click on the challenge to see specific sub challenge requirements.
---
Very sorry you found a high level douche bag aswell
---
Nobody wants this. 
---
They said atx will not give a gameplay advantage. This would cross that line.
---
Canned meat stew from feed the people for carnivore. Lasts an hour and doesn't spoil
---
Uh, no.
---
Of course they‚Äôll sell it eventually. They been shoving crap in our faces to make our lives easier for a while. And theirs not way they gonna charge 150 atoms for 5, lol. Maybe 500.
---
That‚Äôs the one I was talking about??
---
We pretty much have people in all different time zones (US) and we jokingly state that there's a day shift and a night shift. Depending on where you are timezone-wise, I can probably PM some names. Please remember we're on PC.
---
I wish everyone could see this post
---
Youre welcome
---
What's the damage resist and energy resist on excavator? I run t51 and almost got t65 but idk if excavator would be more convenient
---
Don't hold your breath. Both current games they're building (elder scrolls and star field) use an even more updated version of the gamebryo engine. No tricks up their sleeves
---
The game is actually pretty good. If this game did not have NPC's i wouldn't play it. I'm playing it for the story whilst slowly grinding plans and stuff and just doing events. The score pass and plans are what I'm considering the "end game" atm. 
---
If it leaves the game pass I'll pick it up as it's pretty decent, though I hope it doesn't. I picked up a month of fallout 1st and turned of renew subscription just to get the ranger armour and the atoms. Hoping the Elite ranger armour makes a come back later on.
---
Overall solid experience, takes the better parts of fallout 4 and combines it with mp for a fun game. Though given the huge bug issues they've had it's only recently I'd consider it a good game by any stretch.
---
Welp today I learned something new. Thanks for the tip
---
My atoms have been randomly jumping around today. 255 one moment, then 90, then 150, then back to 255. Then complete a challenge worth 40 and it goes back to 150. What is happening? lol
---
You could move your camp. There's a node near Solomon's Lake &amp; it's a really nice area to set up. Then you can farm as much Acid it'll dish out üëç
---
Edit, Solomon's Pond, not lake. https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Solomon%27s_pond
---
That part I knew. I was hoping they would lower the upgrade coin costs.
---
The gatling gun is bugged for sure. When you're supposed to learn a mod it never shows up.
---
Frankly hahah, I hadn't seen someone so high level before I've seen people close to 200 sure but 450?! Damn that's dedication... Or cheats
---
Dw I‚Äôm lvl 131 and I consider myself a noob
---
If people are concerned about freeloaders, just have party XP/quest progress in private teams, instead of public ones?
---
Doesn't make any difference whatsoever. Wasn't online at all yesterday, logged in today and all but one was completed.  Also I was online today when they changed over and all the new daily challenges were available.
---
Excavator gives you +100 carry.  Add calibrated shocks at 50 per leg gives you a second hundred for a total of +200 carry weight on Excavator.
---
add motion assist servos, you get +2 STR, which will give a slight boost to carry weight.
---
Other PAs just have the calibrated shocks And motion assist servo mod for the legs.
---
If you have deep pocketed WR armor, plus a backpack (or high capacity backpack), both of which are unequipped when you enter PA, you can carry more than in some PAs.
---
That said, you can carry significantly more if you don‚Äôt mind fast walking everywhere/not being able to FT.
---
 I have found max carry before you crawl in any PA except Excavator is about 1500-ish, excavator is a bit over 1800.
---
Also remember that in power armor, you can't have a backpack equipped.  So if you modded the backpack with the grocery mod, then you will need the thru-hiker perk under agility.
---
I'm on PC too, west coast, thanks!
---
Well, I just dinged lvl 606 and have 1700 hours or so.
---
No thanks.
---
I have been buying up all the plans and recipes that I haven't learned yet.
---
I am level 530ish. I've learned the mechanics and optimum strategy for all of the events.
---
With the exception of project paradise.
---
I admit to following the left hand diagram.
---
I will adjust my tactics. Thank you for setting me straight.
---
I've been playing fallout series since number 3.
---
Every time I do the event people just less enemies to the people we are supposed to protect causing the even to fail every single time. Never have I got a completion for this event.
---
Adrenaline will be fixed in patch 21
---
Lv 285 junkie heavy gunner, lv 250 stealth rifles, lv 204 pipe gun berserker, lv 100 melee grenade. Pushing 4k hours.
---
That would make sense.  It happened before, but I didn‚Äôt actually screenshot it.  Logged out, came back and my atoms were the same.  Figured maybe I just misread the atom count, despite my intuition saying otherwise 
---
I sent a ticket in - see if I get a response
---
450 atoms is a lot üôÅ
---
The game is great if you're a new player. The veterans, myself included, have nothing but grind and rng to do. Enjoy it while you can young padawan.
---
Man, talk about a Fallout 1st-world problem...
---
Damn it‚Äôs still good but I really wanted to get some of those crazy mods. Know of any problem place that the plans could be purchased maybe?
---
Imagine us haha barely scratching lv 50
---
Join a public team, as long as someone in the team joins the event and does enough damage you should be able to loot her.
---
Double Xp you will be past it soon
---
It woupd be nice, and less fo1st would complain about that versus a moth where the free item is a repeat.
---
Shit really? I did not know that. I've been a 1st member for 4 months.
---
I love Fallout games, and 76 is the year i was born
---
I opened a ticket 2 days ago for a 80 atoms challenge and they added them to my account today
---
Trap camps rock! Except when it's just a hallway with stacked punji boards. I feel like the players that make most of them make the most intense designs.
---
Thank you for sharing your Survivor Story.
---
The real question is, what Nuka Cola name did you choose?
---
Ron Perlman
---
1/month on a Tuesday atom shop update they will add f01st stuff
---
Honestly, the free weekend from Steam. I wasn't so sure about buying it before, but i like it a lot. Now i can say i own all fallout games lol
---
I am happy to help you get that completion! Nectarines is here to help!   If you're on PC feel free to add me (Nectarines).   Wastelands with friends is no wastelands at all.  &lt;3
---
Also, I still haven't been credited for killing a single SBQ at level 300+
---
. . . and don't get me started on contracting the elusive Whoopsies to complete my 21/22 diseases challenge
---
I would hate to be the guy firing that thing
---
There are a ton more.  Do Project Paradise every time it comes up. Bears, snallygasters and cave crickets are plentiful there and I can walk out with 50-100 acid easily.  Also there is a railyard just north of the prime fissure site with about 3-6 snallygasters for another easy 30-40 acid.  Just as a starter for you.
---
Nice. Yeah I got plenty of stuff in my vendors to sell to buy t notes. Well atleast when my stuff sells
---
I rationalize it this way. I'm willing to spent 1 cap a bullet as I find that a good deal for the effort, two for Ultracite. If I'm going to spray countless rounds at colossus windingo, I can probably afford to spread the wealth around. It's not like I need anything but key cards and drugs.
---
'Not¬†that we¬†needed all that for the trip, but¬†once you get locked into¬†a serious drug collection, the tendency¬†is to push it as far as¬†you¬†can.‚Äù

-H.S.T.

I played 3, New Vegas and 4. Preordered 76, hated it, abandoned it, just picked it back up this month now that Wastelanders came out
---
Whats this place called and where is it? No help just telling me about it lol
---
Level 50 today. 78 hours (I'm a bitch for standing in camp AFK while I sort out real life). Xbox 1
---
Just spent a lot of time getting the excavator power armour, it's making the game a lot easier, although the junk grind was boring
---
He wanted the OP to have two copies
---
Silly question but instead of posting on here why not server hop and find out for yourself?  That being said, as everyone else has stated, no you can't.
---
Scortchedbeast Queen brain, can get an 8 intelligence boost.
---
Aye don‚Äôt need to be sorry, people are just rude for no reason
---
You‚Äôve completed that one?  I‚Äôd love to see a screenshot, since I‚Äôve never heard anyone make that claim.
---
The highest level I've seen in game is 300. That's crazy
---
Yes, it has been bugged since release pretty much. Same goes for a few discover locales challenges.
---
I‚Äôm unable to get it to recognize sludge lung.  Got whoopsies the other day
---
This is good to know. We need a PSA
---
[It's been suggested.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gj4kf0/so_while_maintenance_is_going_on_lets_talk_about/) I don't expect Bethesda to do anything interesting with factions at this point.
---
You mean the one we‚Äôve killed probably 100k times?
---
Maybe if they took away the xp bonus or made it non stackable.  A gimped version sort of like repair kits.  I wouldn't mind the other effects, but the xp is too much for an atom shop item.
---
Huh? I don't get it. He crashed your game?
---
no our internet
---
Flooded Trainyard also spawns like 7 Glowing Snallygasters which totals to 35 acid each respawn
---
Warm congrats! I think it'll take me another month to get there
---
I mean if that's the argument to make it junk then why not make all food and med junk as well?
---
There‚Äôs no such place. But he‚Äôs welcome to lodge me wrong.
---
I mean, yes, but it's an extremely small amount of reputation.
---
I have been playing since day one, taken a few breaks here and there but at least logged on once a week.
---
I still can't store boiled or purified water, gunpowder would be icing.
---
Theres only 3 or 4 for it
---
Hopefully he gets banned for that. I got DDOSed after some guy got salty about not getting a hit in on a Sheepsquatch. I reported him and got a generic cookie cutter ticket response from Bethesda. You can add it to the long list of fails from Fallout 76 if players like these are able to continue playing
---
What‚Äôs the mod for the flamer that makes it shoot like a gun? I saw someone using it but when I used a flamer.... flames came out lol
---
FLASH SiXX on Xbox
---
I'll be on tonight. Around 10pm mtn time
---
No like some super queen that lives underground, that we have to actually go down and kill it once and for all with some new questline, maybe enclave questline.
---
üëç
---
In general explosive energy guns do more damage than what they are showing on the card. Also 386 damage is good damage only bad side are the few enemies that are very resistant to explosive damage.
---
Well, never can be too careful.
---
Thanks! My best advice, just keep at it! And look around the forest area theres alot of random encounters to gain a little bit of xp from.
---
If that aint the damn truth. Shoulda been fixed in the first year
---
That's a federal offense. I would highly recommend taking action against him in some way.
---
Alright, how much would you like?
---
My ex husband got me into the fallout games, and now I spend my nights laying waste to Appalachia with my boyfriend.
---
Loving it, made a perfect addition to my camp, thanks:

---
Why have that challenge in the game at all, then?  Feels like you‚Äôre grasping at straws. 
---
Occam‚Äôs Razor:  it‚Äôs bugged.
---
I got both those icons but had no idea they were from a magazine. Must be one of the few issues I haven't collected yet.
---
Yeah I think its equal to the amount you get for taking Davenports photos to either faction. It adds up though I finally maxed out my raider rep the other day so I have both maxed out now. I would like more mission varieties for treasury notes thought since it's going to get really stale doing the same quests even at max rep.
---
Oh so that‚Äôs why people keep nuking that area by watoga. I thought they were trying to clear out the squatters without having to go over there
---
I dont think you got ddosed. Someone would need to capture packets to even aquire your public IP address (assuming they still can) and even if they did thats not guarantee and many providers has some basic defense against ddos and theres no way they could do it quickly.
---
More than likely the server just crashed lol.
---
I freaking love that I don't have to talk to Ward anymore.
---
Or Wren. 
---
Sometimes I still talk to Rocksy. You know some of those run away raiders are legendary?
---
Fallout 3 was the 1st game I owned when I bought my first Xbox 360, I was hooked instantly, after finishing it I bought new Vegas after then when i upgraded to the Xbox one fallout 4 was a must have for me, then 76
---
unlock all the plans, even if you are never gonna use them.
---
That's a bug that was introduced with the latest hotfix it seems. Many people and myself are not getting atoms or rather getting random numbers from lifetime challenges.
---
Its not a mod it was a legacy flamer when energy weapons could have explosive legendary effects it replaces the flame with a bullet due to the explosive effect they are incredibly powerful and before the d00p they were incredibly rare and highly sougt after.
---
No, being in a group doesn't matter. Recent update made it so the rest of the group no longer automatically gets targeted for PvP if one person decides to attack. Are you sure you had pacifist turned on? If you ignored him instead of seeking revenge, then he shouldn't have been able to do anything to you if you didn't retaliate. Something is fishy about that guy. As for your camp though, there is a way people manage to destroy them without you being there.
---
It's definitely bugged, but it would be cool if we could go underground and find a giant cluster of them all hanging upsideown.
---
Is it a guaranteed spawn?
---
joining a party you can get access to all the ip's in that party
---
and who might u be
---
On ps4...
---
Noted. I just yelled at some guy for one shotting everything in that event. He was trying to grief me for not moving from one of the positions in the first diagram. That being said, accidentally finished off a couple mobs because I just got a VATs fixer I was trying out and I'm not exactly perfect with it, and I think he expected me to one shot half of the mobs. Maybe he was looking for an excuse to be a dick or something I dunno. Events like this are why I never cared for MMO.
---
Always wanted a multiplayer fallout. Preordered the game. Extreme disappointment after the initial few weeks of hype during and after beta. I came back a month or two ago and damn. Game changed a lot, wastelanders should have been a part of the game to begin tbh. I don‚Äôt play anymore bc I was trying to get commander da- forget her name- and it glitched so I couldn‚Äôt give her the quest item. Was cool while it lasted tho
---
Nope, any atom skins which include any you unlock from Nuclear Winter you can't put up for sale and if you go to drop it deletes them.  
---
There was a hack to get around that but I don't know if it still works or was patched out.
---
That's an idea lol

loot them - server hop - repeat

Those coolant caps are always there.
---
I‚Äôm u/AFUSMC74.
---
Why is this in Korean though.
---
No.
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone has completed that challenge... post a screen shot
---
Played Fallout2 first when it got out, and got hooked on the world, atmosphere, and briliant stories and dialogues within. Something about the Fallout world makes you want more of it, so I played every game that was released after. F76 was just an opportunity to play the series together with friends. Couldn't play it much right at start, but got back to it after I heard people liked the new added things.
---
Why?
---
That would be amazing.
---
Get to over level 100
---
I‚Äôm not online at the moment but I will send you both a screenshot when I get on.
---
100% we don‚Äôt need anymore leeching players. One wasteland could balance things out, especially with builds like bloodied and junkies.
---
I‚Äôm 532...I have no storage problems.
---
I'm calling bullshit. First of all what's your platform? If on PC, then I believe it's possible via hacks, but not the story on console.
---
Firstly, your team doesn't aggro automatically outside of specific workshop instances (your buddy can be freely attacked in your workshop by a contester as well as you.) But outside of that it is 1v1 so you had to be seeking revenge or shooting him.
---
Secondly, pacifist doesn't cause you to take "reduced damage from him" if you're in PvP you're flagged, if not, you aren't. There is no slap damage anymore.
---
Thirdly, level means nothing literally. Especially with all the XP exploits. I could easily mop you with my level 35. I've also been mopped by level 20-40 toons when I'm on my main. Gear and perks are what matters, along with tactical decision. Which you made a poor one when deciding to fight in your camp.
---
i was able to get it cheap and wanted to see if it was as bad as everyone was saying.
---
my second getting into it was to see if wastelanders made it collectively better.
---
I saw that lethal was .5 miles and range was either 1.5 or 2.5 miles. Didnt see where there would be an issue.
---
Don‚Äôt see booby traps there. We all know you can lock them.
---
I have been playing since beta also, but my son is little an my no 1
---
I didn‚Äôt.  Do you know if the intercepting the hunters gives more rep?
---
He said you need a private server and friends server. I dont have a private server.. or a friend to play this with lol. So this wont work for me. Good area though. Also i think people are saying this is server hopping and it doesnt work no more
---
You can give Urban the Forest paint but not the other way around, including the mask. Both options on the workbench say No Paint and isn't visibly different in the menus.
---
Too bad the only other choices for scout armor are hiding it, covering it in regurgitated Taco Bell, or cosplaying grass.
---
Did it a week ago aswell. So satisfying! Congrats!
---
It's a great feeling until you realise they are some of the easiest missions to run to get treasury notes. They can all be completed in minutes.
---
how?
---
NV
---
Thanks I will scope it out tonight
---
Correct and so is aluminum, copper, concrete and every other thing you can smelt at a chemistry station.
---
I was at a SBQ event and this guy was playing Eye of The Tiger on repeat throughout the whole battle. Wtf.
---
But the Circle of Error Probability was 2 miles.
---
Level 530 something. Played nearly every day since launch. 
---
Haven't looked at my hours played in a while. Probably approaching 3000.
---
Agreed, the PA needs some buffing to make it more viable all round.
---
The Red Rocket Garage pre-fab? It‚Äôs definitely listed in misc, all the pre-fab structures are.
---
Awesome intel! Ty
---
Rolling around with both Gauss guns feels gooooood lol
---
That's 1000x better than the gold grill
---
A popular thing to do from what ive noticed is help out low levels an alternative is to come up with an interesting minigame and offer up prizes to the winners, ive seen a few people do raffles and i know as a winner of one that they are really nice, im closing in om this point too where i have aquired all the riches that i could want all im looking for now is a few different weapons and apparel except caps im level 180 and have never gotten max caps but thats because i buy weapons from vendors a lot.
---
Try being a longshot sniper build, really spoils the immersion when you have to get close enough  to the building so that the windows and walls render enough to actually see the enemies hidden in them.
---
Absolutely this one keeps me up at night
---
Thanks for the intel!
---
im not gonna go into detail here or anywhere but is actually really easy the just download some crap online and use that
---
Yes, part of the legion of gamepass players
---
They are going to fix it with patch 21 so hurry!
---
Looks good. üëç

Same here, for killing 1010 robots with energy weapons...

Love that idea. Assaultron...sentry bot.  Hell, even a Colonel Gutsy.  Or a Fat Man turret.
---
Nice. I still need to take advantage of this X2 xp weekend.
---
where did you hear that
---
im not a "survivor" yet they are still going
---
I'm still having this issue. When the daily for building doors was around, I couldn't attach it to the greenhouse as someone else said. Now I'm trying to just remove it to build something new and am getting the same error. Have tried entering and exiting the build menu. Have tried scrap vs store. Have removed everything in it/on it that I can tell and nothing works.
---
You still make your own ammo? Why?
---
Has anyone else experienced it you ask. If you'd just searched this sub or googled it you'd have seen that there are tons of posts about it.  I've only been looking at posts here for the last 10 minutes and this is about the 10th post about this issue.
---
1 mile range and 2 mile CEP? That just seems wrong. I also couldnt find that in the link. I only found that the accuracy was low.
---
This helped me so much, thanks! As long as one is on a floor (hanging off the edge slightly) you can snap other pieces to it floating in midair and it doesn't mind. I was super frustrated til I read this; now I've pretty much got it!
---
I need this yesterday
---
I have all the serum recipes, etc. I'm collecting all the high tier plans I need, helping out newbs with my old legendary gear I no longer need (sometimes Robin Hood style, like you said, lol), and buying up the scrap I need for repairs. Ballistic fiber scrap is the bane of my existence, I stfg.
---
I don't think so. I try and follow the cheating scene to protect myself and I do not believe this true.
---
Original DoD specs...I have them around here somewhere.
---
Only if you put no thought into it.
---
A slow trickle of ATOMs can indeed be something that encourages a user to finally spend money, as shown by many, many games with an RMC economy.
---
If you could earn ATOMs at a rate of 5 bullion per, you could get 40 extra ATOMs a day, +60 per week (Smiley does 300 bullion?) for 340 ATOMs a week. Still less than what was being supplied by the old challenge system. Obviously this number is just an example, and could be changsd (eg, 10GB:1A would see the player earn 170 atoms per week via this suggested method).
---
So it would take 5 weeks (~35 days) with those numbers to earn enough currency to afford a pack that is typically only available 7, 14 or 20 days before going in the vault.
---
Assuming of course that the player logged in every day and exchanged for bullions
---
You‚Äôre welcome.
---
The idea of a fallout where I could pvp. 
---
Really that was such an innovation for the series,it instantly hooked me. In the beta I also had mad fun at workshops at lvl 5.
---
Obviously that was also the last time I had fun in pvp and basically never even attempted to try pursuing the pvp meta,as it seems totally boring and skill less to me.
---
Not sure about you but I did my first silo before level 50 and I hadnt even finished building a full set other than the excavator. Flux isnt that easy to get if your not in the end game is what I'm saying, they might not have caps to buy it and the enemies in nukes get farmed by high levels making it harder for them to get that first jetpack.
---
I was grinding xp with my friend on his private server, it was just easier to post it and check for a response later when I went into adventure.
---
588 hours and level 398 , still enjoying the game, i even surprised myself
---
One of the old vault raids gave basically unlimited acid if you went on the untimed difficulty and got to the last room that has kinda a horde mode. If you were melee and didn't have to spend ammo on it, you probably have 100K+ acid.
---
I renamed my mini gun the ‚ÄúMini-Fun‚Äù 
---
now joining a grognak axe called ‚ÄúRandom Axe of Kindness‚Äù
---
then don't believe just search for 5 minutes and see
---
I just do it on public server and it's working. I don't have F1st sub or friends with it. Just try it you will see it works.
---
If you haven't done Nuclear Winter now's the time, the special unlocks from Halloween, Winter and Survivors are unlocking now. Double XP helps with that, tho the last unlock for winter (Fur-lined jacket and jeans) takes 14k XP.
---
Your welcome.
---
Congratulations I myself finally hit max for both a couple days ago raiders was easily done but settlers was a pain.
---
I've made a ticket for this and they closed it a few hours later and all i got was a response in which they said that they are aware of the S.C.O.R.E. issues. But this is not related to that...
---
It's very easy to look at that at it's surface level and move on, but it's important to remember that there *is* a reason so many games give out consistent trickles of RMC in games.
---
It isn't generosity.
---
Edit: in addition, I know many people -some personally and some who have shared concerns- who love Fallout, but find the Legendary Run offputting compared to the slow trickle of ATOMS. These people are expressing boredom at the current systems and change they did not want in the product they bought.
---
This was a suggestion I thought would fix that and minimally breaking anything (assuming an exchange of 10GB:1A it would still take ~5 weeks to earn a bundle, which typically has a shelf life much shorter than that time), and even making use of a currently limited rewards system.
---
And we're talking about speed running/glitching for speed. You shouldn't expect to jump right into it. Your build isn't even finished at 50
---
Over 800 hours
---
5 characters levels: 89, 163, 127, 52 (nuclear winter character), and 14 (created just for seasons and easy leveling)
---
Found a camp that seemd legit, waljed up to the vendor and suddenly the garage door closed behind me and the ceiling covered in punji board came down. 
---
I went back and the trap wasnt reset, so I took my stuff i dropped and bought what i wanted. Thought it was funny and havent found a trap camp since.
---
4500 hours, levels 580, 340, 128, 78
---
Simple, get a month of Fo 1st and pack as much shit in the scrap box as humanly possible.
---
Yo interested in this üëÄ would love to learn how you guys farm and do these runs so quick too so I can spread some love throughout nukeless servers
---
You recommend keeping demo expert equipped for this reason (some damage isn‚Äôt showing) or would you replace it with something else?
---

---
I've been playing fallout since it was turn based on PC, I really started getting into it with Fallout Tactics.
---
The actual pond might have some Floaters so careful there. From the spawn point just keep going straight ahead &amp; you'll see it. It's down a small slope. I have the Log Cabin set &amp; had my heart set on making a super cool cabin type camp but the ground is a bit uneven right where the node is so I couldn't fit my cabins nicely. If you get lost, google for the Fallout 76 Interactive Map. You can use it to find anything you want by unticking things you don't want to see. It's amazing. I have it bookmarked. If I find it using this phone, I'll post the link, its so useful.
---
Edit: found it! https://fo76map.com/ Just 'Hide All' then go to Resources, check 'Acid' and it will mark all Acid nodes on the map for you üëçü§óüòÅ
---
We shouldn‚Äôt have to pay for more storage. I find that kind of decision to be anti consumer and predatory in nature.

My contribution from a few months ago where the outdoor reflection map isn't just shiny, but outright broken with the same striped cubemap. Reports fro others is this one seems to be an bug on AMD GPUs

You are incorrect sir, no need to double down.
---
Lunchboxes also give buffs like less hunger/thirst. 
---
This is absolutely p2w. 
---
Hahaha, love it
---
That didnt stop me and wont stop other people. The fact is simple yours is good if you have a keypack the others are good both ways. Not sure why you're trying to fight me on this like I told you that you're wrong or something, I only gave a more accessible option
---
Explosives. Grenades and launcher type weapons.
---
Unarmed as a close range alternative.
---
Also makes me wonder if I should even have adrenaline for this build if my damage is capped
---
If you need any aid or plans, hit me up and I'm more than happy to help. Idk how much I'll be playing tonight but I'll at least be on to do my dailies.
---
92 I've rarely bought stuff with my atoms so I had a sh!t  ton of atoms so I went from rank 24 to 90 been doing challenges since for the last few ranks.
---
Excavator - DR 240, ER 240, RR 360 at level 45.
---
T51 - DR 454, ER 454, RR 305 at level 50.
---
For pure resistances, T51 is better. Excavator just has the added benefit of extra 100 carry weight when you're wearing the full set. Personally I only carry around the power armor in case I get overencumbered by weapons and armor just so I can fast travel to camp or a vendor.
---
Yeah man what‚Äôs your username on social? I‚Äôve got a good amount of plans, currently working on doing the hunting cabin mission
---
It‚Äôs a reference to an in-game event.
---
if you mean a post apocalyptic setting for a Stardew game check out r/greenproject
---
I'm not trying to fight you on anything. We were discussing speed runs and you come in with low level doesn't have access. You shouldn't have access as a low level but c'mon. Jet pack plans drop like crazy and tag the queen a couple of times and you'll have flux to craft it.
---
Enjoy the buildup to the endgame because it's pure shit once you get there.
---
800 lb storage is plenty. 
---
800+ hour player here. Sure I wouldn‚Äôt mind more, but it is adequate.
---
W8, what is wrong with gunsmith?
---
i assume you assumed im on pc
---
Nice idea, I'm thinking strictly power armor too
---
Unless your stupid ass is in a workshop.
---
No need to search. You‚Äôre incorrect. Please stop making unfounded claims and fear-mongering.
---
Next you‚Äôll be telling us your girlfriend lives in Canada in a town we‚Äôve probably never heard of. And she‚Äôs an actress for movies we‚Äôve never seen.
---
Someone wasn't around when the game debuted with 400 lb storage... which they have now DOUBLED to 800. 
---
Is it 3200 lb of storage as you are suggesting? No. But it's 2x what it was before based on player feedback over the years. One step at a time.
---
I sell repaired cores and launch key cards in my vendors for relatively cheap. Kinda gives me a head warning that someone‚Äôs about to do a run.
---
4 is bugged as well. Had 3, and someone opened another. I server hopped then my 100% disappeared completely.
---
I always stand by the collector and gesture to come here but no one ever listens. Not only are you being greedy, you‚Äôre making the ghouls get stuck behind objects so less of them spawn during the event.
---
That document is at LEAST a year old. 
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUGQ0xvqT-0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUGQ0xvqT-0) this is new. That's just a document with a number. As far as i can see there's no actual evidence shown for it to be 180.  Angryturtle goes into depth about item respawning. Now. While he doesn't actually show evidence of it being 255 i do trust his word simply based on the great lengths he goes to in his videos. Just look at this work in the vid about enemy spawns. That's why i say it's 255. Ya feel me? 
---
BUT whatever. Doesn't effect me if it's 180 or 255. I'm not counting.
---
I was gonna say the same thing but I dislike if the convo would have developed into an argument about basic game mechanics
---
Nonetheless, üëç
---
Congrats! I love getting these things out of the way so I can refocus on enjoying the game. Time gated stuff is like a scape I have to pick until it's gone.
---
Stop hoarding
---
I have to disappoint you and a lot of redditors. SBQ is not worth it during double XP days. During 10-20 minutes SBQ fight you spend a lot of ammo. And the result is random 1-3 star legendary, 2 star armor, 2-3 ultracite plans and the worst part is 4000 XP for SBQ and 6000 XP for event. 10000 XP for 10-20 minutes or 100 SCORE points. For better SCORE result you can run westech, mashball or radrumble.
---
So my compensation is also completed
---
Your gonna have to go with a super sledge then maybe if you use PA. As unarmed in PA is unworkable, I tried it and it's really terrible.
---
Fought her a few hours ago.  She was dead within 5 minutes. Fortunately I still managed to loot her but I imagine others were not as fortunate.
---
When I take the train to work, we pass along some big fields and there's a junkyard in the middle of it. There's even a section of oil barrels and canisters.
---
I just want to place my camp there.
---
Same wth
---
You could probably enjoy doing ground control, dealing to the mobs of scorched, and other enemies that appear. You'll most likely not be able to do enough damage to the SBQ to earn a reward, about 1800 I believe, so don't be too concerned if there isn't a huge reward.
---
Honestly, I deal with it by not picking up legendaries I don't need. I have a few other characters who don't have their end game gear yet, so if i see something they need I'll pick it up.
---
Otherwise unless it's an elite or God roll ill leave it, especially if it's heavy and I've already met my day's scrip limit
---
Personally I like Someone To Talk To, but that's just a preference... There's no additional benefit to doing it other than the regular rewards.
---
The creators of that doc provided significant details in how they came to that number. I‚Äôll watch AT‚Äôs video to see if he says he *thinks* it‚Äôs 255 or *knows* it‚Äôs 255.
---
and wolverine skin for moleminer gauntlet.
---
Glad I‚Äôm not the only one who makes jokes
---
Need this 10 days ago lol
---
YOU WA SHOCK !
---
That doesn't really change anything other than that in addition to being encrypted the traffic is also passing through Microsoft or Sony both of whom have decent ddos protection as well.
---
It was half price on steam 3 weeks ago so I bought it. Steam let's you play up to 2 hours and still get a refund so I thought I would try it out and if it was good awful I'd refund. Kept playing though all day. l  Didn't know it was coming to gamepass though so could have saved a little bit of money.
---
Ah. I'm a full power armor build so I think I'll stay with what I got cos it's not like I need the extra 100 cos if I do go over my weight limit I got my survival tent
---
Yep if you were to ever come across an enemy that is invincible and just standing there I suggest shooting it without demo expert then with it and you'll see the perk is indeed raising the numbers. I myself would make a video for you but I don't have that gun otherwise I would.

The damage isn't capped
---
That's a good one but likely too expensive to license.
---
Your welcome
---
Yeah, this kid is either gravely mistaken or just trolling for reactions.
---
He is talking about bugged ones from limited time events that are currently rewardable.
---
No. I shall hoard forever
---
ddos attacks are very common on consoles do alittle research
---
The doors look the same but the text doesn't, open door or Appalachia. Maybe look before pressing the button. But yeah, the load times do suck.
---
Thank you for leaving real tips and honestly i cant believe people really just hide in a bush, takes away from the fun of actually engaging in fights (just my opinion)
---
nothing
---
Hm. Deleted your account. That was a bold move.
---
Workshops are laughably easy to repair. This isn‚Äôt ark survival and you‚Äôre getting raided on top either lol.
---
the secondary effect of slowing weapon degradation is bugged apparently
---
I swear i think of Mario everytime i see someone with it
---
okay
---
Biz's can give you some new recipes and the Red Ant Lager is nice for keeping 1 on you for when you're overweight and need to map somewhere to scrap or sell stuff. It adds 50 carry weight but only for 1 minute. 
---
The one at the Pumpkin House is super easy, equip green thumb and you can get 10 pumpkins behind the house. Then just north of there you can do the one for collecting Red Rocket protectron cores at the same time.
---
No need to get into an argument about this. It's possible looting rules have changed in Wastelanders. I wish [Angry Turtle's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUGQ0xvqT-0&amp;t=277s) had shown a more thorough test to specifically compare 180 world objects vs. 255 world objects + containers, but he didn't acknowledge it at all.
---
From watching the video, by my count, it appears he barely looted enough for 255 world objects + containers (difficult to keep up with the speed sometimes, and there were cuts at the end). But the video showed quite a number of world objects were available again (which would support the rule being a lower number of world objects, such as 180). However, the ammo box at the beginning being populated again does seem to support a combined world objects + containers list, as he didn't appear to have looted 60 containers.
---
I feel a more thorough test would be needed to confirm one way or the other.
---
/u/Rammadeus
---
Yooo that is so badass how you reported him!
---
It's a bugged (magical) effect causing massive damage on shotguns. There are a few others like that. You can drop all shotgun perks and still one shot everything.
---
Check this out. He says he‚Äôll come back with a screenshot... then deletes his account.
---
What is with people recently on this sub?
---
He deleted his account.
---
That answers that, then.

---
The supermutants at west tek are pretty good for xp farming

Just the fact that it's fallout. That's it.

Oh yeah like it‚Äôs worth the effort to track someone down and get them arrested because they hit you offline lmao
---
352, after about a thousand hours. Maybe around a hundred of that was on other characters, the main two of which are levels 30 and 77
---
Hey just saw this. 
---
I can delete if not allowed, it was on PC so im not sure if that stops people from messaging. 
---
Whats the point in playing if you're gonna do that but...wherea the fun?
---
It's such a stupid perk for "pvp" in this game
---
He does seem rather adamant it's 255. But like i said. I'm not counting. Sometimes it glitches anyway and i can loot stuff i just looted again. I do asylum runs many times a day (still need the red) and i usually grab the junk near the lift and on the 4th floor if i find a coloured uniform. And sometimes the stuff i back next server hop or a few later.
---
Fallout 3 and 4 got me into 76  but also the opportunity to play alongside other ppl but after completing everything things got boring i was thinking about quitting but one day i joined a friends world to see if he had some chems for sale for my junkies build and i met this girl he was playing with the most amazing girl üòä we became best friends and fo76 hasn't been boring since ‚ò∫

Wow that is such a cool map, an instant bookmark for me. I've never seen it before. There's even a vault I never found, what the heck...
---
As true as that may be, you have yet to explain how you personally could have been targeted as in order to be the target you need the destination ip address or hostname neither of which are possible to retrieve especially via console without some extremely sophisticated tools and the knowledge to reverse engineer the encrypted data.
---
That basically means it not effective to waste time trying, hence this conversation.
---
Its okay to admit you are wrong, its part of becoming a more mature person. The only person you hurt by spreading bad info is yourself and others who do not know better.
---
I see it this way... I work full time. I have savings. My kids are fed and healthy. Bills are paid. I don't drink. I don't smoke. I don't buy nice cloths (just work cloths). I don't go to bars. I don't go to clubs. After it's all said and done.
---
I buy atoms.
---
It's safer. It's ultimately cheaper. Probably healthier (minus sitting on my a$$). It's my thing and I don't hear any complaints.
---
You'll only unlock a mod when it tells you what mod you've unlocked when scrapping. That notification is a bug.
---
Certain effects on weapons are broken at the moment, or magical as it's called in the first comment. 33 vats hit, limb damage, bashing damage can activate this, to where you can one shot most tough enemies in vats. I have also heard if you have less limb damage on armor it can activate it as well. Certain prefix weapons are said to cause this as well. 
---
I would direct you to a YouTube creator called Angry Turtle. He does detailed videos on this issue, plus many other amazing videos. Hope this helps.
---
250 on main that I started at launch and level 10 on the character I had during beta. I play on Xbox and I am at 700 hours now
---
Highest level I saw was 777 on faschnat event
---
There‚Äôs also a spot near the fissure site south of Foundation/Spruce Knob that you can get both a lead AND acid resource node if you are creative about placing your camp halfway down the cliff. Need to be good to go with scorchbeast and friends attacking your camp fairly regularly, though.
---
Played 1, 2, tactics, 3, new vegas, and 4.... it was just chronological. Have been here since B.E.T.A. with a little over 800 hours of playtime now and my love of the series all started 17 years ago in high school borrowing 1/2 from a friend.
---
I've been using it for a while. It's so great if you feel like upping sticks &amp; relocating but want a node to farm. I've found some cool places to set up because of this map üëç
---
Please elaborate. My wife and I are just starting. What am I missing.
---
I'm not sure that map is right. Only 8 keys? 1 Nuka Cola? 7 melee weapons? 6 plans?
---
46, halfway to 47. Mighta been further along but I got the auto-complete bug one day last week. Hoping they up the dailies over the next few weeks, as it‚Äôs gonna take forever if they keep it at the 1500 or so they‚Äôve had it at.
---
Sounds like the typical ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how the game works so I‚Äôm going to go cry on Reddit about PvP‚Äù post.
---
there's a LOT in that golf club. I didn't realise how much until he mentioned it. There must be easily 50 items in that first room alone. If i could be bothered i would loot 181 items in the golf club then hop and see if the first thing i picked up respawned.
---
You can't
---
You can't add stars.... They are legendary effects.
---
There's the ghillie paintjob for the SS armor, and atomic onslaught for the SS power armor 
---
There was datamined clandestine paints for both as well. Just blackout in color like the skins for the gauss weaponry
---
Harpers ferry?
---
Also, distant thunder (it can be super fast)
---
I just recently decided to mostly focus on one char. I'm at rank 68 I think.
---
Unless u mod which I don‚Äôt recommend
---
I know where you're talking about. It's potentially deadly if the spawn point of the CAMP is in the wrong place LOL. I get my lead from Lucky Holes Mine. Use the Excavator PA &amp; walk out with around 350 to 400 lead ore every time.
---
Or it's right and just not a complete listing of every single thing in the game. If you mouse over the marker it tells you exactly what the POI is for.
---
you cant add stars, stars are legendary effects that drop from enemies with stars next to their name (1*-2*-3*) and the amount of stars determines the best legendary you can get from them, 1*-only 1* legendaries . 2*- 1* and 2* legendaries. 3*- 1*,2*, and 3* legendaries, and also if you're having trouble doing damage try to get a good bloodied weapon for whatever your build is :)
---
Thanks for this tip. I get hit by that damn bug a lot and its caused me to miss some good events and leave good servers when trying to fix it. Ill try that next time
---
it really isn't hard but i guess you are just trying to discredit me lol
---
Currently sold out. I restock cores (along with Stillwater Special and Steeped Ash Rose Tea) on private server before hopping onto adventure mode. Next restock Wednesday around midnight Pacific time.
---
Exactly. After complete a challenge it shows the atoms earned in that session, not adding to the base amount you had. Entering the shop or restarting the game makes that base amount appear and nothing else. So annoying ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Not just that but also plans for 100+ caps which are maybe worth 30 at most.

Here is a clip from my stream where my XBOX party was dropped and shortly after my XBOX was disconnected from my internet.  Goods thing for me i have 2 ISPs so the stream kept going and i was able to clip this.  The individual has been reported multiple times by myself, people in my party, and other within my chat who witnessed this petty act.
---
In the walls section. I believe under the other atom shop walls. Icr the name, nice looking wood one :/
---
It's blocking damage on armor that makes any shotgun magic.
---
That's showing guaranteed spawn locations only. Nuka Cola has random spawns all over the place so rather than confuse, it's doing guaranteed locations.
---
Seems a little severe lol
---
2700 hours, 5 high level characters, inventory management is an art that should be cultured.
---
Thankfully I'm never full on gunpowder cause it takes 12 to craft 100 .50 ammo which my Final Word uses a LOT of, I hate constantly getting mini nukes and missile launchers too, I need to sell some of my stimpacks/purified water
---
I‚Äôll test it myself one day, but the lead &amp; plastic gathering route I use refreshes continually. I was pretty sure I set it to be around 200 individual items so I could run it like that. Perhaps I miscounted or don‚Äôt realize that I tend to grab extra things along the way. 
---
But the document in question has been updated regularly, and since Wastelanders. There are references to Floaters, for example. And Spruce Knob citations have been edited. 
---
It‚Äôs not a static document.
---
What do the lunch boxed even do, exactly?
---
The gillie paintjob is terrible. I don't want to run around looking like Old Greg. I wish they'd put out normal paints for the SS armor. I'm just tired of the gun metal gray. There aren't any paints for either machine guns.
---
Then there's no point in an interactive map if it has only 6 of litterally triple if not quadruple digit items. Just saying it's probably better to just Google what your looking for.
---
I have alts who store my junk legendaries. I look at them almost like a grain silo but instead holding my scrip. I have three characters all above 50 that can move these if needed via scrip. These characters can go to the legendary vendor and roll new ones (hopefully good ones. If I start getting low on legendaries (won't happen for a while) I start to reduce who scrips to one. I have a bunch of amazing weapons doing this that I'm soon ready to trade for things I like (I love a good vampire weapon or weird weapons like rolling pins). 
---
For me throwing things out isnt good for me or other players. If I can roll great legendaries that I never use I can get them into hands of players who can use them.
---
new account interesting
---
As we all know, the quality assurance teams consists of.
---
One standing gorilla &amp; one sittng. That is all.
---
I agree. A simple ‚ÄòOops, I was mistaken‚Äô would have sufficed.
---
It can be. Just scroll. Transfer all junk just doesn't move it because it's a misc resource. I have gunpowder in my stash box.
---
Does that make it any less of a problem?

Exactly what they say in the effects tab.

I want them cards though. I always keep 15 cores on me.

Ever use the other sub that can't be named here? It's a great place for that.  It rhymes with barket76.
---
Thanks for creeping on my profile!
---
And what happens when those extra dailies autocomplete?
---
My main is 315.  I also have a 225, a 176, a 114, and a lvl 92 with 2600 hours played total.
---
Hmmmm! Didn't realise it had been updated. Nice.
---
I used it today to decide on the new spot for my CAMP. I have been just south of Morgantown since the start of my playthrough so I wanted to change it up for a bit. I found a pretty good spot with a lead deposit.
---
Bizarre.
---
Also, some things are meant to be found by way of main &amp; side missions, especially keys, so it's not going to show those things.
---
How long did you wait after taking them?
---
Bandolier rank 2 makes 5mm weigh nothing so I'm just stockpiling it. 68k and counting. Same goes for .45, 63k of that currently. I will point out that most of that was bought from player vendors though.
---
330 and 1200 hours in I think
---
Ya I've never looked there I just see weird shit on my screen when one gets opened lol.
---
Why exactly is this? There are clearly 5 stars labeled. But can only get 3.
---
Why Grey out the other two?
---
They give 25% XP bonus for 1h (stacking) and give a small bonus to damage vs mob types or decrease hunger gain. The XP bonus maxes at 100% (4 boxes) but if you get a 5th bonus, the XP bonus stops to work until you have 4 or less bonuses active. So if someone opens 5 in a row (or several people at the same time), then you're shit out of luck for the next hour and only get regular XP.
---
Is there a reasonable reason to be toxic about it? You could tell I am not an expert on the game and I am venting out some frustration about a system I personally consider flawed. Sure FO76 PvP has got to be very fun for those interested in engaging in it and I am not even salty about dying and getting my junk stolen. But I am a positive that pacifist was on, that I also blocked the player engaging us, getting my camp and our collective effort as a group vandalized by someone repeatedly I think it's fair to say it's not something I would recommend. 
---
Differently would be if we actively engaged in the PVP like if it was something we wanted, then let it all go you know because it's what we engaged on. But trying to pacifically play the game and not engage on someone it's ridiculous that they are able to destroy everything it's enabling higher level people or those who have longer to effectively kill any possibility of new players influx due to this abusive conduct. 
---
I reckon you probably think I am just whinny and you are entitled to have this judgement of me, but please how about not generalize and perhaps offer up some constructive criticism or satire. 
---
Something like: " well obviously since you don't know how PVP works you got wrecked, don't come complaining about it. It's the post apocalypse if someone is higher level and kills you just hop server and forget or you know get educated on this topics. I can link you to X, Y, Z get informed and then post". At least that way you'd be offering some education, context and eliminating this " I don't know how the game works so I'm going to go cry on Reddit about PvP" posts that seem to trigger you.
---
I have this problem as well. Newer player who started when it came on gamepass for pc so I sort of complete challenges randomly while exploring, have probably lost a few 100 so far. Sent a ticket but the first response I got back was about the score issue so I just replied back now. Hopefully it gets fixed and we are able to get those atoms back.
---
Was 130 something in 3 months. Then I got banned in the last dupe wave. Made a new account and am level 43 or something in the last 3 days.
---
It‚Äôs the same bullshit that happens if you use death claw steak ribeye steak and then try and use a pepperoni roll it will cancel two of them out. So annoying and then with the lunchboxes it‚Äôs even worse
---
Agree. We weren‚Äôt hanging up on him
---
I put this on the forum and got a generic 'submit a ticket' response.
---
you're telling me theres a hack tool you can aquire right now that allows you to reverse engineer player ip addresses via proximity on console? How would that even work? 
---
Do you understand how silly that sounds especially since you cannot provide any technical information or proof?
---
What do you mean dead spawn
---
Love doing it for people :)
---
Nice üëç Although, if you never want to run out of lead, use the Excavator PA, go to Lucky Holes Mine &amp; you'll walk out with about 350 to 400 lead ore. You'll just need plenty of Acid to smelt it all down!
---
I think each one increases xp by 25% and there's some fun cosmetic effects like confetti explosions and ones that decrease thirst and hunger game, increased resistances and increases carry weight.
---
Yeah I was searching day I got it and yes it‚Äôs in a whole different section. So annoying
---
33 Vats makes it magic / bugged in vats.
---
It's really annoying.
---
https://nukacrypt.com/solved
---
More importantly, why didn't they hotfix this already! We're 3 weeks into patch 20...
---
Because harassing players that are exceptionally lower levels than you and generally being a twat is "how PVP works"?
---
I like the Camden Park ones - they're really low effort but yield a solid amount of XP. 
---
Queen of the Hunt is pretty solid as well, plus it's one of the easiest ways to knock out the "Kill a Cryptid" challenge if it's a S.C.O.R.E daily. I also do Heart of the Enemy and the repeatable pioneer quests most days.
---
So you guys are just getting dced? What makes you think the player is triggering this?
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm too lazy for that. I get more than enough lead from my unlocked, well highlighted extractor. 
---
Before I moved to a different lead node, I got more than enough acid as well and Scorched waves provide steel from their weapons, so the thing I was most in need of to craft ammo was cloth, of all things :)
---
If it's the XP you want it seems too many people want to get the event over as fast as possible and they bring their ultra power build. A 2 minute scorched earth with no big scorched spawns only gives the treasury notes and random flux, and minimal XP. You get around 1000xp from the event which is what, not even 1 scorched deathclaw with double xp?
---
Let the queen land as much as she wants, drag the battle out and keep her at a quarter bar of health until the 2 minute mark, 5 if you're afraid she'll fly around too much. Get those creature spawns if you want xp
---
you can store the gunpowder and the ore in your stash box. just move it
---
I've been saving mine until the next legendary event. I always anticipate bugs and this one I was right.
---
Thank you everyone! I was misled, apparently. That‚Äôs disappointing. Im still trying to figure out how to do a build, as well. I completed all the quests a while back and got a bit bored, but I‚Äôve decided to try to build my guy up properly. Also, it‚Äôs pretty fun to run around giving stuff to noobs. That‚Äôs nice.
---
So is grim reapers sprint
---
Contemporary builds kinda fixed this issue for me. No longer see any grass in the floor, as my foundations are 4 feet higher up.
---
Thanks. Super helpful
---
I really don't understand why this isn't hotfixed already. The lunch boxes are a prominent reward in the season and this bug makes them useless...
---
tl;dr. Nice rant tho
---
Hear hear.
---
he jumped in the party and basically announced it then we all lost connection but yea just a coincidence
---
When you exit into the pipe room go to the left pick the lvl3 door, in the next room hack the terminal. Bypass the safety lockdown.
---
I do, and it takes up space. I want to store it in my fallout 1st junk stash, which has no limit
---
good to know this isnt just me, I seen the  msg 2 or 3 more times and I got nothing.
---
It's so infuriating... They should have hotfixed it already, as the lunch boxes are a prominent reward during the season. And this bug makes them useless... üòë
---
Yup, I try to get out in the open whenever possible to get her down on the ground.  It seems to work pretty well it you just move around the general area outside where people are bunched up and engage her a bit to get her attention.  So much easier to inflict damage.
---
I usually try to rack up 5 key cards before logging back into adventure mode and sell for 100 caps each. That sound like a fair price? Would also exchange for screws. I‚Äôm on Xbox, gamer tag TeaGeek.
---
I said he doesn‚Äôt know how the game works, not specifically PvP. He has a lot of things he obviously needs to work out, so next time when you reply, try to properly read what I said before you get all hot and bothered lol
---
was probably intended to be future content after the game was super successful
---
You use to be able to add one star to a weapon by modding it with something specific. Like the sacrificial blade for the machete, or a prime receiver on a gun. That was ages ago and got patched out. Assuming they will add more stars to weapons/armor much much later in the lifespan of the game.
---
If you're bloodied it keeps you from getting hit in melee and dying easily. That's the advantage.
---
I think I'll be doing the same. This bug sucks so much... üòë
---
Nah just a glitch and a blueprint
---
It's PC and feel free to call bullshit, I didn't make a post to prophetical speak about "truth" I wanted to vent and discuss with some folks about it perhaps even learn some things I don't know. 
---
Anyways. You are right I have been learning about PvP and the changed that have been done to it recently, however the situation is highly atypical considering we were not actively engaged on PvP with this solo person. 
---
I have confirmed and yes our friend did click on revenge expecting some sort of bounty to go up for this player. But myself I did not engage, did not enter PvP, was not in a workshop and still got 1 shot by his cryolator.  Not once, but 3 times and I was positive I did not shoot, was not in a PvP event or anything. Regardless of it being cheats or exploits all I think is that I really shouldn't take any damage unless I engaged and it sounds like that is the current update. However I still died to this dude in one shot so Idk what was going on with that guy.
---
Well let me start streaming again and pull another clip.  Also a mass DC for multiple people in one party occurring at the same time in different parts of the US...highly unlikely.  I respect your comment/opinion but regardless this is petty and typical from the script kiddie community; upvote if you know what that is LULW
---
Easier to just go into the pip boy at this point honestly
---
To add on to this. If you‚Äôre not using the key cards ask at the event if anyone wants them. Helps us run more and faster. Thanks all!
---
T51 has better resistance then T60 it's really close to X01 and ultracite.
---
Are West Tek, Burrows, &amp; Whitesprings viable for a Lvl 66 player who has done barely any quests &amp; has mostly non-Legendary weapons like a Lvl 50 combat shotgun that does 90 damage or a Marksman Sniper Rifle.
---
Honestly no idea what *good* guns most people should have by lvl 66 but I've mostly been spinning my wheels when it comes to playing actual content beyond killing mobs &amp; running Forest/Toxic Valley events because my brother &amp; I have been waiting to play together &amp; he's been super busy lately.
---
I also don't wanna end up *dead* as hell going to one of these places.
---
Update: the answer is -- take a fuckton of stimpaks, radaway, rad-x, med-x, etc. because my guns suuuuuck.
---
For all the comments above/below, "Cain And Able", nuff said, that's why you never join a party on the Xbox.
---
Whatever you think is fair. Thank you.
---
It works, thanks
---
Thats a hacked weapon.
---
Give everything away
---
I've been playing so much Fallout my dreams have been having loading screens lol (I'm not actually joking on this one, was a really weird dream)
---
Finally hit ally with the settlers the other day. Hit raiders first. It‚Äôs a good feeling. Congrats.
---
Yeah I've got a fully nodded set of all of them but I keep my t51 in my inventory. I keep my t65 in progress, it's coming along. Just slowly
---
Well I‚Äôm glad I haven‚Äôt been the same situation, most people have opened was 3 around me. But I would probably be as heated as you‚Äôre if that happened especially during a queen fight during double xp weekend
---
we were in our own party
---
I think this would be a great idea. It drives me absolutely nuts when the small plants and lumpy dirt clip through the foundations. Maybe even having the option to move the bigger trees to a different spot within the camp building circle would be nice
---
Shoulda had it private.
---
Ah. Unfortunately I'm on PC
---
I feel this... I have all the serums on 2 characters, fully fleshed beast mod weapons, max caps, max scrip, and all bullion rewards I wanted to be bought and earned. I have lvl 100 in NW.  Besides the daily race, I don't know what to do anymore.   
---
Before people say "help new players" I have helped over 100 people get all the way through nuke launches and run a 160+ member Discord (though attendance is like 10ish people nowadays).  
---
I have 22 different and fully fleshed builds (5 accounts) 14 or more are 100+. I just don't know what to do anymore, I love fallout and feel drawn to play it so it isn't as easy for me to just walk away.... I saw a post about photos since beta and since I could also do that and have 1500 photos I may start to make my top albums to share...  
---
Anyway, not an answer for you but just wanted to let you know that you are not alone...
---
I like to switch between them too. I was actually thinking of making a full set of T45 just for something different. I'm level 280 on my PA character.
---
Probably it's how it works with some exceptionally high lever players, I mean you have to get bored at some point but can't quit and based off this "rich" guy's demeanor clearly there's people of all sorts that play the game, some more agreeable some more toxic. But all the power to this player. If that's how this player considers the game should work that's fine, I rather not engage clearly by the above comments I am shown this person isn't interested in discussing and is instead aroused by ad hominem and satire so it's fine.
---
You need to fast travel to the event marker which will place you by fissure site prime. That‚Äôs the only way I‚Äôve been able to fix it.
---
Yes drop them. If you don't have alts or mules you cant do much else.
---
Level 205  with 308hours
---
I am still not sold on this spot so maybe somewhere with an acid deposit could be an option but I still have plenty of acid. I am now somewhere south next to Lewisburg. But I always quite liked the north of the map for a CAMP, maybe I'll find a good spot there somewhere
---
You *can* put wallpaper on walls with windows.
---
It is. Glowing meat steaks for example. You get tons of it during uranium fever or radiation rumble, just need to tag mobs. Or clear Harper's ferry. Tons of guns there (mutants or scorched) and free states vendor to sell all of them
---
5000 hours current characters at 322 ,212,98,96,5
---
I like to do restarts and have shut down moved everything on at least 8 characters with a couple of them being over level 100 also have a secondary account with 3 characters the highest close to 100
---
Why were you banned?
---
I got underground, but I was too close to a river, so it was just water, and I couldn't build my secret entrance, so I gave up, saw a dude on YouTube with a "drop base" and jacked that idea, except I put it behind my "homestead" shop, to act as a front.
---
There's at least one porta potty with a "mysterious button" in it already in game, so if it's not an option for instanced camps, I'll rage. 
---
It's by the... Central Mountain? Lookout, and it's tied in some way to the silos. It pops up as a quest marker for I Am Become Death.
---
top 5 in a BR is a fuckin L dude ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
It was created by using third party tools, something similar to fo4edit if I'm not mistaken.
---
50 of each good? :)
---
Whatever makes you feel better, but this is most certainly not a ddos attack nor do I see any evidence to suggest that you or your friends are being targeted unless the attack is coming from a weakness in the console platform (ps online or xbox live). 
---
I can empathize with frustration about the game as its pretty unstable and I myself crash often on PC. But by declaring with confidence, without evidence that this is what is happening is wrong and you should stop doing it.
---
I'm ahead of the pace and wont be greedy. This and many others are hell. We adapt and overcome!
---
But the pepperoni roll will cancel out the ribeye steak as they both provide an increase to carry weight so won't stack. Not sure why it cancels the deathclaw buffs though.
---
On the second run, the person opening the lunch boxes was doing the lunch box emote before each. People around were doing No emote like crazy when he/she did round 5... And they did still open a 5th anyway. üòë And you can't fast travel away to avoid it, as you're in combat and it takes 15s to travel away (and not get hit... Good luck with that on a queen fight...).
---
People are happy to use the lunch boxes as they should be... But the bug makes it such a bad experience üòñüò° How could such an obvious bug make it past even basic testing...
---
I'm a relative newbie to NW too but from what I've gathered so far: find a route you like where you know there's solid spawns for lootboxes; rad resist is a really good perk to get since you can survive in a nuke zone for a decent amount of time. focus on survival rather than kills for the xp (unless you're out to get the pvp trophies, in that case go right ahead). 
---
best weapons i've used so far are the crossbow (silent), any automatic weapon, shotguns and the m79 grenade launcher. if you find a gauss shotgun + ammo though, you're set up pretty well.
---
for outfits - if you don't have the ghillie suit - I find earthy colours work best - e.g. the raider nomad outfit if you have it, or any kind of camo. also equip a full head covering if you can in case your toon has bright hair. i've been using the raider nomad coat and a mothman cultist hood and its been working fairly solidly. it can give you some breathing room.
---
also: sabotage. if you come across a suit of power armor but you don't want to use it, take the fusion cores so whoever does come across it but does want to use it later can't use it as effectively.
---
I literally just did it. I‚Äôm in my camp, walked up to a window wall, and changed the wallpaper. 
---
Cite your source, please.
---
Fonding Br√∂ther
---
I have noticed this too. I wondered if it had to do with me collecting the atoms from the Legendary Run on the menu instead of in game but I have since disbanded the theory
---
Who the hell downvotes my post? This needs awareness! üòë
---
Better tip use a flaming arrow
---
we have alot of friends that jump in and out of parties all the time we sometimes leave it open to make it easier on all of us
---
That sub is an absolute shitstorm at the moment.
---
I agree with the machine gun
---
But the SS armor should have a straight black paintjob coming
---
Yeah over a long period of time lol. Why you trying to piss on my bonfire. Lmfao.
---
have any phone app like this one? the site run poorly on the phone browser
---
Me too, I think. Rank 56 right now. It's still not even half way to the finish though...
---
Ok kind of figured it was the server but I was a little worried as its my main source of healing.
---
That confetti one sucks.
---
As if bloody mess wasn't bad enough, good luck finding a corpse to loot.
---
Lol, what? Dang. I maxed rep with raiders, never once ran across a legendary. Oh well, this gauss minigun is worth all of it.
---
One tried to get me on a cliffside camp, I'm at the vendor and he removes the flooring panel, I fell to my death obviously, but he didn't expect me to have the 50% revive chance, and lady luck smiled upon me that day. He ran down the cliff to loot my dead body, just stood there and hit him with the angry face and a cheeky heart.
---
Oh wow I've never really used a t45, I'm only level 175 on my main which is a PA build. Not made a mule yet. I use t51 cos it's one of the best and it looks pretty sick with the paints I use
---
Yes, I know, but If I play on Steam, and its still sending my balance points to [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) version of my account when I earn points \*ON STEAM\* Its an issue.  
---
Of which Idk if that is what happening, As I do not play on that account anymore...
---
Ahh I get ya, unlucky.
---
You can no longer engage as a team, which kind of sucks in these situations
---
Feel free to PM any questions you have.  
---
I'll tro to be spoiler free as possible. I always go into a game knowing as little as possible. I learn from what I've done well and my mistakes.
---
Make it a normal wall, put the wallpaper on, then use edit mode to switch it to a window
---
I stand corrected then never knew they changed it
---
Apparently the workaround is to place a blank wall, add the paper, then replace the wall (through the scrap menu) with the windowed one. I haven't tried it myself as I haven't rebuilt my camp in a while, so I am sorry if that's incorrect.
---
I really haven't either. That's why I was thinking about making a set. Just something different. I love the T51. I use it a lot.
---
Honestly sometimes people don't realize they're hitting seek on consoles
---
Buy all the lead and steel from the robot vendors, you can craft tons of ammo ammo and still make a tiny profit if you sell it for a cap a piece.
---
That‚Äôs good, I‚Äôd love to be able to mod up my favorites
---
Except the OP and ensuing discussions here are specific to *PVP*, which means your comment is going to read with *PVP* specifically being considered and with the assumption that's what you're talking about.
---
Otherwise, why would you bother to comment on a post about *PVP*? Hmmm...!
---
it became a a pain when you have 5 3* Fatman waiting the scrap machine to refill. 20 fuckin lb each, is a joke and my stash isn't laughing
---
aye, tovarisch!
---
All of them.
---
I made a PSA saying that atom challenges are bugged and everybody downvoted me. I guesd they'll care when it happens to them
---
How? Also, wouldn't that cause me to lose literally everything I have currently? I don't want to restart :(  
---
(Steam auto-logs in)
---
Because I duped like 80 guns
---
The t45 has quite nice paints. Other than that I've never really acknowledged its existence
---
About 3 days now I can‚Äôt view anything. Ive even gone to the store and searched FO76 and went to the atom shop from there, still no luck.
---
Yeah but I can eat grilled radstag and a ribeye and it won‚Äôt cancel it out but the roll will
---
People usually do it because they want the adventure mode rewards but don‚Äôt like playing NW. If they were removed from NW there would be a lot fewer bush wookies.
---
Tut tut. Naughty
---
&gt; I hope this can be fixed for everyone 
---
You must be new here.
---
Theres no difference in a level 100 and a level 400, all the same info and perks are available to both
---
You don't need to remove anything, click replace, change it to a normal wall, add wallpaper, replace with window again
---
I'd say its worth a try, I haven't had that happen
---
I‚Äôll trust my own eyes over Google, especially when you‚Äôre reluctant to provide a source. 
---
I just tested it again. Placed a brand new structure with a door, a window and two blank walls. 
---
All four let me add wallpaper.
---
What wall and window are you using?  Have you tried making it a normal wall, adding the wallpaper, then editing it back to a window wall?
---
It‚Äôs working for me. Maybe yours is glitched out for some reason.  
---
But I bet it‚Äôs not permanently either, or there‚Äôs a workaround. Or you‚Äôre doing something wrong.
---
Lol.
---
The fact that you are trying this hard to downplay this and call it "Game instability" is evidence that you do not know what you are talking about essentially.  Consoles operate in the same manner as PC's but with regulated APPs and software that typically prevent things like this; but they are still exploitable.  
---
XBOX party chat can be accessed from a PC...thus the fact they are subject to exploits such as this.  The attack occurred right after the individual entered the party chat...you weren't there so your comments will be treated as such; simply opinions form someone who does not play on XBOX.  Might I suggest you add to a discussion within the PC community?
---
I think I‚Äôm living proof the bans don‚Äôt work. Duper‚Äôs just make new accounts and continue to dupe with low key exploits. It is what it is
---
Why are you so upset rn? Are you also one of those people that don‚Äôt know how the game works? Do you also call for griefing restrictions when Bethesda has already put more restrictions in place but numbskulls like you and OP still manage to continuously die and not know why even with more protection? 
---
Get blocked foodie
---
No sorry
---
I like that. Sounds like you earn it and it makes you happy. Cheers bud!
---
Also, it's just gotta be healthier right?
---
You mean when Todd himself physically enters the game and bans the last of the player base in a massive battle royale where you have to fight not only him but hordes of bugs and glitches led by Pete Hines?
---
That is a lot of acid
---
Nerf bush wookies lmao.  Even though I have frog legs there is almost zero benefit from it until the final circle.  I've only been playing NW for about a week and it's stupid easy to make it to the the end solo.
---
Not really sure why killing everything equals less xp than just staying alive here.
---
You had to purchase another copy of the game though correct?
---
Sucks. The devs need to have someone highlight these issues on reddit at least reply so we know its been looked at
---
Ww2 weapons would be neat, especially as new weapons
---
Give the m1 a lil less damage than the lever action but higher firerate and boom its balanced its cool and useful for a lil more aggressive rifleman build (not commando level of aggressive but its own ground) 
---
The thompson is already in the game but would be nice to get a plan for the ww2 magazine instead of the drum mag
---
Maybe an STG and the german MP too 
---
... most importantly though the Garand... an M14 randomly added would be nice as well although way more doubtfull lol
---
Nope all extremely common
---
Sometimes I‚Äôm locked into the sight n cannot perform any other action unless I holster my weapon
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1uXj4ULnrtJJqyIPW7VGPWGQ7966QiaLUi9GXD8Q7FE0/htmlview

Here is a list for outfit rarity though
---
No, all pretty common
---
Civil war one is craftable, or one version is
---
Thanks for the link, I use that site a lot. I am level 181 and I can handle floaters
---
Bloodied in of itself is not op. You need good armor, under armor, a really decent legendary weapon, a good armored/buffed backpack. Even then your still not going to melt queens like that. 
---
Half the fun of FO76 to me honestly is the min maxing. Getting that extra little boost from a new piece of gear, switching out perk cards just so for the right situation, finding that new plan for something you need. There‚Äôs allot of value in that for me. 
---
I really feel it when I switch to an alt and I‚Äôll be like ‚ÄúThe hell? Why can‚Äôt I jump so high or run as fast?‚Äù Really shows your progress. 
---
Yea it‚Äôs nice but it does come with trade offs. Maintaining that perfect balance of 20% health without dying of radiation all the time is a serious pain in the ass.
---
No you just have to make a new PlayStation network account. You need one online subscriptions and as many accounts as you want can play online on your PlayStation.
---
Bethesda was going to put in 5 star weapons and armour but they either put it on hold or scrapped the idea all together
---
Seriously they are the real Mvp‚Äôs of the server but it does help to pitch in too to help everybody in the server.üôåüèª‚ù§Ô∏è
---
56 is a great spot to be! I'm a bit ahead of that but not by much. I think there's a chart where today you have to be ahead of rank 42 or something like that. As long as you're ahead that's best.
---
That works but sadly after server swaping the windows go back to normal.
---
Just record the game when you're about to finish an atom challenge and submit a ticket with proof for now. I got 80 atoms awarded with the screenshot proof after opening a ticket
---
Id love To see the po8 as well
---
Maybe I sit on one of those physical fitness balls and eat a salad while I play üòÇ
---
Unyeliding/bolstering/vanguard armors are usually sought after
---
Ahh I see. PC players like myself would have to purchase another CD key, and create a fresh Bethesda account. (or steam)
---
Yeah they mentioned that but I've never had that happen, so figured it's at least worth a try
---
That‚Äôs exactly how it is my dude

If you check out the discussion OP and I heard lower in the thread, I acknowledged that it was likely a weakness in the console platform services and not a ddos attack. I didnt say the crashing didnt occur or it didnt suck, I was more bothered by OPs insistence it was a ddos attack and his doubling down on the fact that he seems convinced it is.
---
Bethesda bans all player who duped legal weapons, but the ones making weapons like this is still running free
---
 Nope. XBox. 
---
What wall type are you using?
---
Give it a couple days before we're flooded with ecen more "got unjustly banned" topics.
---
It works, but it's gone after server swap. The windows not being able to have wallpapers is a bug introduced with wastalanders.
---
This is goddamn amazing... This is AMV material right here mate, have you thought of doing this with all the different 76 clips like from wastelanders and other songs and whatnot?
---
(My Name by Shinedown is another good song. Or Last One Standing by Simple Plan.)
---
Dang that really sucks. Best play it safe buddy because they dropped the hammer wildly.
---
I know there has ben an issue with CAMPS that are over-budget.  There are issues where you can go over-budget using glitches, and there are times that it happens because Bethesda corrects a budget allocation for some stuff.  Cherry wood floors, for example, were not taking the correct budget when they were made available. So, if you had a bunch of those when Bethesda corrected it then you could be at or over your build budget.
---
It has been posted in the past that when you log-in the game clears your vendors and displays, and then puts that stuff in your stash box. People think this is related to the budget issue, but I've not seen any real confirmation of this.
---
Maybe this is what you experienced?
---
There are so many explosive laser rifles out there that the latest ban wave shouldn‚Äôt affect it too much. Explosive energy weapons have been duped heavily over the past couple years.
---
Sometimes you'll get that when a server is about to die
---
Yeah it would be nice if kills were worth more xp the mode would be way more fun also you could rank up faster then just bush camping for 15 to 20 minutes per match if you make it late game
---
Been broken for about six months now - don‚Äôt expect it will ever get fixed.
---
You're missing a game there.
---
I sent a ticket with proof just to have the ticket closed with no response. I've heard they award the atoms for bugged challenges such as kill tough creatures etc, but apparently now they don't seem to care.
---
I‚Äôll take it
---
with random encounters farming I made half of the last bar with raiders withing 4-5 days. I suggest u to use any advatage to boost ur reputation with raiders bcz the final rewards are 10 times better unless u r completelly not interested in pasive farming of ammo and gauss gatling.
---
Odd. I have definitely seen it working. Seen him pop up a few times at scorched earth
---
I‚Äôve served hopped multiple times today. None of my windowed walls lost their wallpaper. 
---
Maybe it is a glitch, but it‚Äôs not affecting everyone. So the OP‚Äôs rant about ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt use this‚Äô is inaccurate.  They could use it. They‚Äôre just having difficulty using it in exactly the way they want. 
---
Hell, I‚Äôd love to put wallpaper in my workshop building walls. But I can‚Äôt do that either.
---
Here‚Äôs my idea - MASSIVELY buff PA to essentially make it OP but increase fusion core drain to absurd levels to compensate. To the point where spending your entire playtime in it is unfeasible. Like I‚Äôm spending probably 1/3rd of my playtime farming ammo for my gauss minigun, make it similar for fusion cores.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox Ome and just yesterday I was able to place wallpapers on windows however today I tried the same thing and was unable to so I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs just random at this point
---
It's Fallout and that's why I'm here. I've been playing the series since the original game in 1997.
---
I‚Äôve actually tried but the Croco backpack plans are super rare
---
Son, I got Cameleon today. It does not work while hitting. you can¬¥t even move with it. Your confirmation means absolutely nothing.
---
I¬¥m sorry but i¬¥m starting to think you might know exactly what kinda cheat i faced.
---
Please.
---
Noo i dont go over budget for sure, my camp is bare bones just a few display cases and shop. I was sure to not go over budget cause I knew bout the overbudget inventory lag access thing and im not boujee enough to have the floors
---
I'm having some difficulty with my collectrons. I have 3, scavenger, raider and faschnacht. When I use the terminal, it just says "Please choose and option" and nothing else. I have only one option, 'B' to exit. So my raider is stuck collecting chems and alcohol. Any thoughts on how to fix this? (XBOX btw)
---
I can still place wallpaper on my windows.
---
It won‚Äôt matter man.  Bethesda gives zero shits about this game running well and only does damage control when absolutely necessary or if it fucks over atom sales.
---
That‚Äôs the truth to it too, so never expect anything else from them and you won‚Äôt be disappointed again.
---
That makes sense, I was using an explosive effect weapon earlier and the thing was degrading far more rapidly than it should have been. It was all but destroyed after 1 partial run through Whitespring.
---
But you were claiming game instability...backtracking now?  XBOX party chat is separate from the game and the clip shows DC from all XBOX services so explain again your reasoning?????  Because now you're not making any sense.
---
I've been a good boy. I quite enjoy the satisfaction of rolling a dope gun off a legendary. If I could easily obtain them. I wouldn't play the game.
---
Only so much base building you can do if you ain't hunting for guns.
---
My experience was from yesterday so who.knows
---
a stash ? what the fuck is that
---
Ya mostly b2525s and legacies RN, but still a great place to get what you need.
---
Add phones to that list, which are usually with type writers and fans :)
---
You poor thing. You have more than you can spend, but that's not enough for you.     
---
With your attitude, it won't matter if they raise the cap or not, it'll never be enough for you.      
---
Keep playing the victim, you seem to be very practiced at it.
---
About 600-ish hours and level 270.
---
Highest level I've seen personally was someone in the 840's.
---
And here I thought PC was the ‚Äòmaster race‚Äô... ;)
---
Seriously though, try the workaround. You don‚Äôt have to scrap the wall and start over. Edit it to normal wall, add wallpaper, then edit it back. 
---
Best of luck.
---
lol i do these dailies bcz of easy scrip. With ward it takes me 4-5 minutes to complete. (sometimes just 1 min when i got very Lucky)
---
There is a glitch with power amour that lets you faze through any wall and you can skip 2/3rds of the run. I can do it in ten minutes consistently. The worst part is getting the keycard
---
Could be worse, have Preston Garvey as a companion. Every time you get back it‚Äôs another settlement quest.
---
This site can give you a ROUGH idea on prices  [https://fed76.info/weapons/](https://fed76.info/weapons/)
---
pick a weapon and mess around adding different prefixes and minors and majors and you'll soon learn what stuff adds value. You can also check armour
---
What are you talking about? They consistently bang out new content in a week, hence their name, "bugthesda". They just take their time sending it out to people.
---
Telephones have circuitry, no screws. I still pick up every telephone I see too, along with clipboards for their springs, and the wood is a bonus.
---
Sorry then. I‚Äôm out of ideas.
---
Having a lot of friends in your list can make it take longer to load into the game in any mode. I don't know if they ever tried to patch this, but if they did, it didn't work lol
---
Last 2 times I‚Äôve launched a nuke the SBQ has had crazy buffs and everyone at the event couldn‚Äôt kill it. Second time we couldn‚Äôt even get it to mutate :-/
---
Watch the clip bud; also my XBOX keeps DCing...got to [twitch.tv/sojusal](https://twitch.tv/sojusal) and explain to me again how DDOS to consoles aren't possible
---
He shows up for me nearly every time I use VATS.
---
For shotguns + stealth + other perks it‚Äôs very deadly/useful.  For any one hit type weapons I imagine it has its usefulness
---
Curious to know if it‚Äôs literally 1% health damage off and if I longer works
---
Damn, I didn't know this.  I stand on top of a tent because I run bloodied and the mob spawns on the ground are annoying to deal with, especially when a legendary mirelurk queen/king or megasloth come out of nowhere and bop you on the head for instant death.
---
Is there a formula to who the queen focuses on?  I do a hell of a lot of damage, but I've rarely noticed her specifically targeted on me.
---
42
---
Get blocker on any armour piece and then find a weapon with limb damage, faster fire rate, junkies, or a couple other mods ( you‚Äôll have to look those up, but the armor mod plus any one of the other mods is enough) then use vats= easy win.
---
I did it today as well.
---
I'm level 220, and the end game is fine for me
---
Yeah its a Live and Love magazine cover that references the Fallout Universe version of Burning Man, "Nuke-The-Man".
---
I went settlers first because I really liked the camp items, kind of regret it. It'll be worth it when I max raider rep and have all the goodies though.
---
I don't even use ammo much anymore, went melee and don't think I'll ever look back, but a 5.56 cap printing machine is too good to pass up.
---
Tell me more how you‚Äôre going to ‚Äòtrack me down and end my pettiness‚Äô.
---
I'm not a mod, I'm sure they'll tell you if it's a problem. 
---
I've never understood those people. They're like those horrible children who watch other children making something out of Lego and decide they have to break it. Their only joy is other people's misery.
---
One character, level 320, about 1040 hours. Yeah, I do a lot of fucking off and not getting xp.
---
I saw 2 months ago people saying that the displays was bugged and allowed people to buy things that wasn't listed(something like that) could be that?
---
Troika made a damn good world with solid background material.
---
I‚Äôm  sad bethesda got a hold of it and look forward to the day when they no longer do.
---
Fallout 1 and 2 ftw!
---
Have you ever seen the one map visual glitch where the nuke zone looks huge? I want to go through a silo and launch a megaton bomb like that, outside circle would be like a normal nuke zone. Inner circle everything is level 100, even the basic mobs. Much more legendaries too, maybe even some big bosses.
---
To my knowledge it does what it says on the box, double damage on 100% health targets. If the goal is to kill in one shot, it‚Äôs very effective for lone wanderers. If you‚Äôre usually with a group or it‚Äôs a low damage/high RoF weapon, not so useful.
---
And that‚Äôs the first time you said that. 
---
You didn‚Äôt indicate that in your OP. 
---
I retract my prior statement; I hope it *never* works properly for you, lol.
---
I'm on PC but all I can think of is to try building a different collectron then replacing it with the raider again. I had the basic collectron first, scrapped it and built a new raider one and I was able to choose between junk, scrap, guns &amp; ammo and booze &amp; chems.
---
Two words: Raider Assaultron.
---
Power level until you get every perk card maxed then experiment with different builds. 
---
I started using a single action pistol to challenge myself and make daily interactions last longer.
---
Yeah I can see that and have used such weapons. 
---
I‚Äôm using an instigating explosive LMG and am curious how good it is.
---
Pvp never belonged in this game and it‚Äôs only use is to grief. That‚Äôll also never change.
---
Shhhh, don‚Äôt tell anyone that. Then they won‚Äôt have a reason to say it‚Äôs griefing
---
Nice, so as of 19/07/2020, this is still a bloody issue.
---
ChatMod goes last in the load order.
---
Although for the moment, the server that runs the chats is down, so you could leave it out altogether until it's working again.
---
That‚Äôs correct. It‚Äôs a great effect on snipers so you can 1-shot enemies
---
I‚Äôm level 120 and I‚Äôve only seen it 3 times, the strangest was at the SBQ event!
---
I remember the first time I did it I hated it. It felt like all the boring events rolled into one. I just want to do it once more for the achievement.
---
Sorry bout that. Hope you find another person who prefers supplying silo runners to actually launching.
---
Yeah level 50 through 52 should all be super duper. Period.
---
Appreciate it :)
---
You can. Just the wooden walls are bugged at the moment. You can use a solid wall and just switch it to window after you apply the wallpaper though. 
---
Any other wall type lets you apply to windowed wall.
---
Just added Harper's Ferry, I got mostly ghouls and scorched and it could have been better with super mutants, but I don't think it's that great even then.
---
Actually believe it or not, 1700 hours in and I‚Äôm having cap troubles. Been running around killing stuff trying to make the most of the double XP and lunchbox buffs I haven‚Äôt been able to keep caps, I get the daily 1400 from vendors but I‚Äôm fast traveling so much I‚Äôm back down to 500 and hoping they don‚Äôt run out soon.
---
Apparently it‚Äôs a ‚ÄòPC‚Äô only bug according to OP. So you can‚Äôt have the problem, it seems. It‚Äôs only for PC MasterRace.
---
Op added his video after our previous discussion so it looks less consistent. But this all leads back to my original point which is this appears to be a console platform services problem so Bethesda can't really do much to address it on top of it being not a ddos attack. That is all. I have no horse in the race as you pointed out so why does this thread exist here and not on Xbox support forums?
---
Hmm interesting. I'd like to see something like this.
---
Do you know how to replace a wall? It‚Äôs no effort at all.
---
No, I don‚Äôt think I will.
---
wearing stealth suit and a mutation which slow ur falling u will never get a chance to commit a suicide.
---
I couldn‚Äôt figure out why I was so much over weight. I used all reduction perks, removed a ton of consumables and ammo. 
---
I eventually dropped every single thing in my inventory except misc items and finally realized where all my weight was coming from...6k punpowder that I had collected over 200 lvls on my main was weighting me down over 250-300 lbs. I now only weight 170/475.
---
It‚Äôs a great feeling.
---
PA does need a bit of love, that's true. It's the signature armour of the series that appears on the cover (granted, an exception was made for NV in which the Ranger Armour took on that role) but the fact it can't be legendary does diminish it somewhat in the face of 3 star regular armour pieces.
---
I'd agree with the 2 points you made above, extra mod slots would give more variety and choice alongside some new mods being added, as lets face it, the arm mods are worthless to anyone using a gun - they just don't have an option on the table.
---
If we never see legendary PA pieces, I'd at least like to see the various suits get set bonuses added. Things like increased damage resistance, that sort of thing. Perhaps a bonus on top of that if you're wearing a matched set as well?
---
This. The games not exactly designed well.
---
That's pretty gay ngl
---
it finally showed today added you
---
used to be gunpowder was much more precious and dropping it as junk was a real bummer.
---
Because they both want attention. And this one has claimed he‚Äôs going to track me down and end this. 
---
I‚Äôm still waiting on how he will do that with his ‚Äòleet skills‚Äô.
---
Solomons Pond is a nice place to harvest Acid
---
What a dumb take
---
There was no mention of having more than I can spend, the focus was on the fact your cash can spike so wildly in such a short amount of time if someone buys expensive stuff without having time to do anything but disconnect.
---
The only time I'm a victim is after I've read your stupid reply
---
Griefing and screwing players over because they‚Äôre trolls
---
I have level 1 and he pops up often (ps4)
---
I'm not sure what he's talking about. I have 1 rank of Mysterious Stranger and he shows up often enough. I'm on PC.
---
Im so tired of this game that i go just melee , i throw every single bullet and i have no range weapons , no regrets
---
I know, it‚Äôs shocking, right?
---
The yellow slicker hat goes with the Longshoreman's outfit ( rare ) which is from the traveling vendor bot. It's only available from him also.
---
It‚Äôs might be to much for you
---
If it's not 100% health it's not double damage. Had a level 2 guy punch a level 60 super mutant then fired my instigating gun and it didn't do double damage. So even the slightest health missing ruins the effect.
---
Power armor glitch, lets you go through some doors when exiting.
---
They won't add anything for characters that could be dead, that would just poss more people off.
---
This one is adorable when it‚Äôs cranky. I wonder if it will delete its account as well.
---
For comparison I got 4166 total and 2132 was the reward I got for completing the event.  Not bad for about 30 sec of effort.
---
O Lordy Lordy don‚Äôt you be hurting nor shaming these poor cheaters or the mods here will get all kinds of irate!
---
Might be but it won‚Äôt stop me
---
Can you still play the game?
---
for weapons bloodied, junkie, anti armor, berserk, furious for fast firing weapons and instigating for slow firing weapons. as a secondary effect explosive for all of them and faster fire rate for automatic weapons. 
---
for armor assassins, bolstering, vanguard, unyelding, powered and cavaliers.  for secondsry effect reduced weapon weight adds to the value. 
---
so combining two of these effects on weapons and armor makes its value very high.
---
When was the last time you played? They moved things around in inventory and displays a few months ago.
---
Keep fighting it show them all bots who‚Äôs the boss
---
Unarmed. I run a junkies +40% MMG and absolutely wreck with it.
---
I play everyday, literally first time it happened
---
If your buying atom points then you certainly have issues...
---
Nice work, overseer!
---
No idea then. Sorry.
---
I have like 4000 acid. I got a lot by raiding the Honey House every hour during Fasnacht event.
---
Which shouldn't be possible, if the game was designed well. If it's a not a valid weapon, the server should reject it immediately. Really, if it's anything regarding an item coming from the client, the server shouldn't be accepting it. 
---
Rule #1 of any internet application is you do not trust the client. The client is outside of your control, and therefore potentially compromised.
---
I‚Äôm running around with full unyielding armor, building team bonus x1, Kindred spirit, Tasty Squirrel Stew with carnivore, Broiled SB Brain, Berry Mentats and three lunchboxes boxes. The 3+ Sentry Bots at whitesprings, the 2 Glowing Deathclaws at hopewell cave and the watoga substation, and the 2 behemoths at the bog workshop and near the vantage all give 4K XP each for me, and level 60+ super mutants in the bog, Savage divide, and Mire give out 1500+ each. Last time I had these buffs and radiation rumble was going on, I was getting 800 per ghoul there and you know there‚Äôs a lot of ghouls there.
---
All good thanks for info
---
Wait it doesn't count as junk....?
---
What, no apology for making the threats?  I see they got removed. 
---
Tell me how you‚Äôre going to track me down and end my pettiness over a humorous comment on a public forum. I‚Äôd love to hear this.
---
yah i made sure to not go over budget for that reason
---
also, if you‚Äôre waiting for it to start dont crouch. if people see that there lots of high levels already at the event they are more inclined to join.
---
As it's an alpha strike, if it doesn't drop them on the first shot, then it's not going to do anything else after that.
---
If there's even a single health point missing from the target, then the effect won't kick in.
---
Unarmed&gt;2Handed&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;1Handed
---
You are guaranteed nothing. They owe you nothing. Get over yourself
---
I just started playing last week haha, but I may be a tad bit too optimistic
---
Unarmed is pretty much unbeatable for dps
---
But honestly for the most part you can use whatever feels right for ya, melee is really good in this game aside from scorchbeasts obviously 
---
The only reason I don't like one handed is because I find the animations kinda off, mostly cuz the other hand just kinda hangs there uselessly
---
Would be nice to have like a riot shield for your off hand or something, or even just having the off swing be two handed just for the sake of animations 
---
Or to be completely unrealistic, port in skyrims dual wield system lol
---
Exactly and you don't need L68 Glowing bloated ghouls hanging around.
---
That was a shite joke and I loved it, have an upvote good sir.
---
Because it's a craftable item, not a bottom component
---
Lies
---
I've only just started selling them. I price at 500c.
---
So, I just tested that, and I see it now. It‚Äôs only the wooden walls. All the others work just fine. But you can use the workaround like you said. 
---
But OP seems unwilling to do that and enjoys complaining about it more. 
---
Ah, well.
---
No you didn't the only way to get a fixer is from purveyor or your companion weapon case daily
---
Are you sure?  Because Fixer legendaries don't drop on creatures.  Just at Mumbles and other events that use her loot pool.
---
I've actually never been involved in any PVP because my buddies and I use closed games. So, griefing isn't something I've had to deal with in this game. But thanks.
---
I was simply responding to your inane comment.
---
Is foodie an insult? I have no idea what you're trying to say.
---
Sure thing Mr Trump.
---
Just run around Toxic Valley for an hour. Level 24 Yao Guai right outside the cemetery near the fort, the memorial has a chance to spawn several similarly leveled ones, snallies are abound, plus the workshop and the random nodes, and now floaters are all over the place, too.
---
I don‚Äôt get some people
---
only if it has changed. I got fixer drops. 1*, 2* and even 3* outside moma purv and weapjn case. cant remember when exactly, but I had drops before wastelanders for sure.
---
Attention....lol hey you still in the Corp?
---
Assuming you're referring to that console one, the Fallout game that no-one ever speaks of... (probably for the best really)
---
It will only stack four boxes.. If you try another it will break the buff altogether. Angry Turtle did a video recently where he used every single XP buff he could get.. He was getting almost 2500 XP per mutant at West Tek. He got 6k XP for completing a daily. It's insane how much you can get.
---
Max in italics is the stuff of nightmares.
---
Me either, man. OP was resistant to saying where they saw this was previously commented on, and I even asked ‚Äòwhat type of wall‚Äô twice and they refused to answer that. 
---
Had they said ‚Äòwooden wall‚Äô I‚Äôd have tested it and seen what they meant.
---
If you pop 20 of them at once it gives you 5,000 percent xp.  
---
Not sure why you didn't mention that tidbit.
---
PS4 here, thanks though. And thanks for confirming. Stay filthy and safe.
---
Nice work! I‚Äôm curious how the Charleston DMV compares. If you boot up both departments and then clear the building it‚Äôs a good run with somewhere between 0 and 4 legendaries
---
In my experience, unarmed is the best melee. Faster and more fun than two hands. One inconvenient: you can't use power armor with unarmed weapons.
---
Server hopping is kind of a required mechanic in this game to get enemies to spawn, fix quests, or find player venders!
---
Ahh you've reached the point that many of us reached once.  That trusty ole super sledge just isn't quite doing it for you any more.  I still have 4 of  them because I can't bear to get rid of my old faithfuls.  
---
Unarmed is best, and the Power Fist is king of melee, largely in part to the puncturing mod and it's inherent armor penetration.  The Power Fist is rather insane actually. But.. you can't use it in PA.  So there is still a use for ole betsy.  Personally, If I am melee'ing in PA, I prefer a SS spiked ski sword if two handed, but to each his own.  It is just a matter of personal preference really.   
---
If you can't get your hands on a god tier power fist, the gauntlet is a rather good option.  It is easily obtained and does similar damage to the power fist.
---
The max you can get from lunch boxes is 100%. If you have 5 lunch box buffs it bugs and you losses the effects. 
---
There‚Äôs also a cap of 4000xp from any given source of xp.
---
It‚Äôs ‚ÄòCorps‚Äô. 
---
I‚Äôm still waiting on that apology or explanation of how you‚Äôll carry out your threat. 
---
Let me guess. You‚Äôre in the military, and probably in your early 20s, right?
---
Charleston capital building.
---
That didn't last long. Know he was lie'n now.
---
I totally blew the settlers off after maxing out the raider and getting my ammo machine. Clearly I‚Äôm lacking in guts.
---
I can do silos but not the queen, and every time I run a silo there arent high levels who help me. :/
---
Maybe from fasnacht,  it was giving purveyor rolls but I didnt list that because that's not going on right now
---
*Cannot exit power armor here* usually happens if you try to exit with your back against a wall or object, haven't tried it against a door however.
---
Once you finish an ally's questline (or have an ally that doesn't have a questline) they can give a daily that sends you out to grab a Weapons Case. Turning that in and finishing the daily will reward you with one...could be 1 to 3 stars.
---
Edit. Also some of the quests, main and side, will give you a specific Legendary weapon set at your level. Most of them are ho-hum, but they are still Legendaries.
---
Herd Mentality will work even if you are on a solo Public Team. 
---
It‚Äôs the new ‚Äòmust have‚Äô mutation.
---
Get Egg Head as well and run Class Freak 3. It‚Äôs well worth it. 
---
If actually on a team with others, then use Strange in Numbers.
---
Intresting. That's kinda what I started to suspect when I was looking around. What's good about the power fist aside from damage?
---
Mice how do I keep track? Do you have any idea which item you should be earning in order?
---
Only through the purveyor, dailies and legendary enemies and allies. (Player vendors as well, but beware of dupes)
---
Haha, thanks for letting us know that we're not guaranteed a functional objectives system for the 10 week season. The season that has fairly lacklustre (and sometimes just downright broken) rewards, but which also decimated our ability to earn atoms.
---
It's so interesting when somebody tells somebody else to get over themselves, while they themselves speak as some mighty authority that gets to decide what we can and can't care about.
---
Yup did this event and got 29,684.  I got ghouls when I did it, and I noticed that there were a large amount of them that spawn but never actually attack.  I had my sniper rifle and was picking them off the entire time.  I think that if you didn't have a long range weapon you would miss out on a lot of XP from this event.
---
Herd Mentality trigger is being a member of a group, that means that if you have that mutation and you open a public group but nobody joins it actives the bonus anyway because you're in a group even being alone.
---
No. But workbenches, vendors, vending machines, SBQ, encrypted, the 1st 30 seconds of logging into a server? Yea the legendary run board is the only thing that doesn‚Äôt lag.
---
Unarmed is the best by far just because it can hit hard and fast (and I think both one handed and unarmed perks both still stack), but any class is decent enough I feel. I have a bloodied war drum that I pull out when I'm in power armor and it still does good work without perks or unyielding armor.
---
I'd say its up to person preference. You can be ultra efficient in killing or you can stick to your two handed weapons and give your character some character.
---
You can craft  ( some of ) them if you have gold bullion to buy the plans. Have to finish the WL main quest.
---
The assaultron is definitely a more dangerous combatant on versatility and maneuverability alone. To the NPCs and creatures and whatnot, at least. Factor in its stealth capability and... Well not everything is about raw damage output. üòâ
---
Might be role players. But I usually keep the chat volume low or off.
---
I am solo and recently picked up herd mentally.  It works all the time while on a public team spead over the map.
---
Even before the ban wave was shit.  400+ levels and people are selling salt and pepper or ammo for 5 caps
---
Are you using a public group to voice chat in? I don't see how someone else could be joining your group otherwise.
---
Yea someone had complained before which is why I knew the wooden walls were effected. I never use those so never experienced it
---
Set it to private? It‚Äôs not a hard thing to do if you dislike other players randomly joining in.
---
People are social creatures. There is nothing wrong here.
---
Works well with garage doors and the keypad doors.
---
Amen.  If someone is running 2-3 I ask them if they want flux or scrip for entertaining me.  Still my fav part of the game.  Guess what most every time they turn it down.  One time a guy said yeah I‚Äôll take some flux.  He then proceeded to gift me an EE LMG, 7k ult ammo, and invite me to his private server for more runs.  I think it‚Äôs very rare that they are thanked.
---
maybe that‚Äôs it. fasnacht. good solve!
---
When you say ally‚Äôa questline do you mean like BOS, enclave and things like that?
---
Ok thanks. So Im right in thinking the "nearby" is misleading
---
Have you tried buying neon signs for your RL home? Haha, I've been collecting a bunch of neon LED signs IRL, that's more new vegas's ....and las vegas's fault in general but 76 definitely contributes.
---
it's very satisfying to punch with it
---
Just got raiders last night.... that was a grind to say the least.
---
You can make a party chat private? How?
---
Got an AAE lever gun to drop from Uranium Fever over a year ago when I was level 40, so it dropped at 35. Even still, it was my main weapon for the majority of my now 140 levels
---
Why is it bad if I buy a duped weapon?
---
Love the idea, also what would be also cool is if had a AA Mount with a single/twin .50 cal or mini gun to fend off the scorchbeasts
---
Bro the gauss minigun literally just sits in my stash because I cant fund the ammo. And then even when I got ammo its heavy as shit and takes up all my stash space.
---
I'll just tell you this. Run bloodied with unyielding gear, talons and twisted muscles mutations.  My Power Fist or DCG does over 3k base damage, WITH NO MELEE PERKS. I'm specced for heavy guns but use melee most of the time to conserve ammo. It's ridiculously OP.
---
Ore is lower than base scrap, and that goes in misc!
---
good point, but stable flux goes in the scrap box, and its crafted too.  I agree with OP that it would be nice if it was considered junk.
---
Which platform you on? I wasn‚Äôt thinking. I‚Äôm on ps4
---
Interesting as those two are the most difficult to clip through I've found. Thanks for tip.
---
WL?
---
Whats up BMG 2K!
---
Minigun time for you!
---
You can find 5 ally character throughout the wasteland that will live at your camp and give you daily quests and 2 of them have a full quest line to follow before they're your permanent ally
---
No. There are 5 allies that you can recruit to stay at your camp. 2 of them have quest lines (that also unlock achievements) that when finished, give you dailies that can yield Legendaries. 3 of them are random spawns around the map. Once you recruit them, you can start doing the dailies right away.
---
Edit. You can only have 1 ally active at a time.
---
I got settlers yesterday, congrats man.
---
Ok thank you. Ill give it a whirl then
---
Make your chat private. Kick unwanted people if you forget to do that and then make it private.
---
I need that gauss shotgun though!
---
Grounds for a ban. It‚Äôs the new hot thing to get caught for in the game.
---
It is misleading and I actually thought the same as you until I tested it with a teammate who had the mutation.
---
WasteLanders
---
I don‚Äôt play it much but I‚Äôve won a few games and it‚Äôs always fun. I‚Äôm sure like most BR game modes, if you don‚Äôt die immediately it can be pretty fun.
---
I have no idea what you‚Äôre on about.
---
Awesome. Ill give it a go then
---
What ever the stash limit is you will end up bouncing of it again at some point, it's the limits on what you can get rid of that hold the game back for me. 
---
For me it's usually turn in script and treasury notes run whatever daily quests i need to, Do SCORE challenges and run a few events till my stash is full of legionaries again. Then log off.
---
If the daily script limit was double or even higher i could get rid of a lot more stuff and play for a lot longer time.
---
Nope, quests and events is 6k.
---
Thankyou dude!
---
I used to use an Instigating Grognac's Axe when I farmed WS. It's great, coupled with adrenaline and power attacks you one-shot everything.  My favorite is an Instigating SS Super Sledge. 
---
Also, forcing yourself to one-shot melee kill makes you learn how to aim. Try to get it to VATS lunge too. It's devastating.
---
On PS4 there is an option to make the chat private when you create it.
---
Because you‚Äôre indirectly supporting a violation of the game‚Äôs Terms of Service.
---
I don't know if we're talking about the same thing so here's a sample pic I found on the web similar to what I mean by party chat. [http://imgur.com/gallery/OqqLMbX](http://imgur.com/gallery/OqqLMbX)
---
This explains why I never see him then lol I see the Responder Bot more than Grahm.
---
Shit I didn't see this. Yeah I was on. Going to take an hour break and I'll be back on
---
But what if I am unaware of it? Is it still grounds for a ban
---
Yeah, I figured with public teams, I will always be on a team now.  I just read about egghead, and I rely too much on strength for that one.  I carry way too much.  I do recommend level 3 Inspiration and Stranger in Numbers if you don't have those.
---
Oh I'm an Xbox player.
---
Strange, we have a party chat on PS4 but I don‚Äôt use it. Ever.
---
Best of luck finding a better answer!
---
Sorry. Can‚Äôt help with that.
---
He was comin right at me!
---
Did you get my friend request? But yeah I‚Äôll be on
---
If anyone can help me out, why do people always nuke the lower right? I think I‚Äôve seen the golf course hit once, but every other time it‚Äôs down there. Why?
---
I think it's about a 10% chance rate upped from 6% but not completely sure. Definitely not guaranteed though.
---
Mmmm...milk.
---
I'm sorta new to fallout, but what is so special about this "gram" guy? Like I personally have never met him, but does he have special plans or something?
---
HA! nice
---
I spawned into a world before and he was just stood there. As if waiting for me. Then later on i did a messenger event and he turned up half way through and i just let him go HAM on the attacking ghouls.
---
Hey, I was checking to see if you had made any progress.  
---
I see they just gave you a canned response.  Not good, have you gone back to twitter?  Now that you have something on record of them exactly telling you WHY you were temporarily suspended, it seems to me you should be able to turn up the heat on bugging them publicly.  Obviously I would only do that if you really did NOT dupe anything.  But if you did not dupe anything, I would start bugging them on twitter and calling them out every day.  It's clear whatever "system" they used to flag people is not accurate.  One theory I saw formulated by several that were also banned that claimed they did not dupe anything is that if you passed a certain threshold on server hopping and you had legacies some script on their side put a hold on your account. (and you get the email)  Then in theory some human follows up on all of these accounts (I guess you would call it the investigation phase) and then perm ban users  based on some other variable(s) when they look at your account.  And that is when people receive the final email and the account is closed permanently at that point.
---
All you have to do is get the attention of somewhere there to make you rise to the top of their inefficient manner of handling these open temp suspensions.
---
I personally would recommend finding a new game to get interested in.  Their is no transparency to how they do these things, you are guilty till proven innocent.  Given their poor track record with everything in this game you really should find a better game to support, especially if you pay for FO 1st.
---
I stopped playing and terminated a 1 year FO1st membership and did a chargeback myself a couple months ago (was just over the 30 day window at that time)  This company just does not care enough.  For me it was that one mask that they removed the effect on that I grinded forever for on multiple characters. (That was the straw that broke the camels back)  They have established clearly what they plan on doing in the game moving forward.
---
I think the only reason they added FO76 to xbox game pass is because they are in danger of losing others if they don't figure out a way to keep players coming in.  Next step will probably be that it is free to play.  I am guessing that will occur within 6 months.  That is also possibly why they got in with Steam finally awhile back.  They are running out of options to keep people coming in.
