&gt;w shit to atom shop and yet where are the legendary perks and new content??
---

---
It's easier to model then it is to add new features. I know modelers that bang out a new gun or building a day. I think already said the new perks that were suppose to come out for season one were rolled back out of balance concerns.
---
---
---
It's completely empty Lakeside Cabins....
---
Test it out.
---
Which is weird because I have the same setup and no problems ever. RAM?
---
Hey, was that the group I was just with? Or the one earlier? The Heavy in Power Armor or the Melee One Shotter? Or the guy shooting Fat Man every which way?
---
...or spend your money on something worthwhile instead of fallout 76?
---
FWIW I've found three of them just lying around Watoga. Also one in a mound via treasure map.
---
I’d give The Deep a shot...since it was opened up for Wastelanders
---
I always carry around a high capacity backpack as backup (normally use grocer) and then I have “max weight” load out on my (perk load out mod) save slots. If I ever hit max capacity while out and about, I switch to this setup and I helps me get back to camp and sort out my bags or it helps me extend my out and about time another hour or so.
---
It literally has all the weight related perks slotted in (so you need to be higher level to pull this off and if you’re not a strength build a lot of perks will be limited). 
---
40 more carry weight perk, full chem and food weight reduction perks, ammo reduction perk (or ordinance perked you’re loaded down on missles), the heavy weapon weight reduction perk (great if you’re out hunting off legendaries and beg tons of heavy drops), use the radicool perk (adds more strength and thus more weight) I always use full unyielding armor for more strength and keep under 20% hp for max stat boosts (which also helps radicool). Also if you’re mutated and in a group be sure to use strange in numbers perk since it augments some mutations which benefit your weight depending on which mutations you have. Then I top of all of that I toss on my high capacity back pack too (when switching to using both maxed chem and food perks, you don’t need to pack so just going to straight capacity backpack is best)
---
All together it makes for an insane combo pack of weight reduction and space gains. You could easily go from maxed out to dropping down to 50% or less almost instantly depending on what’s weighing you down. Either way this method ALWAYS helps me port back to camp and fix my situation instead of leaving me stranded and overweight.
---
Appreciated, but unfortunately I am on PS4. Thanks for the offer though!
---
Picked the game back up after a looong time. Started a new character for the new content. How did you rank up so fast? Was it mostly score points based off xp gains?
---
Queens easy. Goddamn kings are a ballbuster.
---
Still doesn't phase me lol
---
So strange
---
Because most events are easy , not challenging and people 1 shooting every enemy.
---
I do it, but you are right.. not many others do.  If I have a decent teammate, we can usually keep the cows alive and get both Sheepsquatch.  If I solo, it's 50-50.  I still like it because it is harder than the other locations.
---
Yeah, fuck those 800 million people.
---
Appreciated, but unfortunately I am playing on PS4. Thanks for the offer though!
---
Wait, you don't like putting in a code to leave your base?
---
Oh I remember this picture
---
Sorry for pinging, but u/Valseek or u/Ladydevann could answer those questions...
---
just in case, ticket id: 16283818
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
it describes my issue  
---
  
---
upd: provided ticket id
---
I found one where you activate this personal computer and it clips you into the ground, then you fall and activate a crap load of traps. Didn't get too mad since it was my first time.
---
Not much, but I'm starting over......
---
Just don't tell a raider that you were supposed to kill to make some chaos in fondation.
---
Since I started my naked naked playing, I find myself at a lot until I can loot something. Let me ask you something. Should I start depositing the ore early or wait until the end?
---
I know. They have all played this game from
---
Launch. The all post on here. They all know where to go to buy duped items. They know all about the last two ban waves.
---
They even brag on here at times about buying duped stuff.
---
I honestly don’t know why any of them even play this game because they never want to actually do anything in game. The want unlimited ammo and the best weapons, without ever doing anything you need to do in game. 
---
But is not their fault. And now they are missing double xp/score and I think it’s awesome because that’s the kind of stuff they love.
---
Just do it. Bethesda can’t get it’s sht together so someone else might as well.
---
Next week:
---
survive for minutes(0/120)
---
win a match(0/10)
---
use stimpak(0/50)

Aaaages ago I saw the large succulents available on their own. I've been waiting for them to come back again and not in a bundle, because heck yes succulent! Plus that lil sundew. I'm sure it's going to eat me one night after I get it but still.
---
*Any ideas or is it just my “Holy crap, I’m getting wrecked” panic?* Stealth seems to be broken from patch to patch, I've played where it works phenomenally, and other times where it's completely broken in some instances. Patch 20 seems to have some broken parts related to stealth. Someone else mentioned that 'Escape Artist' was one of the broken parts of stealth this time around, so you got a 2 for 1 there:)
---
*how does commando compare vis-à-vis rifleman?*
---
Really, if you've got the perk points, why not just swap between them both if you're lucky enough to get the weapons. I've had a Bloodied 10 MM SMG in my inventory for a long time that I've just ignored, but when I started playing around with it, that weapon (next to the power fist) is one of the most fun weapons to use in the game. As far as Rifleman goes, the Lever Action Rifle, again, if you're lucky enough to get a good one, is a great weapon to use.  I switch between Commando and Rifleman depending on my ammo situation or level of boredom and they're both great. I've got all three perk cards full on both of them and they've both got strong points to them. I even like the Guerrilla perks for auto pistols and Gunslinger for regular pistols too, at a certain point, you can have all of those perks and can change it up however you want. 
---
I don't focus solely on PA. I'll use my PA if I'm in a nuke zone, but I run most of the time without it in my current commando phase. I like the bonuses you get outside of PA vs. what limitations you have when you're wearing PA.
---
Let me say a few things about the Power Fist, it's one of the most fun weapons to use in any video game. There's something satisfying about just punching something in the face. It's like releasing a pressure valve. The Gauntlet you can buy with gold bullion is 'OK' but, it's the ever-so-satisfying "Ka-Chunk" of the Power Fist that does it for me. And yes, it does a significant amount of damage especially if you invest in the perks, but alone it also does a good bit for a melee weapon. One of my most favorite things is to use it to [punch scorchbeasts](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/fcsq8x/more_fisting_for_your_scorched_face/).
---
 At least he included his in game name so we can avoid him if we see him.  Rather play with clueless players than mean entitled ones.
---
I stopped playing when the legendary run came out
---
People spend time setting them up?
---
Lol
---
As a guy that dislikes bloodied BUT still plays as bloodied for PVE, it makes sense what they’re doing. If they are bloodied they are more for defense, if you aren’t bloodied, YOU should be going to get the ore because you can take significantly more rads
---
I defend it for the event as well as for the XP and plans.  I also figure if I'm going to be playing for a couple hours and the workshop happens to have good resources that I may as well get some resources while I'm at it.  However, having said that, I like playing pacifist mode, so if a PVP wants my workshop that bad they can have it.  I only defend it for normal events and if my left over equipment can help the next player that claims the workshop then I'm also happy to help.  I know I'm always happy to claim a workshop that has some equipment setup when I get there.
---
Honestly I’m an mmorpg so I enjoy progression and service gaming. I’m only playing fo76 because it the closest thing to a fallout mmorpg..
---
Idk if I’ll continue playing after shadowland is release
---
I wish they would fix it to where the weight of the core depends on its charge. 20% charge left should mean 20% weight damnit
---
I'm curious to know why you think that? Line in the sand is something you can see being exploited and nope out of there. Duped weapon you won't know it was one until you're banned over it. Latter seems more harmful simply because you don't know until it's too late.
---
I usually keep squatting behind the peak of the roof and change sides when she heads for me.   She still spits piss at me but it usually doesn't get me unless I am being a dumbass, which happens lol.
---
I already dig into the code and found a way to implement everything I need.  
---
I just want to make this (ideally) open-sourced or at least just legal.
---
*Now ya got me doubting my unscientific method!*
---
Checked and I had a level 3 Adrenaline perk card in there about doubling the damage uptick every hit. (I'd been reading lately that Adrenaline was bugged - apparently that has been fixed or reports of it's malfunction were greatly exaggerated.)
---
Tried both the Furious Fixer again and a Furious Gatling Gun - both were still ticking up, even if not nearly as much.
---
I don't understand how you think I was calling a profile pic a big item lol
---
I thought so too, but the one I faced seemed like it was resisting lots of damage and I was using “Final Word”. The self-regeneration definitely did not help me cuz I was really close to killing it twice 😜
---
Behind the Wayward. Glowing Fungus and Bloodleaf along the creek.
---
I don't know what I did but they are now in my shop. I hope this isn't an ongoing issue.
---
After grinding just about every gold bullion attainable piece, on my next play through it'll be secret service under armour with mods and chemist backpack. Maybe jet pack\torso, but that's it. I found no value in anything else. Bloody commando
---
Great point. Stocks are low atm as I've been sinking a lot of caps and mats into my gear and crafting. But I shall focus on a good supply! 
---
Do you have any recommendations on good farming locations or materials that generally sell well? I am working on a project for mass production of booze as we speak.
---
Happened to me too. It’s a bummer. I get that XP is a hot commodity right now, so why not tag as many enemies as you want, AND make sure the event completes... so you get XP for both. Every little bit helps. Otherwise, just go nuke Whitesprings and leave the events to people who actually like doing them.
---
No offence intended but maybe your weapons are bad. Terrible thing about this game is once you're Lvl 50+ and you don't have at least a semi-god roll, you're gonna struggle.
---
People have been modding Bethesda games to make them playable since the company first started - without it we’d just see more of this fo76 tire fire, so honestly, why would they complain?
---
That said, it also takes 6+ months to get an email response to actual support issues, so I dont think your question will get answered anytime soon.
---
Yeah, in this instance the workshop is completely empty. Maybe I'm not as desperate as he is when it comes to keeping the workshop. I just ran across it with my low level mule and nobody was here at the time.
---
I hope more people come and visit :)
---
They weigh .1 a piece.  Id take them.  Scrap kits can help you when junk farming.
---
Right?
---
This! I can take queens out no problem. Lvl 50 mirelurk kings are the toughest damn thing on the game to me.
---
&gt;  I switch between Commando and Rifleman depending on my ammo situation or level of boredom and they're both great. I've got all three perk cards full on both of them and they've both got strong points to them. I even like the Guerrilla perks for auto pistols and Gunslinger for regular pistols too, at a certain point, you can have all of those perks and can change it up however you want.
---
Thanks! This is what I (and wife) have been thinking - just Perk to the weapon we like and want to play with at that moment. 
---
Of course, I just sneaked up on a bunch of Ghouls and didn't get noticed even after popping them. Earlier today, I was in the shadows, and they saw me thru a building and ate my ass. Twice.
---
I think they pick on newer players, so it's hard to notice sometimes unless you walk in on it happening, and even then, it's so weird and unexpected it's hard to recognize. I showed up at campfire tales a while back where someone was blocking a newer player from picking up the items from the missing camper. I thought they were trying to slow down the event so their friend could get there or something, but nope. Just an asshole.
---
Does it also make glass appear like extremely white and not transparent at all? Because that problem pops up for me too
---
Or is that unrelated?
---
I definately have played with the customini a lot, got rid of the really annoying blur on everything, but issues like that pop up every now and then
---
If you mean glowing mushroom, try the abandoned waste dump in the mire.
---
Where do you get the frame
---
Funny enough I ported over to Uranium Fever... killed the 3 legendary enemies with my team, got the event completion... and guess who showed up late to the event?
---
shotgun + enforcer  
---
wont work on sbq tho
---
The settlers are such dicks from the start even when you try to help them though. You expect that from the Raiders. That's why I sided with them and send them to F#ck up Foundation every time I help Rocksy. Went to Foundation to inoculate them against the Scorched plague, Paige was a dick, never went back. I hope that dude gets butt f#cked by a Scorchbeast. I hate that dude more than Beckett. Even more than Preston Garvey
---
Same for me. No helmet. Anyone know why?
---
I assume that modding for fo76 will be officially allowed some time, that's why I'm thinking that they don't care so much about that.  
---
My case is slightly different - they have written a program and I may modify it or re-use essential part of the code in different program (in this case licensing question is very important).
---
Did you enter the launch code? Keycard is not the only thing you need to launch a nuke
---
The Water Wheel generates power, has done since it's bug was fixed.
---
I know .45 ammo caps at 333 and it takes about 4 real hours to make that and 5mm ammo caps at 1000 in about 5 but those are the only types I have tried different ammo caps at different numbers but it takes different times to hit the caps on different ammo. And they only make ammo when you are online. This shows the rates https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/ArmCo_ammunition_construction_appliance
---
yessir, i give everyone til 25 ore to particpate and if no one else does i insta kill everything :p
---
Thank you!
---
Materials and resources
---
Had same issue til I get vampire plasma gun.
---
But I found laser minigun doing much better dmg
---
You’re level 139 and can’t kill a Mirelurk queen? That’s on you my friend
---
did you really just call this “gay?” thats not it.
---
yah players are nice, really nice, never met a better gaming community tbh but i also thunk its to make up for the lack of support from bethesda and developers. Like how the eldest child will work 3 jobs so the kids can eat while the deadbeat parents collect welfare
---
Lakeside cabins. Nothing built. Just a dude swinging on me in passive mode for 20 mins.
---
In a cave
---
In that case, assume no.  They are greedy bastards after all.  
---
Expect the worst in any scenario where they could claim damages .
---
I'd have to agree here. Either that or not very focused build. My new character was level 39 this morning and when I logged in, I ended up having to fight a level 50 SB and a level 80 legendary SB solo. It was pretty hilarious but I ended up dying once because I ran out of meds.
---
Haha. Them and assaultrons. Feel free to add me on PsN. SeaBreezeNRum
---
Indeed.
---
lol you're trying to sound smart, but making no sense.
---
The range stat on the gun is how far away a target can be before you start suffering damage dropoff. Full stop. VATS or no VATS, that's irrelevant.
---
The range stat on a hunting rifle is 9 points higher than a level action. This is consistent between barrel mods and muzzle mods. Virtually everyone will be running long barrels and silencers, which puts the guns at 177 range for a lever action and 186 for a hunting rifle.
---
this[`https://imgur.com/dOdgJfR`](https://imgur.com/dOdgJfR) is how big the difference in distance between the two is- from me to that baggy.
---
\*edit\* and scopes do not affect the damage dropoff range. At best you can look at the Long Shot perk, since it's a % increase, it'll turn the difference between the two from 9 to \~12. When you're talking 230 range vs 242, 12 is still only a 5% range difference.
---
They were, im pretty sure they nerfed em. Used to take 10 shots but u can bop em once with a bloodied gat now
---
Thank you, much appreciated
---
Some might say he ~Brat~ this upon himself.
---
thats like saying, "you know, this soda would be great if it wasnt for the diabetes"
---
Honestly I didn’t cover as much as I should (or at all haha), but I felt like I had enough bullets shooting fast enough and
---
stimpacks at the time that I didn’t really give a fuck till later. I never really face high leveled ones and it was my first time at the location (he usually sends me somewhere easier!)
---
I'll be grabbing it. Really want that set of tire walls etc too, hope that comes back.
---
Of course Assaultrons! That beam they shoot is the most OP thing in the game lol.. I'll definitely add you when I get back on.
---
Who needs event rewards when you can just farm mobs and get at least 2, usually more, legendaries.
---
With the line in the sand part, I had this happen to me a few nights ago. I was able to spray at where they all dropped and gained loads of XP from it.
---
yah this happened to me too a couple days ago, huge pita
---
The stealth is so wonky at times, especially this patch. Something seems broken with it. Maybe next patch you can see a fully operational stealth station, sorry was channeling Emperor Palpatine.
---
FOMO to push sales.
---
Haven't had the luxury of seeing a trap camp yet, but I unfortunately look forward to seeing one.
---
I've been too easy just willingly walking into clipping bases or vendors in sketchy places.
---
Gratz, you should name it "Berserker's Handmade" and post trades bout a be handmade and trip ppl up lmaoo
---
9/10 uranium fever legendary spawns in the back room. Can’t remember which one it’s called. But it’s the one furthest left as you walk in (not A in the middle). Hope that helps a bit.
---
I'm a diabetic so you know...
---
if its like 1 or 2 things you probably fine but if you picked up 10000000 gifts then you might be in a for a tough night champ
---
I totally understand this, that's the reason for this topic.   
---
If I'll get permission to modify that just for my own usage - I'm ready to share results of my work for free just with Bethesda and let them decide what to do next.
---
that only works when people don't use explosives, i use single shot weapons so its hard to shoot that many.
---
From experience Lakeside attracts the loonies and griefers. I think it's because of the Lead poisoning off the dust coming from the deposit.
---
For starters, Bethesda can't track duped *weapons*, only the activity that produced said weapon. Once that weapon is gone, you're home free once you get it- which is why so many dupers still have their accounts. The burner they used to enact the dupe is gone, but it was $2 on some sketchy site and they'll just buy another next time. All of the reports of people getting 'falsely accused' are a result of people doing activities that mimick the dupe. I do believe some folks are innocent- but the reason they have been flagged has nothing to do with having a duped weapon. Otherwise, there would be **far** more people suspended.
---
Someone doing Line in the Sand this way can prevent you from being able to participate in the event. One person can easily kill all enemies as soon as they spawn with a Tesla/Grenade. This robs you of an activity in-game even though you may not consent to a person doing this. You could server hop, but that means finding the event again which is not always an easy task. In other words, this is a solely negative impact *unless you are aware that you are exploiting the game, in which case you are in the same camp as those who dupe.* 
---
With duping, you have to consent to participate. A person can't swap your item with theirs. If you're trading for a god roll, it is most definitely duped, no questions asked. There's probably on the order of about \~10 legitimate B2525 Fixers in the game. With this knowledge, you can simply opt to not trade with players you don't trust, and the problem is solved. Negative experiences avoided.
---
However, if sharing one's arsenal with your friend encourages your friend to play, duping presents an opportunity to be a positive event. Grind making your friends quit? YOU GET A B2525, YOU GET A B2525 FIXER, huzzah! A positive experience for all parties involved.
---
Wade Airport near Charleston, Grafton Dam and the workshop a little north of it all have super mutants which give great XP. Do the Manhunt event every time it pops up at the Dam too!
---
Do they mark the items with a sort of cursed status that anyone who holds them will be banned?
---
if someone else gets there they kill it before anyone else can. i cant blame them bloodied damage will on shot most things under 50.
---
I am also a sneak rifle build. I cant help a lot but I can say this. Distance is your friend, so is the silencer. Ever rife i have has a silencer. That said, i also have a 50 cal machine gun for when shit goes sideways. I dont use stealth armor. If im going in to an area I can handle comfortably, I wear no armor. If I go into an area im unsure or exect resistance in, I wear power armor. 
---
Im not saying this is the best, but going through west tek I dont need stim packs. I can pop all outside SM with one, sometimes 2, head shots. I keep my distance using a 50 cal hunting rifle with aligned barrel and recon long scope. When i move in, i switch to combat rifle, similar setup but using a reflex sight instead. 
---
I havent really been too bad about keeping hidden except when the occasional bug occurs.
---
On top of damage perks, the 10mm also benefits from Tank Killer and can ignore some of your armour as well.
---
yeah I don't get either, I collect all of them and hold them till the 1 min then I delivered to sapawn the deathclaw.
---
My focus build is weight reduction at this point 😂
---
Is there a better way to get more XP? I’m doing well rested and eating Canned Stew from Mama Dolces but damn it takes me forever to go up one level. FYI level 278
---
Only from Commie Protectron running Proletariat.
---
1% chance
---
I’m sure the person doing it had some sort of mines on the floor. Was weird, heard about people doing it but never seen it before.
---
Light'em up and loot!
---
It's not hard. But it's not the reason that I play nuclear winter. 
---
I actually like playing nuclear winter when I can get a team of friends together.  But NW is the kind of thing I want to play because I am in the mood to, not because I have to do a daily challenge.
---
And I don't play it  to shoot bloat flies and mutant hounds. .
---
So me being at 52 (almost 53) means I’m ahead of the curve? Sweet.
---
Id be happy if I could fast travel or not be dc'd
---
That doesn’t sound right. Otherwise we’d have seen worlds with a lot more than three nuked areas.
---
Right now I'd prefer people drop them fast! Those deathclaws are great xp. Bring em on!
---
Remember when the season started and people were freaking the fuck out with conspiracy theories that Bethesda had rigged the entire system to force you to desperately spend cash to get ranks before time ran out?
---
Now we're at a point where even people that lost out on a few bugged dailies should be finishing this thing within the next month or so with weeks to spare and anyone that doesn't either started way late or only has themselves to blame.  
---
I'm already at least ten spaces ahead of Zorbo and I didn't even go as all in as I could or should have during the double exp weekend.
---
Huh. Never knew.
---
too dangerous, I can tank only 3 of them, but hell yeah I would love to farm deathclaw there.
---
I know I’m like a month too late but mine won’t clear. I completed it but it never goes away. I just ignore it at this point. Level 25 now
---
You are wrong.
---
I'm glad that other people die for the Mothman.
---
Yeah I know what you mean. Happens to me all the time. I normally hang about in the middle till I hear the announcement then leg it over and tag it then run back out. I do prefer to do it on the private server tho, it’s so easy to do solo lol
---
Im not to sure but if they banned everyone who had a duped gun, anyone who has traded for a high tier gun would be banned. That is not to say you cant be but i doubt it for one gun. Ive heard people say its by numbers, if u got like 100k presents u get tagged cause its not legitimately possible to have that many. Same thing some dude had 5 b2525 fixers which is a big nono.  You probably just trippin over nefin but bethesdas ban hammer has collateral damage alot of the time
---
Keep blasting, it's gonna be fixed "later than sooner" 😂
---
did I ever imply any animosity toward them?
---
If it's a concentration of gifts, open or drop them. Don't stash them on your main character. If it's a ton of the same weapon, ditch all but one. If it's just assorted weapons, you should be ok.
---
Yes, you're doing really good! 🖤
---
Nah man, it was just a guy in a free states outfit with a fixer
---
Steve, he said a bad language word!
---
You ignore what I said you have a good day I gave you a reference you ignored I wasn't trying to sound smart I made a statment clearly these means a lot for you're ego so it is your w have fun
---
Please for the love of god don't tell me we're going to switch gears from people complaining that they'll never be able to compete the season to people complaining they completed it too quickly and now there's nothing else to earn...
---
I came to 76 after Destiny announced their "sunsetting" fiasco. I am **so** happy I did because this game feels much more rewarding for time invested as well as having different viable builds. The community is super nice and helpful, and paying it forward feels great. 
---
I just wish I would've jumped on the game sooner than I did.
---
Thanks everyone who commented I should be fine it’s just assorted weapons chems and such
---
It's one of the NW overseer rank rewards.
---
They don't want to do it.
---
No negatives
---
But if you knew Bethesda, you’d realize that’s not how they function. Honestly, it’s not.
---
What level what to get this
---
If you run silos, don't forget to get rid of those extra mainframe cores if you pick them up instead of crafting them. 
---
Also, think about which known plans you really want to keep to sell or give away. Keeping every single plan in your stash forever is a huge waste of space, especially considering some plans won't sell no matter how cheap they are in your vendor (ultracite PA limb plans).
---
it puts the lotion in the basket.....
---
It's always been like this, always will be. Sounds like FO 1st might help with your issue.
---
It's just the internal Xbox messenger can you not use stream to do the same?
---
32 gig
---
It's one thing to be dicks.
---
It's another to rob, rape, and murder innocent people.
---
If your line in the sand is whether someone was rude to you, and not "kill people and use their corpses as decorations," I don't know what to tell you.
---
It took me three games.  Nnot three complete games, three games of loading in and picking a direction to run in killing every creature I passed and then killing myself before the first ring even finished closing.
---
Stop your bitching, there are creatures all over the place to kill.
---
That's some bad ass power armor not gonna lie. Reminds of them droids from Star Wars or those Pokémon
---
Had a similar experience, but I killed him with my fists as he ran out of ammo earlier in the fight. Dont mess with these dance moves. Haha
---
You honestly can’t put it into better words than this. Fuckin bravo my dude
---
You're not an asshole.
---
Those caps go into the void,.
---
Ummm...Sunday I got to the Chief's coordinates in the Cranberry Bog...
---
I shit you negative - two Scortchbeasts(one legendary), a Mirelock Queen, and a Sheepsquatch, and a bunch of misc small mirelocks(the actual targets I assume) all fighting and trying to kill me.  Burned up 2500 .50 cal, most of my 5.56, and half a dozen nuka grenades and a metric shit ton of stimpacks.
---
Did the Chief give me any bonus pay for doing his dirty work in a war zone....Noooooooooooo.
---
seems like i'm screwed since my OS drive is tiny lol.  
---
Bethesda's response of "oh well buy a bigger hard drive" isnt cutting it with me so i'll have to pass on this game. I was excited to try a Fallout title, too.
---
Oh you mean private servers, i guess i do play with my family so we could all join the private server.
---
It doesn't. I finished the questline about three days after Wastelanders released. And I never involved the Raiders beyond what the quest required.
---
Imo as long as its not for hate speech or dev room, then just wipe the players stash and hand it back after a weekend suspension or something - it's a slap on the wrist - a clear consequence for breaking ToS without employing nuclear option....
---
THANK YOU! (For me, it's always the ammo). Great to have a quick checklist if I'm stumped.
---
I know there are already in game items that increase xp, but some other multi-player games allow you to buy/earn a set amount of double or some percentage of bonus xp. I believe fortnite had(has?) a similar thing where if you logged in during a double xp event, you were guaranteed at least a set amount of xp to earn with the boost if you didn't hit it that weekend. Haven't played that in ages, so apologies if I'm wrong.
---
For instance, instead of saying everyone gets double xp for X amount of days, have some sort of consumable that gives double xp for the same amount of time that can be used by a player's choosing. The only downside I could see is that there wouldnt be the same incentive for masses of people to be on all at once.
---
spawn in the middle of nowhere.  your aim here isn't to win but just find creatures, so you want to spawn in where no one will get in your way and no one has already cleared the creatures.
---
As Bob said, no it does not ruin your rep with the other faction or prevent you from earning rep with the other faction, but depending on your final choice in the main quest, you have a chance to lose 500 rep, or something close to that. I won’t say more than that since it’ll spoil it if you haven’t gotten to that point yet. I personally did both Raider and Settler questlines up until the “Siding with X” quests just to get the most rep I could before hating myself with the single daily quest for each faction.
---
This is hardly a cheat or exploit. You dont have to do anything special to get the blueprint. Considering it's the only item I've ever seen be able to make into a blueprint, I'd say its working as intended.
---
It doesn't ruin your camp budget, infact the machine seems to take nothing from your budget at all.
---
I think there might be the possibility that someone had already placed a keycard in but it wasn't actually "used". There was one time I went in to launch a nuke and when I went to insert my nuclear keycard, nothing happened(forget if it beeped or not). Went ahead and tried entering the code and then launched a nuke. I just kinda went with it since it saved me a keycard.
---
Oof he really should...
---
Yeah but it all stacks multiplicatively so that +4/5int can really add up if you keep it up. It was very noticable during the double exp weekend. 
---
Of course if you're a bloodied unyielding build you probably won't see as big of a relative increase but it's an 8/10% bonus on base exp.
---
This happened today...just now...I’ve had to reinstall now 3 times in the past 6 months. WTF?!?!
---
 Yeah, the legendary ones from generation 3.
---
Also reminds me of the lifter thing uses in the movie Alien.
---
They need to change  questing team to give exp from quest completion. I think it would help pretty much every tier of player. It would give the lower level people incentive to run the old questline ( rather than just doing the minimum to start wastlanders) the mid level guys would have incentive to go do some of the side quest they would normally just skip and the high level that are grinding daily quests for script and notes would also benefit
---
Give it a try on an alternate character, but you can still do their dailies without siding with them, the two are just finding and repairing communications equipment, and dealing with a fleeing raider, you can send him to be rescued by the settlers for extra settler reputation.

*The pursuit of the accumulation of wealth lead to The Great War that destroyed the world as it was. Nuclear fire purified the enormous cities of this continent for their greed and gluttony, leaving only the survivors to scrounge for what remained. However, that purifying fire left a vestige - a reminder of that time - in the form of the “Cap”. They are the skeletal remains of the usurping corporations that once dominated this place, and many other places like it. We now use those remains of the bygone era as currency and as a constant reminder of the dangers of greed visited upon humanity. The oldest of us - the ghouls - still remember those times and have offered us this tenet:*
---
*”To share one’s caps amongst the rest in this hellish world is the way. To hoard one’s caps is to invite the purifying nuclear fire once more.”*
---
*So it shall be, so it is, so it always has been in this new era. The well-meaning denizens of this region follow this commandment of the Appalachian wasteland strictly, as to do otherwise is to invite that destruction once more...*
---
...is what my character would tell you, probably.
---
Not really, it's just a dead horse.
---
Every other new addition is broken (challenges, lunchbox, future tec camp)
---
But doesn't he know he can put the price higher? I mean he's just kinda dumb to begin with. And that's his fault and a win for you. You deserve all his Flux 100%
---
I would put money on a visit from a stray Scorchbeast. 
---
Or alternatively rogue Scorched snipers - a real pita that caused me to relocate one time. If they have a height advantage they will slowly peck away at your Camp for hours outside of turret range. I still have visits at my current river side residence but that have to get closer to attack, and face the wrath of my Collectron, Ally and the local wood chopper as well as a couple of angry heavy turrets more than happy to avenge their ancestors. 
---
And once your defences are down anything and everything has a chance to nibble away.
---
I'd say for regular play and dps commando &gt; rifleman. But honestly either will deal with creatures as long as you are sneaky. You need to stick to suppressed weapons though, regardless.
---
I generally play in a stealth suit on my junky. Just need to stick to dmg avoidance perks, not resists. DR is relatively useless compared to avoidance or flat dmg reduction perks. There is a 'soft cap' for most purposes around 300 or 350. I forget which. I rarely pay attention to DR at this point as any set of SS armor will get you plenty high enough.
---
Then hop servers. People are gonna be mean lol but gas lighting because they wanna do that isn't truly fair. Your giving them the attention they desire so dearly
---
Happy?
---
On xbox you can send messages from the social tab it's not exactly text chat but it something

I'm always the only one collecting ore lol

It sucks cause it takes a long ass time for any to respawn, all you really need is TWO people collecting and you're golden

Wasn't any attention. I was sitting idle while working hoping for an easy event completion.
---
bethesda beds to acknowledge this asap, is sad I had lucky that I manage to hit twice power atack on her wile holding 2 pylon is WAY harder than I thought it would be.
---
That's basically my character that I built around a b2525 fixer. S-3, P-12, E-2, C-4, I-5, A-15, L-15. Every other bullet is a critical hit, and I can use vats nearly endlessly because the gun consumes so little, and grim reaper's sprint refills my AP on every 3rd or 4th shot, anyway. I just stay crouched and pop headshots for 1800 damage on most things. Highest damage I got on the queen with this build was 250 per shot. Can't wait until adrenaline is fixed!
---
What did I ignore?
---
And you didn't give me a reference. A reference is "go watch this specific video", not "go google &lt;whatever topic&gt;."
---
The last consensus I saw was that it didn't matter if you switched targets or missed, it was just all time based (I.e. if you didn't hit anything for so long, you lose the bonus)
---
Getting rid of Legendaries is easier said then done with the script limit and the irregular amounts armor and weapons from 1 to 3 stars give you. It's so annoying to constantly having to finagle how to maximize your daily script amount and not end up wasting some.
---
Thanks for the clarification. You may want to edit the title or add a description since the Nuka-Cola Secret Door is an actual Atomic Shop item. People may get confused like me.
---
I wait, hoping people will show cause I like the guaranteed legendary kills. Saves time on days like this where you need to kill 3
---
Eminem would be proud
---
Nah lol. But you're right, they gotta fix all that shit. And somehow they will never fix the pvp stuff because most of the suggestions are ignored
---
What is a "ran" icon??
---
Honestly, I don't blame you whatsoever. I am such a hoarder that I need to cut carry weight, otherwise I can't fast travel at all. Though, I am a little confused since even a non-legendary .50cal shouldn't have too much trouble taking down a mirelurk queen.
---
Rip. I’ve noticed this too. I think there’s a timer for tagging enemies, after so long it wears off, and you have to reapply your tag -.-
---
Tag. sorry autocorrect
---
sub level 100 spotted
---
I feel you but when it comes to collectron you can only have one anyway but they do plan to raise the camp at some point the devs want it as well but I think they are stumped on how to do it and not cause server issues again.
---
It’s the circus cage door, comes with that plan. If I remember right you find the circus cage and scroll right to build the door. Odd setup.
---
Adrenaline + gun fu + grim reaper's sprint = unstoppable dealer of death. As long as I don't get discovered, I'm nearly invulnerable. With my agility boosted to 36 with mutations and Unyielding armor (plus the stealth bonuses from armor and fixer), I've had enemies walk into me and not see me. With luck boosted to 32, I get pies for days, and critical shots like it's my job.
---
Of course. I’ll repair the Ultracite Two Shot Gatling Laser when I have the resources and give it a taste next time...
---
Same thing happened to my wife today. She's PISSED.
---
Ive checked The Deep - fever blossom, starlight berries, glowing fungus and brain fungus only. Wendigo Cave is just glowing+brain fungus
---
I am pretty sure the glowing mushrooms in the mire aren't them, but I will check to be sure. I know the trees in Ash Heap are Blight fungus...
---
I can't remember the name because it is a almost 4 year old video. It is a modding reference video for 4 and explain a lot about range damage drop off how magnification on scopes work how far can the bullet travel before it disappears.
---
Nah. No interest in dealing with the raiders at all. Playing my character as essentially Lawful Neutral. He kills raiders when he sees them.
---
Damn that’s too bad I don’t have the plans for it

Thanks for being a wise ass, no really, it helps!
---
Why are you telling us? No one here can do anything.
---
I saw it as sabotage and undermining them!
---
I bought it, i love it, the voice is cool too. Havent tired of it, but i use PA only when needed, otherwise im armorless. 
---
If you like it, get it.
---
For the record, you can sometimes get two right off the bat when you spawn in front of Vault-Tec University.
---
After that it’s just a matter of camping in a bush and waiting for more creatures to spawn by the edge of the circle. 
---
You might even be able to get 3 in before being ripped in half by the guy in a ghillie suit and skull hemet with the .50 cal.
---
EDIT: Based on other comments on this thread, basically just inner Morgantown is a pretty good place to spawn, with the High School and the University being only two decent spots.
---
I've had a few lobbies where there have been a good mix of the two, but more than anything I find I get into a lot of lobbies with only one or two teams at all, and people don't care enough to join. I keep getting thrown into lobbies full of (what I would assume are) Games Pass players who are mostly low level and don't know the ins and outs of the game just yet. Give it a couple weeks and most of them will either be bored of the grind and leave or will learn a few things and figure out that building is better for their leveling.

---
Your post is a joke? How so?
---
I feel guilt for want that thing and not use ALL THE TIME :/
---
I don't think there is any real hope for balanced PVP, sadly.  I think the problem is that the game's engine is the same one that they used in single player games that were made to be easily modded. Something that was a strength for single player games has become a major weakness for this one.  I think the engine  made the game vulnerable to more exploits than Bethesda could possibly keep up with.  That's definitely their fault. I am not making excuses for them. It's a damn shame but what can ya do?
---
But appreciated none the less. Thank you very very much.
---
Have you never heard of Eminem in your life?
---
Spot on.
---
Thank you! Someone that understands! I’m not going to change my build every situation cuz I usually can’t and just cuz the game doesn’t bother to make it more fun yet. And yea idk either, but I’ll find out for sure next
---
time! 🙏❤️
---
I hated my 10xx series nvid card. I seriously crashed on almost every big game i played at the time i had it.

I’m sorry I don’t listen to the radio.

I’m sorta jealous I think.
---
Legendary Perks are going to be impossible to max out. Too bad you can't start a new character and pick up where you left off..
---
The XP curve is still based on Fallout 4, where the last unlock was around level 200.

Me want recipe

check the skin for you camp gadget if you have one on it you will no appear on the map

Call me stupid and crazy but I still love it, well hate it and love it but more addiction then love, maybe..? 😳

If you want to level up past level 1000, you need to exploit or spend 10 hours grinding mutants.

Bethesda=Mr Im too good to call or write my fans.
---
Okay. It's for FO4. This isn't FO4. It's BASED on FO4, but there's enough differences that I'm not going to pay any attention to a FO4 video when I can actually test this stuff in game.
---
I have tested this stuff. It works like I said. I'm not even sure I understand how you're trying to explain it's different.
---
This all started with you saying the lever action has half the range of the hunting rifle. Let's get back to that.
---
It does not. The picture I posted is a result of me literally just going in game and testing the damage numbers.
---
 If you still think it does, please provide the basis for your belief.
---
Yuuuuup
---
... but did it rub it on its skin??
---
I used to think the bugs were tolerable until my BE lever-action disappeared from my inventory
---
Exactly. Legendary coins become very rare at high levels. It's like they either don't expect us to actually max cards, or they want this content to stretch til 2025.

Who doesn't have at least 3 charisma for hard bargain though? Plus it's the choice we pay, want to be a team player sharing perks, then like everyone else you gotta commit to it like we have.
---
Nah, I haven't caught anyone yet. Though, this one guy in power armor kept killing my friend and I at a lower level, we went peaceful and he came into my house. I locked him in and he picked the lock to get out, earning himself a wanted level.
---
This honestly gave me the biggest chuckle. 😂
---
Sweet. Thanks for the tip!
---
nice
---
That’ll be the last 12.99$ I ever send their ass.
---
Yeah no thanks. Small percentage of the PC community would hack their saves/give themselves items than transfer them over to console.
---
Sounds nice. I need to do the enclave line soon. I keep forgetting.
---
Thats when it helps to be in a team and hope one of your team mates gets a hit on it. Youd be able to loot that and any other legendaries they hit. I got stuck with 2 or 3 pylons at one a couple days ago and I know for a fact I never hit the Imposter because if Im tanking pylons I have to stay out the fight, I cant do both. One of my team mates must have got some hits in though because I could loot the Imposter as well as some other legendary bots
---
Be careful not to spam them though, my friend kept sending messages too quickly and they told him that future messages would be ignored.
---
The institute pa looks kick ass but they would have to add a story where the institute makes it's way into wv for it to make sense.
---
Yeah those guys don't even read the ticket. They just paste whatever response was last copied.
---
I had problem with an event in game on pc. They told me how to solve login issues on xbox.
---
&gt; duping presents an opportunity to be a positive event.
---
Sorry but that unexpected mental gymnastics at the end is ridiculous. 
---
&gt; With duping, you have to consent to participate
---
You got this guy above swearing up and down the thread that he did nothing but trade for a duped item which contradicts your "knowledge". And he's not the only one. I'd say your assumption is wrong. If you at least started with "I think", instead of giving a definite response on what Bethesda can and can't do and their methods maybe there'd be something more to discuss ... But yeah, let's ruin in game economy for casual players that don't have 20,000 caps to pay for inflated priced weapons like those who built up their reserves through duping just so we can share those duped items with our friends who don't get that this genre is "grindy" by default. Like someone else said on this sub - it's like none of you played WoW or EQ or any other online RPG. Even the grindiest parts here don't come close to some shit people had to do in WoW.
---
 
---
&gt;  A positive experience for all parties involved.
---
Yeah, except for thousands of casual players that don't dupe and are left to feel inferior when they can't even get a shot in to claim loot...
---
on a market forum you can get it for 10kish cap
---
The game reuse the entirety of fallout 4 everything that was in f4 is literally in this game just deactivated did you forget when people where spawning in the prydwen
---
Thanks a bunch I appreciate
---
Try the lazy way: Keep the quest active and do something else. 
---
There is a chance another player wander there and kill them for you.
---
The One wasteland update coming out should help with this
---
It technically was never released in fo4. So, technically, it can have whatever lore it wants, since it never existed in the first place.
---
Same, the only bugs I've encountered are ghouls appearing as "protectron" in their health bar and some minor texture bugs that I attribute to the shitty engine. 
---
The only times I've crashed were due to my own incompetence installing mods.
---
No, I didn't. I also know a ton of things that are different from FO4. And you're avoiding the point. Why do you think the Hunting Rifle has a longer range than the lever action?
---
I tho outfit was this system
---
It never happened then I had a week where it happened 3 times and hasn't happened since. it drove me insane but do make sure you're not suing the new c.a.m.p. skin
---
Sell the good ones like ultracite, mg42....fatman...for the love of Tod dont drop the ones worth over 1000 caps.
---
Feed those to your camp vendors
---
Any of the jetpacks that you buy from the Atom shop aren't skins, they're full jetpacks. You would add them like any mod.
---
I sort of feel this. I just started playing New Vegas again and what I miss is how you have “random” encounters with people and they send you off on a quest or they connect to something bigger. You get to make decisions and be good or bad. This game basically doesn’t have that element. If you happen on a random NPC, yeah they have a story but it doesn’t mean anything. You do get a few options with Wastlanders but after that a lot of these elements are just grindy, repeatable quests with little reward. I’m also one of the few players that just doesn’t care for camp creation, didn’t care for it in FO4 either. The world is pretty impressive though and playing with friends/other players is irreplaceable.
---
It’s also supposed to be availble with the level 98 cosmo bundle Bethesda support already confirmed it on Twitter
---
Ah, jeeze! That’s intense!
---
Nice thing about the atom shop, if you dont have the atoms to buy it immediately, by the time you get enough it will be available for less atoms than originally shown.
---
 I got an update through twitter after struggling with the support interface (it kept glitching and wouldn't accept my doc, docx, or pdf and when I finally got my evidence document attached to my ticket, the update ticket button disabled and wouldn't let me submit. Here was the response: "Hello! We can confirm that the reply you sent today has been received and is in the correct queue for manual review. When an update is available an agent will be able to reach out. Thanks for your patience as our volume has been higher than usual. "
---
Yeah pungie boards have damage collision whilst being moved in build mode from the videos that I've seen!

You see, when I went to install my jetpack, I didn't see anything relating to my skin, is it not available on the T-65 set?

it’s not up to you what people think is worthwhile or not
---
Based on what?
---
Since Fo76 came out *everything* Bethesda does scares the hell out of me. So they might as well do what's best for players 😝
---
It’s hot if you eat it right away...
---
It’s a lazy shitpost.
---
I can build for you, do you happen to have flux?
---
whats up Miller, yeah that's what i'm thinking i went back to mess about with the robot dlc in FO4 and its not the same i spent years in those games now i cant seem to spend an hour in one without thinking about 76
---
I think they should bring them all out as mobile games maybe not 4 but defo FO3 and NV so i can play them going to work lol.
---
Buy from player vendors, sporadic but they are out there
---
This guy gets it.
---
You do let the low levels tag the enemies first before you one shot them right? Otherwise they wont get any xp.
---
One of the biggest downfalls of this game is its wasted potential. Welcome to Appalachia.
---
That the two shot legendary guns basically suck with vats. I mean potentially missing 7 95% shots in a row continously.
---
A radscorpion egg omelette will remove one random addiction. Not exactly the same but it requires an egg.
---
Yeah. I don't get that either. I'm just activating workshops for events and just usually drop a big blueprinted sign saying 'Take the workshop. I don't care.' and another blueprinted platform full of lvl 2 turrets for killing the occasional molerat attackers because I'm much too terribly lazy to deal with a defence event that involves those garbage enemies. Then drop like 10 scarecrows to draw all the AI aggro to right under the turrets' line of fire and call that a day. And that ends up costing someone, like, 80 to 90 caps just to claim. Attackers don't even get back the caps they spent at that point.
---
So when folks are like 'I spend 10+ minutes setting up this shop' it's just a total mystery to me because there's just no point. Just blueprint some structures and call it a day.
---
I think dupers are still suspended on purpose. I assume it’s a timeout and/or they haven’t decided your punishment yet.
---
Unfortunately, Pretty much every MMO game does this.
---
I see the value is 508 caps.
---
Can I start the ball rolling at 509?
---
You don’t have to “play with” anyone, you just need to get into the event and do 1k or so damage to the queen. Server hop a bit or even better, check the “looking for group” on Xbox, there are queen events announced very regularly!
---
There are still pvp'ers, and workshops are pvp zones.  I get people, when I'm harvesting junk from my collectors kill me in pvp, and I spawn elsewhere, but they never take the workshop. I don't do it, but there are people, especially knowing this is a score challenge that are just waiting to do this.
---
Fair point!
---
I made a little video showing it! 😁😁😁 -https://youtu.be/-27D6V8tmjo
---
Impressive
---
Get a friend shot hit them every few feet keep track of the distance number displayed eventually you will get to a distance where the game dosent show them
---
I'll leave my comment remove most of it but sorry for offenting so many people. To many people don't like trolling in game I guess.
---
I think I only trolled one person with the shared rad sponge perk.
---
Way I see it, if a workshop is 'activated' and the reclaim event is up they should just make it an event that shows up on the map for players to see. A workshop at reclaim is basically saying 'the workshop owner doesn't care about the shop, so just take it' anyway. That way players will keep workshops more active and keep spawning more defence events for exp and such.
---
The benefit of the workshop has stopped being about anything but exp at this point. Or it would be if the events had more reliable spawns and marked the attacking AI on the map with a pip like in Line in the Sand. Sitting around waiting for these molerats to show up because the AI director cannot pick a good spawn location for them is incredibly annoying. And, more importantly, the late game shops shouldn't even be spawning molerat attackers. Give them some more super mutants/scorchbeasts/blood eagles/fog crawlers/sentrybots/deathclaws/communists + commiebots and the like.
---
Like I could guarantee you people would be claiming more shops for that juicy exp if the attackers were those sorts of enemies in 4/4 waves.
---
The nuka Machine is also an item. I don't think the secret door is available at the moment. I would edit if I could though
---
Public Teams are there for you.

Hey, hey, hey. Whooow there. This is fine.

It is not mental gymnastics to say that a person can have fun with a weapon that was once unobtainable to them. Remember, legacies don't drop, and there's no way you'd be able to get your hands on them without someone duping one. Period. Playing with an explosive Gatling Plasma is fun. Just don't be a dick with it- which is independent of a person having duped to get it.
---
If Bethesda could detect duped items, don't you think they would do something about it *before* it goes public? Why are there thousands upon thousands of people who are not banned even though they most **definitely** have duped items? Why is the duped item not immediately recognized and deleted if it's known to be duped? 
---
You thinking duping ruins the economy for casual players is ridiculous and ill-informed. Casuals would **never** get their hands on a legacy otherwise. Heck, even just this past week you saw an influx of legacies into the market and folks who would have never been able to obtain one getting one. Good luck convincing a person to drop his legit JE Gatling Plasma for caps he can grind out in a week.
---
As someone who got shat on for calling this out earlier today, I’ve finally found my people. The whole SCORE system is designed around rewards that really only work for Adventure mode. There is no reason we should have to participate in Nuclear Winter to unlock these rewards!
---
It's an exploit used by players at the moment. People have to go out of their way to use it, which means it's something that will be on Bethesda's radar.
---
I'd avoid it at all costs, Bethesda doesn't take kindly to overt exploits and duping.
---
Considering how it is done it will be very easy to identify players who have abused the exploit.
---
Yeah, I'm on a hillside, in the forest. So nothing dangerous.  Just annoying.
---
...that's a pizza.
---
Amen! Very thankful someone at Bethesda Rotated them back in. =D   
---
Better still, Junk walls are coming in the next patch!
---
It used to be alot better, as of late I have noticed it getting worse especially sharing legendary enemies.
---
I feel you man i miss those mad weird encounters, hopefully they get ambitious with this game like see how you can travel basically all of the past game maps in ESO, imagine they done that with this would be sweet!!!
---
For real?? Where can I learn more?!
---
No, you're wrong :p
---
Definitely. Jump, VATS, then shoot.
---
I don't,  started playing this week so haven't  ventured into a blast zone yet but i can try to get some 😊 wouldn't be today though as it's 2am currently
---
There are two cool downs. One for the silos on the server, and one for the character.
---
Ohh I'll have a look thank you
---
Not the first or last time that happens... Dicks
---
Thats what I used.
---
I set them up and defend them, there isn't much else to do in this game.
---
I could see that because Bethesda has already added so many already: Overseer tickets, scout badges, scrip, etc. At the same time, they've never added a currency reward for events like they do with Treasury Notes. At the very least I see them adding some more stuff for buillon in the future
---
It reminds me of Matthew Mconaughey jumping at the dragon in Reign of Fire
---
I have a DREAM! That one day, we will be able to gather all together, and ride on an army of invisible mr fuzzies, towards the raising nuclear shroom! Epic, truly.... i have yet to see that magnificent ride, but i need it now.
---
Nice shot right there!
---
Get off the damn bunker though, she is never going to land!!!!!!!
---
When she lands 2 seconds later I don't want to hear about it.
---
I skimmed through this so I may look like an idiot. But if you run nukes often, or have ever, check your misc. for damaged mainframe cores. They’ll clog up your inventory very quickly. I once had 75 pounds worth of them for about a month without even knowing.
---
This is supremely helpful for adjusting INI settings w/o having to muck around in files:  [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/546](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/546)
---
There's a repeatable for events, but who knows if and when they'll roll that one out.
---
You dont need to spec into the tesla, hitting for 1 damage is the same as 150 when it comes to tagging outside of the SBQ, tesla shots chain from one enemy to the next so you get more tags per shot. If you can find a reduced weight model your mint.
---
Legendaries from events are kinda meh, they are usually under leveled and rarely 3*. That said ive seen more people bash and do the come here emote for legendaries since public teams was added.
---
Ive done a few line in the sand now with the glitch, all you gotta do is cook a grenade and get the timing down. Listen for when other cook one too, it makes a noise. Its pretty awesome seeing tons of exp pop up per grenade. Though mowing them down at range in VATS is fun too.
---
People show up. You don’t need to be playing on a team
---
Or Silva or Billings Homestead, you can grab countless corn or razorgrain respectively. Which you might actually be able to use or eat.
---
We can only hope, the damage multiplier which currently are to high will always be a problem since someone will find the right combination to do huge amounts of damage.
---
🤦‍♂️
---
Oh I agree with you on that one :) :) :) :) :)
---
Nobody is farming an event for XP, they're doing it for the event rewards.
---
So which one does the missile status tape display?
---
Forest. I get irritated that all the mobs aren't worth the bullets.
---
I was behind the camera, not shooting the gun.
---
Only for fallout 1st subscribers.
---
Do u have strangler armor? If so can u put the cosmos paint on it with the vines showing thru
---
I just feel its only going to get worse and the game they wanted at launch(rust clone) might come true due to people not being able to not one shot.
---
If they ever do balance it, it will generate so much hate if they nerf bloodied.
---
This guy was ten paces on day one. Are we suppose to catch him?
---
Were trying to get the basics working in this game. Adding a fallout Photoshop face app would send this game into a different bug dimension.
---
Didnt know it was mirror only any suggestions on places with mirrors to check?
---
I don't know if melting player data while trying to start a New Game+ is "best." 😒
---
Chems and food has really caught up to me. I either picked them up or was rewarded, but I had 100+ Radaway and Rad-X, both regular and diluted. Also had 30+ of most snacks, from Blamco Mac &amp; Cheese to Sugar Bombs. Nuka Colas are 1lb, you don't notice until you have 20+.
---
Grenades take up a lot of weight too. With 50+ frag grenades and molotovs, one Ordnance Express card was enough to drop about 50lbs. Slowly going through them though.
---
Using steel for railroad spikes is useful. It's easy to build your CAMP then scrap the items if you need to use wood. I've gone through six fusion cores, a dozen missiles, and a few mini-nukes. Legendary armors with chem and food weight reduced by 20% have helped. Overall I've used nearly 300lbs of items in the past week.
---
Ohh I see, that's great then thank you 😊
---
To be fair, the Fixer plan is the real reward from that event. There's a better 3 star guaranteed spawn by hourly in Riding Shotgun anyway.
---
Thanks to this comment I almost overlooked it
---
That’s fine, I can still help you with it, I can’t remember which it uses but I have enough, shoot me a message on Xbox, GT: CrumbBum3857, I’ll be on later tonight.  The shower needs electricity, do you have a generator at your camp?
---
Hopefully they remove a lot of the placed clutter.
---
You can have tons of mobs, tons of plants or tons of clutter - but you can't have all 3.
---
They overloaded that vault to test stability. Sick move.
---
Valley galleria does my fucking head in. I once spent a stupid amount of time going in and out of the place because the quest diamond thing's placement makes it look like its on the entry way and thinking it was bugged. Took me way to long to realise that its actually indicating somewhere on that bit that goes around the corner to the left.
---
Not really, it's mechanics that are already in the game
---
An alien event or DLC would be awesome and they could incorporate this. It has an alien-like feel to me.
---
All legendary dragons are legacy, it was only obtained via the raid.
---
Same with rippers.
---
This doesn't work on the Xbox.
---
I checked my ammo machine and have 270 rounds of .45 ready for pickup; I then checked my stash box and found only 2 rounds of .45 in the ammo section.
---
I like to annoy and grief other players but also to prep my account for the inevitable balance patch.
---
Yes it became legacy. I have a ghoul slayer explosive.
---
You'll be lucky to get a dozen shots out of it even at 200%  it breaks fast.
---
Oh okay, I think I understand. So it was more the waste of flux? What platform are you on? I might be able to give you some.
---
Hmmm, well that would favor any build, but it’s definitely more a grind than XP, which allows more freedom to go and do what you want.
---
I think, don't know for sure that its the duplication process that gets you banned and not actually the item itself.
---
Done that too, but I got impatient.
---
I think things like this could be something a modded server would enjoy. Something the community was promised before the game launched. I think they have their hands full with other things but I am ready for a seperate modded ecosystem.
---
I wish the Energy weapons had a silent mode. Darn!
---
Ill say one thing for Wren and the Importance of Communication. All the other npc quest givers could take a leaf out of her book on cutting to the chase. "You back? Good. I need shit. Go get it"
---
What do you think I was doing when I posted the picture of me and the baggy? Now, I was checking the range before damage dropoff STARTED, not before damage completely zero'd out, but I see no reason they wouldn't be the same. And the range dropoff starts seems much more relevant.
---
Also, why do you think the difference is double? What's your reason for that? Have you personally gone in game and tested the two rifles with a friend?
---
Reading these comments I now understand why so few ppl ever entered my camp, get some walk bys but not a lot of ppl going in. But I have a main house on a stream, a bridge across the stream to a set of buildings. One is just a workshop with all the crafting stations and the other has my vendors and a little guest room with a bed to sleep and get resting bonus. 
---
I never would have thought it looks like a possible trap.
---
Fallout 4 has multiple building sets that are not in Fallout 76 (most of them, really). The wood set is different. The metal set is different. There is the concrete set that would be great for bunker-style camps. I don't know why porting those over hasn't been done in all of this time since release. Seems like that would be an easy win for them.
---
Also, I’ve heard talk recently on the diminishing returns of damage resistance. Some have said that above 350 DR is unnecessary and may hurt you in the end. Couldn’t explain it myself but I ran a Vanguard build and was regularly above 500DR. Supposedly it’s better to focus on damage reduction perks and armor - as after a certain point the extra DR isn’t actually doing much.
---
I do, I have water farms in my CAMP. I'm just more suprised that everyone seems totally ok with the game just crashing willy nilly. Like if I'm planning on playing a 3 hour session I'm gonna slap down like 10 water purifiers and all the necessary generators so I can stop in every 20-30 minutes and farm, ya feel?
---
I think what they’re saying is, look at your build.  At level 100+ you should be able to kill a mirelurk Queen with a non legendary weapon...by yourself.    A good build is key.  
---
Aim for the legs on a queen.
---
Bloodied can run ores just fine. My advice is to rename all your armour pieces to something like [*** (Name goes here)] and also rename your stealth armour as well so they're all at the top of your apparel inventory, then it's significantly faster to swap out your armour for the stealth suit and then put back on your armour when you're done.
---
With the stealth suit on you don't take much rads at all and a diluted radaway on hotkey deals with the potential overdose on rads. Honey on hotkey also helps regenerate AP if you're overencumbered and out of AP to move.
---
Welcome to the club. I've lost about 20k score points so far because of this bug. We got t-shirts, cake and pie.
---
It is officially a legacy, bethesda doesn't really need to tell you that. The only The Dragon obtainable at this moment is the default one.
---
Oh no no, I already got some flux, thank you for offering though :)
---
I'd just like a harder game mode option on the main menu
---
Some points about stealth:
---
Agility: max it to 15.  The higher the better, so pickup unyielding and drop your health.  You won't be detected and will have a lot of AP points for VATS.  Use Sneak3, Covert, Sandman, escape artist and Marathon perks.  Leverage GunFu when detected.  If you have 21+ agility, rarely are you detected.
---
Armor:  use one chameleon piece and the rest with unyielding and at least one of those with sneak.  Major attributes should be AP refresh, agility or endurance to help with sneak, health and AP points.  And use ultralight mods since armor weight affects detection and boosts AP points.  Avoid heavy given the weight.  Scout is good b/c it offers same DR as heavy, but weighs less.  Use the sturdy frame perk to make armor lighter=less detectable.
---
Weapons:  pick up bloodied and junkies.  Majors won't matter that much initially, but shoot for 50 crit for rifleman and FFR for commando as you progress, then VATS for the 3rd attribute.  Explosive is good too, but does compromise detection.  You need a good hold out weapon when detected with a higher fire rate than your sniper weapon, doesn't explode and uses the same perks rifleman or commando.  Ideally different ammo than your sniper.
---
Mutations:  marsupial for jumping on stuff to escape, adrenalin reaction for boosted damage at low health, carnivore, speed demon for reload and faster stealth movement and healing factor (assuming you don't rely on chems for damage output).
---
Perks: minimum 12 perception   Max commando/rifleman and 3 to swap between glow sights, tank killer and maybe concentrated fire.
---
Rifleman/commando:  pick one or the other per character, not both.  It takes too long to stack perk cards while in combat even w/3rd party utilities.  If a perk build out is introduced that changes per weapon, then definitely use rifleman for main weapon and commando for hold out.
---
There is a lot I'm leaving out.  Ping me if you need more information or explanation.
---
this is some good investigation! cheers on figuring out exactly what it was we were seeing-- these fireballs need some gravity added to them
---
Its a video game. Stats can be quantified and you can objectively declare a weapon the best of its class.
---
It's a fantastic shot, I seriously like it a lot.
---
Why am I so heavy...
---
/eats 4 canned stews and 12 sweet rolls
---
Seriously though, great guide! 👍
---
Yup the perks are really bad. At least we have the SPECIAL training perks so maybe I could boost up my charisma to share a rank 2 card.
---
It looks like a salt shaker.
---
Gauss or radium rifle. I think this was a joke, but im an idiot so i looked it up.
---
Is the Greenhouse worth picking up?
---
Don't build up workshops. The game can't handle the load.
---
Devs are really naive thinking they will one day fix it.
---
Couldn’t enter the code because it wouldn’t take the keycard. I tried both entering the # and launching it. Just got a beep and the PA system said to enter in the keycard.

Not sure if the subreddits rules will let me link the psycho voltage discord here - But you can find a link to the server usually in JerseysGhost datamining videos. If you'd rather not - I'll put together a little imgur album.

Interesting. The Red Rocket Ranger Jet Pack is listed as an option when I go to modify my T-65 torso but it's grayed out like I'm short components though I have plenty. Oddly, the MothMan version is also grayed out while the Free States Survivalist version is currently equipped. Only difference I can see between them is the Free States requires nuclear material. And I don't have enough violet flux to experiment. 
---
I wonder if there's something missing. Like a required material that's not showing and therefore is being checked as available.
---
Sure! Whats your gamertag?

Once i find this red (i will) i may start looking for those
---
Sounds to me like someone cherry-picked your death bag. Nuclear waste does not disappear from your dropped junk. As for “making it”, you can mine it from any workshop that has “nuclear” as a resource (like Red Rocket or the Federal Disposal Field way on the bottom of the map).
---
Wish there was a good extended around, hopefully someone makes one :)
---
Any eggs? Or is it just like the brahmin minus the milk and easier to keep safe.
---
Haven’t played in 2 months, what’s a legendary run?
---
It is, but it's such a useless weapon to carry for a build. One shotting SBQ or anything on public server just kinda makes you a dick.
---
Same here.
---
do plasma grenades not scale at 100 or something (mid 80s here)
---
I got to level 485 in about 7 months~ 
---
I'm still working full time with no family related responsibilities but it's doable, the hardest part is the level 1 through to level 50 solo.
---
I spent the first 85 levels buming around with a wacky build, doing quests &amp; sight seeing.
---
High level players starting to roleplay as Mysterious Stranger essentially. Now you just need a microphone and play the little jingle as well.
---
Im not bloodied and Im doing alright. I respecced my character this week a little and tweaked CHR so i can take advantage of the perks and team bonuses that boost INT. With some other buffs I can sit around 27 to 28 INT Im sure you get way more on bloodied but what Im getting has made a big difference for me
---
We have it for PA, but it should apply to all weapons and apparel as well.
---
Atom shop outfits being craftable items instead of paintjobs has been my pet peeve.
---
That's nuts. I have 16 and I never have problems. So weird. I believe you...just odd.
---
cool, it will only take 12 days of extra bonuses to equal the SCORE I lost to autocompleting challenges
---
I'm no rank snob!
---
I’m not entirely new to the game (got it in February) but what’s the difference between “!” events and other smaller ones? I rarely do events, so I’m not sure of the difference
---
Plant crops to make Infinate whisky!
---
No logic.
---
They roll 20 sided dice to determine if new asset is atom shop or earnable.
---
1-18 is atom shop.
---
19-20 is earnable.
---
I recommend finding a good weapon prefix that you like and building something to compliment that. if in the future you find you made mistakes with perks don't worry because you can always fix them later, but once you get a good weapon prefix you will have an idea of what armor you want and what perks you need
---
As long as it's super valuable is all I care about. Just gonna use it to get my hands on a 2/3\* bloodied fixer if I can help it anyway.
---
Did you see the post of the player who was level 10,000?
---
explosives
---
Ps4 and 88. I'm also a busy bee so I'm in no rush at all. :)
---
Glad it produces so much fertilizer. This will help greatly with explosives.
---
Also its not rads, it's fungal spores
---
Communist power armour?
---
I like that mindset. It made me feel bad but like...why should I feel bad because someone else is a dick? ;)
---
Company Tea and Sweetwater Blend are OP
---
Certainly better than anything the damn SBQ has given me!
---
I agree that people who are jerks online are probably either jerks irl or would be if they felt they had the "power" to be. Sad.
---
It's a reddit post.  There are these things called "jokes" and you apparently don't get this one lol
---
I think I have about 200~ hours since (just before wastelanders came out) I'm at level 485.
---
Any XP buffs &amp; INT boosts is what you need.
---
lol good one!
---
Yes, always legs.  Don't bother with the body like mentioned above in an earlier comment.  If undetected, 2-7 shots, legendary or not with the right build.  And don't bother w/VATS since it's a large target and points would be better spent on tank killer.
---
This is good, I'm barely at level 36. I was doing the bare minimum and missing a few weeklies and easy dailies, like joining a team, the first two weeks. 
---
Though it feels like I spend less than an hour playing every day, that includes being over-encumbered and walking where I need to go.
---
Yes! I'll add you. I'm busy with a work project lately so I have no idea when I'll have time to invest but itd be nice to have a fellow filthy casual lady on my friends list regardless. ;D
---
At about level 80 is when the game really starts. Or after you launch your first nuke to be specific. After that the goal is to create a perfectly nodded power armor and roll a perfect set of scout armor and weapons at the Rusty pick. The SBQ fight is a huge xp bonus as are the repetitive dailies( I do ALL on my 3 play days EXCEPT the vox syringer, cute once, but tedious) and events NOW that teams are available and the legendary run is going you don't have to find ones you can solo.
---
the charging barrels VASTLY reduce the fire rate. Your overall DPS will drop by a loooot.
---
I'm on PC and I'm always either grabbing ore or healing scavs with my swing speed Shishkebab. Found that thing in a player vendor for 600 caps and didn't even bother to check the other effects, I just bought it on the spot.
---
Don’t email them. I’ve tried, it never works. Apply for a ticket and have them message you directly. It works far faster.
---
I can’t get it to clip on! Am I using the wrong one? Is there more than one? I’ve tried everything! (The door with the little round man)
---
I was able to kill three creatures over two games last night. I doubt I'll have the same luck today.
---
For sale? DM
---
This ^
---
I farm westtec and got to level 485 in around ~200-300 hours of game play.
---
I started playing just before wastelanders came out.
---
This right here!
---
They can't kill them.
---
Enjoying summer? I an in thee most southern state of the united states, and it is 65°F at 4 pm, why does it have to be so dam like warm, but the real problem is that my internet cannot connect to even the most basic of games
---
I'm crying for you! What a series of unfortunate events! My psn is the same as my username here if you'd like to add me!
---
I agree. Especially now with legendary perks.
---
Ah ok. I thought maybe the FFR would offset it and (obviously not make it shoot as fast without charging barrels but make it not as bad). I think without Charging Barrels the fire rate is 220.
---
Like I said I barely crash, however this game has way to many bugs and most people aren’t ok with it, but unfortunately “not being ok with it” doesn’t fix them.
---
There’s a day vendor cap anyway of 1400c and having 4-5 water purifiers should give you plenty. Only build purifiers/generators  in workshops where it uses the green materials (not yours) than if something goes wrong you don’t lose anything.
---
This games issues are likely not going away either adapt or keep getting screwed over by them but at some point it’s no longer the games fault but your own.
---
You can build both.
---
Swiper got your ass
---
One shotting has been here since launch, you dont even need to go full glass cannon or bloodied to one shot.
---
And dont blame the bloodied, if public teams taught me anything its that a TON more people play bloodied than I ever figured and plenty rock nerf weapons for events, they are also the ones helping carry others @ SBQ and ISS.
---
The amount of one shotting will raise and fall like it always has, as people come into and leave the game and learn the ins and outs of how to be a good community player or dont for some.
---
Some people play games for fun, or an escape, some play to build their wildest dreams, and than some just play to stroke their ego. People be messy.
---
Just look forward to once they sort out the One Wasteland update, which is hopefully a semi clone of One Tamriel from ESO.
---
Do the lode bearing event there is uranium nodes in there that make nuclear waste with super duper
---
yeah
---
 Happened to me for the first time today as well.  Just wish they would communicate some plan of action going forward for people that have been affected.
---
I'll give you my personal preferences depending on the build.
---
Commando: handmade or fixer if stealthy
---
Heavy weps: 50 cal or gauss minigun if you can afford the ammo
---
Mele: deathclaw gauntlet 
---
Shotgun: gauss shotgun
---
They’d probably have to drop the Institute part of its identity (due to lore reasons, but this is Bethesda so wtf is lore) but I’d love to finally be able to mess around with this suit! Maybe if it was Enclave tech and had a similar paint job to 76’s X-01 armor... it could be a masterpiece.
---
"Shit, I need to catch up."
---
-started a new account 2 days ago.
---
Wish the legendary run didn't auto complete challenges, Bethesda support are worse than no help!
---
Ah sorry, next time I'll keep my comments simple so you will get that I was too joking.
---
Prime does ablut the same damage as hardened, but easier to find ammo for. Dont waste time or effort on it.
---
Pickaxe Pilsner is goated
---
Spawn a couple guards to take care of them or die. Despawn them out of view once the threat is dispersed.
---
thanks Banshee!
---
Ummm you can just pause while in nuclear winter and check.
---
For anyone curious I picked up the grill. [Looks awesome](https://imgur.com/a/F1Gsjl1). Has a bbq sparks effect you can see from a distance as well. Very pleased with its quality.
---
Rad Ant Lager.  Accept no substitutes.
---
I was just coming on here to complain lmao. Haven't been on since yesterday, yet just about every daily and weekly challenge I have is completed. I have about 2k score worth of challenges I can complete, but that's it. (: Awesome.
---
Agreed.  Prefer the 10mm SMG silencer over the dual wield if an option.
---
I stopped a while ago. I only go on fallouts  twitter and comment asking about people being suspended.
---
Get a plasma gun and you'll have more nuclear waste than you'll ever need.
---
So is that a good thing? Idk what to think about that. It’s good but bad.
---
Do the Radiation Rumble event, you will get a lot
---
Bugs the hell out of me when Census Violence takes place literally in the brahmin pens of Blue Ridge. The same brahmin you are meant to die protecting in Riding Shotgun. Yet when scorched are crawling all over their shit during CV the guards pay no notice even if the scorched wind up killing them
---
You can just buy them from the vendor bots can't you? Try a lap around whitesprings vendors.
---
Your mom's house? Sorry, couldn't resist 😂 As you level up, I used to start at watoga train station and head to the forward base or whatever it's called, straight South, and take out the gutsy (s) protectron\assaultron (usually you'll get a plan\magazine\bobblehead). Keep going south, sometimes you'll find something (sheepsquatch ect) at the (for lack of a better word "weird" spawn spot) Keep heading South until you find a cabin (can sometimes buy the Hunter's long coat, winter jacket ect from the vendor that can spawn there) or find a weapons plan. Next hit up the farm close by, sunrise?(throw a grenade in the pond\swamp for the mirelurk queen) Now go due East and take out the SB and scorched at the fissure site on your way to fissure site prime. One you've cleared prime, clear out forward base Delta (a little southeast) check the upper deck for plans\bobble heads. If you survive all this, circle back towards Watoga train station, but go through the abandoned rail yard and pick lock\search all the container cars. Unload at Watoga. Follow the tracks West from Watoga and check the the empty rail cars (usually a good sellable plan in the empty car with the ramp entrance) Carry on to the NAR repair yard (I think) clear that out. Usually a bobble (in the train station looking building) and a plan in the quanset hut. Rinse and repeat. I know you're probably not quite there yet, but you will be soon enough. Oh and if you get a Marine tactical helmet plan, learn it, craft it, sell it for max caps everyday. And as always, rest for XP (resets after you die) and eat that canned stew! (Feed the people) Hope this helps
---
my problem is I run this perk loadout by default. my dps is shitty but boy can I carry everything and the kitchen sink.
---
 The reange stat you see is in fact not the drop off range.
---
Alright to clarify, the range stat on weapons is actually mostly meaningless as far as the question of ranged drop off goes. Some of my numbers may be misremembered, as it has been a while and I cannot find the original datamine thread these were in when I learned of them, but I have done my best to give a general overview. Gain of salt advised.
---
There are three stats that effect the performance of your gun at range, I can't remember the exact names, but i will refer to them as dammin, dammax, and vrange
---
Vrange is the one that the game shows you, and this is a number that effects your vats accuracy, increasing or decreasing it as you get farther or closer to the enemy. That is all that number refers to, as to what it's measuring it is a %, 200 means twice as likely to hit compared to a baseline 100. What a 100 is I don't know, there are too many confounding variables and I don't have the skills or knowledge to figure out how to data mine the base values.
---
Dammin is the minimum range before your weapon starts to lose damage, and dammax is the range where your weapon drops to half damage, these are hard stats that are attached to the barrel of your weapon, and are invisible. There are 4 main versions of these stats that are copied and pasted across various barrel types, though a few weapons have unique stats.
---
shortest (10-20m) is found on sawn off and stub type barrels, it's simple, if you are in 10meters of an enemy you deal max damage, if you are beyond twenty you do half (less than half because of how armor works in practice)
---
short (15-25) found on most short barrels, and on some medium barrels for weapons with stub or sawn of barrel options
---
medium (20-35) found on most medium barrel weapons, and some long barrels for weapons with stub/sawn, and some heavy modifiable weapons.
---
long (25-50) most heavy weapons, long barrels, and sniper barrels have this damage profile, and is generally ideal.
---
In general weapons will be one of these 4 categories, though some fall outside or between them, one notable exception I know of is the dragon, which has something silly like 50-75. Overall you should always, always, ALWAYS take the long barrel option every single time without exception because short barrels are already doing minimum damage at the same range long barrels start to suffer any sort of damage fall off. Perks and stuff that boost range do boost fall off distances correctly (or they did, a lot of things are broken this patch though, so who knows), while silencers and stuff only effect the vats accuracy component.
---
The range number you are shown is useful because it is usually similar to the range falloff in terms of barrels relation to each other on the same weapon, so if you have a 100, 150, and 200 barrel the 200 one probably has the better hidden damage fall off stats
---
haven't you heard? this game has no content and they never release new content...  
---
/s
---
They were running around the place jumping off the porch closing doors sneaking around for a good 5 min  then it got quite and I heard the garage door 😂 went upstairs to that 😂
---
Very cool. I wish there were more rad storms
---
Love this event. If you can one shot the ghouls. You will get so much xp and likely run into 3 legendaries. if you wait and turn in the candy you can roll something big.
---
Edit: Oh, this is soloable too, in fact I recommend running solo, you get all the xp for the kills(3 ghouls each candy bucket and 1 legendary per round) and can loot the meat piles after for the candy. Just untrack all other quests so your radar will show you where to go.
---
Hmm interesting! Can’t say I would’ve picked that but it does have that clanging noise when you drink it
---
After playing fallout 4 for a bit after playing fallout 76 for a while, I forgot that you don’t have to pay caps to fast travel lol.
---
Ballistic Bock!
---
No, but now I'm gonna start
---
I don't know what the camp skin is, so I'm probably not using it...
---
I played my first 2 games today and I thought it was fun, I won my second game too.
---
Boost your int, ~2% exp increase per int point.
---
Charisma is supposed to increase the amount of exp you get when a team mate completes a quest, but im not 100% on the charisma thing.
---
Egg head is a other under rated mutation, especially with stranger in numbers. Irc +6 base(12%) and +8 with SIN(16%)
---
I don't think its a small staff issue. Fallouts, at least the ones made in house, have always been crazy buggy. 
---
I just took some time off, thanks to the boredom of the grind, and went and played far cry, witcher 3, outer worlds, etc. even other multiplayer and mmos and these other studios really but bethesda to shame. How they have created such a reputation while putting out incomplete and buggy games is mind boggling. 
---
A week of playing other games and I am not sure if I am coming back tbh. Its like we become so used to it we don't see it anymore until we experience something different.
---
I did this as well, plus putting a combo between them makes rifles and heavy guns an awesome swap between for lower enemies that arent "worth " the heavy guns ability.
---
I'm.... positive no one did.
---
Eep.
---
I thought I was super far ahead having done nearly all dailies/weeklies since it came out. Apparently need to grind the repeatable like clockwork.
---
I think I have a 50 cal or an lmg at a low level. I can get on and double check if you want it.
---
Well that's depressing
---
I feel personally attacked, lol.
---
stares at pipboy which says I am currently carrying:
---
* 100+ purified water
---
* 200+ stimpacks of varying types
---
* 200+ alcoholic drinks of varying types
---
* 50+ stew from MAMA DOLCE'S
---
* ~1500 grenades of varying types (around 1000 of which are base frags from when the grenade bundle glitch was still a thing)
---
* 2000 40mm grenades
---
* 60 mininukes
---
* 300+ missiles
---
* some other stuff that I'm probably forgetting
---
\*shrugs\*
---
The same reason you’re wasting 15 minutes waiting for him to leave, is the reason he si waiting for you to leave. Either one of you could go to a different server but you both refuse to lol. 
---
Also maybe that player claimed that workshop because he needs the resources. Not just the challenge.
---
Sadly, welcome to encryptid. I was at best 50\50 when starting that event. It is a good cap sink though
---
Bethesda support lately seems to either ignore or insta lock tickets..
---
Just throwing in my 2 caps:
---
- Bulked scrap are not prioritized for crafting/repair jobs, so if you've got some junk you're saving up for later or for display purposes, be sure to stick them in a case
---
- Bandolier 2 makes 5mm, .38, and .45 ammo weightless.
---
- Strange in Numbers affects Carnivore which as of Update 20 already doubles the positive effects of meat dishes. That means You get a total x2.25% for carry weight buffs. Smoked Mirelurk Fillets and Pepperoni Rolls will, give you a total of +75 carry weight while you're in a team, and +60 when you're not in a team.
---
Just noticed you are pc and im on Xbox, sorry.
---
If they don't acknowledge the issue now that people are completing it legitimately every week there will be more posts about it as more people finish. Hopefully it's something they consider tweaking for next season.
---
August 4th
---
Old Possum
---
Weirdly, you can't feed a family with score rewards.
---
Lol, I don't think I've ever paused in NW so that explains me not knowing that!
---
not true, you can still get one star variants from the S.M.A.R.T machine in watoga highschool.
---
same with 1 star rippers (lvl 40)
---
Did u launch before in the same silo? U have a personally cooldown of 3 hours to even if silo’s are clear to launch,I mean if u launched from alpha within 3 hours before in another server
---
Did you launch a nuke from the same silo 1hr and 40 min earlier on a different server?
---
I don’t even believe being on at rollover is the issue unfortunately. It’s different for everyone in that regard so it’s something else causing it, as people are still having issues and it seems totally random.
---
Beth must have at least some idea what causes it, as they claimed to have mostly fixed it, but with outliers still suffering.  
---
For my own anecdotal evidence, I never logged off last night during challenge refresh and it was perfectly fine. I’ve also never lost score the entire event, logging in every day and not following any real guidelines. 
---
 I can only assume it’s the same for others as the server I was on didn’t immediately die and a lot of people stayed on. 
---
I do feel sorry for people who get it, especially as the only consolation so far is extra daily challenges that are also open to people who never had an issue. Hardly seems fair.
---
we are on a private server and we both loosed it
---
The High Capacity Backpack is a Possum plan, not Tadpole.  I don't know if any price adjusting cards affect it, but it's 8 Possum credits for me.
---
Thank you for this post!  Very helpful!
---
I'm right there with you man.  Full time job and a family.  The only me time I have is a few hours at night.... That's if I feel like burning it on a game.
---
This person knows people eatin'
---
Oh, I had no idea. Not a fan of the Gauss charge (tho that damage is sick). Will be looking at the Radium rifle - tho IIRC it shoots .45 ACP.
---
Did you die more than once?
---
Nice one
---
Mate, totally agree with you, I was only thinking myself lately I want the good old days before wastelanders and the gold grind, and especially the legendary run, atm it's log on daily score a few weekly, gold and gone.
---
I have no time to spend with friends anymore, i want to move my CAMP, but that takes hours I don't have because of the grind. I really enjoyed just running around someones CAMP just talking for what can be hours, walking to where I would like to be, not..poof i'm over here...poof i'm over there . At least with the Atom challenges, you could come and go as you please. 
---
 It took me 18 months just to hit level 200. Now they are cranking up, I mean what's the point if we are all level 400 come the 2 year anniversary? any way running off topic, but definitely hear you.
---
If you one shot everything then they don't get any XP for the kills.
---
"Does it feel good or does it do good?"
---
Kudos for the good intentions though.
---
I found a guy with 8 of them in his camp at whitesprings. I promptly reported them.
---
Whoa! Thanks for all that. I’ll have to share with my wife and take a moment to digest it. Much appreciated!
---
Yeah I got the fusion one earlier today 😊 I'll message you thank you
---
I keep hearing conflicting information about whether int as a bonus for xp stacks after 25. Do you notice a difference at 25 versus after 25?
---
💥
---
Wow really? It isn’t out yet? Damn... that’s kind of embarrassing. What about legendary perks?
---
Responder vendors
---
No idea. Same problem on ps4.
---
I just hope they add an option in the menu in the next single player fallout for real time vats.
---
But then what would you grind for?
---
Get rid of any super mutant body parts in your misc tab
---
NW: start a match 0/1
---
NW: shoot 0/1
---
NW: die to bot aim O/1
---
It does shoot 45. I think i had a Gauss in my bag, but i dont remember if I gave it away already or not. Ill have to look and let you know so you can switch between.
---
I'd be so good at that
---
This is correct. Only available from the SMART machine.
---
Angry Turtle has a video about the legendary perks on youtube.
---
Wow, this needs to be a loading screen.
---
I died, I took my junk back without looking my inventory and then died again, took my junk back and my friend who died once said he didnt have his nuclear and mine disapeared too
---
Bethesda have geared them up as the most sympathetic, softest raiders imagineable. The worst crime they participate in is "taking stuff that isn't theirs". They have several dialogue line where they distance themselves from the blood eagles and the cult of the mothman.
---
It can't 1 shot the SBQ anyway. Prob not even a 3 star deathclaw or squatch. It can 1 shot most regular enemies but it takes so long to reload, whats the point?  Cool collector item though
---
Its just that my level may look like oh he played a bit but that could not be further from the truth. I dont play alot and dont know alot about the game either. I just got a friend to kill all the higher level creatures when I gave them some damage so I could level up is basically all im saying.
---
I get the build part since mine is weight reduction, but I just hate having to change my whole build when I didn’t ask to fight a goddamn legendary mirelurk queen cuz 90% of the time the quest is fodder, but, yea I’ll be smarter.
---
I just join pub teams for the XP I don’t really have interest in playing with randoms but that’s just me
---
Ballistic Bock and High Voltage Hefe are primo
---
I’ve earned my level. I don’t want level 48 super mutants and high level scorch attacking my camp in the forest.
---
Sorry if I somehow offended you though since that was not my intention.
---
Isn't it from the raider ammo thing?
---
Cosmos armour is a skin, it doesn't magically appear over the other power armour frames to overlap, it just replaces them cosmetically. You either get it in white or black with no alterations, why would you ask something like that?
---
I think you know what happened now. Or you were both simultaneously hit with a one of a kind bug. You’re lucky. Some people lose god-tier weapons. You lost 12 nuclear waste. Count your blessings :)
---
Excellent advice, thank you!
---
He didn't have anything built and I was sitting idle while working. I would've hopped servers after claiming it and then they would get the extra claim challenge AND event completion for retaking the workshop. But people are dense.
---
Good advice man thx
---
No, not at all! :)
---
I believe its damaged based for the Imposter and the Queen.
---
That or a Life-saving legendary armor piece. I always yeet myself off the edge at the end of the event. 50/50 shot at a revive and randoms are usually nice enough to revive the dumb idiot who decided to race the mothman to the ground.
---
just sell whiskey and moonshine the beer is all piss
---
Hefe all the way
---
The "!" are like public events that pop up on the screen when they start. Some are random and some can be initiated like scorchbeast and cryptid. If you have finished the quest line for the wastelanders raider/settler stuff then you can get treasury notes from the public events. Easier ones give 2 and harder can give up to 4.
---
Yeah this has been my experience too, which is why I hope Bethesda will one day give us options on level ranges to join.
---
Ah okay kinda sounded like it its hard sometimes for me to understand how you mean certain stuff with text messages lol guess thats part of being blonde haha :)
---
I have an IE reduced weight The Dragon and I use it to either kill or take a massive chunk of health on scorchbeasts and other big things. It’s not useless.
---
Not a problem! I'm literally terrible at the game so I'd never judge anyone for not knowing all there is to know, lol.
---
Man, a few ppl have been getting incredible shots lately. That's a great shot!
---
Keep experimenting!   Try to avoid getting hung up on doing one thing, one way.  Infinite possibilities in 76!  😊
---
I can confirm this is not always the case. Had the auto complete happen to me and can guarantee it did not add to the score total.
---
Institute
---
There a different between players and only real question here is that there are player who play more efficient then you.
---
This double exp weekend I went from lvl105 to lvl153 with a friend while my 3rd friend went from 96 to 99. 
---
Before the weekend I stacked up 100 full fusion core. I ran nonstop events and Public events me and my other friend held workshop for the defense events 
---
Well rested , 5% “feed the ppl” reward food buff , event group buff and Chr rank 3 exp bonus perk 
---
We were getting approximately  3 lvls per hour , line in the sand &amp; radiation rumble were about a lvl each time
---
No, text is the worst because theres no tone. I feel ya!
---
trenches are fine, I just can't stand the sundew groves when they start particle-effecting all over the place and you can't see shit
---
never, dupers all over the place, I hope a lot of weapons come this way too.
---
Less. AA is 50% that leaves you with 50% and the 25% is applied to what's left so it's effectively 12.5% giving you a total of 62.5% armor penitation
---
It's rather roomy inside, the walls being transparent glass are nice, and it works either as a standalone structure or part of a larger building. It's decent in my opinion.
---
Legacy perks come out in Patch 21 supposedly.
---
You can nuke a specific spot/look in the sundew groves when someone nukes, but the event isn’t live
---
I have an idea of what i want in my brain.  I then spend an hour building it. Then i realise it would look better a different way so i start again. 30 minutes into rebuilding i realise i could do something else instead. So i start again. And then an hour later i realise i didn't leave enough room for something or something is blocking something. So i restart. And two hours later i am done.
---
That is by far the most hideous set of PA I have ever laid eyes on. 
---
But hey, if others like it then who am I to stop it from being sold?
---
Damn really? This is the same content that was being advertised like 3 months ago..... and it still isn’t released
---
Finally someone with the guts to help
---
Yeah well I'm not saying to let this item be sellable but why cannot I keep it on my own account and pass it to another character? A full health junkies build or something? This is actually a good piece and it's a shame that I can't use it
---
Why does it have to be all or nothing? I haven’t missed any days but just wanted the sink, ammo converter (that I won’t use again until it’s fixed) and the raider tree cage. I got that last one today, my grind is done.
---
They created a style of game that we like and it's fun but they just have a bad engine or bad coders and are lazy with fixing things because they make money even when they don't fix shit. The community fixed it for them previously but here it's on them and it's so much more obvious.
---
I have like 15 for sale at my camp for 500 caps a pop. If you ever get it and SQQ head mount from scorched earth, don't learn them and they'll keep dropping.
---
I've found Pipe twice in two weeks, didn't know it was a random event. Went back to where I first found it to pay my respects but it was sadly gone :(   
---
Pleasant surprise when it popped up later elsewhere!
---
https://i.imgur.com/Lt4LjJj.png
---
This is just the first example of points missing for me, out of the 20k or so points I'm missing total, I stopped counting them since it's clear they're not doing anything about it. It's not adding anything, they're just gone.
---
There are two bugs. Dailies/weeklies completing and awarding points at 3/5 completed, this is what most people think is happening here but it's not and then there's the bug where it's completed when you log in and you don't get any points at all, this is what a lot of people are experiencing.
---
This is ants in his eyes johnson telling you to come one down. We are practically giving this stuff away. Right here we have ultracite calibrated shocks for 100 caps *points to mothman statue*. And if you want metal table plans, we have them for 25 caps *points to empty display case*.
---
All good my man.  Swimming is fun when you tread water to move/explore, not so much when the focus is survival.
---
Ohhhh, gotcha! I know there was one event I tried (emphasis on tried) where it fast-travelled me into a unique smaller building. Is that also part of it? I mostly do smaller events, like the Mothman one at the lighthouse and the one at the Vault-Tec greenhouse, but I’ve only seen the one teleport you inside a location.
---
Honestly I’m going to make it this season I’m about to hit 65 but I completely agree. They need to change the challenge system so that if you only play on weekends (or what you consider your weekend) that you can still make it. Maybe more weekly challenges and they stay after that week, so if you get on in the last week you can do 10 weeks worth of weeklys. I don’t expect you to be able to make 100 doing that but some decent progress would be nice.
---
YASSSSS, finally some pets that cant die!
---
20k, is that weeklies as well? Do you know when your daily reset is?
---
Im going to place mine as an exit from my camp. But that just leads to under the map and if they arent careful will fall through.....muahhahaha
---
It speaks volumes that you hate how people play a game so you intentionally try to ruin their play time by being a dick.
---
You are so entitled Jesus
---
Radrats, unless I’m carrying a tesla.
---
Honestly though, I'll probably pick up the fatman skin since my character's build is for explosive weapons(not the legendary kind). I know they all suck but I want to believe dammit.
---
The challenge reset is the same for everyone. 10 am eastern time.
---
I am level 94 and just killed the same queen too. Took about 1k 50 cal to do it tough :'(
---
&gt;Now I could be wrong
---
you are
---
I don't get why people are so stupid they put stuff like that for so cheap. It's not like we can see the prices before going to the vendor.
---
If you kept up with the news you would understand that they were ready to release legendary perks but the community wasn’t happy with what they were offering so they delayed it to make some changes. 
---
TBH I’m fine with that, upside to the PTS.
---
Check around the outskirts of Morgantown. There is also a house near the Nuka Cola plant by the river, but that is only one house.
---
This is it.
---
Thread over.
---
100% know it’s not always the case I auto completed two weeklys in the first week and I was still level 1.
---
ok thanks
---
Yeah I haven’t been keeping up with it. I quit after the mole minor event and fasnacht fuck ups. Just decided to randomly get on to see if it’s worth playing now and I’m pretty disappointed. But they don’t make the game for me, I’m sure there are a lot of players who are still enjoying it
---
I strongly suggest researching the intricacies of anti armor in this subreddit. There are users here who have done the math to reveal the nature of AA. Additionally, I would suggest Angry Turtle’s video on AA on YouTube.
---
Yeah it also does not help when you often read texts as if you said something wrong either which in turn makes you nervous and feel sorry/rude so you say "lol" alot and apologise I am very introverted and non confrontational so texts are my nightmare haha. oh well what can we do about it haha. I will say this though if there is one think I know about the game is some of the monsters just make you run and scream in the other direction LOL
---
Lol we’ll just leave the team when we see what you’re sharing, not achieving much there buddy 🤣
---
no, you should be 46 before today, without taking into account double score and xp grinding
---
Don’t care it funny but there no different between a lvl50 or lvl1000 when it come it , 
---
the lvl1000 has the same limits when it come to equipping perks 
---
The lvl1000 gear is also lvl45 &amp; lvl50 
---
Sure the lvl1000 has more build options and probably better gear but that just about it
---
Still agree with your last statement though.
---
Well I mean... I can’t blame you two
---
I have posted several times about a process when first logging in to follow that seems to keep it from happening. I have yet to hear back that it doesnt work. 
---
Log in, go straight to adventure (no NW, no atom shop, no legendary run), after loading wait 5 minutes before opening the map for any reason, then look at challenges. I havent lost another daily or weekly since doing this and those i talk to say the same. 
---
My guess is it has something to do with "looking" at them as they are still appearing the first time for the user. If it doesnt work or you have tried this and it doesnt work, let me know.
---
I’ll just wait for it to go on sale in a month or two and use less atoms.
---
And more experience
---
Its not removed its a player made mod.
---
Loosing?
---
I get what you're saying.
---
But in relation to the lever action vs the hunting rifle- the range stats are accurate per their actual damage dropoff. The hunting rifle DOES have just slightly longer range than the lever action, both at the start of the dropoff as well as the maximum range before 0 damage.
---
The hunting rifle sure as hell doesn't have double the range of the lever action, which is what started this whole discussion.
---
My picture shows the difference in distance between the two for the START of damage dropoff- very short. Maybe even 9 in the mythical game units.
---
Check out Angryturtle's video on this- relevant section is around 11:20
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVQk8KetQHw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVQk8KetQHw)
---
You can see that his hunting rifle, with a hair longer range, is doing damage just a tiny bit further out than his lever action- but put a suppressor on the hunting rifle, which drops its range stat below the lever action, and now the hunting rifle also can't hit the target.
---
The range stat for rifles seems to in fact be entirely accurate for their damage dropoff.
---
Naturally, not all weapons behave the same- things like the tesla rifle behave very differently (as best as I understand, it basically does maximum damage out to a certain range and then simply stops; there's no dropoff but the range is much shorter than other weapons). Shotguns have MUCH higher damage dropoff- rifles go from full to half damage; shotguns go from full to like 10% damage.
---
Wrong. It was made by bethesda, but removed from the game. Then a modder brought it back to life so we could use it.
---
That is my favorite daily. I do however get ticked when I go hunt down the ex-raider and someone else or something already took him out. I wanted to shoot that F'er in the back
---
thank you
---
:(
---
k thanks
---
disapeared
---
Hello, Im a BETA user here to tell you, dont regret not buying it at launch. It was a buggy pile of hot garbage. Don't get me wrong, I love the game rn with all its imperfections. But at launch it was unplayable.
---
Nukashine is the only alcohol worth drinking
---
Well yeah, everyone knows you are what you eat!
---
I knew that for Queen but thought Imposter might be different. I just feel like I’ve hit him only once or twice so many fights and have still gotten loot. I’ve never missed loot on him even when we were doing it at level 50 etc. We hit 150 just now after dxp weekend.
---
What the difference between a lvl200 or lvl500? 
---
Experience isn’t much of a factor once a player reach lvl50-80 they will experience everything the game has to offer
---
I can't speak for everyone, but for me and many others (I think) it's about being a completionist. Unlocking everything, including the skins at the end, is important to special events like this.
---
Pipe is best random event....
---
I still have that note on my character, was a trip when I found it, I was giggling my ass off and my friend was so clueless.
---
eminem's mom must be working customer service over at beth
---
Exactly!   I pretty much miss every special event weekend because I'm too fucking busy with actual life.
---
Dying during SBQ once and respawning inside of the nuke zone with no Rad protection therefore dying and losing my junk then constantly respawning in the nuke zone making me not be able to do anything unless I leave the server.
---
Here, an actual source:
---
The relevant section is around 11:15- he switches between a hunting rifle (216 range), a level action (207 range), and a silenced hunting rifle (186 range).
---
The hunting rifle is able to hit the target and do damage. The lever action isn't. The silenced hunting rifle also isn't. The range stat is in fact accurate for rifles in terms of the start of damage dropoff AND the maximum range they can do damage at.
---
I’m hoping once loadouts launch that they will have completely individual SPECIAL that way I won’t need to have multiple characters. Not sure how it’s going to work yet but it might be worth saving that armor?
---
That new Legendary Perk for Lockpicking/Hacking looks good though. will help with having to constantly switch perks around to activate those.
---
But sometimes I cant resist that desk fan or these typewriters.
---
FYI...I still haven't gotten it to work but that's fina as I hear the open mechanism is glitched anyway
---
I don't know who downvoted you, but myself and two people I play with regularly all did the quest within the last month and didn't have any issues. PS4.
---
Why are you trying to take my workshop?
---
I know it used to work on ultracite and raider PA. Freed the torso up for a different mod
---
Yeah I understand I have been saving the armour I almost have a full set of Vanguard even though I don't want it. Actually pretty nice stats. But at least if they released an ultra-light mod for Secret Service armour it would make it weigh a lot less making it take up a lot less space in my stash at least if they can do that that would be a lot better. We need an ultra-light for SS armour this way it would only weigh a pound or so..
---
Yes, someone gave it a half ass read and thaught it was a SCORE autocomplete. Write another ticket and specify it has nothing to do with SCORE. It shouldnt have to be this way but if you want your atoms this is what I recomend.
---
I've had my junk rat perk since I was like level 5 and now that I'm going heavy weapons and I have fallout 1st i was wondering if I should get rid of it. Its nice to know it's fairly useless.
---
Wow that sounds pretty good, I might have to contact support if I find another decent Furious weapon and the damage doesn’t increase like my current furious
---
I just hit level 200 myself right before this past weekend through natural play from day one (then got 16 levels from the weekend lol). I can’t believe it’s been almost 2 years wow. I do miss the atom challenges, I felt less of a need to do every one of them.
---
IMO the PA talking isn't that bad, when it was first released last year it was pretty insane how constant it was but now its spaced out enough to make it special when liberty prime talks. I would personally wait for the double bundle to come back but if you like the matte black colorway then go for it imo
---
From my experience, what I've learned is that if you're going to mainly focus on carry weight, using a .50cal tends deal a decent amount of damage. I've been using shotguns for close quarters.
---
If you're having trouble with ammo, I'd suggest farming lead ore(using excavators) from lucky hole mine, steel from the mole miners in blackwater mine(scrapper will give an average of about 16 steel/weapon), acid from cave crickets in tanagra town(top of the tree), and then cloth from wherever you choose. I keep the ore in my stash since you can't reduce the weight and it(the ore+acid) weighs the same as bulked lead while stored. Since steel is so easy to farm, I try to keep under 100 steel scraps.
---
Don’t start trading till you’ve launched at least 1 nuke, and killed 1 queen accordingly. 
---
Basically beat vanilla/wastelanders, then try it out ☺️ welcome to Appalachia friend 🍻
---
If you follow the road from the dam towards Morgantown there is a nice little section that has a couple of houses right on the corner before the 4 lane road. 
---
The street is all torn up at the corner but there are some decent spots to build in the yards of the houses. I have my tiny 2x3 house a 2x2 cafe and a nice little open air bus stop looking structure for my shops. It also has some telephone poles running up the road to attach your wires to.
---
Good idea. Might try that of it were implemented
---
Absofriggenlutely
---
I do that on the atomic shop music.
---
I'm assuming you haven't seen strangler armor with a different skin on?
---
I think radiation rumble and maybe uranium fever teleport you inside. I'm not sure either of those are small buildings, but I don't know that I've done all of them.
---
Pretty much after this I'm done repeating the same shitty time every day. I just want to try to finish this one and I'll probably be taking a break. Maybe when they add more places to explore or more things to kill, I'll be back.
---
Honestly, this grind was enough
---
I feel this so deeply it's not even funny
---
What would you fix reducing the player count?
---
Are you just trolling?
---
What platform?
---
Sold my stuff waaaaay too cheap, cause I wanted someone else to feel that "omg!" feeling I had, when I was pretty sure dude was drunk (or at least I hope so 😂)
---
Captain cosmos armour is literally just a skin replacement for whatever you are wearing. I'm assuming you've literally not levelled your score up at all to have unlocked it like me?
---
Join me underground, its nice and no way to get attacked by any enemy there.

Yep role playing as mysterious stranger is actually epic fun

I read post after post of Daguerre's incessant singular dialogue once her quest is completed and after completing it all I can say is, you have no idea how much of a blessing it is that you can't finish this quest.  I love Daguerre as a character, but fuck, seriously Daguerre see a shrink.
---
That said, the experience is nice, the story is solid and well done, and the vendor is uniquely cool.  I feel for ya, but once this bug gets fixed you'll get a headache from Daguerre.
---
Best title ever, if I had Reddit coin things, you'd be getting one.
---
Do you have a link to these ugly rewards?
---
Ikr I love it
---
How would I be trolling? Lol i redownloaded the game and am asking if content that was promised almost 1st quarter is in the game. It is not= I am disappointed. I said maybe some people still enjoy it but I don’t.
---
Awwww dude what a rad shot
---
Fallout 1st?
---
Sounds fishy
---
+10 RADS
---
I can’t remember the name of the event but it was trying to protect and feed lab animals. I was way too low-level when I tried to do it, the place was packed with Sentry Bots, Assaultrons, and all kinds of creatures.
---
Stuff vanishing from your inventory is not unheard of, its a rare bug that mostly targets power armor it happens every now and then , but to lose everything? Yeah either your friends been hacked or the bug triggered in the most unfortunate way
---
Couple days ago, was getting mad with 200+ just gunning down enemies and one shooting. 
---
Fast forward to today. I got a bloddied gat laser the other day, and learned about the power plants efficient way of farming fusion cores. (Really 3 every half hour basically? And if you have all 3, I have 40 cores lol)  anyways, now I'm running and gunning every scorch beast and high lvl enemy easily. SB's land on the ground and there dead in 30 seconds tops, if that. Idc how many fusion corws I burn up I have FO1st and I can farm cores till my ass is numb. Lvl 87 and I'm just plowing through lvls with all the groups and siht 
---
I love this and I'm exactly this man now, and I'd. But I allow everyone to get there tags in. But also make sure I tag them first cause gauss shotgunners are rampant and destroy
---
Xbox!
---
What are exactly are you trying to do and why?
---
Capitalism is rather old, but people are pining for things the way they used to be...15 years ago.  It's not the system that's the problem here (though it's a problem in a lot of other places).  
---
You used to be able to make a 'AAA' game (or what passed for one a couple decades back) on a pretty small team.  And you still can make some pretty decent stuff like that, but modern AAA games are TONS deeper and have more complicated 3D assets and such, there's no way to make the next WOW killer with a team of 3 people.
---
Hot server!
---
Bro it's an exploit.
---
Beautifully said.
---
Thanks Villawolf i feel less regret, it must feel good tho being there from the start rebuilding america and all that!
---
Took 1 match in Morgantown.
---
Yes and I would seriously sell all my shit to keep rolling if there wasn’t a stupid daily scrip limit lol
---
Those things were originally slated for patch 20. They were delayed based on player feedback. We haven’t had any patches since patch 20. They haven’t been delayed that long... and again... it’s based on the public test server feedback. Patch 20 was only a few weeks ago. 
---
Ugh why am I feeding the troll
---
Okay that's not what i asked do u have strangler armor if no just say no, but if you apply a skin to strangler armor the vines show through the skin, what I'm asking is does the vines show through on the skin and no I havent I'm at 63 atm tho and just wanted a simple question awnsered not jump through hoops for a awnser
---
Well tbh after launch I only played for a few hours becaise I couldnt bare all the bugs and crashing. I only picked it back up after Wastelanders and became a hardcore fan.
---
Depends on server, still havent had too big of an issue with single tapping. Then again today a level 13 followed me while ghouls and scorched raged on me and he got a chance to tag them, then I would kill them. Took him all over the ash and got to smack down a wendigo as well. 
---
Just dont forget what you want to be, and others will follow.
---
Nuclear apocalypse... I would take FULL advantage of every opportunity to stay alive in such a situation. And the Raiders have found strength in numbers. Feels good to be a "bad guy"
---
Ok. Shame there isnt cross platform.
---
I just tested it out.  I currently have 145 .45 ammo in my machine ready to be picked up, and zero ammo of any kind in my stash.
---
I’ve only got roughly 723ish hours and I’m only 226 ☺️
---
No but Im no way that observant about differences. All i know is Im progressing through the repeatable way more times than I used to and thats about as "sciencey" as I get. Someone more clued in about that might be able to provide better data for you. Sorry.
---
I think there's a niche for power armor that has sub-par DR/ER but rad resistance that beats the hazmat suit and a bonus similar to the Excavator armor but for plants. Would be choice for nuke zones and fit the mad scientist/nuclear apocalypse researcher fantasy.
---
That displays the server status. If you launch a nuke, you can’t go back to the same silo for 3 hours. You can launch all three on the server, but once you do the character timer won’t let you launch any more until it expires.
---
how economical is farming flux? Can you only get it from launching nukes? Sorry, Im getting to end game but havent done main quest or went on a nuke run yet...
---
I literally can’t hit something without it dying, lmao.
---
The fuck do I care? It’ll get fixed or it won’t sooner or later. Makes no difference to me
---
:-(
---
It might be a programming thing but why doesn’t CAMP budget increase when you level up? Maybe have it so every twenty levels your camp budget grows by 20% of its current size?
---
the fact that it takes 5 mins to find a match and a 2 min or more lobby is the irritating part imo. I don't mind NW, sometimes I enjoy it even, but expecting me to spend 3+ matches and 15+ mins just waiting on the thing to start is insane imo.  
---
I like that they added the new dailies and am not complaining about the availability of SCORE but I think they are trying to get more people to try the mode and as it is there's still a lot of improvement to be done.
---
I’m not upper class, just a really bad impulse buyer and a idiot
---
Where'd you get it?
---
If they aren’t gonna fix the overwhelming presence of hackers, they shouldn’t subject us to NW Challenges.
---
It's an effective weapon. I don't use it as a main, but it's definitely not weak. Easy ammo too.
---
yessss
---
Depends, if you already have a build that you enjoy go for it. You can always trade for something more useful to you, especially since that is good bartering piece to have.
---
The pricing is based on how much it took to make.
---
So this skin and the 2 you talked about took approximately the same to make.
---
I would have to say that it is pretty good. Bloody builds are pretty popular so it would be a feasible build though you may die a lot of you're not careful.
---
I thought that was a different Motherlode? In my game, the one I repaired was Motherlode-003, and had storage containers, while the one from the quest has no containers and is simply Motherlode (I think).
---
Ouch!   Haha  ;)
---
The keycard took 15 minutes, I didn't explain very well. The rest... also embarrassing. Sigh
---
I mean it is the coolest version tho.
---
You generally find weapons that can kill enemies quickly. 
---
Why throw a grenade and wait 3 seconds, hoping the enemy will stand still, only to almost kill it when you can usually kill it quicker with 4 bullets from whatever 3 star legendary weapon you've acquired.
---
Grenades are fine if you want to use them, but with no such thing as legendary grenades they will eventually be so outclassed by your legendary weapons that it's a waste of time to use them.
---
I believe it’s implied they managed to intercept one of the Motherlodes and were trying to drill through to the Enclave bunker?
---
I know. He was close to the vault so I think he was preying on the lower levels and not anticipating a veritable rad sponge coming through to game his system.
---
Hi! Would you like to develop an app? Its an app you would want to develop.
---
No real world money spent. Like a true man.
---
They could make your CAMP structures stronger as well
---
 I'm waiting on the clip from him don't really know the guy, he was just in the same party. If it looks legit I'm going to hook him up with some replacement stuff and ill post a link here if possible. Guys still kind of freaking out right now...
---
Same, I'm 60...lol
---
&gt;They’d probably have to drop the Institute part of its identity (due to lore reasons, but this is Bethesda so wtf is lore)
---
Considering this is entirely just concept art that never even made the transition to being shown or mentioned anywhere in-game, does it *really* count as a retcon? (This armor pictured is just a mod re-creation. It doesn't actually exist in the files)
---
Yeah, raw flux comes from nuke zones. To make stable flux requires 10 raw flux, 1 high radiation fluid, 1 hardened mass and 1 glowing mass. All to make 1 stable flux.
---
Don't remember, I either traded it with my mate after it was made a legacy or I picked it up and stashed it all this time \*before\* legacy. Not sure, it was just kinda chillin there.
---
All his flux are belong to me. I used it to craft a bunch of jetpacks for myself, my teammates, and random players I stalk down. I will find you and I will gift you with something useful at no cost. I'm a menace, I know.
---
Oh that sucks dude :( I am still yet to complete that event, just can never seem to get a coordinated team lol
---
No. This is from the Institute. That crappy part of Fallout 4’s storyline has no place in 76 and Bethesda knows it.
---
yeah well going of how the game sounded and paying full price would've been painful amigo so no wonder you left for a bit.
---
I noticed that too! So the Motherlode you repaired is still out there, and it still remembers you. Motherlode 01 is sacrificed to break into the Vault, but there’s at least two more.
---
Well either way it's a god roll
---
I usually just build a floor piece, than work my out until it "feel" right.
---
Hahaha!!!! Literally LOL over here. 
---
Thanks, I needed that.  :)
---
You don't see any benefits from doing the challenges if you only play NW though. Maybe the atoms?
---
It was never released in fo4, so, it's just a concept art at this point. Can be reused with a new purpose.
---
Made actual friends in game. Woke up and regretted my mistake. Lone wanderer always.
---
Thanks to all who encouraged me. I appreciate it.
---
My damage resist is from T-65 being great plus Nerd Rage 3 and Emergency Protocols torso mod.
---
I think you’re right about that, it’d mostly just be a process of reskinning it (removing any Institute logos and slapping some new paint on it) which I’m completely on-board for.
---
I message them in the first week they replied nearly straight away saying they were looking into it but to message them under “quest” issues. So I submitted another bug report, no reply. so 3 days later I message the first bug department again no reply... that was the first week. GL is all I’ve got to say.
---
Yeah but still
---
Does it look like you're on fire?
---
So this is my Reddit post to you I hope you read it, hey Bethesda I’m traveling for 90 caps instead of using the freeway. 
---
Oh shit i forgot How is Bethesda supposed to read this out? 
---
*game crashing noises*
---
Leaving my pet level 3 feral dog Poochy unattended.  RIP
---
When I was mass-laid off I couldn't tell you how many times I logged on the next day and couldn't remember that I sold or scrapped stuff or bought things. 
---
One day I spent like two hours grinding legendaries trying to get an upgrade for my gatling gun before realizing I apparently did get one the night before.
---
Whoops.
---
I think you get that when some kind of health buff ends. I go through a crapload of stims when im taking pylons in Encrytid. Yesterday shortly after it ended my character starts spasming randomly like that every few seconds at roughly the same pace the stims Id been pumping would have worn off
---
I've been consistently behind by 8 or 9 spaces for a while now, despite playing daily for the last couple of weeks. I don't have enough time to play enough to get the extra points from leveling up several times a day.
---
No, not still.
---
lol! because im playing 76 i forgot about saving the game and i was wandering for a good while then got fucking slayed by a few deathclaws, had to go back to my last autosave man i think i just quit and logged in to 76 lol
---
Sweeet! Thanks for the key link.
---
Yeah. Same issue on PS4. Its intermittent between public and private with a team. It’s annoying at best, and just makes us not want to take workshops.
---
Not the guy you were asking but this is what I’ve gathered:
---
Weapons, armor, ammo, plans, junk and meds. That’s what people gravitate to. 
---
For weapons and armor, I generally sell scrip. 15c/each. For example, 3* weapons = 40 scrip = 40*15 = 600 caps. 
---
Develop an understanding for which plans are common, uncommon, etc. I generally sell plans for less than 50 caps. For example, Wooden Barn door - 10 caps. Brick building set - 50 caps. Ultra-light armor plan - 25 caps. Flaming Sheepsquatch Mod - 150 caps. 
---
Sell most ammo for 1c. People don’t bother buying ammo for more than 1c unless it’s like a plasma core or fusion core. Popular ammo types are 5.56, .45, 5mm, Fusion Cells, maybe .308. I generally sell whatever I’m not using for 1c each.
---
Medicine prices vary. You can get away with selling some drugs for 20c. Stimpaks - 12 to 15c, Super Stimpaks - 25 to 35c. I generally sell my drugs at 15c. Unrelated but canned dog food is a good commodity to sell at 10c.
---
You can gain a lot in junk. Steel - 1c each, Lead - 3c each, Acid - 5 to 10c each, adhesive - 3c each, screws - 3 to 6c each, etc.
---
Keep your stocks full for the foot traffic, keep your prices simple for the revenue.
---
no way, as if people are actually still playing this game
---
and pay monthly for the privilege, I will never understand
---
Thanks for that tip, my dumbass is always there
---
I have a luxury scrapbox.
---
I really wish the hoppy hunter ipa had better stats. Hop bombs are the best.
---
But Ballistic Bock would get my vote
---
Yeah, you're right. Broke my own rule: "Never post while I'm having a tantrum".  Hehe.
---
I guess I'll do a little digging. Thanks for the encouragement.
---
Thanks, but on PC. Never done multiplayer games. I should go buy a headset and figure it out.
---
Same. There's something about a beer made with gunpowder that makes me happy.
---
There are multiple Motherlode units. The one you save in the game is Motherlode-03, and the one used in the Vault raid is Motherlode-01. So yay; the one you saved is still out there and it remembers you!
---
Do you ever Fast Travel?
---
Literally im always bitching at people to get off the fence, tents, etc. I want the SBQ to take a minute, not 10.
---
Idk man it looks like you care a lot.
---
defo man i played NewVegas to have a shot of the Anti-material rifle and the vats just stop time its crazy i dont know why i forgot  maybe its because FO4 i thought in all the games they still moved
---
No they're okay of course. You HAVE to collect more screws. What if you run out of screws and you would have had enough if you had've just grabbed that fan? 
---
It's okay, just drop whatever food you have, you don't need it. *The screws will sustain you*.
---
Yeah no idea, oddly enough i think i saw this happen more as a melee character. I figured it was just the server catching up from the times i got hit several minutes ago.
---
Idk but the couple quests I had glitched usually mean I need to reaquire an item (keycards for Garrahan for example). 
---
I’d say try and find the flight recorder again? See if it’s available to pick up
---
Your idea of what the game *could* be doesn't align with what this game actually is.
---
You're expecting all these crazy, large scale armies invading areas of the map, territory changing hands, new areas being added and...none of that happens.
---
And no, I don't want future Fallout games to follow this mold.  Despite how the map looks the first time you open it, as you level up it becomes apparent that there's less meat on this game than previous entries.  Less quests, NPCs, towns, "dungeons".  Just less everything...except grinding.  Which they use as a paper-thin substitute for actual content.
---
I don't think 76 is terrible by any means, that's why I still break it out every now and then.   
---
 But as the template for future games?  ***Fuck*** no.
---
I sincerely doubt taking the existing skin and making it grey rook the same amount of time as making it from scratch?
---
yOu hAvE tO pOsT iN tHe mArKeT sUb
---
Nah its institute power armor so it doesn't exist in 76 times.
---
I think one of the first perks I leveled up was lone wanderer. Figured I’d solo 99% of this. Nope, turns out people mostly don’t suck on this game. How novel!
---
Congratulations!
---
I just hit rank 50 and feel extremely accomplished, shit! I’ve been playing every day too. I think maxing our INT is a must but I don’t want to screw up my build. Edit: Maybe you can write a guide to help other players. Tips and tricks for the exp grind? Where to go, what mobs to hit. What boosts to have going?
---
it would be awesome if i could shoot my bow at 95% vats and actually hit something. yet i somehow still forage around missing 5/6 shots on a mob XD
---
Charging barrels does something like double your damage while reducing your fire rate by 80%. The trade-off is horrible, sadly.
---
Can you read all the other comments before commenting?
---
Jesus... any idea what could be causing it?
---
I’ve avoid being on at roll over and don’t play NW until all other challenges are complete and I’ve had no issues since the first week.
---

---
This is why I play this game. For these moments. Usually no one captures them. This is tight af.
---
Too many variables to account for.  Most people don’t even include if they are on PC or console for this bug to occur.  Had it happen for one daily challenge on PC, and it did net me the score.   I think if people recorded it happening on their platform, and visually proving what is going on, it would have helped/help narrow down the issue 🤷‍♂️
---
Nah I just logged in like usual and they were all completed this is 10 pm est so not even close to the roll over
---
That's nothing, when this game first released I used to play it to make myself sleepy
---
No the institute didn't exist
---
I was looking around at vendors the other day and came across one camp that had about 6 radtoads inside. No doors open and all turrests outside and still online. They had just spawned inside and were wrecking the house from the inside out
---
Just kidding but thanks! I play some solo but mostly with my son so it's all good. :D
---
I’ve seen strangler heart poke through the red rocket power armor skin, so I know exactly what you mean. I never could get that to work with my strangler heart chassis. I was wonder if it’s because I crafted it pre-Wastelanders. Anyway, tried applying dark matter cosmos to my strangler and it looks like normal cosmos.
---
Einhorn, is Finkle.
---
Seriously.  If they aren't going to let us cripple her wings to bring her down, then there needs to be a hard limit on how long she flies around before she looks for a landing spot.
---
I serve me but mothman is cool
---
Lmao I’m not a troll but I don’t care either way. Regardless of player feedback or what. Doesn’t change my disappointment. You’re a kind of toxic and need to go outside.
---
I’m really interesting to find out the causes so that as a community we can avoid them.
---
Every time I load in I check the atom shop, than I load into adventure (non private) I don’t see how loading the atom shop would help. Though I wouldn’t start loading adventure until after the atom shop and the pass has loaded.
---
How quickly do you click on adventure?
---
Yes but only to our brothers on ps4 as I don’t think I wpuld enjoy getting killed by flying players who shot through walls.
---
Bivs daily quest
---
The Free States have a lure that draws them in and grounds them! We could use that! 
---
But obviously a bunch of Vault Dwellers can make it so much better then those traitors did.
---
 You get them from Biv's dailies in Big Al's Tattoo shop I believe.
---
Fuck crossplay. Then us console players would have to deal with the hackers. Leave that shit to the "master race"
---
Thanks. I'll look this up.
---
Warframe has a catchup mechanic where if you say start on week 3 and complete that weeks dailies the previous weeks will then appear.
---
What you mean?
---
Well, idiots like them aren't known for their common sense
---
Or smarts
---
Or IQ
---
Or even dick size
---
I waited like 2 minutes and did not load the atom shop
---
Thanks for the information.
---
Well i've submitted a ticket with multiple of instances of this issue to bethesda support, and only got an automated response of (install the bethesda launcher and repair the game) for the ones that would like to know this is the list i've sent. Just be aware that this is on my 1st part of the mission which is to save ra-ra the "Fun and Games" but there's also multiple players having the same issue with this quest on other platforms as well. I'm currently on steam. found at least 5 occurrences from the forums from ps4 and xbox.
---
"1st right at the start of the quest, when i save her from the "Robos" there's a card reader that i can't access to proceed in the quest so i talk to her again to prompt the next part of the quest, she goes inside a vent and into the room to open it up for me, after the robot wave she didn't open the door, tried everything going in and out of the map, threw grenades at her nothing. What "fixed" it was restarting the session, had to go through all that again which makes me waste more bullets and consumables. Afterwards there's some rail pathways, gutsys and robotrons to deal with, easy but then she needs to eat something which i give some ( more wasted consumables mind you) she thanks me and goes into a vent again to open the door from the inside..again. The door opens "gonna keep chasing that animal to find bunnabun cya" and she darts towards another vent, and the quest advances. Now the assaultron that's supposed to spawn inside that new area is completely fucked, either it spawns invisible but can hit me without any feedback ( like staggering or any kind of sound), that gets fixed quite easily i just have to run back at the main entrance a couple of times. Or it gets stuck inside the vat it normally spawn because it freezes there, i can't hit it and i cant access the console on the top area because of that.  I have to do exactly the same, restart the session, do that all over again give her food, waste more consumables, waste more ammo, etc.. with luck on my last run everything went well up until the room with the power armor. Which if you've fed her she decides to help you and goes into the vent to open the door from the inside. The problem is this is a guaranteed quest fail, she bounces off the vent, darts towards the table and gets stuck on something whilst activating the console, so she doesn't move from there. Tried this shit 8 times now. Wasted about 20 stims, 4 med-x and a bunch of glowing meat steaks. Not to mention .50 cal, and 2mm ec and some grenades. So help? I'm not going to waste anymore ammo or consumables if this shit continues, and this is part of the main quest. So what am i supposed to do? She gets stuck on a console that was a known bug on F04 so why is this still here." 
---
I've also included multiple ss from the bugs appeared, and now i've asked them if this is something that needs repair from our end with the launcher, how does a fresh install help with this issue if its the npc that constantly breaks? I've installed this game this week! Its as simple as polish the npc off these bugs, its simple path find buggyness, or failure in state loads to the next area/prompt its the npc that bugs out not the player. I would understand a fresh install if an error message appeared or if my textures were messed up or if there's was actually something missing from the quest like sounds. But this is just the npc bugging out on the path.
---
No, I don't just blindly bust on the scene. I'm conscientious. It's the whole point of lending a hand. Otherwise why bother.
---
Thanks this is what I was wondering, pry just gonna switch to t60 anyways unless they buff the strangler
---
So just my suggestion as a pro Bush Wookie.  Morgantown, skim just north of the airport from the west side to the east side, then down to the river and skirting around Morgantown itself.  I usually find a few creatures during that time that I can take out. Lotta bushes to stop and duck into. If you can get the Ghillie Suit, you're practically invisible.
---
Good stuff then!
---
Thanks fir the info. I’ll skip the charging barrels.
---
Hey. He’s referring to a bug where strangler heart pops through whatever skin you apply to it. It looks gnarly. I’ve seen it a few times. So, relax a bit aye?
---
Of course! I do it to help, not grief.
---
Then I wonder where all the corpses decorating their camp come from?
---
My BE Dragon will 1 shot sheepsquatches, scorchbeasts, behemoths, mirelurk queens, even alpha creatures in PP.
---
But, the problem I get is the vats hit bug. I will 'miss' a 95% hit, but the explosive part of the damage is still applied. Still good damage, but won't 1 shot anything.
---
So it's a beast, when it works.
---
I am going to start taking more pictures of the randomness I find, will post the good ones!
---
I skipped a few NW challenges early on until I sucked it up, got a few more of the repeatable XP boosts I think.  Now I'm doing all NW challenges except the kill a player one because I just suck too much at PVP.
---
Just two weeks. Not a long wait now.
---
Pipe spawned next to my camp.  I think its those damn undertakers!
---
Yeah I guess
---
There are! The one you repair is Motherlode-003, the one used for the Vault is Motherlode-001.
---
I’ve had this happen too. It’s almost like I’ve been stung by something.  I see the red marks on screen like I’ve been hit.  I spin around spamming vats to look for anything or anyone and nothing.
---
While they're at it, please add the recipe for buffout. I don't understand how that's not already a thing.
---
Does yours sometimes deal less damage than it should in vats? I have a BE and it sometimes doesn't work properly.
---
Strangler still has better rad resist. Nice even stats on it. But yeah the rad resist isn’t too important. T-65 is very nice.
---
I go near there for ballistic fiber
---
Level 3 of power user makes fusion weight manageable I rock about 40 fusion cores and have a max of 395 and stay consistently at 300 weight
---
The market subs mods are a bunch of bitches
---
For future reference if you need to find where a plan is at as I see other vault dwellers already told you where to go. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ffhdsy/plan_and_mod_database_v1_this_is_the_product_of_3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

Place down the foundation pieces until I got a rough outline of what I'm going for and if I don't have enough room like the camp radius then I restart an move the camp in the direction I need and redo the process. Next step is I place placeholder walls and see how I high I can build an what limits I have to deal with. Sometimes the roof an wall can get cut off cause it's outside the buildable area. Restart and move the camp again. Once all that's done I'm ready to start adding in the wallpaper. After that I add in the power conduits. Then furniture, decorations and crafting benches.
---
Were you completely exited from the game?  If you exit to the main menu, and then go to your respective dashboard/desktop, the game is still running in the background. You have to manually shut down the program.
---
Happens all the time seemingly random. Even in FO4. I just call it stubbing my toe.
---
@ least PlayStation - they seem to have healthier attendance in NW.
---
Yeah to often I tag something and the next guy one shots it. Luckily I normally play with my family in a public group so they normally still get the legendary.
---
I ran into the exact same issues! Same script problems, i was baffled by Jen because I explicitly convinced her to spare and forgive her mother, and got Digger spared too.
---
Just starting the grind for the t65 did the strangler got disappointed, made a new character got him to 200 and have since been bouncing between the 2 and I just finished buy the raiders gold junk, which most is truly junk to say the least
---
Sounds like it works out anyway. +1
---
I rarely play in public teams but I did yesterday and during a nuke zone too.
---
Here's a list of all the current chems that can be crafted.
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Category:Fallout_76_chems_recipes
---
No I left the room while it was booting then I came back and loaded into adventure.
---
Looks like Grafton monster.
---
Kind of scummy of them since they scammed you in a way
---
And also what evidence pdf did you make or have? Is it possible for me to make it?
---
No. I mean from the previous game.  How are you quitting out of the game when you're done playing?
---
So many people are butt hurt that I shared the rad sponge mutation, I think that speaks volumes about the community.
---
Haha yeah. I like the minigun because I can maintain the ammo with my play style. Ammo machine is good for 5.56. Grenades are big meh.
---
If you use discord feel free to drop a line: Vault310#0077 I'm always willing to spread some knowledge.
---
Thank u this dude was giving me a headache with his replies
---
Nah thats crap. You should sell it..... to me
---
Me 100% last week a started fallout 4 and realised its a way better, complete, deep game than f76 plus on top of that you get mods?! Its better in every single way however I've slowly been getting back on 76 because of the daily/grind
---
Ok, I had given away the gauss already. Radium could be fun though.
---
Oh I'll hit you up. Thanks for taking your time with a newbie lol
---
So they wont add it. Simple as that.
---
I can’t say that I have noticed if it does. I suppose there are moments where I’ll shoot something in the head with a VATS Crit and it will not register— owing to Bethesda’s slew of bugs and glitches.
---
Been working on saving crimson flux for the legendary perks to max out on what I make, been trying to get a junkies gauss mini from it been a real drag got the same gun twice in a row
---
yes
---
Np! It takes me seconds to type a sentence or drop some stuff in game. But it makes a world of difference.
---
Seems to me they are trying to place a blueprint of a camp within what I presume is a workshop.
---
Yea, the system is super difficult and I've read people saying your better off using smaller blueprints, having a base that floats on one foundation, or building from scratch.. I'm sure resource extractors dont help with an already difficult system. This is probably a factor why most people dont heavily invest time into workshops.
---
That was one of the most common dupes on PC for quite a while, before the b2525 fixer started circulating.  Almost every trader had one, and many still do.  Still a great gun.
---
I also finished a couple of days ago. Running full unyielding with all the xp cards, mutations and food really helps. I went from 60 to 83 SCORE level in the first 8 hours of double xp weekend just from the repeatable running charleston DMV -&gt; Golf club -&gt; Huntersville -&gt; West tek -&gt; Burrows with Brain fungus soup/Cranberry relish/Berry mentats/4x lunchbox.
---
Yeah i get it all the time too... i just put it down to "A fallout thing" lol
---
Yeah sometimes I get that, but it will still apply a small amount of damage from the explosive. Even if the target is flying, with no wall or floor to splash damage against.
---
Angry Turtle has a video on AP regeneration that is very informative and will more than likely answer your question.
---
Whats up Xero, i see what your saying man i don't expect these things to happen its just fun to imagine where it can go, hopefully you know  they do add more over time like what they do with ESO and don't just leave it in the dust. 
---
cause i think that's the whole piont/story of this game you get out on day 1 and start fucking rebuilding america lol
---
but its interesting that you dont want this for the future fallout games i take it you want that solo lone wanderer experience where your the dude that saves everyone or the evil dude that slays everyone.
---
Cross console wouldn't be bad but like stated above PC has way too many people running cheats.
---
I just sent you the request!
---
Really? I feel the exact opposite. I went back to finishing all the Fallout DLCs and I’m playing Far Harbor rn and am hooked
---
None of your weapons are silenced. Energy weaposn can't be. Get yourself some good ballistic rifles and get silencers on them. It's a HUGE difference for staying stealthy.
---
Thanks.
---
That's project paradise. It's one of the most difficult events and takes a lot of coordination to get the highest level rewards. It can be pretty fun if you're on a good server with players who know what to do.
---
Oh oh oh yes this has happened to me before. It always messes up the Instigating part of my gun when it does!
---
If you want a good challenge but don’t want to die a ton I recommend starting on normal and work your way up to Very Hard
---
oh gonna test it now :), I just brought and I'm trying to understand how to make a good heavy weapon build with a laser Gatling, is kinda tight and low on carry weight tho and no other gun benefit from it.
---
The best suggestion I've seen is to be able to catch up on past dailies for the week once you complete the current days dailies. Maybe have it so the last two weeks of the season if there were past weeklies you didn't complete you get those back to grind out? Definitely agree it needs something. I really love your idea of rewards after completing the season! Especially for those lunch boxes!
---
Wait! You can play while drunk?!?!?
---
I tried explaining this concept but all the sheep that read my post really couldnt grasp the idea. That or they were so infuriated theyve wasted so much scrip that they just didnt want to accept that theres patterns to it. Either way if you get a good roll keep going, if not then server hop.
---
Platform?
---
I maxed out INT and that’s why I’m level 118 and have been playing since April
---
I just click quit and then quit to desktop
---
No problem. In short, AP regen is very good. The more the better.
---
Doesnt matter those dumbasses got banned along with their shit.
---
I asked someone to do that in that event and he just said “get good”
---
This is Bethesda’s solution to duping and maintaining a controlled economy. I expect that more items will be added in the future especially if those new items go beyond lvl 50.
---
yeah I really like that, got the RRG this month and now the brand new shadow lol, it is good the enclave quests and the outfit is awesome.
---
it’s like they want it to be as hard to use as possible
---
I see. So trying it alone at level 30-something was a BAD idea. 😂
---
Shut up. 
---
If it wasn't for high damage output bloodied builds, most boss level events would end in failure.
---
Have you looked into changing some of the .ini (scripts)?
---
Damn...good luck tho, with practice u will get it
---
XBone
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Why dont you tell this to every other game that dors this to cause this isnt a new thing and has been a norm for while. And dont use the excuse well thats not how a good game does cause half you knuckle dragers have only ever 0layed cod and halo
---
Next time you exit the game, open up the task manager and see if it's still running.  On consoles (at least Xbox), there is no exit option on the main menu.
---
23 free plans left come and get them guys I don't want them anymore.
---
Are you on PC?
---
I'm happy to help, and give advice-tips.
---
(Save you wasting some precious time finding out the hard way)
---
I've only played to the first primes when did this happen?
---
Yup! And thank you
---
I'm there on the 10mm smg, but it's a no from me on the dual wielding.
---
Duel wielding is not effective and it's a bit too goofy to my liking.
---
This is why I don't play nuclear winter sadly
---
Yes, especially at night. I usually play in the afternoon for a bit then from midnight to 6 am and i may see two public events the whole time. Its honestly awful and they need to fix it.😑
---
Then how about be like the other completions and grind it out
---
I am on pc
---
I also use a gatling laser in PA, this is my build since my gatling laser isn't a bloodied one, just a anti-armor one. Try this build out and work towards getting the heavy weapon perks first for sure. https://gyazo.com/9a0b64850328c42c0984fe94a25e9d61
---
Logged on the next morning with all of my legendaries sold and my camp moved and rebuilt half assed.
---
With rank 3 of Animal Friend you can tame some creatures that show up occasionally at random encounters. I literally just tamed a beaver but the stupid thing never showed up at my camp, just like the guard dog I tamed last week. :\ Deathclaws and sloths always seem to make it back though.
---
Edit: The beaver finally showed up at my camp!
---
Yeah I was wondering this as well I always manually close the game.
---
Yeah it sucks, I had an instigating explosive Dragon before I got hold of this one. The instigating does more damage over the bloodied, but the damage bug ruined it for me like you said.
---
Still does ok outside of vats, as long as you don't miss!
---
I did the same thing. Got murdered by a level 45 radstag and noped out of there. That being said, if you see several players already in the event, give it a try. You can probably hang around them for protection and tag enemies for plenty of experience.
---
i have an laser Gatling aa 25% fire rate +1per, I had done this one https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f394e38&amp;d=sq2st1s20sx2s32sr2pe2eo2eg1ee2cu2ce0s11ig2id2ih2ip2&amp;w=a72l71ls2lt2
---
gonna take a look on yours
---
I just came for the delicious stories 🙃
---
Definitely agree with this, three star Power User will let you get away with only carrying a few cores if your intent is PA. Batteries Included is then not really needed for PA, but is good if you're carrying a lot of cores for use as ammo (also coupled with Power User).
---
I’m super glad I’ve comparmentalized. Allows me to get my level ups super easy, I actually went hard on my main during the 2XP last weekend and i must have gone from 189-199- just broke 200, might give him a break- my NW Main is between 190&amp;200 as well- then i have like a 25 a 50 &amp; a 75(77?) I havent even begun the main Wastelanders quests with the three smaller characters but I’ve found that each one becomes better off earlier than the last- and to think I thought 10k was a lot of experience... Holy cow, not during double xp lmao. Last Wednesday too, i managed to gain 100% bonus xp from a lunchbox orgy after Uranium Fever and holy shit, i had the time of my life. I think I got two of my three weekly level ups in that one hour before i even got to do 2xp thursday and friday- this has been one hell of a legendary run, i’m at rank 47 right now, wish me luck- as i wish you all 15 points of the dang stuff!
---
What?
---
Why do you even come to this sub then?
---
I believe you have two times the opportunity to freeze with the additional shot of a cryo cell.
---
No particular reason. I was scrolling through the videos and happened to see it and decided to watch it. I do follow some but will also watch recommend videos by YouTube as well. I did  decide to not follow him if that makes it better 😅
---
For the meme
---
Yeah ours is almost the exact same, I just have a +1agl instead. That build looks good too, especially since adrenaline is broken atm but once it is fixed you might want to consider using it.
---
I don’t follow all the usual internet drama. Is there some issue with the market sub? I trade their occasionally and haven’t had much of an issue
---
right? if this game lasts 4 more years we’re gonna see the true diehards in youtube videos with like a level 5000 two shotting a level 12,000 like wtf is this shit anymore?!
---
It looks a lot like an Elemental assault suit from the Mechwarrior series.
---
And now I’m *really* showing my age.
---
yah I was debating this one on adrenaline if was Worthing put and wait for the fix but I will pass I don't use with my current melee too and I do well, and on PA what you suggest to use? I have a Ultracite ATM is worth take any other?
---
A good old fashioned Whitespring nuke
---
I'm illiterate and am paying the price
---
Nuke Whitesprings and Morgantown to farm ghouls 1st since mats don't spoil, then go after your desired flux. 2nd option would be to buy flux off of players.
---
It's the opener to a full health rifle stealth build. No one uses it probably because they like one gun, it's easy.
---
I love it myself, it can one shot a 50 legend mire king. Not as fast as bloodied but I don't get spotted. The dragon doesn't put you into danger with chameleon.
---
My unyielding character has a similar setup and he goes into danger at times, runs a handmade and b dragon (it's about as good as the I3315 below). Chameleon is definitely better stealth but it lacks the int and perception. You need things like radrat steaks.
---
It's really about one hitting or doing as much damage as possible and finishing. Deathclaw 100% it can do.
---

---
It would help with the role play.
---
So, next time you exit the game (to desktop), press/hold CRT+alt+del to bring up the maintenance screen.  Select task manager.  This will list all programs currently running.  Click on the processes tab and scroll through the programs and see if either the Bethesda launcher (if applicable), or FO76.exe is still running processes.  Select one or both, and "end process".  If you don't have the Bethesda launcher, ignore that step.  
---
I have no clue as for what the actual cause is. But, if this helps, then they have a better idea of what's going on. That's why today's update had a logger put in place. So they can see what "potentially" triggers it.
---
I hope they fix this, soon, and compensate us accordingly.
---
if youre on xbox ill trade you for an identically legendary 50 cal lmfao
---
Morgantown as well as whitesprings
---
Yes keep funneling new players into a half finished game and tell Bethesda they are doing nothing wrong by means of your actions.
---
Ah yes, something that is "the norm" must be inherently "good". And any older game that gave rewards to players who played the game at any pace, certainly could no longer be good, as they are no longer "the norm".
---
Forcing limited time events with tempting rewards and a monetization system to speed up the earning of the rewards so that players don't "miss them", *is totally not a known means of pressuring spending*, no couldn't possibly be.
---
Cheaters and duped franken bs weapons will completely ruin the console environment, just no and f crossplay.
---
Just to update you as well, I contacted support about it. they kept passing me around even after i have sent screenshots of the bug and they kept asking me to wait till their next update to see if it gets "resolved" which we all know will not magically just happen, but guessing with how they treat bug reports for this game i'm just gonna shrug it off. being an fo1st member makes it feel worse that they didn't  even actually try to help.
---
I was with you, up until the ammo. Oof. I will say though, I somehow accidentally accumulated over 5000 steel in my stash without realizing it...
---
There used to be mention of pets on the roadmap but I believe it's since disappeared.
---
I understand that a lot of your responses are, let's say pragmatic instead of negative, but just because other games do one thing doesn't mean that every game needs to follow suit.
---
This is a suggestion to make things more accessible to casual play. This isn't a hard core competitive game. This is really just a solo game where you have the option to do things with drums friends or strangers. There aren't leader boards or anything like that.
---
It's not asking much to make the grind a little more forgiving for people who don't have the time to invest in something like this. I'm also suggesting that people who do have more time not be punished for completing content too quickly, and offering an idea to reward them for continued play.
---
One Tamriel made the game drastically easier i hope the opposite is true here.
---
One shotting without bloodied or junkies requires alot of through and right weaopons and perks. I use a two shot guass pistol and explosive perk to one shot enemies. You also need really good hip fire accuracy since that offsets the bad vats.
---
I don't usually have problems on XB. Maybe the zone you're in?
---
I always lock my camp, BUT I also have a visitor area. And when I find that I'm encountering rude people who want to glitch through my windows, I just eliminate the windows. I've had one too many annoying visitors who would not leave the camp..
---
Scrapped my tattered field jacket and spent 21k caps on a forest asylum outfit.
---
No ally in a witch outfit?
---
Rad
---
I have heard if it the first time you can put in a trouble ticket and they will refund the atoms and you keep the item. Not sure how many times before they stop helping.
---
Trust me you don’t want crossplay with PC hackers are everywhere.
---
Do you know if you can actually locate her in the game?
---
It's the only thing I can think of.  I've loaded the game and have gone straight to n.w., atom shop, private world, and haven't gotten this.  However, I DID have thus happen 6 hours AFTER the reset, and after I'd been playing adventure mode.  Everything was good until I switched to n.w.. and that's when it autocompleted all of my n.w. challenges (a couple weeks back when they had complete 0/5 n.w. games. It was day two).  And the only thing I could think of was that might not have closed the game down (or soon enough before the reset).
---
You should be ok.if in a team and someone in your team launches and it gives you credit it kinda would dull that first nuke moment.i hope it didnt.
---
Nah you double clicked. An "are you sure you want to purchase this" prompt has been requested since the shop came out. Bethesda doesnt really care tho, im assuming a pretty good portion of purchases are mistakes. If you contact support theyll give you a refund and let you keep what you bought. If they didnt want to do this then they would simply add that simple prompt.
---
Strange. I have yet to be hit. 🤞
---
Travel south east from Hornwright summer villa. There are a few houses on the road there, one of whixh can be entered.
---
Don’t really “plan” anything. Every camp I build is just a variation on the last one I had. Started as a big three story metal building. Then when I got the original red rocket bundle (the one with the rolling door and the sign) I rebuilt it so it looked like a garage that was added onto/turned into a home. Then came the contemporary bundle and it became a two story house with an attached garage. Now with the release of the prefab red rocket garage, all my crafting stuff is moved to it and I have a wraparound porch with my vending machines on the side, behind windows and garage doors for when my shop is “closed”.
---
This game is already potent grindy enough as it is. There are numerous achievements and challenges that can be grinded for trophy hunters out there. When I say completionist, I'm really meaning people who have the desire to complete a timed event.
---
Look, if the event wasn't time locked, it would be fine. People could move at their own pace and not feel rushed or obligated to sign in every day just to complete their dailies. That's not compelling gaming from a positive perspective. You can look through the forums and the threads here and find many people are burned out and several who simply sign in to get their dailies done each day. That's not "fun" for some. It's a chore.
---
Your thread reminds me how the Atomic shop seems to really heavily favor raider gear.  Liberty prime is 1200 atoms for just a power armor skin. 
---
The raider scabber bundle I bought also cost 1200 atoms.  It  gave me not only a very cool power armor skin, but a cool outfit, a head piece, flags,  and a back pack skin. 
---
They seem to keep offering all these kick ass deals for raiders and screwing over everyone else lol.
---
As long as it doesn't get failed, I actually prefer it take longer than a minute.
---
I started a few weeks before Wastelanders dropped, so I'm still a relatively new player, and I remember how tough SB were, and now I can take them down single handed in short order with just a pistol (albeit a gauss pistol) which is cool, but it's still nice to have something that feels like some sort of a challenge.
---
It will autocomplete if a team member launches a nuke. Essentially that entire quest is a tutorial on launching nukes. You havent missed anything you cant do yourself at any time you want. If you need the tutorial part of it then there are plenty of youtubes with great tips and instructions on how to go about it
---
Wasteland Whisperer is the reason. It only works for things like Deathclaws and the like.
---
Animal Friend is what you need for animals like dogs.
---
Only like one of his songs are on the radio because their all explicit, how have you possibly not heard him yet still use the internet?
---
I've had a two shot and both projectiles will help slowing the target. What holds it back is the magazine size and the potential to break faster.
---
TS seems to slow faster than quad if both FFR but can't keep it frozen due to Mag size.
---
Sorry I have no data except using them both and I could totally be wrong.
---
I just build
---
I will keep this in mind next time, thank you for the advice
---
Compared to 4, they may as well not even be in 76, for how rare they are.
---
They're upset because you're intentionally being a total dbag for what can only be jealously. 
---
Thats smol pp energy.
---
That is a solid strategy my friend...
---
My bad I wasn’t trying to make you feel illiterate. Sorry if it came out like that . I was actually trying to find out what the drama is with the market sub. Someone further up called them a bunch of bitches and was curious what the story behind that is. 
---
You’ll probably get someone to sell you flux if you ask on the market sub.if not server hop every 20 minutes or so. The weekly and daily kill legendary score events is causing people  to drop nukes like it’s Christmas.
---
Nothing wrong with it...but he probably gets plenty of junk to repair it with said trap base.
---
Im on PS4 but Ive been getting a lot of weird texture issues since the last update so it may not even be you
---
Don't really need it. If you stand in sbq face and shoot, she will freeze. Quad is probably more useful. I have a instigating 90wr and still freeze her almost stopped.
---
Trick is keep the snow balls on her head.
---
Yup! Bethesda just added that feature in the latest patch!
---
What happens irl are always mirrored in the game world, if you work hard and as a result get paid more, the lazy ones will hate you.
---
I like the fact we cant trade it makes it a challenge I just wish we could scrip more then 150 a day...I am damn near out of space and nothing I can do about it.
---
There’s never been a mention of them on the roadmap. They said in a AMA that they were doing it eventually and some pets are already in the files rn.
---
Git Gud and quit complaining I literally got the challenge done in one match
---
Except you get XP for completing the event too and half of them were probably on events teams so why not have your cake and eat it too. With 10 people it's super easy to farm the event and get max completion. It's the same problem with Encryptid and Project Paradise people just don't bother with the objectives they just shoot stuff.
---
No kidding. Would probably save their support team a decent bit if work too, but then again their handling of accidental Atom Shop purchases is one of the few things people are satisfied with. I wouldn't doubt if Bethesda recognizes that fixing the main issue might just backfire since then support really wouldn't be able to help with anything else and people would have even more of a reason to call them "useless".
---
Maybe the leather armor was modded and the combat armor wasn't? Who knows. The loading screens also claim that Marine Armor is the strongest in the game LMAO
---
I use the heavy variant with the BOS paint and its just fine for me. I think stats wise its about 3rd behind the scout and then SS.
---
Supertough guy.
---
Keep being the cool vigilante.
---
Yeah I wouldn't sweat it at all. I do the same to hit up vendors. Maybe others see things differently but I couldn't care less who is on a public team with me or if they come and go.
---
It is for OP
---
There are three levels of both combat armor and Leather armor.  You may be comparing apples to oranges.
---

Hmmm, I never considered NOT claiming tiles until seeing this video...
---
This reminded me of a time I walked around Bonaroo -the day before it started-and a friend of mine played American Pie as we all sang along.  Ah memories.  But, in summation, yes! Awesome idea!
---
I never really thought about it but I’ve always disliked the cannibalism in the fallout games but I also totally took blood drinker without a second thought. Welp, whoops guess it doesn’t matter now
---
For future reference here's the Roadmap: https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/4mPsYvLByiH9sFAAOEcMAq/6a81bc94d42fb2489f1eb5e445efa29f/76_S1_FullSize_CommunityCalendar_EN_1920x1080.jpg
---
And just to clarify no Legendary Perks are not coming in Patch 21 they are actually coming out in Patch 22 in September.
---
TS, Quad, and, Suppressors are best for cryolators. Yes im sure a bloodied would do a bunch of damage because my ts ffr can kill, but its not what the gun is made for. I can freeze the queen or anything else effortlessly with the crystalization (snowballer) mod. Please use that cryo, it can be a 1* and itl still be great. We need more cryos in the wasteland. All you need to add to your ammo farm is crystal, you should have a bunch of lead and steel if you use guns. Enjoy Christmas in july as you make it snow!
---
Edit: be careful, idk about a regular cryo but when you make it a snowballer it deals explosive damage... like alot. Idk why but just watch out for other players in big events. If someone walks in front of you youll probably die instantly if you dont have serendipity and dodgy. But that means demo expert boosts it along with heavy gunner.
---
Yeah super tough right?  🤯
---
I seem to have good luck saving up 20 legendary modules then doing 4 at a time on one piece until I roll a unyielding. I have rolled a unyielding chest 3 star with 10 modules a right arm 3 star an the right leg with 20 modules...that damn leg only gave me 2 unyielding 2 stars.but I always roll my ss gear at the same location.its kinda my good luck site
---
Hey dumbass dont necro
---
The Leader of the Pack events almost never gets anyone doing it and theres usually 3 low level legendaries in that event. If you arent getting any luck on the better events try that one just to tick the challenge off
---
Nah because we cant trade here.
---
Its quite the paradox. Keep giving people free atoms, or make a minor QOL update.
---
What is this smart machine? Is it in the watoga high school? If so how many candies to reedem
---
That's great and all, except when they auto complete. I'd really like those 20k odd points I'm missing. And while they're at it, they can remove the atoms off my bethesda client and put them on my steam account where they're supposed to be.
---
Doubt all you want, but it’s true.
---
Blocker is one of the best perks in the game because many enemies use melee, and Blocker gives percentage damage reduction. It is a must have for non-sneak bloodied builds.
---
He is using Lifegiver for the auto-health regeneration bug associated with speed demon and adrenal reaction. Unless you are using a vampires or medics weapon, this auto-health regeneration bug is crucial for non-sneak bloodied builds.
---
Heres mine: not the most OP just preferences
---
Sniper semi auto: lever action-instigating variant
---
Commando: Fixer then Handmade
---
Heavy ballistic: LMG or .50 Cal for ammo efficiency 
---
Heavy energy: Gatling Plasma 
---
Pistol: Pipe revolver
---
2H melee: super sledge or regular sledge 
---
1H: Ski Sword or Combat Knife 
---
Unarmed: I like the mole miner gauntlet personally 
---
My favorite weapon in the game is the shovel. Just has a great sound when you smack something. 👍👍
---
Is that craftable? I'm almost sure I read plans for crafting heavy combat armour but I don't see it in my armour workbench
---
Considering FO follows whatever Bethesda does for the Elder Scrolls, whatever the next ES title contains the next FO title will be almost an exact mirror.
---
I completed it a long time ago its just annoying to see super low levels not even gettign the chance to touch the legendary so they get nothing.
---
Old Possum is cheap, New River Red Ale sounds like a craft beer.
---
I GOT ACID! 176c ON THE STRIP! Msg me for my psn
---
It’s like a little extra storage space 😅
---
Ricochet doesn’t damage you. It is a good perk for increasing tankiness. The only problem with it is that it only works in PA for some reason.
---
You are arguing something that has been a thing for more than 2 decades check your privilege
---
Could be - I ended up opening a Ticket w/ bEthesdA Support.  Maybe it’s just some weird issue w/ my XBone or Internet/Settings.
---
The best way to go through Nuka Cola *and* frag grenades is to make nuka grenades.
---
1 aluminum, 1 frag, 1 nuka, and I think you only need demolition expert 2, so other than the plans (I don't remember where I got those) the bar for entry is pretty low, and even without demo expert equipped, you still do like 400 dmg and 125 rads, if memory serves.
---
Skip on the quantum, though. Useless.
---
The MIRV frags are pretty good, too, but more resource intensive than nuka'nades (but not to the level of the orbital grenades which, for the resources required and the weight, kinda suck, but look neat)
---
I think I understand you. You are having trouble posting in the forum. It’s easy, you just need to know the formula. Because I’m on Xbox, this is what I would post...
---
[XB1] H: junk W: Colbalt and Violet Flux
---
The “[PC/PS4/XB1] H:” and “W:” cannot change or yes your post will not submit. Obviously only put one system, the one you use. Space it just like in the example above. you can put a lot more in the ‘Have’ section. If this what you needed and have any questions, let me know.  😘
---
A workstation that allowed you to can a few types of meat and veggies would have been a great bullion plan for a final reward from Foundation.  Much better than the silly turbo fertilizer. 
---
Upvoted!!
---
Oh god i forgot about those, yeah my 4 year old playstation cant handle the the experimental MIRViguns.
---
It is a successful business model look at wow and destiny now look at games that dont oh wait they died out

I don’t want another Fallout that’s totally online like 76 any time soon, but I really want to be able to play future Fallouts with a friend.
---
Both are the light variants
---
I get really crazy by building a 3x3 house with a staircase to get this: *another* 3x3 storey. Sometimes if I'm feeling really feisty I'll build the house 4x3.
---
A very good write-up!  To add a few a few more comments:
---
  The Batteries Included perk reduces fusion core weights when you carry them (I think someone eluded to this in another comment)
---
  If you run SBQ fights often, check your Misc tab for Improved Repair Kits (they weigh .1 each).  I accumulated over 100 before I realized it; of course the extra benefit is I haven’t had to use raw materials to repair my weapons &amp; armor in over a year.
---
UPDATE: Just watched the clip... He's in PA fighting the queen they kill her after looting he goes to exit PA. Another dude runs right up to him as the animation begins. When he gets out of PA he is naked and the PA is now just a bare chassis. Not sure what to make of it going to see if I can share this with everyone somehow... be careful out there guys.
---
because it's just aluminum bars? and the aluminum scrap we get comes in bars, the reason bottlecaps are the currency of the wasteland is because the caps themselves cant be reproduced, but aluminum just melted down would be unknown if they were melted from caps or old tin cans
---
Very concise. Thank you!
---
Junkies is superior.
---
Change my mind. 
---
Jokes aside. I wish there was diversity and seeing all these bloodied builds really kills the fun sometimes, especially since theres all these newer players starting to play and feel obligated to follow along. I can kill/1 shot any tough enemy and chunk away at the SBQ with a healthbar, granted my character is dumb as a rock but that doesn't change anything.
---
"You take a sip from your trusty Vault 76 canteen"
---
Lodge a ticket. They will send you back a bog standard 'we are investigating' which will probably annoy you more. What they need to do if they can fix the bug add double SCORE to pointless stuff. Like 1000 SCORE for eating one bubble gum. Happened to me with a daily. Not a weekly and I wasnt even online when it turned over. Sucks this spoilt the game for you.
---
The reward are primarily cosmetic if you dont earn them fine it happens there are people who literally started that I personally know with the game pass and are well into the high 70s it comes down to do you want it and if so are you gonna earn or is it gonna be given
---
Thanks dad dad dad!!
---
Shouldn't have bought that shit in the first place but good on you for canceling now.
---
When this happens I just leave like nah, not playing with pricks today. Bye.
---
This is what I’ve wanted most right next to (and conveniently located right next to) the blood eagle handmade skin. Really looking forward to getting it!
---
Bro I live for the camp items. What are you saying mang
---
I'm skipping most of the NW challenges. Because fuck PVP. Hope this still gives me the chance to get to the end. Maybe I'll have to buy the last few levels.
---
But the "place CAMP x number of times" and maybe the "survive x minute" challenges are ok to do.
---
Just put one in, thanks
---
One day, maybe bloodied builds will be able to use all this **salt** for their cooking.  
---
*Especially* because it has much less weight!
---
2x the amount you get for daily
---
Fair enough. I was thinking all the caps sorta glued together in a sense vice melted down but yeah, you are right.
---
Ok, will try that.  I'll have to see a youtube video for this quest to see where I can pick it up because it doesn't show on my map.
---
for real theres no reason for 150+ and up to being do that shit its not cool at all just shows us all they are fucking losers
---
Matter of fact this is my philosophy in life.
---
It will encourage more AFKing at events as well.
---
I use X-01, I am working to get the T-65 Secret Service power armor from the gold bullion trader. I think Ultracite is good, especially if you have the mods for it!
---
So you’re claiming that you didn’t put anything or take anything from an ncp vendor that shouldn’t have been in their inventory
---
Yeah its craftable. I think I got the plans for the Heavy Combat Armor from the bot at the Grafton train station. I cant for the life of me remember where or how I got the BOS mod plans though
---
I scrapped my Jack O’ Lantern Short Suit 😭
---
I came back at the end of May. Was level 78 now I’m 277, got 66 of those levels during the DXP weekend. I’ve been playing a bloodied build for about 3 weeks and the XP bonuses are insane.
---
I mean yeah I show up with weapons that are so op they kill me. But i just smack em in the face with the but of my gun lol.
---
I guarantee its the same type of people who tried to get that stupid petition signed about Bethesda unbanning all accounts for duping.
---
So true. Honestly I wish bethesda would cool down on making new models that we have to pay for and instead implement meaningful and fun content where we have to work towards those new things in the game. Maybe their sales would go up and the game would recieve more praise, because right now it feels like the work out into the game is 90% atomic shop stuff and 10% bug fixes, balancing, new content, ...etc. lord knows that we won’t ever get that because all games nowadays revolve around in game purchases but maybe they should cool down on the cosmetics that we have to pay for and add in some making the game worth it’s retail value.
---
I put all extra plans on sale (all at least 50% off MSRP, of course) for at least a day or two, because you never know when a low level character, or someone looking to blow caps, will pass through.
---
Anything that's still sitting after a while gets dropped in front of a low level character, or dumped in a container somewhere between Flatwoods and Morgantown, same with various aid items and ammo after vendor caps are drained and ammo is converted or in the shop.
---
Could be. But more likely it’s the exploit for munitions ammo extractor.
---
Yeah and then it dies and youve successfully wasted an afternoon.
---
I know a lot of people do, just not my cup of tea. I'm only saying they should rotate camp items one week, and combat and armor stuff the next and so on. I can appreciate people's cool camps I just don't personally see an appeal in building one up myself besides the basic stuff that I got for very cheap. The last 2 weeks were very heavily camp focused and I am just trying to spend some atoms on cool PA and weapon skins. I guess I am in the minority though.
---
Nuke Whitesprings and kill glowing feral ghouls. They have a chance of dropping high radiation fluids.
---
I get you though man! I totally agree there should be more diversity as well. I feel like more diversity and shorter time limits on items could help a lot
---
Hahaha yeah exactly that kind of person lol.
---
Thanks so much!
---
What about the Weeklies, do they still offer the same amount?
---
You get it off of creatures you kill inside a nuke zone, id suggest not picking flux until you have an abundance of hardened mass, rad fluid, and ionizedmeat. And use the green fingers perk card when picking flux cause you'll get more flux. The things you kill need to be IN the nuke zone to drop the crafting stuff, its heavy so you'll be waddling around alot. Good luck man!
---
So, like I said, they mentioned it and it appears to be in the works. Which was kind of the point. Thank you so much for taking the time to correct me though, that's always nice.
---
You aren't playing the game the wrong way. There is no indication that creating an alt is strategy that BGS recommends or frankly even considered in the Battlepass design. I believe they intentionally kept it simple to promote the most dramatic rewards for the newest members of the community. This follows the initial Atom rewards design that shipped with the game on release. New players see an avalanche of Atom rewards for challenges while they simply play the game. You can guess where this leads over the the long term when that rate of automatic rewards starts to diminish as players level up.
---
Sold a fixer plan for 50c
---
I build my base and have one display with just that note wouldn’t trade for everything in the game the duper’s missed the greatest item there is fools
---
Hear, hear. I have never been able to wrap my head around people who like that kind of weather. 50s and high 40s are perfect weather to me!
---
That I wouldn’t know. Bethesda could only give you one daily if they wanted to. Probably 7-9 Each day and they are worth 500 or 1,000.
---
Agree with you there. Sadly I don't think it will ever happen, but I can wish. All I can do is wait until next week aha.
---
It takes like 30-60 minutes tops to find a tamable pet if you're not picky about what you get. Hardly a waste for the life they add to your camp.
---
Ha
---
Animal Friend is what I meant to say in the first comment. I tamed the dog no problem, it just never showed up.
---
Wasteland Whisperer seems to be completely pointless for taming pets. Animal Friend even works on mirelurks even though it shouldn't.
---
gg mods 👌
---
100 score points for 10000xp ingame
---
&gt; The High Capacity Backpack is a Possum plan, not Tadpole
---
Thanks, edited!
---
&gt;  I don't know if any price adjusting cards affect it
---
Sadly not.
---
I thought scout with the polymer mod was a little better but I might be wrong. I was going to get a set of scout with decent legendarys but then they added the SS so there didnt seem any point after that
---
I think it looks goofy  lol. It looks like Buzz light year in a militarized mech suit.
---
in my case, the amount i'd lost was that equal to what i'd been given from the legendary run (450 atoms)
---
1100 atoms after quests and legendary run
---
650 atoms after bugged out atoms
---
If you're willing to unlock and take the bounty it's free lol.
---
That's so specific lol. Wasnt she from the brotherhood in fallout 3?
---
Wait, we aren't using HD textures atm... Thought this was 16x the textures!!!
---
Im off tomorrow and will be on and off all day. Send me your discord if you want and we can play.
---
I m on the same situation, rank 50, I think we Don t have any problem, reminds 7 weeks..
---
I don't know, I just run huntersville and west tek and get it done in 15-30 minutes. Never touch events for legendaries because it always ends the same way.
---
Potato, Potahto.. lol.
---
Correct.
---
They specified that the double SCORE is only for dailies.
---
I didn’t need anything on my main character either but it was a nice jump start for my low level to get a couple thousand caps and some basic repair kits.
---
Radical pic man
---
Yep. And I’m right 😂
---
Haha radstorm
---
&gt; The Batteries Included perk reduces fusion core weights when you carry them (I think someone eluded to this in another comment)
---
Maybe it's not clear enough, since I didn't make it a separate bullet point, but that's actually in the guide (sixth). :)
---
&gt; check your Misc tab for Improved Repair Kits 
---
Ikr, I have 51 on me on my current character... I only use those for armor, though, to save Ballistic Fiber. Weapons don't cost much to repair, so I tend to do those manually (plus I get to repair them to 200% instead of 150%).
---
Damage shows when shield is up, but it doesn't count.  Don't have to do very much when shields are down to count, but not sure.
---
Yes sorry for being so vague
---
Great idea. Ill throw them on Mr. Mule.
---
Ughh gave a new player that just hit 50 a furious faster fire rate gat plasma and told them it was a great gun for almost anything to have them turn around and sell it for 100 caps...... not doing that again
---
Classic bethesda
---
Sorry for what I hope you can actually find a guide for it, I'd be amazed.
---
I think Greg in Grafton sells them.
---
*sad M79 Grenade Launcher noises*
---
Also the (non-claim) tokens that you occasionally see have the same weight and there's no use for those. Lots of hidden weight in the misc. tab.
---
yep, running as many weight reduction perks as possible with max strength, unyielding, and some other stuff. constantly hitting around ~450ish lbs worth of stuff. If I push it I think I can get 500+ carry weight.
---
Nuking Whitesprings generates quite a few legendaries. If you do it in a private server, you won’t have to worry about missing anything and you can even farm the same area 4 or 5 times (depending on your group. I think my friend and I did it 5 times with just two players.)
---
There's so much random character bound nonsense in my main's stash. I wish I could do something with that besides just dropping it.
---
Having a mule character, or even a separate account if you're that deep in to 76,  helps with weight so much.
---
Junk and Scrip mules especially are super useful. Being able to store and accumulate Junk and Scrip is very nice, it saves you a lot of busy work later. Aid and plan can be nice too, but they're more late endgame luxuries. 
---
I'm never actually going to use 50 decon shower plans or 700 glowing meat steaks, but if I ever do I'll have them.
---
If you have First or have multiple accounts, mules are a powerful storage tool
---
I think that's the idea, though.
---
I mean, sure, things like lockpick, hacker, etc. could and should be able to be on in the background, but weight reduction perks, not so much, otherwise, you wouldn't have to sacrifice any points from elsewhere.
---
For example, if thru hiker was passive, a melee build could carry tons of str/melee dmg+ food and drink, but still allocate the three points to max thru hiker to strength.
---
Pretty good compared to a poster that was already a freebie so you have it.
---
Nah fuck that, ill just farm enemies for xp and legendaries like you even if the event fails i won't move a muscle to collect ore for you entitled fuckwits.
---
but i never use any chems or ect.
---
Never said Ricochet hurt you...
---
no
---
Ok great! I’ve tried this before and only yielded like 2-3. Maybe I was just unlucky
---
but i never use chems
---
I'm getting reaaal tired of those thorn bushes...
---
i just usualy blame jagex.
---
I set an example by taking a light shot at a legendary then emote call everyone over for a shot.  I have been pleasantly surprised at how many times other players get the hint and follow suit.
---
I got them somehow, but honestly can't remember where. I think I just found them lying on a counter somewhere but can't remember where.  Might have  been a random spawn at fort defiance.
---
Basically, they are plans that I just sort of got through playing the game a lot and exploring different places.  Doesn't help much I know but that's the best answer I can give.
---
In my frantic travels looking for garbage to buy while at cap limit before someone buys something from my vending machine, I've found more people selling Fixer plans than flux.
---
1. Look at this image: https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2019-02-16-11.png

---
3. Read the title of this post. 
---
4. Profit.
---
Yeah it really sucks. I have been on the edge of quitting for a while and I think this alone just kinda killed any passion I had left for the game. Unless they fix it soon I can’t see myself playing for much longer.
---
Awesome, congratulations! -)) I finished the run a day before yesterday without spending any atoms too, the grind ended much faster than I expected. Double xp helped immensely. I started in my early 400s and ended up with level 622. Not particularly fond of any of the rewards, but that planetarium lamp looks fantastic (didn't spoil it intentionally by not looking up the vids prior to receiving it) and the new fireplace was a great addition to my fancy bar as a toilet door :D
---
I found it surprisingly enjoyable as well to get a ton of levels in the process -))
---
Right now it's kinda strange to see there's nothing else to do in game since dailies/weeklies do not give anything anymore. Before seasons I used to log on every day to grab the atoms and it's strange they didn't bother to add any rewards for dailies/weeklies to incentivize people to continue logging on after the season.
---
Well, I guess I'll take a break from the game for several weeks then -))
---
i cant even place items in my display because it takes up budget, also so does wires.
---
Regarding scripping, I sort by value and go down to the bottom the list so that I get rid of more items before I hit the daily 150.
---
Public horde events would be pretty epic actually a damn good idea! I'd love that!
---
Well alrighty then
---
I'm the opposite. Those legendary enemies in UF are underleveled, I already have all the gear I want, and I'm at the scrip cap anyway. I don't go after them as a matter of principle, and when people use their "Come Here" emote to be polite I just refuse. One time they even tried to kite the legendary to where I was minding the extractor. Listen, kid, you take that legendary, I don't care. Same goes for One Violent Night; I don't need a tag on the wendigo, man, I'm just here to play some bass.
---
^ this!
---
Also lift the gold cap. I have 300 treasury notes and 5k gold with nothing I want to spend it on. If score is my only reason to grind, they lose me in under an hour
---
Oh yeah, that happened. Says volumes, doesn't it?
---
Theyre found at in world random spawn locations in cranberry bog/watoga areas. The wetsuit one is a bit easier to get than the tactical marine helmet. That took me a lot more grinding. The plain marine helmet plan was one of the loot drops in the last Treasure Hunter event. You will be lucky to find any for sale at player vendors but someone might make you one.
---
Some places to look are the NAR Trainyard inside the half pipe building on a table to the right.
---
Between that trainyard at the Watoga station is a train car that spawns a random plan on a pile of boxes next to the skeleton.
---
Inside the bunker of Dropsite C-2 (this one always has high level gutsies and sometimes an assaultron just for shigs and is a pain in the arse to check)
---
At the back of the Ranger District Office is a shed. A random plan spawns on the shelving.
---
My advice is check and if its not the plan you want then leave it there and try another server. You wont always get a plan anyway because others may have already picke dit up. Its a grind. Took me a good few weeks of checking whenever i logged in before I got the helemet
---
&gt; How would you suggest they rework it? 🤔
---
they could literally make it so as long as you put in effort for the event you get to loot it as well, cause I literally saw a 214 person come right at the end of campfire tales one shot the legendary then leave all without doing the event he camped where it would spawn and 1 tapped it right away.
---
It would be nice, wouldn't it.  
---
On console, it seems like everything either has a low-res texture or appears lathered in baby oil..
---
I finished it in about a month and a half... But I also took a two week break
---
Just north of Tyler County fairgrounds is a little farmstead with two red buildings.  Near the river too. You will see a water tower right by it as well.
---
It also has a wood pile you can put an extractor on. 
---
👍👍
---
did you change your camp module to the new skin you get from the legandary run
---
edit : it is bugged and will not show your camp on the map anymore take it off
---
Selling items for RMT.....and who’s getting these weapons for RMT?  Duper’s. What they SHOULD have done is shit the servers on the night the dupe became public. Rolled them back 24 hours and banned everyone who used the dupe before it went public. You get all the RMT duper’s and remove all the duped weapons from the game in one shot. They didn’t and after 4 days when they closed the glitch they either ban everyone who used the exploit. Or nobody.
---
Unless you have a few players it's a pain to keep the Brahmin alive there because they stop right where the Sheepsquatch spawns. If you're only hunting legendaries it's a lot of work for one or two sheepsquatch.
---
I don't have all the mods tho, just some and mate just got all the heavy gun perks and is awesome
---
I tried the combat armour myself but went back to leather since I'm a sneak character. For some reason, even though I put shadowed and muffled on both sets, I'm detected way too easily in Combat armour than Leather. Light, sturdy and heavy doesn't seem to make a difference. Wearing heavy leather shadow/muffled I've had enemies walk through me and still not detect..... I enter a room in combat armour and a frigging enemy will spot me halfway across the room.
---
Is there any other way to rank up your settler and Raider status other than the one daily mission
---
I never see pets, because theyre always dead or become scortched and then die
---
I've seen people regretting doing the exploit because supposedly they permanently eat CAMP budget. Scrapping everything, moving camp, doesn't matter. They become completely screwed of ever building a CAMP again because of glitched ghost budget.
---
If it's true, I find the comeuppance for greed very amusing.
---
not even stims or radaway?
---
It has been so bad today because of the "kill 3 legendaries" daily challenge. 
---
I sat and played my little heart out on banjo at One Violent Night. I was the only one playing an instrument out of 3 of us, which is fine. I don't mind. But as soon as the wendigo popped the other two rushed out and destroyed it before I even had a chance to get out the damn door. I gave them an angry face. That will teach them I'm sure.
---
According to [FED76](https://fed76.info/weapons/), it is priceless lol.
---
Vault 94 raids were wicked buggy and diificult ftom the few I did. Good riddance
---
Civility goes a long way. Use your emotes and show your intent from the start. At all events, even if mobs aren't legendary I only tag them unless I need to urgently protect something. Know the spots and when you see a legendary, wave people over. It sets the tone and works most of the time.
---
😃
---
The one that makes the eagle sound when you drink it lol
---
That sucks.  It's pretty much instant on PC.
---
Ohoho buddy. Keep dreamin
---
You could weapon bash, or hit it with your fists if you're melee. You don't have to kill it in one shot.
---
I work nights. Im often on 1am to 4am PST. I miss every update, every major weekend event. If Im luck I get two ! Events. I want a triggerably hord mode event. Give me x.25 the xp. I dont care. Just tired of grinding servers that are already picked clean.
---
Oh sorry, I misread that. Ricochet is for tankiness, not damage.
---
I just want to grab that orange cat I occasionally see wandering around alone and meowing in the Ash Pile.  Give it a good home.  I hate how Bethesda treats that cat.
---
Agreed. Any other game it would be a no-brainer what should be done, but of course 76 has to turn even the most basic features and concepts into a conundrum.
---
1 point in sneak and 1 point in escape artist and you don't need any armor mods, and you can walk right up to mobs
---
looted my own stashbox.  more times than im willing to admit
---
I just moved and don't have internet yet, so I had to set up a chicken coop in real life.
---
400 .45 for 70 caps. Can't beat that price!!!
---
they take up no budget
---
EDIT: or just downvote me lol, they dont take up budget
---
Yeah I got escape artists and sneak maxed but there's a noticeable difference when wearing either armour and having the above perks.
---
Will make for Bethesda identifying the accounts very easy. Watch this being the next ban wave!
---
Dump that gunpowder too
---
What is ionized meat good for?
---
The tamable ones always spawn alone and have nothing around them to kill them. If they're scorched you can still tame them but they act weird and endlessly attack parts of your camp (without doing damage). I've tamed dozens of pets, you've just had bad luck finding one I guess. Go to Cranberry Glade and server hop and one will show up.
---
&gt; If you have First or have multiple accounts, mules are a powerful storage tool
---
To add to that: if you have 1st, and want to transfer items on your own: launch a Private World on the character you're playing with, dump the items in a world container (like a suitcase at a train station). Exit to Main Menu, switch characters, and go to the Private World again within 10 minutes. You'll find all of the stuff you dropped in that container (suitcase) on your mule character.
---
However, it's a better idea to have a friend playing/standing by on that world, or just give them your stuff and have them hold it for a few minutes while you switch characters. That way, if something goes wrong (crash/bug/whatever) the items aren't lost forever.
---
In 8 days of playing, I’d say I’ve seen 6 so far. But I play many,many hours a day so your mileage may differ
---
Just relaying what I've read. If they move their camp, the budget bugs out and won't free up.
---
Ill sell ya the wetsuit for 1776. Im out of helmets but i usually sell mine for 2776. Ive seen them for more but who knos if they sell
---
I have noticed most of the problems with landing come from people shooting her during her landing animation. If you hit her in the head, or use one gun army and heavy guns, you will stagger her and she will not land. Best advice, if you see her start to land, stop shooting until she lands.
---
no one is going to get banned for this lol
---
Is there a way to download images and put them in a folder with the other screenshots to make them loading screens?
---
When am I supposed to pass him
---
Winner, winner - chicken dinner
---
Yeah it used to be like that. Ever since the season pass (like day one I noticed this, it was like a switch was hit) it is hit or miss if you manage to get there before some one else or if some one comes in while you are doing it and kills the other packs.
---
Absolutely the fact that we have to play a mode to unlock things in the other mode makes no sence
---
You can only use the 1st member on the service you purchased. Atoms for first are stored on said acct. However if you have atoms on Bethesda side you'll need to spend them on that side.
---
The only way you'd be phucked is if you planned on playing through bethesda launcher and not steam. If you have the game on steam and plan on playing it there you're fine.
---
Also, any items you buy progress made etc is all shared between accts so long as you use the same user name.
---
Because they want you to give them $12 instead of $5.
---
Worst tinder date ever. They order $100 worth of drinks, don't finish them, let you pick up the check, then ghost you.
---
I've got my first and only one in the NW lobby... :(
---
I have the plans in my vendor and I can do full BoS material, which makes combat armour the best all round armour in the game imo
---
Lol your either really funny or astoundingly stupid.
---
I know this sounds like a dumb question. But I can’t seem to add a picture to a post on here. It said it was removed. That they aren’t aloud. How do I share a picture or video ? Btw I’m new here.
---
oi, cryo support squad, the wasteland salute you! thanks for your service.
---
Im with you. I never ever touched f4 after 76 release. I dont find a reason to build anything if no one will ever see it. I will of course play another playthrough of the other games, im itching for some lee van cleef character in new vegas. 
---
But 76 got me really hooked. It has lots of flaws but its slowly getting better. World map has change with the release of wastelanders. Soon the BoS will arrive.
---
Im still keeping my hopes up.
---
Oof
---
Bethesda: One last time, or what?
---
I just got the weekly today without even trying between that popular event with the mole miners in the cave (that for some reason the name slips my mind right now) and using the burrows to level myself up (and one from one voilent night). I get lucky and mostly find people willing to share the legendaries. But the burrows today had 6 for me. Even better than a good day at white springs (which I find is more reliable than west tek honestly which is very hit and miss for me).
---
I know but cummmmmmoonnn bruhh
---
I don't start with a floor plan or prefab exclusive design, I look for an interesting place first. My primary criteria are the view, fast travel benefits, and maintenance costs. I don't build near fissures or frequent enemy spawn locations. My current CAMP is on a tall rock formation on the cliffs near Foundation. Wonderful view, no significant enemy spawns, and I haven't seen a SB the entire time. I placed the CAMP module as high as I could on the rock, moved it out of the way, and placed the first floor foundation in its place. I just started adding stuff from there. As the Wanderer says, Just relax, let yourself go. And everything will be all right!
---
We had 2 minutes left when she finally died.
---
That's what I meant, thanks. Orbital Strikes can be fun, though.
---
But i dont want anither fallout online. We alredy have a shooter looter, now bring me another single player RPG.
---
This is the reasons why I stopped playing, even before with normal atom challenges, none of them would ever pop. It would take forever to complete the challenge and it wasn’t even a guarantee that it would pop to give atoms. And now people are having the same issues but with this limited time event
---
I mean yeah, if it were a standalone sure
---
Those crazy kids... Level 15 armed with nothing but a board showed up at Scorched Earth. While I'm sneaking around, they Leroy Jenkins their way in, get in a few hits, and their corpse flies 100 feet through the air. I ALWAYS revive downed lowbies, if only because it's so much fun to watch them charge in head first, without a care in the world.
---
i hear you, just clarifying. ive built up to like 50-60 at once, they dont take up any budget. you cant delete or move them once theyre placed however
---
We waited 4 years for you to fix a bug and you just said no
---
plenty of mmos do it just fine though with this suggestion or a similar type of system.
---
I would only worry about handing off to a real person if its a high value legendary or plan, personally.
---
Desk Fans: should you pick them up? Why not, screw it!
---
It’s the good kind of shitpost, and it ain’t lazy
---
Not new, been out since beta. Just no one uses it cause you stumble over wood all over the place.
---
Or next week. Or be able to build it even though you didn't buy it( love my globe)
---
I also want to add...
---
Don't just have random power armor stuff just chilling in your stash. If you have some random parts for a suit you're trying to build then try to get your hands on a PA chassis and then put the parts on that and then put that in your stash in the end your weight will be 10. Now, keep in mind that I'm a filthy idiot casual player so I might have some weird perk equipped that I don't know about so YMMV. 
---
You can bulk raw materials but the only weight savings is with aluminum and lead. Bulking those cuts the weight by 50%. 
---
Cork is a low effort, high return material to bulk and sell. 
---
Right this second, drop those god forsaken missiles and mini nukes. they weigh a fuckton and don't kill shit. 
---
I'm personally a bit iffy about telling people which raw materials to keep or scrap because I took the advice of a guide which suggested keeping metal to a low number like 50 which I tried which lead to a massive dumping of metal which kind of fucked me because I've now been grinding an extra amount to pick up steel. 
---
I guess maybe think of it like this, if bullets or armor don't use it then keep a low amount of it. Things like glass, asbestos, ceramic, etc. are really a waste of your time (MAYBE, maybe not)
---
You noticed that the organ music seems to be coming from the piano in haven church?
---
if you join at the end of a event you dont get anything thats fair completely since most events are timer based anyway if you show late thats the players fault themselves.
---
Encryptid is the easiest 4 notes outside of dailies though. Rewards aren’t as good as the queen, but a decent team of 3 can server hop and keep doing the event.
---
The hunger and hydration is pointless when it takes no effort to keep both full.
---
They’ve always been there.. they’re just so useless that no one really mentions it. Though, they’re probably aesthetically cool. The cabins by the dry lake have a wood extractor node as well. 
---
You don’t really see camps near it because I assume most people either want to camp near better resources (Steel + Copper, Junk + Lead, Junk + Water, etc) or overall more accessible locations.
---
I sit and vibe on the front porch of my little cabin. Wind rustling the tree, wind chimes tingling along, radio inside playing some good old-fashioned miners music, super mutants shooting up my outhouse....
---
..... Damnit not again..... Be right back...
---
I do cranberry relish, brain fungus soup, well-rested always, +1 Int in 3 pieces of armor, I'm also a bloody build with 6 base int. You can add mentats/berry mentats for more int. If you're carnivore, you can do Squirrel Meat Stew for %xp, and scorched beast brain for int.
---
I could do brain bombs instead of brain fungus soup for more int, but I'm lazy.
---
I emote for everyone to follow when I find them but these players literally do not care thats the problem.
---
Maybe it has something to do with everyone having B2525 fixers and exploding energy weapons thanks to the duper’s?
---
This definitely happens. I've checked the map after it popped up completed and usually, there's a player nearby, but sometimes I think it's other NPCs.
---
Kinda like how when you do Retirement Plan, sometimes you show up and the former raider gets/was killed by random mobs in the area.
---
What he said. Apparently people have also fixed this by walking in and out of the room repeatedly trying to talk each time until it eventually works, sometimes spamming interact. If that doesn’t work look up the quest online and just redo everything whether you can or not. That’s what I had to do for the graham quest the guy above mentioned.
---
Bloodied builds
---
What are these "good items" you speak of?
---
I've only ever received stuff I had an abundance of.
---
Can't blame them really it is the best build in the game, the end game should be legendary perks and not bloodied low health builds.
---
Lol, you were always half way there
---
Why does everyone care about this? Is it hurting anybody? Seriously I wanna know?  Because I could care less if they make their ammo with this glitch. I can make a ton of ammo without ever using this so what’s it matter?
---
&gt; Of course if you're a bloodied unyielding build 
---
[You got me.](https://64.media.tumblr.com/9ecd91a84df7f1ade6ad30ee28d84ad2/tumblr_mgkp88PQH11qcxbquo1_500.gif)
---
You're right, some food items do stack, like Soup and Relish. Throw in the reward you get from the Wise Mothman (Path to Enlightenment at the Lighthouse) for another 5% XP bonus. But like you said, I usually only bother with that event when it's double XP weekend.
---
I keep thinking about going the bloody build route for those perks. Been building my unyielding armor set before I jump in.
---
I'm not jealous I want the game to be better and not have everyone use the same build.
---
Roughly 70% uses it currently and it will only get worse. I guess the other 20% use junkies
---
I would like them to expand upon factions and make it so you really have to choose a side. I’d like full on events where it’s just a battlefield or invasion or raid or whatever on one of the faction and then players choose a side for the event and earn/lose rep from the faction they sided with
---
There is food everywhere, and players cams make it easier.
---
Meta builds exist across nearly every game with builds in them, 76 is no different
---
So you can't blame them for it, but you can make an effort to negatively impact their experience for doing so?  
---
Hmm.. 🤔  
---
Maybe you're the problem 🤷‍♂️
---
Yea....i.have a full set of van, troubleshoot, and unyielding with amazing stats....but oh well
---
Level 100 bush team, reporting.
---
Nope, it’s a grind. Unless someone knows a glitch
---
You probably got it as a quest reward, don't worry lol
---
That fucking slays. Well done!
---
Tried to PVP at a workshop when I was a younger level, against a way higher level, only to die within a second of claiming the workshop. Worst thing was losing a heap of flux, lead, steel and about 30 hardened mass's along with the rest of my junk, because I forgot about them.... oh and I thought I was invincible. I never go to workshops under the influence anymore
---
Just right now bought it at Pleasant Valley station for 9K. Only had 9.5 on me!
---
I think when we did it, it was like 2-6. To reset it for the enemies to respawn, I had to leave the blast zone and my friend had to leave his server and come back. I’m sure there are videos regarding this subject though.
---
Well to answer your questions, the whole thing started about a month ago. I realized that my bloodied explosive lever action was missing and initially made a ticket thinking it was the npc glitch. The response I got was that they would send an agent to replace it with something similar and wanted to arrange a date to meet. However, a few days later when I was doing challenges for atoms, I bulked some resources and broke them down and sold the unwanted stuff at the freestates robot at whitesprings. I discovered that items randomly get sold from your inventory if you spam the sell option, in my case despite only selling junk, I ended up selling my unyeilding action refresh chest piece and had to buy it back for 400 some caps. That's when I noticed that my anti armor explosive plasma gatling was missing and figured it might've been sold without me realizing.
---
When I reported the glitch to bethesda and they responded by saying they lacked the tools to help replace in game items but to keep submitting glitch reports to help improve the game, in short the never helped me.
---
So I told my friends about it and they got pissed off (I guess they also got screwed over) and said they would help me and we ended up forming a trade group on discord. Over the course of a month and some change, we did our parts to contribute to trading (I gathered resources and handled low scale trades with a few exceptions) and together we amassed a lot of cool stuff and pooled it (we even encountered some people who were either quitting the game and gave us some of their stuff or ran across people who were returning for wastelanders and didn't realize that some weapons became legacies.) 
---
Now as for my evidence, I took screenshots of some of the trade conversations I made (to prove that my inventory was mostly the same a month ago) on discord since it's timestamped and put them in a word document because I had to attach the file in one of the accepted formats like doc, docx, etc. and updated my ticket. So it's very much possible for you to do it.
---
Unfortunately the support interface glitched out and seemingly wouldn't let me attach the file and then when it did the update button deactivated so I had to go on twitter and contact support. They asked for my ticket number and then they updated my case. So I guess it's a good thing because I suspect that they placed an automated system to weed out some of the tickets but through Twitter it bumped my ticket past that automated wall.
---
I personally run a bloodied build with 70+int (it's usually 72-73 with the +int team. Base int is 14) and the difference even between that and 55 int is **immense**. I was getting 2600+xp from a lvl 68 super mutant during double xp with 100% lunchbox bonus. Huge mobs almost always net max mob xp (4000 flat). I was barely getting 2k from a mutie with 55 int this way as far as I remember.
---
Without lunch boxes and double xp I get 4 times less (660 from max lvl mutant), these two bonuses seem to apply multiplicatively above everything else.
---
I reviewed my build specifically to raise my int as high as possible before the season and was able to finish the season run the day before yesterday at level 622. Gained about 200 levels in these 3 weeks.
---
It’s really not that difficult. Git Gud man
---
By the time I unequip my weapon someone else kills it.
---
It better or it’ll get the hose again
---
I either fall through the floor, can’t load in, and still can finish a quest because it’s bugged
---
I know the feeling, when I had played for a couple of days then found that stash in the red rocket in Flatwoods I was like wtf?! Then my drunk ass takes everything back to my camp to put in my stash and I shortly was again saying wtf?!
---
Because hype. Because "Nana Nana I have more money/time than you" bullshit.
---
This is 100% accurate.
---
Agreed with another comment. The season pass has opened a flood gate of people who haven't learned the wasteland etiquette. I give some people the benefit of the doubt and hope others educate maturely on mic.
---
But I've seen some high levels running through legendaries lately. It's either to be scummy or out of frustration with other players doing it.
---
Either way having double XP go away and being far ahead of the legendary grind, I'll be crawling back into my hole called a private server. I expect as players get bored with the game (like they have in the past) things will come down and what will be left will be a new wave of seasoned players that get the flavor and flow of things.
---
Be patient. It's been much worse!
---
I've played through the reset almost every day up until Saturday and never once had an issue.
---
I've also never once started NW.
---
That's just my experience, but anyone that cares about SCORE and would only play NW for the challenges might want to just skip them to play it safe.
---
It sucks to hear but do keep in mind the subreddit rules(#9).
---
I have 28 with my normal gear, and +4 from brain fungus soup adds a little xp, as does a building team and Int bobblehead.  It’s not a huge difference, but it’s noticeable enough that I’m aware when I need to drink more soup.
---
There's a AI upscaled HD pack on the nexus for some of the textures. https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/585
---
How bout it
---
I sell stuff cheap not drunk
---
[Heh. ](https://2eu.funnyjunk.com/gifs/Jumping_758749_1062291.gif)
---
Because they need to make money to pay for the servers, employees, and investors?
---
these are extremely high level players doing it they arent new they have been around plenty its levels liek 150+ doing it
---
Damn.
---
I had a double of the Wetsuit. Didn't knew it would be worth that much. I put it up for 50 caps and was already wondering that this was the only item I sold so far :D
---
Thank you friend. I accidentally got attached to mother lode 73, since she was the closest thing to an NPC we had at launch and she regularly helped me out
---
Will these players receive a ban? It seems from what I’ve read these things should never be placed in CAMPs because they take up budget and aren’t scrappable
---
I... I get the reference!
---
3
---
You must be new to MMOs.  Meta builds have existed forever in any game that offers custom builds and gear.
---
A full ultracite chasis with the exact mods and paints and fur abilities on them as my primary? I’m doubtful but I didn’t know you could earn ultracite power armors from quests
---
Stable flux will get removed, but I didn't think nuclear waste did, but it's possible.
---
Grind settlers rep and you can get the BP for bullion
---
Got this idea off this sub. 
---
We like to strip down to underwear and combat knife, drink nuke shine and race back to my camp.
---
This is the answer I was hoping for. You'll have to excuse me, imma turn that queen into a bitchsicle.
---
Edit; it's pretty obvious to me that a TS cryolator is the most effective way to freeze the queen. Only downside is the durability is terrible.
---
Yeah, I feel that. The Motherlode’s are quite neat, and helpful.
---
Here's the sole survivor or the vault dwellers from 76 making a fusion reactor but a bottle cap is impossible to recreate.
---
So uh... What do you do to the insult bot?
---
i always emote people to come over to me, but there is always that guy who finishes them off, 200 plus lvl people....
---
Says you. Also survival wasn't removed for FO1st. Survival was removed because it was mostly dead.
---
I have all unyielding and one bolstering ss pieces at I’m specced into demo expert and all shotgun perks I also have adrenal reaction and all that put together I’m putting out 2600 per shot when I get to 10% I’m doing 2600 per pellet oh yeah I also have bloody mess and tenderizer and adrenaline to do more damage
---
Ah I miss read I guess,  I should avoid social media when sleep deprived.
---
From my ass.
---
You really think they ditched a game mode that most of their “target” players were playing?
---
HE got it mixed up. GLowing Mass is the third reagent to make Stable Flux, not ionized meat.
---
Glowing Mass, not Ionized Meat
---
It did this to me as well and I was a little bummed out and then I did the silo by myself and tried to launch a nuke before realizing I left my nuclear keycard in my stash so I’ve had bad luck with nukes and still haven’t launched one lol
---
Of course 😉
---
It's because players like you and me bought the game because it was advertised as a survival-lite game, however the majority of the player base bought it because Fallout was in the title. Most players didn't want a survival game so most of the survival aspects have slowly been diluted or phased out. PvP is next to non-existent in Adventure, food debuffs have been removed, death has even less of a penalty at Public Events, and more.
---
I wasn't personally a fan of Survival Mode for many, many reasons, but I'd take it back at this point. The game was already so easy it doesn't need to be made any easier. If they're going to cater to casual players and keep simplifying the game they should also do something for the players that can handle/crave a challenge.
---
It’s bad game design that the SBQ can fly out of bounds in the first place.
---
Waiting a little bit to respawn isnt much of a punishment.
---
Oof. Ty
---
1 lvl 200, 1 lvl 135 and 2 lvl 105+, and mobs stop scaling after you hit lvl 50, so what's your point? Or just typing useless * funny* comments
---
Yeah some guy did this the other day. Waved everyone over to the legendary then one shot it before we got to it.
---
Sorry comrade. What platform, and what level are you, out of curiosity?
---
How do you find subreddit rules?
---
really oh man thanks!
---
Yeah I found some foxes
---
Ok, cool so im looking at easily another 1000 dam. The only perk/armor/serum you mentioned I dont use is adrenaline so looks like im still rolling for that bloodied gauss. Wish me luck it's been a non stop parade of 1* exterminators and hunters since hitting that max rep  😂😂😟🙁☹😭
---
Idk what to say then. I only use a point in each and have no problems. Maybe full unyielding helps? Though idk why it would
---
Yeah !
---
That little fellow could join all those other cats at that gigantic billboard sign in kinda the middle of the map
---
They were at big freds bbq
---
I just answered your statement " grenades dont do enough" damage. They does, its up to player to use them or not. Game is boring one shot fest anyway
---
I feel your pain. My friends and me usually share scrip between us, depending on who still hasn't hit the daily limit. Nobody wants to hang on to a 3 star Exterminator's Sledgehammer, but it makes for good scrip.
---
He should move to the Portside Pub in Morgantown and re open the bar.  Or just stay at the Nukashine I guess.  Would be cool to go to a fully stocked bar.  Could move him to the Whitespring too, might be some fun interactions with the other bots.
---
It's rare but it happens
---
For the last time, every bundle and tab is there. Open your goddamn eyes.
---
It took me 2 months to roll all my stuff I got very fortunate I got a bloodied faster fire rate 15% vats fillers almost instantly the rest of my crap to months to roll
---
Yeah, until it goes to 15 seconds to 20 seconds then 30 then 45...
---
Yes started a timer after I did feed the people... Got to five hours and it didn't show up... Then may game crashed and my 5 hours of waiting were wasted.
---
honestly how tf do u play this game that long there's 0 content
---
pc and my highest is like 123 ive been around since beta and this is the worst ive seen it.
---
Until respawn bug kicks in and then...
---
I know lol, can kill an irradiated demon FEV monster bat queen and launch infinite nuclear missiles, build sprawling buildings and settlements, and all these unimaginable feats yet they dont know how to reproduce a bottle cap? very confusing.
---
If you can get all the plans the Sheepsquatch Staff still outranks all other 2H weapons with the burning barbed mod. But getting all the mods for it is brutal because of the way it randomly can pull any of the 21 others that you already have.
---
I'll keep up the good work. Was really looking forward to that SS uny armor but I'll be ok in BOS combat for now. Thanks for the reply, my friend!
---
Get better armor... maybe the problem isnt the "punishment", and it's that you're just dieing too much..?
---
Im usually away from home 4 days a week when ive got to go away for work some weeks im lucky and only have to go away for 2 days if its a quite week.
---
It's a really long boring event for a not even a good reward.
---
I believe BOS heavy is higher DR than both scout and marine.  Marine has more rad resist though.  But BOS is second to Secret service stats wise.
---
Sometimes if I have other stuff too close to benches, it won't be able to complete the camera transition and the game spazzes out.
---
Try making sure the space in front of the stations doesn't have any obstructions.
---
The Scouts too! Still waiting on the next set of Badges.
---
No fence, no bunker, and dont shoot her when she's in the air.  The stagger animation knocks her out of the landing animation.
---
Doesn’t seem to work that way. No ammo in my stash but there is ammo in my ammo machine.
---
Well no matter, I'm definitely not working on this all the way to 100. It's not worth it.
---
No problem have fun in the wasteland (I also suggest having high endurance so u can have a high 20% health I have a 16 in endurance cuz my bolstering piece and heard mentality it makes it where you can’t be one hit it’s very nice I walk around at like 50 health just a suggestion though)
---
Holy shit, I'm actually on track, if not a little ahead lol
---
&gt; Don't just have random power armor stuff just chilling in your stash. If you have some random parts for a suit you're trying to build then try to get your hands on a PA chassis and then put the parts on that and then put that in your stash 
---
That's actually good advice, but better advice, imo, would be to specialize and go for one specific set of PA. My personal favorites are the T-51b and XO-1. The T-65 I'm not that taken with, tbh, because the Resistances aren't actually that much better in practice and the Helmet looks like crap to me.
---
Well, Boston did get hit harder than WV, and doesnt have mountains keeping em at bay
---
This.   They are soft......sooooo soft.
---
Dude hell yes! 🤙🏼
---
Lmfao, I have secret service armor and the best dmg resist mods for it. And lol, I’m not gonna blame the player 🤷‍♀️ I think it’s ridiculous they increase the respawn time.
---
Ya gotta pay the moth toll to get into this boy's hole
---
Yeah, that’s annoying as hell too!
---
Well players aren't mean't to have 7 or 8 ammo factories in their camp.. so yeah? Hurts no one really. They get free ammo, no need to farm up steel and lead and they get a free ride. This was the first one I came across in game personally and its crazy how fast they make ammo compared to the raiders ammo maker anyway.
---
You gotta pay the troll toll 🎶 
---
To get into the boys hole 🎶
---
*They are forbidden from crediting SCORE by the penny pinchers who control the monetization of the game* FTFY
---
What makes you die so much?? I do scorched earth encryptid and project paradise as often as I can and barely ever die twice in one event? (Not braggung..) maybe dr perks would help?
---
I'm high level and I do this event every time I see it as long as no one else is in the area.  It's literally impossible for me not to one shot the wolves, even just punching them.  If a newbie is around and I'm aware of them I'll back off and let them get the loot; but this particular event is not made for teams or multiple people unless they're all fresh from the vault.
---
Had the exact same realization last night. I’m a FO1st guy, but I’m always going to public servers to interact with others, meet newbies, buy sell and trade. 
---
Met some cool folks last night as well, Nuked harpers ferry and explored the underground completely (amazing Xp btw). Was a great time with total strangers
---
There is an accidental dupe in the game. Not sure of the conditions but I believe it has something to do with your save state when you connect/disconnect to laggy ass servers. I accidentally duped a junkies flamer and had a serious moment of consideration that I was developing a memory disorder [before I found this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bbzho8/unintentional_dupe_glitch/).
---
If you're worried go ahead and submit a ticket but for the most part its just one of the 80000 bugs in the game that will probably be fixed in the future.
---
How rare are rad storms, because I got 70hrs and never encountered one
---
Not Worth the Effort.
---
You can’t damage anyone unless they wanna fight and shoot you back. As for the acting weird thing. Idk maybe he’s just a weird guy.
---
Thanks I appreciate it, I've got a Bolstering SS chest piece (the only one I've rolled so far) and that plus dodgy, nerd rage, serendipity and 800 stimpaks are keeping me going 😂
---
Ok this makes me feel a lot better that it’s a known bug
---
I once bought a 1* bloodied HM for 400c, I never forgot that. So sometimes, not anymore, I would do a blowout sale cause I wanted someone else to feel that same "OMG" moment. No, I do not consider dooping ok nor do I condone what I did, but but I can't imagine what the person that bought a BE90 laser gun for 15,000c outta my vendor thought. I would've shit my pants. And I know I wasn't alone. Vive la resistance!
---
Same
---
Its like Todd forces you to play NW. You got 2 extra dailys, stop whining. I just skip most of my nw dailys (stopped after glowing skeleton costume) and im lvl 53, just doing dailys. But people need to whine about something i supose
---
Absolutely this.  Playing after work always chills me out.
---
Weird, I think this happened to me with just a junk, (empty) basic chassis I was trying to dump it before I knew it needed scraping, after trying to drop it a few times I finally scraped it at a station and found another in my inventory later that session that weighed 0 instead of the usual 10. Scrapped that too as I don't use it but it was strange
---
Noone forces you to do them you know, u got 2 extra dailys
---
It was a reward from the mole miner event what was going on before Fastnacht. My absolute favorite backpack in this game haha
---
If you're on pc, I have some spare UNY I can give you. They don't have Int, but some are pretty good.
---
How does one trigger Riding Shotgun?
---
Go to atomic store, camp skins, and then look at the item that you place your camp with. The little projector looking thing. They might automatically apply when purchased. They come in a few different bundles. But I’m not sure either way just explaining what that person meant. If any but the standard green color is selected, revert it back and see if that works. Also, storing vendors resets inventory. If you move your camp, they’re reset automatically. If you need to move them, do so without storing them.
---
To see more asses burn and angry, make repeatable daily : get 1k or more overseer exp in nw 😁

For every penny pincher there is a crew of game designers, artists and programmers that try to make the best game they can within the constraints that the penny pinchers set for them. It's the way of any creative for profit business. The balance between the penny pinchers and the creatives is what can take something amazing and turn it into a steaming pile of microtransactions. Bethesda has been teetering on that fence for a while.
---
That’s smart you saved or had a track of Your trades. Unfortunately I don’t keep track of them.
---
I hope you get your account back but unfortunately for me it’s probably going to be a while :(
---
If you don't want to launch your own nuke, just sever hop until you find a blast zone, and then hit it up.
---
Don't just make one pass through an area and call it a day, though. Go through the entire blast zone and then start going back over ground you already covered, looking for respawns.
---
I get most of my mats by just sticking around after everyone else has left, and grabbing the respawned enemies.
---
I also run a refrigerated backpack to keep my raw flux good longer. After I burn up my mats or get under 10, the flux sells for 3c each with hard bargain and grape mentats, and if you used green thumb, that can add up fast.
---
The worst one is scorched earth, I’m an unarmed build so I have to charge her head on and I die at least once every time i fight her. Then you get respawned in the middle of the nuke zone with no protection and die agin
---
But one build what other MMO just has that?
---
I know they had plans to make it where everyone could loot legendary enemies during events, but I'm not sure if we're still getting that or not.
---
The Stimpak ones aren't bad either. There are locations with guaranteed first aid containers with Stimpaks, and you can use the Pharma Farma perk too.
---
FYI, Tire walls are available now with FO1st exclusive discount
---
Or you know, yoy can play junkies with uny gear
---
I adore my plants.
---
The succulents are in "Floor decoration" category
---
Agreed!! He should have more quests!! Something maybe maybe linked with Duchess
---
Wish there was more of these too!!
---
You don’t have to side with them for the raid, you do all the set up quests for the vault raid with the settlers and the last reward is the stealth armor plans. After you get the stealth armor you can side with the raiders
---
There is mods for that, and mutations, atleast for fo4
---
The big advantage to this format is that it's a living game now. New modes, new areas, new NPC's, new quests, it can all be added and integrated over time as the game ages. They said they had a multi-year lifespan in mind, so while we may not have vast hordes of supermutants overrunning Appalachia at this moment, it doesn't mean it won't happen in the future. Brotherhood's coming to town, they seem to enjoy kicking greenskin ass.
---
Same story. 100% sympathize. But oh my God is worth it. The Jetpack is fricken amazing.
---
I haven't used explosive lasers, I've heard it makes them pretty OP, but I'm not a fan of the non-legacy lasers due to the spinup, core mechanics, and weird issues with ash piles.
---
Gunpowder 900. 
---
Goddamn it.
---
Biv is great! Seems like every fallout, there’s a robot I adore. I always kept Buddy in Fo4. Primm Slimm in NV (sorry Fisto). Shakes in tenpenny tower in Fo3. More robots, more jobs!
---
I guess I just want them to change it is all
---
Yes it does
---
Well thanks but too late. I already finished buried treasure lol
---
I run bloody unarmed, and I die pretty regularly during Scorched Earth. And for sure it’s a pain to respawn in the nuke zone, and half to frantically try to get into hazmat or stealth.
---
Obviously, I hate it when I’m doing it, but objectively, I think it’s good design to have glass cannon builds be fragile.
---
Punishing completely innocuous players won't achieve that.  
---
[But this might](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/42223/~/where-can-i-provide-feedback-for-fallout-76%3F) 🤷‍♂️
---
Leaders of the pack event in the forest zone, spawn 3 legendary wolfes, all lvl 10. It happens fairly often
---
yeah the wolf event or horde of a certain type of enemy isnt but you gun bash shouldnt oneshot anything so you can give them the tag as well as get some yourself.
---
I use a combat shotgun and it's fine. You just need gunsmith.
---
Right, I do the same, but I'm also guilty of hoarding all of the plans for so long I find myself at stash limit. If you stay conscious of them on you, it's easier to deal with it at a better time than at the end of a SBQ fight, for example. 😊
---
My friend did same thing and just requested refund through Bethesda and then purchased through steam instead. It worked but as the other suggestions here, it’s up to you how Important playing on Steam is. I prefer it for voice chat with friends.
---
9 was way too much, and 5 is still a little too many. I think 3 is much more doable, but I wish they would do more than what they've done. So far it's just kill players, kill creatures, make a camp, pick a lock and use stimpacks.
---
They could do:
---
Survive for 5 minutes
---
Loot 3 crates
---
Fire 25 shots
---
Obtain an armor set, a gun and a melee weapon
---
Become mutated
---
Deal damage to an enemy player or creature
---
Run 500 Ft
---
Spawn at X location
---
Change your perks
---
Use a Quick Kit
---
Find a Magazine or Bobblehead
---
Yeah, that's a good one if you can catch it solo. I feel bad doing that one though because the legendaries are so low level, like I should be saving it for new players.
---
why go to all the trouble bro, just get yourself some as well.
---
😹😹😹😹😹
---
I thought it was the whales who buy them? Not the dupers...
---
If you get full unyielding armor your stealth stats will be higher if you’re a low health build, the rad resistance is the real plus side of the stealth armor. But like the other comment said you can buy it with bullion once you get neighborly with settlers I think, it’s ridiculously expensive tho
---
99% of new players does not even know that event exists. I give those dropped legendaries to new players btw.
---
That sucks. I'm on PS4 and haven't had most of the problems I see on this forum. I generally only use my 330 main, idk if that helps if people worry I'll retaliate
---
That's probably true
---
Buy. Yes. Create. Duper’s.
---
Are you unaware that the BOS is coming back in patch 22?
---
This.
---
Should the whales get banned for investing in the RMT market?
---
I’m gathering that! I’ll see what I can find. 
---
I’ll have to remember to put a silencer of my green laser to match the silencer on the muzzle IRL, I guess. ;)
---
Hahaha yeah man same here. Whenever someone just disappears out of the group, and we see him saying “iT jUsT wOrKs” we all know that the game crashed or froze or something lmaoo
---
Thanks man
---
Haha so many fell for this
---
And I'm thinking maybe they're making creatures spawn more frequently when "kill x amount of creatures" is the challenge. I got 5 out of 5 in my first match, though that may be because as I play more, I know more where to look for spawns. Found 3 mongrels at the school and 2 ghouls at the college.
---
Hopefully it works for you :)
---
Todd came to me in a vision and said go forth and build. So I built. 😂👍
---
Eh, maybe, like I said if a noob is there I let them take the shot.  I literally unequip my weapon and still kill them.  I'm only in it for the chance at the rare forest weapon mod plans.  I drop the legendaries for low levels too, some pretty sweet vanguard armor, instigating hunting rifles and shotguns I would rather hand out than scrip.
---
One of them is probably from the bos quest. The chassis awarded weighs 0.
---
You can check the condition if they match.
---
from what I hear and see pc community is the most toxic compared to consoles
---
I don't know, it's not really reassuring that you need 3 weeks of non-stop grind with a probably min-maxed build solely focused on this instead of playing the game how you'd like to play, just to complete the run.
---
Just picked up a 2* radium rifle, executioners, vats crit +50%  want it?
---
I have two characters that I play that I keep low in weight. 
---
Sneak build sits around 56 and the blooded heavy PA I around 67.
---
Sneak has full secret service armor and uses chemist backpack. He is a junkie build. Uses 3 different rifles(lever, handmade and gauss) and carries 30 stims, 30 radaway and 5 diluted rad-x. 30 canned dog food, 30 water. Around 10k ammo between them
---
Bloodied, 2 weapons(50s one explosive and non-explosive), 30k .50 rounds, 250 diluted stimpaks(born survivor eats these and they weight half as much), 50 diluted radaway and 5 diluted rad-x. Roughly around 100 water and 80 dog food(runs speed demon) 40 fusion cores, 80 psychotats, camera and 20 film, no other armor except clothes cause no one wants to see him in his stained tidy whities.
---
I love playing the weight management game. Lowest I can get my stealth build down to is 24 but thats if he uses the Chinese stealth suit only.
---
But I bench mark my weight and set a goal to keep 8t a specific level before log off every night. Then I stage my script for the next day.
---
3x 3* and 2x 2* etc. And that's all I carry extra...
---
Oh and if you dont turn in the scorchbeast dna that is 1 lbs and nuke cards are 1 each also.
---
Oh and I either give away or vendor all my 1* / 2* junk  if I already hit my script limit for the day
---
Sure. But how do they prove that?  It’s a trade in the game. With someone who duped they broke the terms of service and it shows on their account what they’ve done.
---
irl?
---
I'd absolutely love a line in the sand style event with super mutants and lots of them
---
Yessir
---
I still do biv daily for the scrip
---
Great tips here👍🏻👍🏻
---
I have missed out on 3 days worth of daily challenges, and today when I logged in I found that 5 of my 8 weekly's were autocompleted. It is super annoying and makes me not want to continue the run.
---
I even took the recommended steps to avoid the autocomplete bug, but no dice. I have lost out on 10000 score because of this bug, that is 20 days worth of the two extra dailies assuming no other bugs happen.
---
i'm curious to see what they do there i think the next elder scroll game will be like skyrim but will they add multiplayer options i don't know but i cant wait!
---
"What's your boggle?"
---
Cranberry...
---
"I don't ge...."
---
(heavy rifle noise)
---
Hahaha the cry of the disgruntled
---
My B33 gets about 2400
---
What is that weapon the player is using?
---
The thought of a sheepsquatch power armor skin terrifys and excites me.
---
You have obviously never scrapped assaultron heads.....
---
Maybe try putting it in Documents/My Games/Fallout 76/Photos/Character
---
Thats where the photos i took ingame myself are stored, so i'd expect that putting them there yourself will also put them ingame hopefully.
---
Usually the last bit, Character, Is just a bunch of letters and numbers, think they may be a code of some sorts but i ain't an expert.
---
He could have had the trade glitch where your inventory doesn’t show up or you can’t activate trade at all. That’s why he left and came back. As for shooting him unless he shoots back you’ll do nothing to him. So not a hacker. If he just wanted to look in your inventory that’s standard. If he wanted u to give it to him to look at. Scammer.
---
I have lost out on 20 days worth. 5 of my weekly challenges autocompleted today :(
---
The point of these sales are they want to encourage you to buy a load of junk cheap then they kill you get the junk back and keep the caps you paid. So they won't price it higher as they are trying to catch you out. Quite often it's cheap screws as they know that appeals to people. It amazes me though that many don't seem to realise about the light footed perk.
---
yeah that would be awesome if you could go through the story with your friend, wife etc.
---
I dream of him being released from his prison and wandering the wasteland mumbling and drunk... saying how beautiful a dead animal is and talking to a wall. I can dream.
---
I'd buy one. Or two.
---
Plasmacaster, you get the plan from a vendor using an emd game currency. (Avoiding spoilers)
---
Harpers ferry has a spawn for the marine stuff. Check west of the train station in that box car in watoga too
---
xD
---
Pipe is Life.
---
That's what I have been doing, too. People did it for me so I think it's really the only fair way to handle it.
---
Re: horde events: what do you think of claiming a workshop and choosing pve vs pvp with separate rewards?
---
Pve: lower risk, lower reward, predictable attacks. Similar to current defense, but each attack is a wave that incrementally increases in difficulty, and each successful wave increases your workshop max budget and/or refills your free workshop material pool. Think tower defense mechanics not unlike 7dtd. The more you play that workshop, the more materials/budget you gain, the more resource drills you can afford to build, and your rewards snowball until the difficulty of the attack waves becomes too much for your player level and you’re overrun. 
---
Pvp: higher risk, higher reward. Haven’t planned this out as well as pve, but it revolves around an amount of caps you choose to pay when you claim the workshop, your bet. You cannot build resource drills, but you may build additional defenses. Your workshop is broadcast with all of your player information and your bet amount on the workshop. Any player entering your workshop loses that bet amount upon entering, setting up their investment, and they gain it back plus your bet if they kill you. You gain their bet if you kill them.
---
I've seen maybe 10 since beta, my crew always makes a bigndeal out of it, we take pictures. Saw two in the last week including this one.
---
They just appear so innocent like children trying to raid the cookie jar 😂
---
Found 4 legendary down by pylon workshop today.
---
[Yes, doctor, this comment right here.](https://i.imgur.com/fcAU8aj.png)
---
Aren't instanced camp spaces on the roadmap? I imagine the budget for the instanced interior spaces will be much larger
---
I wouldn't have risk to take the product of exploit, but good for you (:
---
one shot Jimmy don't understand that, as a melee I have a deep angry towards any oneshot pew pew guys, I make sure to change to a lvl 5 knife but those last days I became oneshot things too, no patience to call all people and Jimmy takes the price alone.
---
Spawn at Morgantown high; I usually find a few mongrel dogs there. Then run over to VTU and maybe you'll find some ghouls. 
---
I got this one done in 1 match and even got a player kill when some fool was trying to steal my puppy kill and I blasted him with the gatling gun I'd just found.
---
I last played 76 on PS4 and got to lvl 150 before I burned out (pre wastelanders). And I really enjoy it on PC better than PS4 seems like a lot less head hunting and more cohesion
---
well.. events have a difficulty, you shouldt do events that requires an higher level than you are. if you die often in those events is probably you are doing something wrong
---
I have played for 16h and I haven't met any cheater. If you have at least gtx960 it should run no problem
---
Ooo have to look that up. I just tamed a house cat
---
I didn't know this either..I actually move camp A LOT and always forget to empty out waters, ammo, and collectors. I always find it afterwards in my stash a few hundred 5mm and I just go burn it on a possum. 😆
---
Rank 1 is more then enough, since shotgun shots 8 pellets
---
What did you do to get that much xp? Been playing since launch and I'm only level 122.
---
They do take budget when you move your camp, because they get stored in the "stored" tab, they're just invisible and can't be scrapped. 
---
Claiming they don't is disingenuous at best, and troll-y misleading at worst. If you build a bunch and move your camp, it WILL eat up budget that you can't get back.
---
yeah aw man i just imagine the Brotherhood rolling up taking ass kicking names, my hopes are up there too man would love to see some tanks rolling in with them!
---
I've seen that before on old nvidia cards, happened when the gpu was ran too hot.
---
It helps to farm flux in two parts:
---
1.	The stabilization materials - Hardened Mass, Glowing Mass &amp; High-Radiation fluids in one run.
---
2.	Flux (with Green Thumb equipped) in the second.
---
You need one of each to make a stable flux (Make sure to equip Super Duper for the 30% chance to double).
---
Harpers Ferry is excellent for Violet Flux btw. White Springs is good for the other types
---
I’m going to say yes.
---
He is right you know. The game is dogshit. This game is literally a bezerkers bash damage fmswa pipe bolt action pistol
---
Thanks for answering! To be completely honest, I have been headhunted a lot on Xbox while going for a silo. The one friend I had playing didn’t even know what mods were good and he was a higher level. That was why I took I break shortly after wastelanders.
---
The only thing that ended up working for me was toggling active repeatedly, and finding the right spot to stand.
---
After the event head to the vault entrance and leave a little care package for emerging vault dwellers.
---
Died over and over and over and over with almost one hit from most enemies while in the nuke zone. After screaming into the headset and getting mad drunk hitting the desk my wife and brother over discord told me I was an idiot and running around with just a 0 DR Hazmat suit when I thought I was in my Power Armor.
---
Alright let me lay this out for you. All they had to do for this was: 
---
1. Open the editor and copy the files for the original files for the liberty prime armor.
---
2. Change the color from silver to a grey and save under a new name.
---
That’s it they didn’t have to remake the textures and models of the armor unlike when they made the set the first time. All they did is changed the color. Idk how to put it more simply for you because apparently I wasn’t clear enough the first time.
---
EDIT: 
---
Also another counterpoint to your logic if it took the same time to make two sets (where one has a more complex skin with stripes and crap) then by your logic the first set should be 2400 atoms if not more.
---
I’d at least give it credit as a Vampire’s Bash Damage Fixer.
---
What do you mean ,,help out,, ?
---
What do you classify as mid tier? Game seems fairly CPU  bound in alot of situations and it has stutters and some pretty bad performance in areas that seem to affect even high end rigs. Having said that, its an excellent experience on PC, though you may find people don't use voice as much on console and its nearly impossible to directly contact anyone in the game.   
---
As far as the actual gameplay goes, I can just about guarantee that the skill level on PC is higher simply because of the mouse and keyboard, I've heard alot of console folk saying they need to rely on VATS to be accurate and thats not really an issue on PC, VATS is obviously still super useful but not needed to fully compensate for aiming as its nowhere near as difficult.   
---
Hackers? well if you like Nuclear Winter, you might be disappointed, there seems to be quite a few hackers in that, its harder to tell in Adventure mode, lots of legacy weapons and such, but hard to tell if anyone is actually hacking.
---
You can have difficulty right now, just use non legendary weapons and armor. In bethesda eyes new difficulty would be just bullet sponges, but honestly what else could they do
---
I’m playing New Vegas and when bored play Fallout 3 or Metro Exodus. Got a whole bunch of free time due to Rona
---
Hopefully they'll give us cats. I want one but really don't want to give up my deathclaw. Plus I fear the cat won't last up at my base with the mean and nasties around.
---
Haha a freaking beaver, you damn hero.
---
Thank you i just tamed a cat
---
Impressive!
---
It’s very easy to get around this. I actually announce it aloud in chat but no one ever seems to listen. All you have to do is fast travel near her location. Anywhere down there works, and poof she appears in front of you. You can even drop your own tent if you have one, and chances are she will teleport to you without even traveling. Works for multiple/any/all SB down there. I know it sucks having to do this but you can 100% recover out of bounds loot from any SB.
---
Decon Shower? Meh, I'll stick with RadAway, it's the best!
---
Wow great answers, thanks everyone. Guess going above 25 is definitely worth it!
---
The plasma caster electricity effect makes this 100x better. Nice shot!
---
If he wants to PVP workshops are really the only place to do it. So he is set up inviting all to PVP? I don't know, I'm guessing. I always claim workshops for certain resources and leave everything unlocked. I'm finding with the new influx of players from games pass all those camp plans are in high demand. I sell them at 10  to 20 caps and make a few thousand per night
---
I found it was not to bad
---
going solo you can often find 1-2 each mach usualyypu just go to a building where you notice no one goes, that’s where you usually find them. somehow last match I also found one each nuclear plasma cryo and frag mine. So after sniping a ghoul and mongrle I went bush Wookiee, killed one of them posthumously with the mines When he tried to loot the bag. Much fun was had by me, and aparently his team lost. I suspect he’s going to be Vety paranoid about looting the duffle bag from now on.
---
Help out however, building, escorting, sharing supplies. Giving XP from harder enemies
---
Its called free for all pvp
---
I haven't checked if I have all his recipes yet, but I still do his daily every day because yes, he's awesome.
---
I'm on PS4. I think the dude was bored.
---
REALLY??? I've got Fallout 1st. Just came with today's weekly update?
---
Oh right the nasties.... My camp is at west-tek by those floaters xD rip mr. house cat
---
Poor little kitty.
---
This is not how you report an exploit... this is how you help publicize an exploit so people start researching it and it starts spreading more.
---
Send a report to Bethesda and delete this.
---
Alt+F4 closes it too. Log out from adventure when done, not nw. I log to menu first and out, hasn't happened since. It's a old issue, used to happen with atoms.
---
I classify my rig as mid tier because of how old it is. I have okay stuff like a 960 and I7, but I haven’t gotten any sort of servicing or check in 3 years. I’m planning on upgrading some components soon but what I have can’t run games it used to be able to while new. I’m still kind of a newbie when it comes to setups and getting good parts, so I don’t really know how good a rig is until I play a game and it either crashes in heavy areas, or just chugs hard while looking at stuff like vegetation
---
*does mothman dance*
---
You'll have to be more specific. Cheating as in God mode? Duping? Glitches/exploits? Hacking in nuclear winter? This game has more ways to cheat than actual content so..
---
Same here. But you wouldn't believe what could go wrong. I've once witnessed a friend of mine lose his second-to-best Shotguns because of miscommunication and an unresponsive server.
---
They are greedy 
---
Not much more to say
---
Enjoyed it
---
They could have just released a good game at launch
---
Why does my combat rifle reload when there's 10 shots left in the magazine
---
Sharing??? Communist spotted on american soil. Maybe people just want to PvP in adventure mode, earn workshop or go take another
---
radium maybe, if its 2*
---
This Mothman truly is the wise one, the Sun after-all is the most glorious lamp in existence.
---
New phone who dis?
---
Nuclear Winter on PC platform is a cheaters paradise according to reports here, I don't use that mode so who knows?
---
I've never noticed cheating on PC adventure beyond 'magic weapons' at the Scorched Beast Queen fight, but that's just taking advantage of an exploitable glitch in weapons not really cheating.
---

fence is ok, as long as she is targetted on a player that is on the ground.
---
If you have carnivore mutation then get some scorchbeast meat. Each one cooked is 500hp with strange in numbers. It saves stims and I find with the extra health regen from Scorchbeast meat that works better than stims and does allow more flexibility in tagging the imposter.
---
yeah after thinking its clear they could just have this game as the only online one especially if they had all the maps like ESO, just have it progressing over time i admit i would love to see another single player RPG like NewVegas with the quality story and the amount of choices and factions but with some CO-OP options or even splitscreen lol.
---
I’m a lvl390, I can handle pretty much any event
---
Clumsy toon.
---
Probably meant the time to get *to* the launch prep stage, bypassing the first few rooms.
---
I do all those events too. And I barely die as well but when there are times when it happens 🤷‍♀️
---
If you want to see REAL shit durability, try auto laser rifle with beam spleater. Shotguns durability is fine tho, explosives is not (maybe you have explosive shotgun)
---
I'd be thrilled if I could make Biv my allie. I love him. I'm sticking grinding out recipes, and love his his happy drunk ass every day. 
---
What if he was a mean drunk? Like, what if insult bot was a lush?
---
Yeah I probably should have been. I’m referring to mostly like big things like god mode and like major exploits. I’ve always know that people dupe. It’s just part of the game at this point for some players.
---
No, they patched that in 20.
---
My carry weight is 525.  No pack rat, strong back or any perk/buff besides level 15 strength and full set of unyielding.  One piece has 90% weight reduction of weapons, one has 90% weight reduction of food/drinks.  I never carry junk.
---
Life is sweet!  Stay Filthy!
---
I'm sorry but I also don't believe they should receive a ban. They have ruined their own camp, it doesn't ruin server stability, it isn't making a god tier ammount of ammo quickly, the only thing it is doing is giving them alot of ammo
---
Yep! It is 80% off, so you only need 100 atoms. It is in the atomic shop "S.P.E.C.I.A.L." category.
---
To bad no AA mags
---
I was drinking and visiting people's camps to shop. Found a camp with Sofia dressed only in her underwear. I jokingly made my character squat down and stare at her crotch because I have the same sense of humor as a 13 year old boy when I'm drinking. I turned the camera around to see the owner of the camp standing right behind me and staring at me. I got up, turned to look at him for a few seconds, he stood still and stared right back, and then I ran away out of the house...and right off a cliff to my death. The owner ended up stealing my junk but I deserved it lmao.
---
Well guess what, it’s not up to you how other people play 🤣
---
I also wish Rosie has way more quests. Way more. Her backstory is pretty bomber too. 
---
For anyone not really following lore, be sure to listen to all holotapes in her area.
---
I'm digging Raider Scrap bot because he has a crush on her. And he wants to burn my camp down.
---
Yeah so people will leave, what’s your point?
---
Thanks very much! I’ve wanted this for ages!
---
Bethesda support claimed that they have solved the issue and during today all “lost” Atoms will be given back to the players... we’ll see this evening
---
I got 50+ from scorched enemies. But first, you need to find a bugged ultracite ore. Then spam that mine button so there will be an endless scorched enemies coming.
---
Nope. It's just the Big Game Hunter set
---
Dude I was playing a lvl 7 with a machete. He was level 57 with a deathclaw gauntlet. That PvP session would not be fun for me.
---
Yeah a ban would be too much I agree. If it's something they can do, just remove it from player camps and give a penalty slap at most.
---
I drop my nukes so she has to be fought there. A lot of other players do as well. If she’s ever out of bounds, fast travel near her location once or twice and her body spawns next to you. Easy, 100% workaround.
---
You say that but I haven't seen the fish lamp or cat topiary in a loooong time. Plus the Thanksgiving display. Wish I didnt have to wait another 3 or 4 months for a chance at that
---
You can't actually give away the chinese stealth armor even if you wanted to.
---
So cool
---
The game warns you when u go to claim. Just saying. I’ve done + would do the same thing if don’t know u. 😂😂😂😂
---
I wouldn’t skip a heartbeat ordering one.
---
Not sure either. A few weeks back someone on here mentioned the stealth mechanics with some items are broken and leather works best. I prefer combat armour cuz it looks bad ass when heavy and liked it since Fallout 4, but there is an issue with sneak I've noticed anyways. Switched back to leather and I'm a ghost again. It's odd.
---
Ok, well can u help?
---
It's totally **not** the same experience. Character building (which includes gear hunting!) is a big part of any MMORPG so having challenges that match your gear will give you a way more interesting progression.
---
Well obviously you can't!
---
So basically the writing for this post mimics the writing for hit song "Stan" by Eminem, which is the song that crazy fans of stuff like Kpop use to call themselves now. 
---
"Kpop stans, rock stans" etc etc but Stan literally means Stalker Fan, and the entire song is basically rapped from the perspective of a stalker fan writing to eminem about shit he's going through and his obsession over him, and Eminem doesn't respond till it's too late, but you can't hold it against yourself because sometimes you can't help people who are off the wall mentally like that. 
---
Anyway it's damn good from a lyrical perspective. Let me post the lyrics that this is a reference to.
---
&gt;Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
---
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
---
It's been six months, and still no word—I don't deserve it?
---
I know you got my last two letters
---
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
---
"Oh fuck where did all these fusion cores come from?"
---
-me that one time i found i had 20 unexplained fusion cores on me
---
Yeah, I have the exact same entire armor set with mods and dying is such a rare occurrence for me. It might be you bud, just pop a Med-X and Stimpack often.
---
There's no incentive for "sharing" and many players prioritize killing enemies and completing objectives as quickly and efficiently as possible over improving the experience of some random player. Bethesda are ultimately at fault for this behaviour having a negative impact on some players gameplay, not the players themselves. There's no reason a player should have to gimp themselves inorder to make everyone else happy. It doesn't make anyone "scummy" just because they have a min-maxed build that they refuse to tone down during events. You should be directing your anger at Bethesda for punishing players that don't also choose to play this way.
---
Thanks! I did not know. I love the ammo machine btw.
---
Well Bethesda said they patched god mode about a week ago but who knows
---
I’m only level 17 in NW, but I’ve only seen a script kiddie there three times. So either I’m lucky, or people like to overexaggerate.
---
How about actually start playing the game instead of begging for free goodies? 😜
---
How black? Like it sent source to other monitor or it's  still active but no picture ( backlight active )? 
---
Other thing could be resolution/refresh rate that's out of display range, or some driver issues. 
---
Hope you'll sort it out!
---
I could imagine a Duchess’ Dram and Nukashine combo/cocktail quest or something.
---
A cat is a good one, these level 1 animals seem to be really rare compared to the deathclaw and sloth.
---
NG+ with only resetting quests would be great. Losing plans and recipes would be a nightmare though, and I wouldn’t trust it to work in the first 3 months.
---
Yea theirs alot of smaller things they could do to make this game and the servers run more efficently. Like crafting/cooking multiples of an item. You got 50 meals to cook that's 50 requests to the server, when it could just be 1. 
---
Optimization and stability doesn't seem to be a priority though, sadly.
---
That's your problem. The others are there.
---
You probably mean 20% weight reduction on those armor pieces.
---
Stay Filthy? I used to wear clean Asylum Worker outfits for the daily level-up challenge, thank you very much! (No seriously, r/fo76FilthyCasuals is actually a very nice place, but I can't claim to be of of them.)
---
Eh k
---
So yep I'm just not that observant and missed it 😋
---
(looks at savage divide)
---
yes, but you're not going to like it
---
So i found a trap canp once where you get stuck in a room with an electric chair and a sign that says "have a seat". I just fast travelled to the camp and got out for free. The reaction of the owner just sprinting away felt appropriate
---
I can't recall exactly. Sometime last year i think.
---
Yeah was stuck between the forklift and wall today. If keep running in the same direction it does unstick
---
Are you having a stroke???
---
Oof, Atom forbid it’s twice the challenges. I know it most definitely isn’t that case but man would that stink to put it lightly.
---
Queen,player shops (there's some people that sells cheep)  , I find a descent amount blindly running around the swamp and the reddish area in the map.
---
Yes!!
---
Riding shotgun, the burrows I’ll get around 1 in 3/4 runs. West tek if you are a tuned build, awol armaments, those are the best ones off the top of my head
---
i think its cause im fresh into 76, its just occupying my mind, dont get me wrong i love the past games. ive gen up spent a good fraction of my childhood in those games.
---
A little bit
---
I came prepared
---
I mean it’s likely. You should be around 30 by I know I think, or 40. I’m not really sure
---
Damn autocorrect fucked me up, or a virus
---
Alright thank you!
---
Metro is awesome i wonder if theirs a Reddit page for Metro.
---
There is r/Metro
---
I always tell people weekends don't really exist anymore.
---
How many FU uses?
---
I think you mean only the Fixer. Combat rifle has a plethora of skins that need to be shared with the Fixer.
---
I’ve stopped as I have about my next weeks worth of scrip lol, but sometimes I drop like 10-20 stars when I just can’t carry them
---
&gt;with the exact mods and paints 
---
Well.. No, that's odd. You do get an entire Ultracite set during the main quest though.
---
A ban for using this "exploit" would be dumb on Bethesda's part. It is their fault for not making sure these resource centers could be blueprinted and set down. No different than if they had a unique item in a different workshop and you blueprinted it to take it as decoration. The ammo being involved in this exploit makes people biased. We suffer from all the bug problems in this game, a simple blueprinted item is nothing like duping a weapon that to longer exists in the game for being overpowered. Once the ammo converter is fixed and this exploit is gone all will be happy again :)
---
Awesome dude I’m glad to hear! I didn’t have calibrated shocks for my x-01 but there’s a lot of players in game who do modding of power armor pieces for a fee, there’s a few discord’s you can join and all you do is trade them the pieces and they add the parts on, then you pay them in caps.
---
You made me chuckle.
---
Just play the damn game instead of begging in the most pathetic way possible.
---
(flying camouflage sheepsquatsch (with player name) drop kicks me across map, then breaks my camp using only a protest sign with Todd's face on it)
---
Nah, mostly pvp god-mode and super aim (i.e. across map and through walls, etc)...
---
Eh ok
---
True, haven’t ever seen stable flux (plenty of inert flux weirdly) in a player vendor. And I vendor shop a lot.
---
The server would explode trying to craft everything with super duper involved.
---
Well, some things can be expensive, such as reactors and decontamiation showers
---
Sadly, this box knows no such mercy. The only way out was sheer luck or damage. And that was temporary, since my teammate got stuck immediately after.
---
Bethesda low key haunting players into buying FO1st 😅
---
(points at savage divide)
---
here.
---
"where?"
---
"the whole place?"
---
yes, follow the traintracks south.
---
"no i want a specific place, like a building, or a lookout tower"
---
no.
---
"i hate you"
---
"... "
---
Lol you replied to the wrong post friend
---
I don't disagree with you, but Rose is a much more contentious character than Biv. While Biv may not be universally loved, he is generally pretty positively viewed by the play base. Rose's popularity in the other hand seems split fifty-fifty. I can see a lot of players complaining about having to do anything else for her. I'd personally enjoy more content surrounding her but I can understand why that's less likely to happen than you or I would hope.
---
Very strange, but what the hell i'll try it
---
No.
---
It's not black as if my display is off, it's black as in the backlight is on, but the whole screen is displaying a black color. I'm currently running my display at 1080p@300hz. I'm thinking that the higher refresh rate may be the issue, I'm currently reinstalling this game again and then I will test it on 240hz, then 120hz if that doesn't work.
---
They need to add repeatables for events, daily missions, killing certain enemies, crafting certain amount of chems, etc.
---
45 is where you should be at in order to finish in time. But don't worry too much, just level as much as you can normally. Dont buy ranks till the last few days, if needed
---
They want to start a rap battle
---
Nope. Bethesda account is ingame. Its different to your steam account.
---
And a large majority of players use Bethesda launcher and not steam, so there's no hope in hell.
---
That’s the thing, it’s an idea/theory/conspiracy even. There is no definite proof that such patterns always exist.
---
Hahaha 🤔🤣🤣🤣
---
In most events can't collaborate 20 players.
---
oh, the helmet is a lie...
---
... i'm joking, but also i hope i'm joking
---
So I tried out what you and /u/eshowers suggested, but sadly it didn't work out. The recorder wasn't on the device and I have it on me so I can't retrieve it again.
---
Nice going, there. My stealth rifle character is weird, I'm a Junkie's/Bloodied hybrid usually at ~19% or ~39% HP but it's real easy to switch. [What can I say?](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8f/22/39/8f2239510b4d664ffdde48fd3628e467.gif)

Faint noises coming from east

I am literally seething!
---
I'm on Xbox. Where would be a good spot to search with pharma farma
---
Agreed, but as waster said. Matchmaking would take a very long time. The playerbase is already very small as it is, it wouldn't be sustainable to split it further at the moment (unless solo mode gave interested to a large number of players not already playing NW, or it came out free!)
---
It's been reported, I've seen a lot of people mention it.
---
Whitesprings was always a good place for me
---
I’ve heard a few theories that they will do BOS first and then once they finish that maybe working towards the enclave or cultist. These are just theories though but this would be the best way to keep people playing is slowly adding in a small story here and there.
---
Yeah, I get that. Some folks don't like raiders. I've never heard anyone have anything but love for her, but that's the folks I run with. We all chose raider, not because we are dicks, but Ward is a lazy dick that makes you kill people for crap he doesn't even need. 
---
And Page is just....a giant yawn.
---
If its not in the description it dose not come with the bundle.
---
I’m not sure. I looked it up, there’s a guy claiming if you pursue support enough they will reset the quest for you entirely. 
---
Did you try the other fix? Walking in and out and repeatedly trying to talk? People said it took upwards of 5 minutes, but multiple people said it worked, so worth bringing up again.
---
I have about 150 hours and have only encountered a rad storm twice. So, kinda rare I guess
---
lol dunno how that happened.
---
Neat pic dude
---
seen people finish it already, legit, just people cranking out levels all day everyday
---
She's a robosexual, don't kinkshame her

Idk why the downvotes lmao. On my feed the post directly above this one is what you were referring to so I just found it funny ;p

Hey man I'm sorry to bother you again but i just had a few questions? How did you do queen runs with an archer? Like did you keep the crossbow during the runs or switch to something else and also how did it face up in pvp? Just curious
---
Yes you need to get kicked in the nuts by Todd our saviour
---
If that happens, usually I go to Adventure mode first then try joining the Nuclear Winter again.
---
that was one of the things I was really looking forward to!
---
How overpowered do u want to be!!!
---
You on ps4 think I was on that server but was playing my alt and he has no radiation protection so couldn't go have a look
---
You just reminded me of my deathclaw that died out of nowhere, i still miss greg
---
Really? I just the cage, am I where I should be?
---
it had concept art, it was never "made" or "removed" from the game.
---
Lol I can't agree with you more about the Settlers. Doesn't help they pretty much set up just a little further up the neighborhood from me and act like they own the whole place now. I can at least see where the Raiders are coming from with that attitude, but these Settlers are just over here Manifesting Destiny and acting like I should be cool with it.
---
Also don't get me wrong, a lot of people do like her, but I've noticed that for every post talking about how great she is there's at least one complaining about how annoying she and her quest are. Some people can't stand her voice or attitude, but hey, I don't think she'd care lol.
---
There was a CM reply on twitter to someone saying it should be craftable, so I'm sure it's just a bug.
---
Its more about your perks than weapons . Dont need a god weapon to 1 shot things
---
So, my initial comment was that they dont take up budget to build, not that they take up budget when you move your camp. As far as me being purposely disingenuous or trolling, im going to have to disagree with you. Are you speaking from personal experience here? Because I just tried it to see if maybe you were right and there was something I was missing, and my stored budget didnt change at all. Which makes sense since they dont cost any budget to build so why would they stored. I had 10 built at my base that I just moved to prove a point lol (I was going to move anyway, so it doesnt really matter)
---
[Pic proof](https://imgur.com/a/BWwv6yZ)
---
TL;DR: Calling bullshit.
---
Because the BoS already had an established presence in Appalachia that went radio silent and that the west coast knew were fighting something big. It makes sense that they’d eventually send someone to at least see if they’re dead or not. 
---
As the the Enclave...I mean they’re kinda all dead. I’m not that well versed on the lore introduced in Fallout 2, but I’m pretty sure they’re kinda just fucking off on the oil rig and waiting for vaults to open so they can have human lab rats.
---
Yep I know. But it also doesn’t take a huge amount to go from a sniper build to a low health bloodied build. Damage increase is massive
---
Cant argue with that point
---
Buffing other builds means that everyone is one-shotting everything, which kind of kills the fun. If everything gets buffed to be in line with the meta builds, then they'd have to turn enemies into giant blobs of HP to add any semblance of "challenge" back into the game. I don't think Bloodied needs to be nerfed, but something needs to wiggle somewhere so that playing in public events isn't ruined by someone deleting the bosses before people have a chance to even draw a bead on them
---
Damn. Wish I could provide them for you.
---
That link moves each day to show you where u should be. Double daily’s coming up so 10 levels from 48-58 should be reasonably easy this weekend with the weekly as well
---
Didnt that patch actually bring back an old method to activate god mode?
---
I may be wrong but you won't be able to access it if you've completed the mission. I know it still works because I just started that quest on another alt. Hope this helps.
---
Great explanation. Also important to note you need 10 raw flux to convert to 1 stable flux.
---
I don’t remember where I am atm for it. 
---
Raider tree is pretty dope tho
---
Seems that I am not killing a lot of humans then 😂
---
Yeah I've looked in Harpers ferry and watoga, it seems easy for everyone to find it but it hasn't spawned for me. I get some weird plans but haven't come across it yet
---
Current atomic shop items for camp skins show in my building menu as static plans but unlearned, I think it’s for advertisement purposes. They still have the locked symbol for me though. Or can you guys freely place them? They wouldn’t flag you for something like this.
---
A non legendary dragon can still be found in game. Legendarys ones are legacy though
---
How much fertilizer can it store before you have to loot it?  With the Large Water Purifier even though it says 60 Purified Water per hour, there is no way that anyone will get 60 per hour with standard gameplay since it requires looting it every 5 minutes.
---
Not fucked at all, just zero out your atoms on the bethesda client on anything you want, or save them for later. Install the steam version of the game and uninstall the bethesda client version (you don't need it, you can add bSteamEnabled=0 (1 enables steam again or just remove it) to your Fallout76custom.ini file under documents and it'll let you play through the regular client. Do this if you want to spend the atoms later. 
---
Fallout 1st only applies to the client you purchased it under. Unlocks purchased on either client will be available to both clients. Your season progress doesn't change between the two clients.
---
They tend to appear more time based, just Bush wookie for a bit, a lot appear when the circle is fairly smaller, also as long as you get a hit in it counts so let the firestorm kill that grafton first ;)
---
You can get back in if you still have the veil. Sometimes it glitches and locks you out. Reloading the game usually fixes it. That’s been my experience anyway.
---
At least once a week I do a HUGE check of everything, random power armors I dont remember accumulating, explosives like mini nukes and missiles. Theres also random bags of spoiled meat veg etc all over the wasteland from me hahaha
---
I am speaking from personal experience. A buddy and I tried out placing some on alts. Because they place weird, I placed a good amount down trying to get them in the place I wanted because my camp is built around having an extractor but I don't have one at my current location. This involved placing one down, backing out of the build menu and seeing if it was in the right place. 
---
After many times trying/failing to place it where it needed to go, my budget was maxed out, despite the ammo factory being the only thing I was placing. 
---
I deleted *EVERYTHING* in my camp, and 18% of my stored budget is eaten up with invisible factories. They take up space, and people should know that before they try and place some down. I'll add my own picture evidence when I get around to logging in.
---
Just go to west-tek alone, there are 2-3 legendaries there most of the time.
---
Thank you for sharing this. My sides hurt from laughing!
---
Wait there's a skin for one?
---
In today's Atom shop update
---
At L218, Ive found the wetsuit plan twice.
---
Once about L55 at an radio bunker near galaria mall, and copy 2 was yesterday at top of the world
---
Nice one!
---
"... we shall see what Todd allows..."
---
(sad wooby noise)
---
&gt; Spawn a couple guards
---
how?
---
Non-legendary ones yes. The legendaries are removed from the loot table and they are kegacy now (no matter hkw crap roll they have).
---
This was about dupers?
---
nope. it's a sheepsquatch skull and horns, a cooking station, a lamp, and a chair. I Accidentally purchased it this morning.  :(
---
press the place camp button, then it moves camp. 
---
"but i want to keep everything"
---
that is not the best way
---
"but..."
---
As Mr crabs would say "Money"
---
YES YES YES YES YES

It’s the lyrics to a song about a crazed fan that obsessively writes the artist insane ramblings and takes personal offense to there not being any response, getting more unhinged and possessive with each subsequent letter. Eventually ends up driving off a bridge in a fit of suicidal rage, for it to turn out that the letters had not arrived.
---
When Eminem finally gets one and writes his response he slowly realizes the person he’s writing to is the guy on the news.
---
Incredible music video, and the song itself got lots of accolades.
---
It’s called “Stan”.
---
I rank up by hiding and watching my teammates back as best as I can. I just can't handle the guilt from letting my teammates die.
---
Killed by other player always feels bad at first, but overtime you'll get used to it. Win or die trying.
---
I’m a firm believer that ESO is not a real TES game. It’s a different game entirely with an Elder Scroll theme. That’s my opinion.
---
However, I really feel like FO76 is a true Fallout game. It has the majority of the elements and new ones that really make the game enjoyable (til you do everything and there is nothing else to do-_-) but despite its shortcomings it is a decent game and really has that Bethesda feel, unlike ESO (I understand that BGS didn’t develop it, but it’s still labeled as a TES game)
---
Imma just tell you straight up, that moving your camp and blueprinting your base is 99% a lie. Try and rebuild in the new place and have fun. 
---
Good luck.
---
Awesome!
---
I heard that due to how Resistances work, T65 is not worth the grind unless you are going for its look.
---
Hey would you mind breaking down your Int sources for me? I thought I had everything covered but the most I got was the mid to high 50's. I'm curious what I missed out on :)
---
I noticed that 4 is super clunky compared to how streamlined 76 is. 76 might have issues, but the engine upgrade really makes a big difference
---
"Box Social" gets a new routine

---
I've found more legendaries just roaming the roads. Also, is not guaranteed but normally there's a legendary in the workshop's "Defend..." events. And of course, any event in the Savage Divide, Cranberry bog and the Mire.
---
In a two hours legendary hunting session I normally get my 150 scrip. Plus a few legendaries for the next day.
---
I think you just need explore more and less fast travel in order to spawn more enemies. For example this is one of my routes... I'll go to Huntersville, after clear the town I go up to the hill near of the fast travel point (the road passing a iron fence). To the right there are a clear zone in the forest just a few steps from the road where some enemies will spawn, but you need be cautious because there are mines nearby. After that you can find another spawn point following the road in the hill. And some enemies spawn in the top also. There's a rad zone after that where more enemies will spawn. Is normal that the enemies of the last three zones get together. I think I normally get two legendaries to this point. But there're more! Returning to Huntersville you can now follow the road to below Devil's backbone. There are a spawn point previous reach the concrete bridge. And then we can go to Riper Alley, Wes Tek (probably cleared in a public server), and the Freak Show. Passing The Freak Show you will get to a radioactive crater (similar to the one in the top of the Huntersville's hill) where more enemies will spawn.
---
There are dozens of routes like this.
---
Yeah holiday ones would be an expected annual gig.
---
Todd's Toxic Revengers?...
---
Wow! Thank you!
---
I’ve described it to my 68 year old mother (I’m 39) as a “relaxing hike through the woods simulator, with the occasional monster you have to fight.”
---
I think it has to do with the super relaxing ambient (non radio) music of the wasteland. I agree with you and I love it too.
---
Yeah, that is not working. Some asshead tried that with me. He was mad about his fail :)
---
Speaking of which, I would enjoy new radio music
---
I think that armor is ugly as sin honestly.  
---
Power armor that specializes in mad high rad resistance and offers a bonus to nuked flora though, man I am all in for that.
---
use mic to activate "throat-nuke" in the fus-ro-dah skyrim style
---
Can't you just reject the quest and start it over?
---
There is the original quest line, there is Wastelanders quest line at least on the Raiders side, and then some good events/dailies.
---
Cop a Squatter is usually a challenge for me.
---
Enclave likes to send me there from time to time.
---
Monster Mash is excellent when it finally fires.
---
I feel like I’ve been sent there for other quest related reasons too.
---
You are bloodied by chance? You have to pay the price for being op.

No, just every Ally.  It is the difference between getting the awesome Lover's Embrace perk and getting the meh You Slept Near Someone Who Thinks Like You perk.

Workshops are pvp zones, it says so on the big yellow box when you claim it. If you want to take workshops: always stay crouched, stay out of public teams and move on as fast as possible. Also: Always Stash your Junk.

I had an issue halfway through the quest where I took the elevator thing and was locked out. I was too close to the grid when I equipped the veil..... I walked back to the elevator and then walked back to the grid and it fixed itself. There's a proximity thing going on.
---
Worst case, You may have to leave and come back with it already equipped to fix it, but should just have to step a good distance away and then walk back towards the grid.
---
Logged on the morning after, only wearing a tin foil hat and fashionable glasses. I have no idea what went down that night..
---
I ended up dropping the stealth factor from my unarmed build. I’ll never look back. But if you enjoy it enough to live with it, pick up a gatling laser, preferably a junkies ultracite. I keep one to get my damage off on sbq in case she doesn’t land. if you haven’t tried your build without stealth, give it a try, it’s incredible. 
---
Side note, how do you deal with sbq fight? I never got that far with stealthed build. Do you still stay stealthed when meleeing her or does she turn on you anyway?
---
I think the hackers are rare. But a lot of people like exaggerating it.
---
Sounds like way too much work. Why not just go to 76 entrance or the farm nearby. Good to know tho
---
I guess I thought it was general communication, make sense
---
What's the deal with making a post and then deleting your account?
---
hahaha. I had to look it up. Nice reference. Now I'm gonna have rewatch a childhood favorite movie!
---
Two reasons for me: That first wave of glowing wolves has a good chance of killing at least one of the Brahmin unless you're bringing top DPS and get lucky with finding and killing them before they can do too much damage. And then there's the chance of two Sheepsquatches at the end, again increasing the odds of Brahmin getting killed and thus lowering the chances of getting any of the desirable rewards.
---
lol!
---
The only thing you missed out on was unyielding double dipping then -))
---
Again, I have never seen them take up any budget while building, even after [building](https://imgur.com/a/5x0FNG9) ~60 at a work shop. And my stored budget clearly did not go up when I moved my camp which had 10. So im not sure what were doing differently, but im not trolling or anything, this has been my experience with it. IDK why yours are taking up budget, but mine and my friends are not.
---
You can try to ask a refund. They will pay back your atoms and you can keep the items.
---
Just do not overuse this, or they will ignore you.
---
I think Watoga would make a great map.

It's hourly

Got any evidence to back up this ridiculous claim?

There is a bait grenade that lures them down. You get the recipe from Rose's quests
---
Ok but then don't complain about how the game has issues and why Bethesda doesn't fix them.
---
For some reason I’m unable to create a group. But I can join one. So eventually when I become the leader of the group, I change it away from intelligence.

My preferred bonus is luck. It’s a very unsung SPECIAL stat.

Okay 👌

Nice catch!

Dragon may have high damage, but the reload speed hinders the DPS so much.

I started playing it on PC recently and just reached level 50 yesterday. The community has been really great. People always there for events and I haven't seen any cheating or griefing yet. Vendor prices are fair for the most part.

There was one guy who was dressed like a Nazi and asked me if I was a Nazi because of my outfit. When I said no he tried to convince me to become a Nazi. Then he said he wouldn't buy from me if I wasn't a Nazi and started to leave, but them came back and said "never mind free market and all", then called me a noob and ran away when I didn't have anything he wanted since I just had free food, water, and junk for other noobs.

Oh yeah, mouse aiming was funky at first. [I had to disable the in game v-sync by editing an ini file](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9wy70q/psa_how_to_disable_vsync_in_fallout_76/) then use Nvidia profile inspector to apply v-sync through that. Playing in borderless window also had problems until I disabled the v-sync and used nvidias v-sync instead. I went from 25 fps to like 50-60 after fixing the v-sync and it made mouse aiming feel like any other fps.
---
They also try to trap high levels by being super annoying and following you everywhere shooting you. If you finally get sick enough to turn off pacifist, they have their whole team come in to hit back. I just server hop if someone's being a jackass, but I do like the idea of ruining their camp next time they follow my around shooting me for not buying stuff. Wtf. I can't help that you sell crap.
---
You need to learn how to store less.  There is no storing more. Unless you have fo1st .
---
There's 5 now. Is something happening?
---
HAHAHHAHA you actually duped on your main account without VPN? What an idiot. And now you whine you got banned? HAHAHAHAHAHA
---
This. Plus it would keep people playing. Some days I only log in to scrip, collect my 200 buillion, which at lvl 325 doesn't take long if I get lucky in SBQ/events,  dailies then log off to play something else. You'd think they would want players spending more time in game... 🙄
---
If you have recently started playing fo76 then you probably have a bunch of challenges that reward atoms. You will need those.
---

---
Are you on PC, perchance? I have a T-60 or Ultracite set that could use a jetpack... lol
---
Ooohh, that's sharp! Looking good TC!
---
yeah only way for more storage is the scrap box which holds unlimited junk
---
Tbh I've stopped cap pinching a long time ago but useful tip for newer players
---
yeah the blueprint of your whole camp 99.999999% of the time will not work, I reccomend building an entirely new camp, I have always loved building in any game so this has never been a problem for me, but if it is for you I suggest sticking to bare bones camp builds if you plan on not making that spot permanent
---
Proof positive the devs don't play the game because this is so stupid.
---
Thank you Just_Inspired you just inspired me to try this 😁
---
Don't call them morons when they do what is rationally the optimal thing for them to do. XP is the hottest commodity right now due to the way Bethesda chose to structure the Legendary Run. And you get way, way more XP for killing the waves of ghouls in the time that you would need to gather your share of ore, than you get back from the increased reward levels. So unless you want the rad suit or rad barrel badly enough to forgo a huge chunk of XP, farming XP is the thing to do at this event. And yeah, I badly want that rad barrel, so I'm rather unhappy about this situation as well.
---
TL;DR: Don't blame the people who are doing what's best for them. Blame Bethesda for their shitty game design and utter lack of understanding incentives other than time gating and FOMO.
---
I do it every time it pops up and if it drops something decent I do it up and drop it to a low level
---
If you're gonna give em ideas, give em ideas we can ALL benefit from
---
I have The Dragon for sale for 40 caps in my vendor. Just picked it up yesterday or the day before. My guess is it didn't get removed.
---
No idea how wrong you were
---
Thanks....I'd been looking for the white ones. Duh.
---
lol would not be hard to find dead bodies around Appalachia
---
You're welcome!
---
I haven’t done the vault run yet, but I claimed the first x25 bullion reward in the legendary run... at first it showed as adding 25 bullion in my pip boy but then today I logged in and my pip boy said 0 bullion. So, I hope it’s just a mistake and I didn’t actually lose it...
---
Yeah I hadn't heard about that, that's great :D
---
Don’t feel too bad, at least 10 people discovered this tonight alone, myself included. I was fortunate enough to have my gf beside me in the silo or I would have alt+f4 as well. I’ve read so many posts about this tonight for some reason :p
---
The weapon is still available in the game. How exactly is offering a skin for a weapon in the game proof positive that the devs don't play the game?
---
Normal people don't drag corpses back to their homes to hang from meathooks or put their heads on spikes.
---
Stop looking for excuses for them. They're psychopaths.
---
Started crying because I saw a dead settler on a road
---
Yeah but most of my weapons do too (and im not bloodied/junkie) except for some heavy weapons.
---
No legendary option other than the rare legacy, trash weapon overall.  
---
People who find one use it for 5 minutes, realize it trash, sell it or scrap it then move on.  
---
I would love to see the sales of the skin and see how low they will be.
---
Honestly, I used to troll all of Whitesprings on a regular basis for these. There are quite a few spawns around the various buildings, although "with rads" is always up to chance. These days I let the Fasnacht Collectron do the work for me. The only reason I use exclusively that setting.
---
Make a mule character, get him some weapon weight reduction armour, take all the weight reduction perks. You can easily store 100+ weapons.
---
You can get plasma grenade plan for 100 coins and IT might sell for few thousand caps as IT is very rare plan.
---
Nuked flora and rad fluids-meat, so you can craft more flux, since you are scientist
---
You may need [Mappalachia](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmwpx9/mappalachia_my_project_which_can_automatically/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
Ohh, I didn't know he'd collect that; thanks
---
Im sitting here with ton of drags (around 500 of stims and radaways) and all the time i have chem reduction perk. Once i take it off i jump from 300 to around 1200 weight.
---
Don’t forget tank killer.
---
Try 10 to 50k a shot high damage to my knowledge no rfle comes close
---
It turns to nothing.
---
It gonna have some problems with super-duper im sure, but still i would like to have that option
---
Herbivore mutation does that? Man i was reluctant from using it but now it seems like must gave. How it affects canned food? Are things like salisbury steaks, dog cans, can from mama dolche event not working for you?
---
The Shadowed mod was broken for a really long time on anything but leather armor. With the latest patch it now finally seems to work on all armor where it is available. (The Shrouded mod for wood armor is still broken.)
---
From what I've heard the cards are character locked
---
Nice. It's gone from completing every daily/weekly and still needing some extra from xp to only needing every daily/weekly to now being able to completely ignore all the NW challenges and *still* make it with plenty of time to spare.
---
Isn’t the “Mystery Meat Pie” one of those Gourmand recipes though?
---
I've lost legacy to servers dying.
---
I mean, it was terrible legacy. Level 40 Mutant Slayer Explosive gat plas. never feels good though
---
What I’ve learned after countless scrips:
---
1: good stuff do drop, but not at the time I want it. 
---
2: the ‘seed’ theory is very real. I built five characters and one of them keeps getting fixers, one of them keeps getting heavy weapons, way beyond random chance
---
3: save the good ones you don’t need *now*, because very possible when you want to try a different play style you’ll be looking for them again.
---
Ok?
---
I would say the latest dupe glitch was a pretty big deal. It allegedly has thousands of players suspended/banned. Any outfit or weapon was susceptible and the dupe was supposedly easy to accomplish.
---
*mic drop*
---
I wish they could make Biv a Collectron skin. He could collect booze for your camp....
---
Once I couldn’t figure out where all my weight was going, I was even doing the unyielding trick every time I played which got me to 500 pounds of carry weight and I was still on the edge of being over encumbered.
---
Turns out I was carrying 300 pounds of lead ore. Apparently there was a few nights where I did a run of Lucky Hole Mine and I just said “F*ck it I’m tired, I’ll smelt all this shite tomorrow.” And then I forgot about it...
---
Now I’m currently having the same issue but it’s not ore ammo or chem related and I have no idea where the weight is coming from.
---
not generally due to sun perks
---
That just what happens. No more score. No atoms. Its nothing once you finish
---
Oh ok thanks
---
Legendary Perks System Refresher
---
If you weren’t familiar with Legendary Perks from the last PTS, or just want a refresher, here are some details on how this system works:
---
Legendary Perks are new high-level Perk Cards you can access via the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. Menu, and you can equip them to add even more power to your character builds.
---
You will be able to unlock your first Legendary Perk slot at level 50, and new ones at certain level milestones after that: 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, and 300. 
---
Your characters who are already high-level will immediately have access to one Legendary Perk Slot for each of the above leveling milestones they've reached. 
---
For example, a level 250 character will have access to 5 Legendary Perk slots, with the ability to open a sixth slot at level 300. 
---
Each Legendary Perk has 4 Ranks, and you can use new “Perk Coins” to rank them up. 
---
Earn Perk Coins by scrapping your unused normal Perk Cards. 
---
Legendary Perk slots are account-wide, so create new characters, assign Perks to those available slots, and share your feedback on how the early game now feels for experienced players experimenting with new alts.
---
You don’t change your whole build to the weapon, you just carry it around and bust it out when you need to tag things. Most people carry reduced carry weight teslas for tagging. If you want everyone who’s bloodied in the game to change their play style for you instead of adapting your play style I’ve got some bad news.
---
Nah, I only a lvl 210 and I have to plenty of legendaries, scrip is annoying but so what
---
Old Possum sounds like a barleywine to me.
---
You have many options, distributed between what you have on yourself, what is in your CAMP, as well as properties of items, and properties of your armor. Oh, and you also have chems and food that can help. You can also experiment with bloodied builds.
---
At CAMP, all you can do is to add scrapbox from Fo1st. That will cost money but will be a good way to solve the problem with infinite junk.
---
On yourself - this depends on your perks (there are lots of them, but you can't use all of them): weight reduction perks for heavy weapons, pistols, melee weapons. Weight reduction perks for chems (travelling pharmacy), food and water (thru-hiker). Weight reduction perks for ammo - ordnance express for heavy, ballistic thing for ballistic, batteries thing for energy weapons. There is the same one for junk. There is also "strong back". Also every 1 point in Strength gives you +5 in storage.
---
Now, items themselves can have a wonderful property (legendary one) called 90% weight reduction. This applies both to armor and weapons.
---
Armor stuff (including backpacks). You can use armor that makes stuff you hoard weight less. The best I found was one that gives you 20% less of weapon weights. It helps tremendously. Imagine having 4 pieces of it, and 5th being focused on something else. It's quite neat. There are other weight reduction legendary properties - e.g., 20% off ammo weight, 20% of food, water, and chems (this is a neat thing). Obviously, you can also use your PA. When stuff is super heavy I sometimes shift to my Excavator PA that itself gives 100+ storage bonus, and 100+ more through calibrated shocks, and 10+ more through motion-assisted servos in the chest. For that though you'll have to rebalance your Perks as backpacks won't work in PA. Obviously normal non-PA armor bonuses won't work, too, so if you're reliant on weapon weight reduction perks of your non-PA armor, and have a lot weapons on yourself, then even Excavator PA with calibrated shocks and motion-assisted servos won't really help. 
---
Backpacks also deserve your attention. You have to go through the Order of Tadpole quest lines to get a normal backpack - it can give you 60+ storage space. Then you can either continue Possum Badges quest to get high-capacity (total of 120+ storage space, at the cost of DR and ER) mod, or you can grow your reputation with raiders and settlers to get their backpack mods (for chems and for food-weight respectively). 
---
When all of these options are used, you can also use the power of chems and food items to increase your carry capacity. I prefer to hunt for radstags and eating them. They give 20+ carry weight for 30 min. To simplify the process I've added grilled radstags to my shortcut menu to button "0". It makes my life way simpler. Every 30 min I eat a new grilled radstag and have my 20+ all the time. Other food items can also give carry weight bonus, but I think only grilled radtoad legs give you 20+ carry weight. Others give 5+ or 10+. Chems are a bit different and can make you addicted to them. Of them I usually prefer to drink Whiskey as it gives 10+ carry weight (most of the other drinks give you 5+ carry weight, not 10+). There's also a less common drink that you need to get a recipe by either buying it from people vendors, or as the result of a quest from Biv that gives you 50+ carry weight for 1 minute (but then removes 50 carry weight for another minute) - that's super useful when you want to just bring everything to your CAMP and then slowly process the stuff (e.g., dismantle junk, weapons, etc.). I don't have it yet so I didn't try this option.
---
Final option is bloodied builds. When you combine them with your Unyielded legendary armor you can increase your strength to high levels (yesterday I had 28 Strength, and that's without one of the Unyielding pieces). 
---
That's I think is about it. Use combinations of all of these opportunities, scrap and sell stuff you don't need, and you're good to go. Sadly, it's not a local running game so you have to balance things out.
---
 Not sure, but it sure sounds like it!
---
Tried changing power settings to high performance in windows and NVIDIA ?
---
Make sure game is running in full-screen mode not windowed.
---
Is your stash full?
---
I'm lucky if I get 1 fml
---
I'm sitting on 800 lol I can't get rid of them 20 a day just doesn't make a dent there should be no limits of you have grinded enough scrip caps or gold then why punish us for playing
---
Thanks very much for the info :)
---
Anyone can post and image about that?
---
Oak Holler lager. Sounds like a beer that would be perfect in the late afternoon watching the sunset.
---
Sadly... this week atomic shop stuff is complete garbage (IMHO).
---
Sometimes it's 1 or even none, but most of the time I've seen at least 2 there.
---
&gt; Took a break and played other games with zero issues, only 76.
---
This is so true that it hurts.. 😔
---
“Ah... today's a beautiful day. The floors are green, the walls are blue, and the sky is shining like the sun.”
---
Uranium fever
---
I say it would depend on you build. Some weapon types use/need more AP than others.
---
What a nice shot.
---
I guess I haven’t seen it in a while
---
How? I've been doing all the dailies ( minus "Level up!" Except for here and there) and all the weekly and I'm only lvl 42.
---
[Legendary modules](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Legendary_module) from Purveyor Murmrgh weigh 0.25 each and show up under your Misc tab. While the daily limits may create good reasons to be storing these for future use if you're still saving toward the plans with which you'll be using them, at least move them into your Stash instead of lugging them around in your personal inventory. You can transfer them between your own inventory and your Stash, but they are avatar-specific, and cannot be stored on an alt or otherwise transferred.
---
One time I went to this CAMP and I was searching all over for the vending machines. The CAMP's owner was watching me the entire time and so I did the ??? emote and he motioned me over.
---
He was pointing me towards a very narrow, hidden tunnel. My heart was racing as I carefully crept along the path, bought some stuff, and got out of there.
---
It ended up being nothing to worry about but that couldn't have been good for business if no one can even find it.
---
This is still happening.  I was at an even tjust now and more than 4 were opened.  I am getting no XP buff at all.
---
I use a b2525 fixer. Bloodied commando in full Unyielding. It would be nice to ditch action girl and only use grim reaper's sprint
---
My rx580 does as well. I have to wear headphones because it's so loud. I don't toy with the settings, because it looks beautiful and I still get close to 60fps, and the temp never goes past 70. I just chalk it up to being a graphically intense game (I've voiced my displeasure at thr console version many a times). In fallout 4, I have to tone down the God rays to otherwise get ultra settings; maybe that'd help with the gpu load.
---
Right? 76 players in a foot race be like “Why didn’t the winner slow down so we could have all tied!?”
---
I enjoy the prohibition vibe his current residence has with the whole college kids making illegal alcohol "lore" thing.
---
We should help out the newer players
---
I got the same issue, and they just replied that they are overwhelmed during the COVID period. :/
---
Really? I have one, holy crap, never knew I was lugging around a legacy gun, I feel special now :3
---
not really a new. was in shop previously. but nice  reference
---
Does that mean my Two Shot Dragon is worth a good bit now?
---
They are the least sought after legacy mind you. But still a legacy
---
Haha that explains it. Thanks very much.
---
Yeah, for the Relish? That works since Patch 20. 
---
You can still satisfy hunger from eating canned and meat-types of food. But the bonus for veggie-based food is just so good, and you only need to make a few for hours of play. 
---
You could flip this around, though, because Carnivore (mutually exclusive to Herbivore) also benefits from the 2x bonus. Tasty Squirrel Stew would probably be your best bet.
---
&gt; can from mama dolche event
---
I tend to only do Feed the People when I need to do an event for some challenge, ha. I might have one or two Canned Meat Stews on me as a non-spoiling back-up, but really I'm a Cranberry Relish snob. ;)
---
Quick guide on how to make Cranberry Relish easily: go find some Gourds at Raleigh Clay's Bunker, plant them in your camp. You'll thank yourself later. Anyway, when you have the Gourds available to you, farm Cranberries with the perk card Green Thumb on at, say, Aaronholt Homestead, for example. Collect Snaptail Reed in the river near Flatwoods to make Sugar. Now you have all ingredients, so providing you have some Boiled Water and Wood, go ahead and craft!
---
Well, it is a legacy, but I doubt it can step up to an explosive gatling plasma in terms of price.
---
Since the Handmade already has 7 or 8 skins already, id say make it only avaivable for the combat rifle and fixer.
---
The combat rifle only has two skins, Halloween and dark matter. Which for a rifle commonly used is not a lot.
---
I'm a heavy gun guy and I can see far more potential for me never having to run out of ammo.  Cuz me n da boyz cravin moar dakka.
---
What do you consider a solo build? 
---
Anyways here's the list and you decide for yourself: 
---
- **Ammo Factory** - produce 50%/75%/100%/150% more rounds when crafting ammo. Yes it does stack with Ammosmith and Super Duper.
---
   - **Funky Duds**- +50/+100/+150/+200 poison resist when wearing matching armour or power armor
---
   - **Blood Sacrifice** - When you die, teammates gain +25/+30/+35/+40 DR and heal 40/50/60/70 HP over 8/10/12/14 seconds
---
   - **Brawling Chemist** - generate 1/1/1/2 combat enhancing chem every 60/50/40/40. Up to a max of 3/4/5/5.
---
   - **Hack and Slash** - 20%/30%/40%/50% chance for melee VATS to do area damage
---
   - **Collateral Damage** - enemies killed with melee have 10%/13%/16%/20% chance to explode
---
   - **Detonation Contagion** - enemies killed by thrown explosives have 20%/30%/40%/50% chance to explode
---
   - **Electric Absorption** - 10%/13%/16%/20% chance energy attacks recharge your power armor's fusion core.
---
   - **Exploding Palm** - While unarmed, 5%/10%/15%/20% chance of triggering an explosion on attack hits.
---
   - **Far Flung Fireworks** - Enemies killed with a ranged weapon have a 10%/13%/16%/20% chance to explode
---
   - **Sizzling Style** - +50/+100/+150/+200 fire damage resist when wearing matching armour or power armor

---
   - **What Rads?** - +50/+75/+100/+300 rad resist, restore 1/2/3/6 rads per second.
---
Dumbest thing is when a Scorchbeast decides to attack my camp and I gotta fix the whole damn thing, even the interiors! The swooping attack is just the absolute worst. I thought Project: Clean Appalachia was getting rid of these buggers!
---
Also it can only hold 10 fertilizer.
---
Wha ...? \*mindblown\*
---
Dragons
---
Rippers
---
Explosive energy
---
Any weapon with the double effect
---
Explosive harpoons
---
Ultracite/raider pa limbs with jetpacks on them
---
No head sledge hammers
---
No blade combat knifes
---
Named survival weapons (kinda legacy)
---
Those are the ones that come to mind
---
the plan was duped when presents were, its not worth too much
---
Fair enough. I havent done it myself for a while because I havent needed to and I like to leave it for lower players. It makes sense though that it might be gaining in popularity with the grind. The icon seems to stay up for ages on the map though for me
---
It's a game lighten tf up...
---
I have some in my vender on pc
---
Combat camera lmao
---
Add bSteamEnabled=0 (1 enables steam again or just remove it) to your Fallout76custom.ini under documents.
---
If your account is linked, it should work, otherwise you'll have to wait for a response to your ticket.
---
Survival weapons? The ripper is a legacy? Huh. Ultracite can't have jetpacks?
---
~*Sadder auto grenade launcher noises*~
---
A legendary ripper is legacy. Not a standered one.
---
Survival mode gave named weapons, like the unstoppable monster. It was a death claw gauntlet bloodied 40 pa damage 40 less dmg while pa I believe. Hence why they are kinda legacy. The named version is no longer obtainable but the rolls are
---
Ultracite can have jetpacks. But for a long time you could put the jet pack on a limb. Instead of just the chest piece. So my strangler heart set (that uses ultracite mods) has a jet pack on the arm. Giving me a free chest space
---
Biv is still the best part of the game for me I love the guy.
---
PS4 is usually pretty good for me too.
---
There were challenges when survival mode was around that awarded named items with set stats on them, some were good, most were bad but you can't get them anymore, so they're legacy. 
---
The ripper along with the dragon only dropped as a legendary from the raid, so any legendary ripper or dragon is a legacy, no matter how crappy it is. 
---
Ultracite and raider power armor had a bug where you could attached the jetpack to every single piece. Placing a jetpack on the armor or head would free up the chest for emergency protocols or something else.
---
* hick *
---
Probably could call it the Grafton Monster armor in 76 since it does look headless.
---
Ah okay, I donked up, I had 2 unstoppable monsters and scripted 1, along with a lot of the other repeat ones, not a lot of stash space to carry dupes. And I didn't have another character at the time. So I have all the survival weapons except the very 1st one the grenade launcher 2 star. Huh, Bethesda sure likes messing with the games economy a lot.
---
It’s probably those 40mm grenades you’re using now
---
The survival weapons, while technically legacy, really arnt highly valued. Certainly not more then the unnamed counter parts with the same rolls. So it's not a giant deal that you scripped them
---
Is that safe? I've heard of mass ban waves for people who so much as sneezed on the software. I can unlink it on the Bethesda net but I don't wanna end up doing that for them to turn around an say they need it linked to fix the issue.
---
Was a bit tipsy playing and sold my one legacy explosive harpoon gun for 25k caps. I needed the caps and yet.........that was a one-of-kind gun man.
---
Implying the 1st model is even necessary for the stuff we have. So many people forget Fallout 1st was never mentioned in the pitch for this game or the deal we all signed when a lot of us paid full price for it. You fell for the marketing excuses just so Bethesda could add another layer of monetization on the price of entry.
---
So that's a holotape I'm sending you, I hope you hear it...
---
Just to add some info for yourself. Dragons and rippers could be world drops before the pervayor was introduced. After she came to town they could only be acquired from the 3* chest at the end of the raid, dead in the water. Once that was removed they became true legacys
---
dunno why you got downvoted for spitting facts, but that's reddit community i guess...
---
All i know is there are certain people who played this game too much when it launched to get all the legacy weapons and dupe them. Then again its also Bethesda's fault. All will be fixed when the weapon level cap increases from 45/50 to something like 70/75.
---
You won't be banned for ini tweaks, that'd be pretty damn stupid on their part. All it does is play through the regular client, it doesn't change anything else and you can remove it to enable steam again.
---
Right now, getting a bloodied gun is a bonus for me lol. I have so much shit that out of PA i can carry more than being in one thanks to the backpack mod, radicool and 1 2* unyielding with 25 rad resist heavy combat armor leg among others.
---
Then you will be fine without the perk. The gun is vats reduced. Unyielding is a massive boost as well. Just mod the armor to ultra light, get shielded raider underpants and lone wanderer + nerd rage. There are sooo many ways to boost AP.
---
Are you kidding me? this is a terrible idea.
---
It's funny to see all comments of people having no issue with NW challenges get downvoted. It's almost as if all this thread wanted was to be an echo chamber for "*NW bad*".
---
Now i do like the NW challenges so i expect to be downvoted too and btw it only took me a single match. So it's only like 20mins at most (granted you make it to the end) not spent in adventure mode, you'll live.
---
Cool I’ll give it a Try.
---
I think it's a bug, try restarting the game.
---
Would you mind explaining how exactly?
---
r/TodayILearned
---
What the hell? What a dumbass he was selling that!! So many people would’ve treasured that and he goes and sells it. Fail
---
Nah those 200 grenades only weigh me down by 50 pounds. My weight should be somewhere around 300 pounds but I’m around 500.
---
"Settlers are such dicks, I hate them.'
---
"Raiders literally rape and murder."
---
"It's just a game, lighten up!"
---
Yeah, you don't sound like a moron at all.
---
This is pretty awful
---
It means guns you use literally break 50% slower. It doesn't matter if you craft or found them.
---
But we've had all DLC for free so far, surely that can't go on forever unless there are people that support the game by subscribing to 1st?
---
The game is perfectly playable with the daily limits, were all used to it by now. Removing the limits would be a slight convenience for those that with to support the game a little more.
---
thats bad.
---
They literally break slower, so you need to have the perk equipped during combat.
---
Do you think they would?
---
Fair enough. My build is well tuned, but I was hoping to clear out some room for agility perks, so it seems like with one more AP regen piece, I'll have 3 perk slots available
---
Yeah I remember posting that comment, I swear to god I was on the right thread when I did it, I prob hit back and didn't even notice it XD
---
Yeah, my temp is fine also. Hmm, well I guess it be that way. Thanks.
---
That sucks. They shot themselves in the foot with that one, at least when it was atoms it was a reason to log in each day.
---
When I logged in today the ones from lvl up auto completed, but gave me the points anyway! Dont know why?
---
It is.
---
Yeah, sadly.
---
It wasn't intended. When it will be fixed is anyone's guess.
---
Welcome to the dome of hell
---
Bunkers ok, i think. It's getting on the fences and nearby survival tents that really mess her up.
---
Are you on PC, PS or XBox? If on PC, I might stop by later...
---
thank you :).... bloody buggery Bethesda bugs
---
didn't work but thx anyway
---
Yes, Fallout 76 is pretty awful isn't it?
---
If it's over really quick you don't get the mobs sometimes I will launch a nuke in my server with no intention of killing the queen, she lands all the time spawning all the mobs it's 30 mins of chaos, it rains exp 👍
---
You have to have it equipped. You want weapon artisan, that can be equipped before repairing to let you repair it to 200% durability, then you can remove it.
---
This sounds like the single best way to destroy the game. Flat out. If you want this game to die, I can hardly think of a better way then this. If you don't want someone scripting your legendary don't sell it. Forcing people to use legendaries just to satisfy the work put in getting it is stupid. You got your worth out of it when sold and they got it when purchased. If they want to buy your legendary you spend twenty hours hinting for and instantly throw it down a fissure that is a 1000x better use of it then what you suggest.
---
Yeah sorry but this is not only unnecessary but also pretty stupid
---
I think Bethesda is very carefull with their choice in pictures and composition, also I think some of hers might be before wastelanders, plus she has a lot of filters going on.
---
Even with that, if you notice the new atom shop pictures you can sometimes see on those that Bethesda has the exact seem problems with the shine/gloss.
---
They're literally losing money by it being so buggy, no matter what I tried I couldn't buy the pack with Pipers coat and hat...didn't even show up in any way shape or form.
---
Hope this works.
---

---
It punishes people for playing the game, sucks the fun out of it, and a discourages people from playing the game. Sorry farming caps are a much more legit way to okay the game then your toxic idea of how to play it.
---
I have this regularly if my CAMP couldn't be placed and I need to insta switch servers again. In a private server the symbols for the Workshops are there, and on regular servers sometimes if I can stay on the first map after starting the game.
---
A short while ago (maybe a couple of days?) Bethesda acknowledged this here on Reddit as a bug and that they look into it.
---
Not quite, got about 2 pounds of space.
---
It’s steam so PC- I’ve had a similar issue. All my earned challenges atoms go away after a moment. I assume it’s because Beth.net atoms are separate, and it’s not correctly allocating the earned atoms to the steam instance.
---
My ign is the same as my username, Venomousbeetle
---
Edit:
---
Also while I have your eyes, I haven’t been able to find information about if the team is aware of Crash Landing being bugged. Commander Daguerre is not able to talk to advance the quest when returning- I believe this is because the Flight Recorder has disappeared from my inventory. Usually when this happens in a quest, I go back to grab the item but in this case the item isn’t re-attainable at this stage.
---
Wait so there no legendary dragons now?
---
The game is pretty much already dead with its current system. You know it. Bethesda knows it. The only way to revive it is to weed out the players who are intent on destroying it further, by abusing the way it presently works. This is the whole reason why duping keeps coming back and further destroying this game world. It's also the reason Bethesda keeps nurfing, reducing and limiting everything in the game... which has already sucked the fun out of it.
---
By encouraging players to actually play events to unlock benefits, why is that a problem? If you're not playing the events in the game world, then what are you doing?
---
Flatwoods church, the steeple has 3.
---
I never said the first 2 things. Insult me all you want, it has no effect on me nor does it make you right.
---
Sure raiders are not saints and have done terrible things but, i know this may sound surreal... at the end of day, these events never actually happened. It's a game no one is hurt.
---
So i say again lighten up don't take fictional events that seriously.
---
It honestly seems like Bethesda wants you to spend 1/3 of your play time pushing the A button (Xbox).
---
There's no punishment here. There's rewards here. You're simply looking at what you want to see. By actually using the weapons and armor that you buy and by ranking them up, you gain even better damage potential than you currently have. That's WAY better than what you get with a stock legendary weapon or armor set today. There's way more on the upside than on the downside here.
---
My gf, who runs 0 unyielding compared to my 5/5, gained two levels on me over the course of dxp event. She runs 3 points in inspirational compared to my 2 points. That 5% bonus is consistently beating my set. 
---
Side note, even though I have BiS rolls, I actually took a huge hit to my dps/QoL by switching to bloodied, and the fun factor is doing a mediocre job at keeping me interested.
---
But then they won’t be able to sell us all those totally not overpriced and useless atom shop bundles with each new content release! We can’t have that!
---
I don't know. Maybe if Fo 1st subscriber ask for it. Sure as hell they don't implement things based on this subreddit 🤣😭.  
---
Maybe they could do significantly cheaper repair costs when you reach NG+. That sounds more like them.
---
And if Beth announced it was focusing on bugs and nothing else you can guarantee the very next day the other half of the player community (and likely many of the same people that asked for a bug removal focus) would be making petitions for new content.
---
I think it says more about us that we keep playing/putting up with this stuff...
---
I appreciate the follow up on this issue. Looks like I need to keep an eye out for an email on the atoms reimbursement.
---
You are building a camp, doing the quests, going hunting, having fun
---
 This plan is by far the dumbest thing I have ever heard and does nothing to stop duppers. And why you are upset at people, not appreciation the legendaries they naught from you is just some next level entitled bullshit. Sorry they owe your time and commitment nothing
---
I spend several hours today with friends on a private world running around as union soldiers taking over workshops and just building our camps to be cooler. We did one round of feed the people over those hours and no other event. I think our having fun is a correct way to play this game then your anal-retentive screeching at people for not playing the exact same way you do.
---
been waitin for a reply about not being able to buy gold from Smiley for 3 weeks now lol.
---
There are clear patterns yes. Of course, a video game can't do anything truly randomly and this one is particularly bad at pretending it does
---
Uranium Fever has always been good to me, usually 3 drops per event.
---
If you have a super mutant horde event dont kill the main one. You can farm legendaries off the respawning underlings.
---
Guided meditation is hit or miss for me, but I often get at least 1, if not 3. I occasionally will have zero legendaries, or a teammate will get them.
---
Final stand has a legendary Schored beast if you have multiple people.
---
I know people like Wes tek but it's only one or none for me there. 
---
The arktos lab mission will give you plenty if there are other people there to keep it going.
---
Encrypted has a few but it's a GD blood bath, where a full set of troubleshooters for this.
---
Nothing wrong with role playing as a trader. I love owning a store. Getting new stock and putting other stock out. Why is it my issue if someone buys something from and does what they want with it? If someone paid the caps they can do whatever they want. It’s not like their caps come free. They also have to use ammo and resources to farm those caps
---
Whitesprings has a total of **6** that spawn in and respawn after you breach the 255 item pickup limit. Item spawns are not time-based, you have to collect 255 items to "reset" it.
---
1. On table in the parking lot work area with, first room with the zed.
---
2. On porch near table with bobby pin box in front of one of the many motel-style rooms in a row on the left as you approach whitesprings from the trainstation.
---
3. In two-story historical house, in 2nd room behind the white hamper on the floor, near bed.
---
4. In a box in front of one of the doors that have the hand scanners on the row of motel-rooms.
---
5. Inside the firestation, on a shelf behind the door to the room with a bed.
---
6. Bottom floor of golf club, near locked door next to a jar of spices at the drink counter.
---
Flatwoods church steeple usually has 3.
---
Mosstown house near the fissure usually has 1 - 3 by a skeleton in a bathtub.
---
But what I found the easiest way to farm these is to server hop and check the Whitesprings Trainstation vendor (and if you want to run over and check the inside of Whitesprings shopping with the faction vendors too). But the train station vendor regularly has them for sale 1 to 2 at a time.
---
Here let me help:  money
---
Except every time i roll some legendaries.
---
Bro. The open and then slam shut door bug.  Been forever.
---
For those that have them, can you scrap wetsuits to discover their mods, or do you have to buy plans for the mods?
---
Are you able to explain the wording in the Legendary Ability perk ("can't go over the 15 point cap"). The first part makes it sound like I'd be able to add additional perk cards to a maxed out ability but the last sentence seems to contradict it. Any idea how it actually works?
---
Your preaching to the choir
---
I consider it not playing in a group with lone wanderer equiped at all times but thanks for the list
---
Yep you’re the scum 100%
---
you're\*
---
How about giving Biv an advertising spot on Julie's Appalachia Radio? Hell, I think all the different Factions vendor bots, as well as Graham and Duchess, should have an advert spot on Appalachia Radio.
---
No, please no. As much as I love to see this come true...
---
If they stop adding new content and start repairing the game - &gt; We would have no new content and exact same number of bugs and glitches .
---
Who cares?  Honestly, so frustrating seeing repeats of this post.  Don't play it, you're not missing out on... well, anything.  I'm rank 220+ on NW, got teamed up with a rank 8 guy, who decided to hop on mic and just start cussing me out for playing the NW mode "too much" and it's "people like me" who make Bethesda think it's ok to "force him" to play NW.  I wasn't even on mic myself, just sat there listening to him rant for ten minutes until he eventually got killed, probably because he wasn't concentrating.  Oh and of course, when he killed that was all my fault too.  You all need to get a grip.  
---
Edit: I did enjoy sending a passive-aggressive 'goodbye' emote his way though.
---
It won't stop the dupers from duping, but it will stop the dupers from selling duped weapons and armor without some effort on their part, by far the most commonly duped and sold items. 
---
If you can't quickly sell those items, then there's no reason to dupe them. It won't stop duping of other items like aid and presents and pails, but that's something that Bethesda will need to solve... which they are already doing by making new versions of these items restricted, non-droppable, non-sellable. Pretty soon everything in the game will be restricted to only your player. It's coming.
---
This idea is one of the only ways they can keep the vendor system alive... which is quickly dying to Bethesda's newly restricted and unsellable items.
---
🤢🤢🤮🤮👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻
---
Not sure what to say, thanks I feel pretty silly now.
---
Well look at you being an actual fun person to have in the community unlike some of the people above
---
Not saying I defend their business practices (especially this one in particular) but they bill 2 days before your actual renewal date.  So in your case, your current month subscription ends on the fourth.  If you would have renewed you would have been billed on the second and received atoms/another months benefits on the fourth.  They aren't screwing you here, just telling you you have a subscription until the fourth.
---
I used to have it without stealth all the time, I was past level 100 by the time I rebuilt it for good stealth too. And now it works slightly better thanks to the Chinese stealth armour but I lose out on legendary effects of my armour. Bloodied stealth works out better in my opinion because you get a lot of bonus damage and get hit less often
---
Thanks for that :)
---
Awesome idea. I keep forgetting those grades are a thing now
---
I bought the bundle.
---
The floor is really nice.
---
The head is kinda cheesey and way oversized in my opinion...
---
I put it on my wall for 30 seconds, hated it, and replaced it with my classy deathclaw.
---
The fixer plan only drops from the Encrytpid event
---
Dushine or Nukess Dram?
---
Love your magic dipping resets the rank. If they could do that
---
.... They would just stop the dipping to start with. So no if your stupid and I mean idiotic system happened. Max rank items would be the primary target for dupping. You punish people who play the game for fun in your quest for purity.
---
You have to complete the lying low quest line. There's like 3 quests I think and at the very last one you will summon the sheepsquatch imposter otherwise known as encrypted and upon completion of that event you have a chance at a fixer plan drop. But only if you complete the quests first. You can't just join a friends event and get the reward if you haven't done the quests first
---
Best bet is
---
a.) Bloodied buil = high damage - in return you kill more stuff faster and can tag more stuff during events
---
b.) probably unyielding armor +15 to all stats except Endurance
---
c.) Many perks in Int, as many as you can afford without gimping your damage skills
---
As a result with chems added you can significantly increase the exp per enemy.
---
I watched Battlestation on Twitch the other day, tehy do Lunchbox Parties to get an additional exp Buff from Lunchboxes.
---
If you have enough time to play and stack buffs like this you can advance rather quick.
---
My ticket haven't been replied to for over a week now, not even a single response. 
---
But then I saw BethesdaSupport twitter, lots of people with 2-3 weeks wait time. 
---
I guess im still halfway there till I'm worthy for a reply from the support staff.
---
I guess what he meant was "Let **me** tag them."
---
Haha as much as I'd love to see it I would rather Bethesda commission someone else whose competent to make it. 
---
The history with shoddy merchandise is real. 
---
If Bethesda made it, would probably be advertised as cotton come as asbestos. Be only 4 inches high and carry covid xD
---
The fixer plan drop from the encrypted event. So you can not find it as a spawn. 
---
But you can be lucky to find it in a player vendor. I have seen it two times at 7500 and 6000 caps.
---
You seem like the loser to leave trays and trash on the table at a food place and say the employees will clean it up
---
Still... get off V9 no excuse to be anywhere near V9 during a queen
---
Apparently so, I didn't know this, I just thought it had a low drop rate since I only ever got 1 like ever.
---
No, because you didn't read what I wrote entirely. If a max ranked item is duped and sold, its rank returns to zero for the new buyer. Gold or higher ranked can't be scriped to a vendor, so it must be ranked up again by the new buyer before 1) it can be sold again to another player for listed scrip and 2) before it is again considered max ranked by the currently held player.
---
Max rank is only held by the person who max ranked it. Selling it returns it to zero rank.
---
I wasn't drunk for this one, just tired. That's my excuse and I'm sticking to it.
---
So, I play a stealthy rifleman mostly. This means I spend a lot of my time in the game crouching. Bear this in mind...
---
I was doing the early Settlers quest at the Hornwright Industrial Headquarters. As part of this quest I needed to go up to the top level to get something from a plane hanging from the ceiling (I later learned the quest is completable without doing this, but that's beside the point). So I go up there, kill the high-level assaultron guarding it, and go to the plane. No way to interact with it. I look around for a button to maybe lower it. Can't see a button. I look around for a terminal to open a cargo hatch on the plane or something. Can't see a terminal. I explore the rest of the building and check all the other terminals. Nothing. I kill all the remaining robots, in case this helps somehow. It doesn't. Frustrated, I start sprinting about the building to see if I've missed anything, and suddenly, magically, I find I can interact with the plane.
---
I am not a clever man.
---
I had the gatling gun from those challenges due to a glitch from it as I never played survival. Got it when playing PS4. Started again on xbox and miss that weapon. Though Final Word helps deal with the loss. Lol.
---
Can't remember what the gatling was called now.
---
I guess I have a few weeks left to sit and wait then... rip. Back to ESO for me.
---
You have to buy most of the Wetsuit lining plans, but shielded is a rare drop off Mirelurk Queens, and maybe a few events in the Mire.
---
Edit: you have to buy almost all underarmour mods, besides the Vault Suit ones (Overseers Caches), and Shielded Mods.
---
You mean killing a bloatfly and get shot in the back trying to find it's body?
---
sucks man, im down 900 gold and i bet when they do reply it'll be some bs excuse or that theyve passed it on to the dev team. its a joke.
---
Maybe only the suit comes with the outfit bundle
---
I've been seeing a lot of people talking about finding camps that have used this exploit but i know nothing about the exploit itself. But keeping that in mind i can't help but wonder if this exploit could be used to do the same thing with the fusion core maker from the power plants, I'd rather have one of those at my camp.
---
Dang I and three of my friends run around dressed as union troops using black powdered rifles and was hoping to get some sweet legendary dragons, or just dragons, for a big opening volley punch.
---
Keep it unlocked I can always use more cores 😆
---
I’m level 28 and I’ve seen none, upside to console I guess.
---
No it’s a bit misleading with the picture so I bought it thinking it would come with it, but yeah the description doesn’t actually include it so :(
---
Yeah good idea. I am bloodied unyielding melee build but even I admit it’s too powerful and too far ahead of everything else. I don’t think we should nerf it just buff other builds like berserker.
---
New players don't give a damn about legendaries or checking the map to do that event specifically
---
Most of the bugs are annoying like having to try multiple times to fast travel, but there are some bugs that have been around since launch like 2 years ago that are actually borderline game breaking and they have done absolutely nothing about it (melee attacks not doing any actual health damage about 20% of the time. Guns giving back almost as much health as they take) so what makes you think they would actually fix most of these little bugs?
---
And people will dup it, and find fun ways to transfer it max ranked to everyone and I would reward them for getting around such an abusive system. Why do you hate people who play the game for fun and not work?
---
Resolute Veteran, I miss the fire rate glitch on the galling gun
---
Honestly i would if i had one. But not knowing anything about this exploit means i can't test to see if this could be done.
---
What’s the point of enemies exploding, is it purely visual and no damage boost?
---
There's nothing that's stopping you from selling aid, plans, notes, magazines, scrap, clothing, junk and anything else that's not a legendary item. In fact, there are plenty of very rare plans and clothing items that are equally as rare as most legendary items. You can even sell non-legendary armor and weapons. 
---
Legendaries are a completely different class of item and need to be treated as such by Bethesda for in-game sales. They've already started this with the Purveyor.
---
Yeah we’ll never get that mountain scout mask Lmaoo
---
Best to steer clear of all that just avoid any hassle
---
Got 2 Dragons today. One in westec from A supermutant the other in loot bag Had not seen for months. They must have readded
---
Was my plan but no harm in wondering.
---
How long did It take? I started 4 days ago and i'm lvl score 31... Can i do it if i do farm real hard?
---
I think you’re underestimating the value of a top tier legendary weapon like a bloodied fixer or handmade. People don’t go around just throwing them away or scripping them. Majority of the time it requires another top tier weapon to trade for
---
I would suggest multiplying the SD chance % with the number of items to craft. For each 100 add a free item, with the remainder use it as a % for possibility of one last free item.
---
For example crafting 4 items with a SD chance % of 40, would give a result of 160, so you would get 1 free result, plus a 60% chance of a second free result.
---
A legendary dragon or a normal one
---
I'm not banned or anything but what I like about being a steam customer is I can just cancel in their app and just even stop it in PayPal as well so they can't bill me.
---
Just a price
---
Like it was during steam summer sale
---
I have a fixer plan for sale for 6000 caps
---
I'd say it's pretty decent. It definitely has its hiccups, like any Bethesda game, but I play &amp; stream on a mid tier rig, play on medium so I can play with the least amount of stutters. When not streaming, it actually handles well enough. 
---
I've been a lot more active since The Legendary Run started &amp; people have been cool as hell.
---
Can someone explain follow through? Is it as op as it sounds?
---
I have one more item of the halloween/xmas NW rewards to get so Ive set a target of 1000xp per day so i can get it done hopefully otherwise Id probably not bother. I dont hate NW but Id rather play Adventure. I play it when theres some other kind of limited time bonuses.
---
Oh well. It never hurts to try. The worst that can happen is the game gets more bugged. But hey, judging by how people are reacting to this post, everyone seems to be happy with that.
---
How about the other way.
---
I send me all to foundation don't think killed one yet.
---
Means if you have 15 agility and you use the legendary perk for agility, its not going to increase your agility anymore.  15 is the cap for special points with the exclusion of buffs. They are treating the legendary perk as if you were adding actual levels to the given special and not as a buff such as unyielding ,food, chems etc. They only want you ro be able to equip 15 perk ranks per special.
---
I bought game starting from BETA and it was moved to steam and I may use any of those launchers 
---
But now you will be able to login just through launcher, you used to purchase
---
Normal. They added a skin in the atom shop for it. They will be everywhere now. It is kind of useless due to reload time I do better with a board or boxing glove
---
Nein, es ist eigentlich alles okay. Ich habe Kohle, einen entspannten Job, ein gute Familie. Mich über euch Idioten zu amüsieren, ist nur die Sahne auf dem Eis :D
---
as i do super XP grind in double XP weekend. Its looks like legendary enemie appear after you kill XY regular mobs. So best legendary farming is fast killing a lot of npcs. Any location with a lot of npcs, events or fast relog on location is best.
---
 Ah okay, thanks for explaining, that actually makes sense.
---
Have to take out strength as well or the melee builds would be insane
---
Yeah, nice job making assumptions. You seem like a real mature person. Nice ad hominem by the way.
---
The fact of the matter is the players didn't design the current system where if a player at an event is a min-maxer who doesn't hold back you're punished for not playing the same way. The Fallout devs did. You can cry all you want about players not caring about whether or not you get a hit, but they also don't owe it to you to hold back and save you kills either. 
---
There's no reason you should be punished for not playing the same way I do, and vice versa. If I want to be a super soldier that makes events a breeze I should be allowed to. If you want to take it easier and not be forced into a particular build or having to run-n-gun to earn rewards you should also be allowed to. Bottom line though is it's up to the devs to make the changes that allow all players to play the way they want, not the players. The most we can do is offer suggestions and be vocal about our needs. Hopefully the devs listen and can implement something that benefits both the casual and the hardcore player bases.
---
Seconded! My wife thinks it's adorable!
---
Be careful when you get a visual glitch showing doubles of a lot of your weaps. I just tried to equip one and the game crashed, came back barehanded and the gun gone from my inventory. Friend of mine said he had it, tried to drop one, and game crashed. Came back and the weapon was gone.
---
Yeah I would really love a skin for every weapon
---
Nice one thank you sir!
---
To much work for bethesda 🙄 better add more skins for Fatman or dragon
---
i don't think so.
---
It's not a question of new vs. old character - I've had the same happen the last few days on a character that is more than a year old. I personally suspect it's to do with not doing enough damage to the SBQ or otherwise failing to get enough event participation, since in all cases the SBQ died suspiciously quickly. I assume this was caused by people using either hacked or glitched "magic" weapons.
---
It's on some servers and not on others. I've had it show up intermittently
---
A neat idea that you'd think would be simple to implement, but would add a good deal of extra immersion and flavor to the game. I'd imagine the only issue would be justifying the cost of recording new lines for something small like this, but maybe they could fit it with another major update? Either way I like your thinking.
---
I wanna see a [FO2](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcRxxM75lEY6XV3arc65IQ_TvDYiGfYRGmE_xQ&amp;amp;usqp=CAU) or [New Vegas](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Power_fist_(Fallout:_New_Vegas)) recolour skin for the Power Fist! And a FO3 [Deathclaw Gauntlet](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Deathclaw_gauntlet_(Fallout_3)) skin!
---
😻
---
You'd think some of the most iconic weapons of the Fallout franchise would have their iconic original skins released, wouldn't you? 🤔
---
Yes! Already said same thing. And if we could get **Biv CAMP vendor** it would awesome too.
---
r/UnexpectedEminem
---
Oh yes that 28 degree weekend after Derby really hard killed tons of stuff. Around here it’s usually accepted ok to put out anything after derby which is first Saturday in May.
---
And a recipe for Med-X
---
Yeah I would love a skin for the fixer for example!
---
Short answer: you don't 😂
---
I want it, I’m a hammer swinging power armored alcoholic.
---
Just thought if u buy on steam not sure whether you could join PTS through bethesda launcher
---
Not hard to craft a shitty level 5 or 10 weapon for tagging
---
So how do you balance that out? The significant stat boost for Unyielding is balanced out by having to go low-health and having to invest into all those mutations and defensive perks to build up the survival synergies. The only drawback to Yielding would be the increased use of stimpaks which... sounds insufficient as a drawback seeing as the game is throwing stimpaks at you by the cartload.
---
That was a fun glitch.
---
No keep it. This my stupid high armor (nearly) full vangaurd armored melee character will have a reason to exist.
---
If you get neighborly
---
Go down to the Bog and go to the tunnel entrance for Big Bend. Talk to Vinny, the guy drinking his coffee and wearing a business suit. Ask him to start up a caravan run and he'll start the event if one of the three merchants are around.
---
These devs leave so much easy money on the table.
---
Try to change texture size from ultra to high, they gonna look the same, and shadow distance to lowest setting (its still more than was in fo4)
---
Wah wah baby go cry in you’re crib. Here’s you’re milk you can calm down and it may allow you to grow into a big smart boy but it’s not likely. Here 🍼

Tyvm. Is it every hour on the dot or every hour after the event is done? Does server matter?
---
I once fell into a guy's radiation trap house, instead of warping out when I could I took all my armor off and just stood there spamming rad away and tad X to shame him...
---
And make him waste mats fixing them.
---
I've never had so much fun emoting.
---
Let me put this another way so that you can understand why what I suggest is better than what seems to be coming. The next major weapon to be introduced by Bethesda into FO76 is likely to be instanced, restricted, undroppable, unsellable and limited to only your player... yes, even the non-legendary versions. 
---
Bethesda is already moving in this direction very quickly. It's the only way they have of halting duping. It's already here with the Bow plan which is not droppable, sellable or transferrable in any way. In fact, the Fixer and the Bow could easily become the last sellable legendary weapons that get released into Fallout 76.
---
At least what I propose gives Bethesda an option to retain vending. Unfortunately, Bethesda's recently introduced restriction system doesn't allow for sales or trading at all. Mine is only a suggestion, but it's at least a better option that offers some trading than no trading of weapons at all. Worse, it's only a matter of time before Bethesda chooses to retroactively apply this restriction to newly dropped legendary weapons regardless of type.
---
In fact, it may only take one more instance of major duping before Bethesda rolls out their current no-trading restricted system permanently and across the board.
---
Melee foods stack, also you can nukashine and use brawling armor, talons serum with a power fist and outdmg almost every gun bloodied at full health. Yea some ppl will swap for the extra 80% dmg from the str but it wont be meta (I think). It will only help to increase the builds diversity.
---
Every weapon skin, power armor skin, icon, atoms, armor skin and apparel: Am I a joke to you?
---
Skins for combat rifles fit on the fixer. It's currently bugged like a lot of things but they're working on it i guess
---
I would buy that
---
No its not, without adrenal reaction it still gonna do less damage, and nerd rage. And its all about carry weight
---
This was with ppl duping. Expect the price going up at least 5x after the banwave.
---
Yes I see they are the same model, but I cannot apply the paint to the fixer, I don't see the selection in the crafting menu.
---
It'll be up as long as the merchants are there. If the event hasn't been completed then the merchants will stay there till someone activates the event. Then the next merchants will show up in an hours' time. Server doesn't matter. It really just depends on if people on a server have been doing the event or not.
---
So if players have done the event on server A but players on server B haven't then the event will be available on server B.
---
What? Just because something popped up doesn’t mean they should just say “lol no more nuclear winter”. Also, they are fixing it. They’re making a new anti cheat and are close to banning players like ELF-76 and .Timez(? Don’t know if that’s how you say it).
---
Wrsteck surprised me last night 2 legos outside 3 inside...I never go inside but think I'll start.also killed a few ghouls at the g.c before they woke that I wasn't able to loot
---
I hardly ever see people do it. Time to farm :D
---
Your idea is a lot more thought out than mine. I wrote this a while ago and submitted it via the [Fallout 76 Feedback Form](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/42223/~/where-can-i-provide-feedback-for-fallout-76%3F) and I think you should submit your idea too!
---
So picture this.. when placing your CAMP, your build radius is a square/rectangle. You build your camp, in this rectangular lot as you would normally, but upon re-entering a world it is placed in a Camp Lot. Think of this like a parking spot in a large parking lot, or like an organised caravan park. If you opt-in to the Camp Lots, then upon joining a world your camp is placed in a vacant lot in a kind of.. Settler shanty town!  
---
Join a world, your camp slots in, and you are right in the centre of a new township made by survivors of the wasteland banding together for mutually beneficial trade and commerce. 
---
Imagine no longer having to fast travel and risk being hit with the infamous Infinite Load Screen only to end up at a camp selling common Fasnacht masks and a plan for a damn Chemistry Bench. Imagine being able to simply walk to the camp next door to continue your shopping spree without having to face another loading screen. Imagine signs being useful as more than just pointless decoration! Walk down the strip and look for the signs for what you're after, and stop in for a bit of a browse!
---
In a post-apocalyptic world, survivors would band together for survival, trade, commerce, and the in hopes of prosperity. Especially if you all theoretically spent years living confined to a vault together! You wouldn't run away and and build a McMansion in the middle of nowhere! Now I'm not expecting the New Vegas Strip here.. Just mutually beneficial cohabitation! 
---
I think this adequately tackles the demand for a central trade hub and a common hangout spot to meet other players, and even face-to-face recruitment for the new Public Teams! Meet up in the Town Square, bust out some emotes, have a laugh and group up! I also think that rather than having an "Auction House" or something like that, this allows the possibility of easy trade without losing the fun of all the visitors coming to explore your camp.
---
I think it would have to be opt-in, and maybe on Private Worlds your camp would instead return to where you originally built it.. maybe that could be a mechanic that could be used to add in the **promised** increased camp budget in private worlds for FO1st subscribers 🤔
---
...
---
#tl;dr
---
Slot-in camp shanty town / trade hub that is like a caravan park for camps. Log in and fill a slot, log out and free it up for someone else!
---
Those are incredibly easy, Jesus Christ.
---
this makes me smile, tnx op
---
15 extra strength at high health wouldn’t make melee, which does the most damage by a mile, stupidly overpowered?  Of course it would. With 5 str and no melee perks with Uny armour my DGC does almost 800 damage before the sneak multipliers. It’s nuts.
---
Chameleon on armour is only visual I believe so might as well try to get 5 unyielding pieces
---
Really hope you turn team fill off though, lol.
---
To be fair as to why, you do get that guarantee 3 star raider, but other than that the event is kind of boring solo since the AI director spawns less enemies with just one player attending. The event has more enemy spawns with 3 players or so attending.
---
Saw a guy at whitespring doing the same stuff too
---
Yeah but then they always ignore the caches -_-
---
You literally can breeze through a event without one hitting the legendary you’re an asshole at the end of the day for doing it.
---
I just use full unyielding. Does the job and gets extra benefits. This is why I think some serious rebalancing needs to happen. Unyielding really is far too good compared to other effects.
---
The institute power armor? Could work though considering it never showed up in actual lore
---
happens to me all the time. in 3rd person it looks like I trip up, so now my head canon is that I trip up. a lot.
---
EDIT: Just happened to my character as she was sleeping in her bed. makes sense. sleeping pains, i guess.
---
Seems to be kind of common at the moment. A few days ago I saw someone that hd 10 of them at their CAMP just outside Charleston. Then I've seen a post on here about someone else doing it almost every day since
---
Fuck are you on about? NW is apart of 76, a huge part infact. You get tons of skins and icons for Nw man. Just because you dislike it and think it’s not fallout doesn’t mean it’s some next fallout pinball. It’s of course not fallout, and it’s not the main focus, but’s it is still important. What you’re saying is genuinely stupid.
---
Riding shotgun event, always have 1 guaranteed spawn but you can find more, is easy to solo and easy to farm (manual trigger event and you can server hop to spam more runs).
---
This post right here, couldn’t agree more.
---
Not the first thread like these you’ve tried to justify one hitting either, good one man abusing the flawed system for the sake of being ass no better then the duper’s and xp glitchers
---
Kinda depends on the situation.   If they're in danger of the event failing, I'll shut down the enemies quickly so the event succeeds.  Or if I'm not doing well, cornered, jumped by many enemies and in danger of dying myself.   I don't enjoy the wasted time it takes to get back in the fight.   It's quirky, but it's happened twice.
---
But otherwise, yeah.     :)   It's really great to see reaction change from, "OMG, they're here to take my workshop" or whatever to "they're here to help!"
---
Uh, that's a cool idea as well! Love the idea of having a survivor kind of camp slowly growing somewhere!
---
is a bug, you can save a blueprint of the machine in the workshop and put it in your camp.
---
Just use the full unyielding I've tried all those combos and full uny is better not to much of a sneak difference
---
unyeilding doesnt make bloodied builds stronger, you can play with bolstering and do even better unless you play stealth commando (that's why I think "yielding" shouldn't give agility). it will only balance out the XP gain and carry wight... mainly ppl will need to chose between tankyines or insane dps.
---
also, when i play junkie i actualy use my stimpack instead of trow them for caps of vendors every day.
---
You can make a blueprint of the ammunition factory allowing you to place it at your base and work shops
---
Instead of Lone Wanderer, Lone Warrior.
---
It's funny, cos they're both kinda opposite but also stem from the same idea of a closer community.
---
You should submit your idea!
---
I never picked up the flag one.just have a ton of stuff I don't want and its been showing free for like 3 months
---
Like it, am going to try this for sure.
---
More than likely it is the ongoing social tab bugs/issues. Happens to all of us now and then. Unless you muted these individuals in your social menu there is nothing you did wrong. Reloading the game sometimes helps me.
---
They could barely keep up with bugs they had without them.   Perhaps this is another layer of complexity, which would have only added to problems?
---
Did you play Nuclear Winter mode?
---
You type in bethesda support ticket.
---
Yeah I can imagine its a big need for a lot of players -- the faction hubs for the settlers and raiders are already nice but they lack the life that real players would bring to them (and the life that more npc's doing stuff would bring to them). 
---
I'll submit it after getting some more feedback here, thanks for the advice :) 
---
For your idea the main challenge might be the giant flat area that needs to be placed somewhere :D
---
No problem. Forgot to mention, there will usually be a dead Blue Ridge guy next to each crate as well.
---
What is pts?
---
Also I have been told that the perks is broken right now like adrenaline and a few others after the last patch.  No idea if this is true for sure but I removed the rank 3 version I was using and haven't really noticed a difference.  Kind of leads me to believe it is in fact currently not doing anything.  
---
Anecdotal evidence but may be worth looking into further before wasting points on running it for now.
---
I was happy drunk and gave away almost everything  i own .....came to almost naked except for undies with nothing but .38s
---
😪
---
Fallout lore became a meme sometime after Fallout 4 anyway, so...
---
Full Unyeilding.
---
All of Bethesda merch is commissioned by someone else.
---
But yes, I get your point. The canvas bag was a pretty big f up.
---
I disagree. Given some of the stories that have been posted on this sub about the frankly unhealthy amounts of playing people have been doing to reach level 100 already, I'm glad Bethesda haven't incentivised people to finish the season as early as possible to get more days grinding atoms.
---
Um not this morning, but last night I did.
---
public test server  
---
right now patch 21 is running there
---
Let people do what they want, it doesn't change your life.
---
Based on previous posts, the two are associated. Somehow NW triggers the random bass sound.
---
Wow, thats weird. Ah, it only adds to the gazillion other bugs im currently experiencing with this game.
---
Where do you get the snowballer mod? I really want to try this now
---
I’ve never been able to tame an animal via the regular way (It won’t let me), so this would be great!
---
That would be nice.
---
Word on the street is it takes up massive budget and cant be deleted/scrapped... So if that's true, not sure if it's worth it.
---
Running around with  30.0000€ caps and someone bought my 27.0000€ bloodie 3 star gatling gun from my vendor at the same time... I forgot to remove it.
---
The faschaut collectron also finds them for you.
---
For me, after I exit NW and enter Adventure in the same game session, the bass sound plays every time I get a pop up in the upper left corner. (Legendary enemy has mutated, etc.)
---
There is also another weird noise that plays less consistently when I enter NW now.
---
^Dumdum ^dum ^dumdiddely ^~
---
WestTec I reckon, up to 7 spawns.
---
Even more chance on a private server because more will spawn.
---
It stacks multiplicative, but the returns are actually not diminishing, because armor damage reduction is diminishing in a reverse way.
---
Means, every point of armor you ignore, gives you more "more" damage.
---
example: weapon damage= 100
---
Armor/dealt damage
---
200/38
---
150/43
---
100/50
---
50/64
---
25/83
---
12/99 (one never can deal 100% damage, there is always 1% loss)
---
if i reduce the targets armor by 50%, 200-&gt;100 in the numbers above, i will deal 12 more damage. If i reduce it by another 50%, 100-&gt;50, i additionally deal 14 more and overall 26 more damage. Another 50% and i deal 19 additional and overall 45 more. Conclusion, reducing it once by 50% gives you 30% more damage, reducing it 3 times by 50% gives you double damage.
---
**Rule of thumb: Every additional 50% armor penetration effect increases damage by ~30%, until the damage is 6,6 times bigger than the remaining armor, at this point full penetration is achieved.**
---
Where did you find the cat? I need an animal at my camp like yesterday
---
The problem wasn’t me dying. The problem was the game crashing constantly and not being able to quick save any progress so I had to keep restarting every time the game crashed.
---
Yesterday, I found you. Looks spooky :)
---
I encounter rad storms quite a lot, they’re a impressive site. 
---
I sometimes equip my storm chaser perk cards when this is happening. You can also use this card in the rain.
---
That's why a lot of people use the pacifist mode
---
Hard doubt. You share that clip here
---
Its not the same session or anything for me though. I hadnt played NW since last night. 
---
Such a weird bug.
---
Honestly, stuff like this is one of the main ways that false information gets shared.
---
"I dreamed I lost all my atoms"
---
Before you know it, people start saying "yeah, I lost all my atoms due to that well-known glitch"
---
This. The added Agility basically makes up for the missing stealth bonus from the legendary armor effects, and you get all the other stat bonuses as well.
---
Damn, I didn’t really know about that
---
IIRC one person had been playing 18 hours a day, seven days a week, to reach level 100. If they could keep unlocking atoms from the repeatable XP score weekly then there's a fair chance they'd keep playing 18 hour days, for the whole 10 weeks of the season. No game company should ever be encouraging that sort of behaviour.
---
I have not done the queen run with an arher yet and I do not pvp.  But I would always keep some kind of back up other than the cross bow, pistol or shot gun
---
Neat. Will probably Do that once the instanced Base/Camp stuff is implemented. Simply Not enough Budget 😥
---
Was this confirmed somewhere?
---
I have done that because I got irradiated by a ghoul making me too bloodied(making me do more damage than intended) now I just bash the legendary in the head before calling people over.
---
If you're on Xbox i can help grind the event, my guy's a tank for that
---
Post on Reddit, Bethesda replied to it
---
I have workshop symbols on my map?
---
Yeah.  All I want is that duck lamp, but not paying 1200 atoms for it.
---
I got three from the steeple; the only vendor in all of Whitesprings to have any was the train station - he had one. I ended up with 23 total after a couple hours. 14 were the non radiation kind, so useless. Do more spawn in Watoga than Whitesprings? Seems like I've seen them there a lot too, but I'm not sure if that's random or not.
---
The cap for any base SPECIAL stat is 15 points you can go over that with buff of course but as far as Perks go you can only ever equip 15 points worth of Perks in any SPECIAL stat for example I have Heavy Gunner (3), Expert Heavy Gunner (3), Master Heavy Gunner (3), Traveling Pharmacy (3), and Blocker (3).
---
I wouldn't be able to use the Strength Legendary Ability and push my Base 15 Strength to 20 to Equip even more Strength Perks. 
---
However what I can do is lower my Strength to 10 and push is back to 15 with Strength Legendary Ability and that would leave me with 5 free SPECIAL Points I can use wherever I want. Another example is that I currently have 6 Charisma but I plan to lower it to 1 and push it back to 6 points with Charisma Legendary Ability which would give me another 5 free SPECIAL Points I can use wherever I want.
---
Not sure everyone knows how to
---
More carry weight and melee damage, more VATS accuracy, more health and disease resistance, better barter rates, better condition on crafted gear, more XP, more stealthiness, more  VATS crits and better condition on found gear. Oh, and all the speech checks.
---
But yeah, otherwise Unyielding doesn't make bloodied builds stronger...
---
And Bolstering doesn't just suck compared to that, it even loses out defensively against the mob-type specific 15% damage reductions.
---
Not surprised tbh.
---
Just ashame because it ruins the game experience.
---
If a player attacks another player.
---
Said player should not be allowed to go in to pacifist mode.
---
The attacked player should be allowed to get retribution.
---
Instead these Cheats are exploiting Pacifist and Ignore modes.
---
A player attacks and kills a player yet he gets to block and ignore the player he attacked and killed bwhaaaaaaaaa.
---
Thanks. I got three after killing the captain but not opening the gate. And then it apparently has a timer and failed me for taking too long. Be nice if there were a countdown for that like every other times thing.
---
The only thing u could argue to use as a sneak bloodied is Chinese stealth, as I've noticed a difference in sneak then as ur always invisible crouching, but then ur extremely squishy just depends what ur going for ig
---
It says how to at the bottom of the screen when on your perks
---
Its just one of those things with the player base. I think some do it just to do it. I'll jump on mic and ask that they participate but I get silence. 
---
I just jump around team to team and hope I find one that everyone is sharing.
---
I think as this matures there is less reason not to have a card shared. Meaning my Lone Wanderer has been retired. I have Strange In Numbers permanently shared since you should be joining a team (even solo) as soon as you log in.
---
You do blast damage to surrounding enemies at the price of potentially scattering bodies and items alike ....maybe? I haven't seen the perk in action yet so I'm not really sure if it scatters anything like I'm assuming it does
---
I figured it wasn't time based anymore, but the 255 limit is interesting. Like... any thing? Silverware and hangers and flowers? (Oh my!)
---
Steam has achievements and more social functionality through the launcher. Beth launcher has the public test server available.
---
To idiots using punji board stacks:
---
Git gud.  Your ego says your a "master troll" but your skills say you are hot garbage.  Get original and creative scrubs.
---
I just wanted you to answer so I could give you another upvote.
---
I finished it last night, and yeah, it took waaaay longer then anticipated tbh.
---
I’ve had this bug without playing NW too. It usually happens when I interact with something, I noticed it most whenever I gathered wood, picked berries and converted ammo.
---
I think you likely are misunderstanding. When you cancel your subscription you still get to use the service for the rest of the month. I doubt you’ll get charged again.
---
Edit: lmao on your reason for canceling. Lighting looks much better on Xbox after wastelanders but even if it looked worse, what a funny reason to cancel and/or quit.
---
Yeah. It's not super user friendly though. You'd be surprised how many people don't know.
---
Inspiring.. I'll do it!
---
Or even there is a feud between the two and maybe during the quest you have to side with one of them over the other, with Biv obviously being the innocent/good intentioned one
---
And thats nowadays mentality. Because few bloodied players act like a spoiled brats, all bloodied players deserve to suffer.
---
You can hear people on mics? I only ever see the mic symbol flash up. Dialled ‘chat’ volume right up but even then, at best, it’s a very faint voice in the background.
---
Cool. I have a full set of T-65 with Emergency Protocols but haven't really used it yet. Good to know.
---
This is correct
---
&gt;	You may cancel your membership at any time. Any cancellation will be effective at the end of your then-current membership term.
---
Whenever I get a bloodied drop from some legendary in the world I immediately go to the rusty pick, just the other day I got a bloodied 40% power attack +1 strength deathclaw gauntlet and a vampires ss power fist back to back, made me not hate mumbles so much  getting my 2 new favorite weapons. Congrats on those awesome rolls, cheers
---
It does exactly what it implies.
---
Let's say you a max out Following Through perk card and you Sneak Attack an enemy and it does X amount of Damage but the enemy didn't die so you Follow Through with more Sneak Attack shots to try and kill that enemy and you will be doing an extra damage 40% damage for the next 10 seconds to that same enemy you shoot.
---
Pretty bold to assume I was banned for duping..
---
Yeah I was banned for duping.
---
Wait a second...  does a fridge actually help preserve food?
---
Yeah it is. Bought a troubleshooter’s explosive one from a vendor back in the day. Totally unviable, simply because it breaks so fast, but fucc me if that thing isn’t fun to play around with 👌
---
With the nighthawk skin available now, they really need to put it back into the loot pool. And make em drop as quad as well while they’re at it.
---
Oh right I see what you're saying now. Well i don't think the repeatable should reward atoms beyond the season then. But they should add something for players once they finish with the season.
---
I share.  I've never seen a card by my name, so I'm not sure it's showing up on screen.  Keep that in mind before you bail...
---
I think they will deliver, I will not give up the subscription mainly because of grinding, if i need literally anything from.lead to steel to acid and back, i just hop in to.my pvt world and I am full of this junk in 10', on public there is always a fucker that is either cleaning westek, the lead and other good places, i think only with public servers you would die from lack of needed junk, i tested this
---
All buildings have crap like this. I want to put a wallpaper down and it bugs into the wrong side and then just looks crap. I have fun doing the camp but not when it’s so buggy.
---
The peninentary is acutally pretty easy once you Figure out how to get through it quickly.... but until then... Yea good riddance 😂
---
Oh okay thank you!
---
Been like this randomly for me since patch 20. I can't really see a pattern when or not it shows the wrong icons. Really annoying since I have mistakenly started contesting other peoples workshops, not being able to see the status of the workshop and the cost of traveling to it. How does Bethesda manage to break more than they fix with their patches?
---
I had played FO4 for half an hour, wondering why there are no players / camps in the world. I realized my mistake when pop up reminded me of another settlement needed my help. :D
---
That's fair. It is the repeatable that would really cause the problem.
---
People may want to temper their expectations on that one. We have no real idea when data-mined stuff is due to land. It could very well be soon, but IIRC some data-mined skins from over a year ago still have yet to appear.
---
In case anyone sees this and is having the same issue you simply have to completely close the game and reopen the game to fix the issue.
---
🤞
---
You don’t need to blueprint to move your camp. It automatically will move everything to storage and create multiple blueprints of your structures. Actually placing things may be a challenge though so you may need to break up those stores blueprints. Everything will be under the stored tab when you move.
---
There are work arounds, but people shouldn't need to use them in order to play the game.
---
Raise a ticket, highlight all the problems you .mentioned and say you want a refund, they will give you atoms back and let you keep it.
---
If enough people are getting refunded they will loose money.
---
If you’re lucky, ore at the fissure site prime will be glitched and you can mine it infinitely and get unlimited mats from the scorched that spawn
---
Wren/Rocksy at the crater and ward at foundation missions provide treasury notes. All public events with ! Provide them too.  Also if you have the caps then buying them once a week from smiley at wayward is worth it.
---
Yep, that's how I roll too. I'll sometimes 'port to a downed character (trying to get that scout badge), but they're always either dead or already healed by the time I get there.
---
To separate you from your bullion.

Not dumb! Go to IMGUR and upload a picture there, and then copy and paste the URL to a new post here. Only new posts will show the image, not comments. Comments only show the URL

That's it? Lol
---
Not everyone has 3 charisma.
---
Thanks for all the responses, I know what I'm doing when I get home.
---
Never said it was.
---
But why should I? 
---
Just to be nice to random strangers?
---
I’m not obligated to let some random person hit something.
---
I don’t get mad or upset if I don’t his something.
---
It’s a game.
---
They’ll live.
---
You need to deal a certain amount of damage to the queen to get the event rewards. 1500 or so.
---
You can buy the shocks from the bot down at the amusement park. South West Ash heap.
---
I've managed to get by with only 6 INT, been relying mostly on the XP and INT buffs for being in a team, and it can get pretty high even before using lunchbox bonuses. I'm Usually at 40+ INT fully buffed, with an extra +15%XP for Inspirational 3 and +25%XP for tasty squirrel stew.
---
Just hit rank 60 today.
---
I run bloody, but i absolutely love trap camps. Well made, creative traps. Not random stacked boards.
---
Yeah, let's compare exploiting and cheating to playing the game using 100% legitimate mechanics just because you don't like it. Grow up. End of the day it's a game and you're throwing a tantrum because people aren't playing by your definition of what's fair. Sorry you don't like the rules, but complaining about the players for playing by them and not the creators when by your own admission it's a "flawed system" is about as asinine as it gets. 
---
I don't want to have to gimp myself or wait around for everyone to get their shot on an enemy to kill it. It's boring, unengaging, and unintuitive. I'm not about to do it just because it makes some random player feel better at the end of the day when its going to cost me my own enjoyment. Instead I'll support changes that allow me to play the way I want without fucking over players like you. Call me an asshole, but I just want to play the game the way I want, just like you want to play the game your way.
---
Are you going to try and argue that making the game better for everyone isn't a good thing? Because then you're pretty much saying your a selfish a-holes who only cares about themselves, which I'm guessing is what you think of me.
---
Edit: Btw you either have a great memory or you did some serious digging through my comment history. Because I was curious, I had to skim through multiple pages, and go more then 2 months back to find anything close to me defending one-shotting enemies. And even then I was in support of changes to improve the game for players like you so I don't know what your problem is.
---
Great.. Now the youtubers will make videos about disappearing atoms!
---
And dont forget to do the s.c.o.r.e challanges ! They also reward boullions sometimes
---
Thanks so much for the fast response! I wasn’t sure if the wastelanders daily quests are ones that you see under data but that’s good to know! Best get on the grind to get me some good armour :)
---
Main things I want are this and the fireplace door. Can you place more then 1 down? I have a farmer character that would be pretty cool for my camp
---
ah I didn’t realise this! More reason to get them completed!
---
Nice idea. They should add also simple colors, like blu, red, green, yellow ecc.
---
I share Strange in Numbers and I have occasionally un-shared it when in a team with just one other player with no cards on the table. If   &gt;L100 then they really should know by now, or at least be questioning why I have the little yellow card on the team graphics. If &lt;L10s can do it then why not experienced players far, far past the noob  stage?
---
Its a little bit fun, part educational, maybe even petty annoyance, but I like to think they notice a mysterious small drop in stats as I go to xp bonus mode only.
---
Its bizarre that there are level 400+ players who still dont know this
---
... and not everyone with 3-5 Charisma has a 1\* perk card equipped.
---
Well your flashligt is brigther, but yeah, thats it 😅😂
---
The whole area needs to be designated a no build zone by Bethesda.
---
Is a shame because at launch, some players would build a camp at the event which had loads of turrets and fortifications which would help keep the mobs under control.
---
Now people hide on tents in power armour, it looks stupid.
---
You get x4 more ore from ore deposits (mining resources on the ground where you can put down a resource machine don't count). Hydraulic Bracers only increase Unarmed Damage which makes this one of the worst mods on a Power Armor considering you can't use Unarmed Weapons while inside a Power Armor.
---
You can buy the plans your looking for from the Responders Vendor in Whitesprings if you got the caps to spare.
---
I remember giving one away to a low-ish level guy once. You didn’t get yours from a pirate looking guy near Harpers Ferry, did you? 🤔
---
I don't know what's up with radstroms in Fallout 4 and 76 (and regular storms in Skyrim), but they always scare me on some primitive human level. I always get this nagging urge to seek shelter and wait it out. Fighting the Queen in this environment would be quite an experience to me...
---
Mire, divide and forest for me. 
---
Not a fan of ash heap, valley or the bog
---
They are also available from the Responders vendor bot in the Whitespring mall (first shop on the left when you enter the Whitespring mall from the main entry).
---
Damnit
---
what the other guy said, also dont forget Riding Shotgun - it doesnt pop up by itself so you have to trigger it manually. Its easy to do even by yourself. Rad Rumble, Scorched Earth and Encryptid awards 4 notes. The other events rewards 3 or 2 notes. But basically join an event group and do all that pops up.
---
That's what I currently do now. Unyielding 20% HP, but I haven't touched any of my Bloodied melee or heavy guns in ages. Only time I've had to pull out the ol' Bloodied Gatling Plasma was I forgot to top up my ultracite fusion cores for my JFFR Primed Ultracite Gat Laser.
---
It’s a status piece, likely something to buy after all the other important stuff has been bought. It says “look at me, i had Bullion to waste on a cosmetic”
---
We're you looking at the terminal screen, or the ammo container on the side? There are 2 lockable components, likely he had the terminal locked and the container left open.
---
I don't even waste my time with these people anymore.  They are only looking to grief someone who they no is not kitted out for pvp, it just makes them feel better about them selves.  Sad!
---
Anything over 350 DR/ER/RR has diminishing returns of protection. After you hit those levels, your going to want to get damage mitigation perks and armor in order to properly tank. And not to mention, the Tesla arcs are broken as shit and do more damage when shooting the ground then with direct hits. 
---
As someone who takes PvP in this game somewhat seriously, your best off just avoiding it all together at this point. There's just so many bugs/glitches/exploits surrounding it, and the community as well as Bethesda won't address any of the issues. Its heartbreaking watching the PvP in this game slowly die because its not being given any attention.
---
I 'm bloody and never found a trap camp, I must be unlucky
---
I have all the level 50 gear. And I give it away for free.
---
Whenever people beg instead of playing the game I feel like I owe them something...
---
Pm me.
---
🤣
---
got a workaround for the wire issue? because that‘s what‘s hitting me hardest. can‘t use it as a vendor hub as it is. i need a door i can lock.
---
I’d share Strange In Numbers too but my charisma is too low
---
The grind is a killer lol I’ve just got all the SS armour and mods etc. Took ages lol
---
I forgot to write about the Ash Heap.
---
No you will see no gain beyond a third piece.
---
With 3x AP you can ditch Action Boy.
---
I don’t bail, I just get disappointed. If it’s not showing you might want to double check
---
Nothing yet. But I want to get drunk, stash all my gear, take a nuka shine trip and make my way back to my camp without looking at the map. Going to be epic.
---
Because people demand high value items that few others will want to buy.
---
And when they appear the same people ask why its so expensive!?!...Price = Exclusivity
---
Drop it to a couple of hundred and you'll see them everywhere and bang goes your easy rare item you  petitioned so hard for.
---
Yeah, I’m not really a fan of the Ash Heap as there wasn’t much there before Wastelanders making it kinda forgettable.
---
I leveled 4 characters and I noticed that you did not start getting rewards from scorched earth until level 30.
---
Not  bad idea, we need something seeing how many crappy legionaries you get as rewards
---
Nice that's pretty sweet I just got a 1 star, but at least it was anti armor
---
Cranberry bog
---
The Queen dropped it for me years ago. Only good drop that flying cunt ever gave me. I've gotten more STDs than good drops from the queen.
---
going into pacifist after attacking someone doesn’t do anything. Ignore just means they are invisible on the map to (and you need that to counter griefers)
---
Thanks for your reply, it explained it clearly, I wonder why I was told this then 😕 
---
I assume there is no arm mods that will boost harvest rates in those case.
---
You seem very knowledgeable.
---
Put the vendor on a rug outside, attach wire, move rug with vendor slightly to the side and place down again, now you should be able to pick the rug up and place it and the vendor inside the RR with the wire attached.
---
Does multiple strange in numbers even stack? I’ve never noticed the few times a teammate shared it
---
IIRC If you click on Character in the main menu it will take to a page of all the characters you have and above the photo ID you took it shows how many hours you have on that character.
---
True. For me personally all those legendary effects and defenses are generally worth more than the additional stealth from the CSA, although I will use it in nuke zones and when gathering ore during Radiation Rumble.
---
I have seen only 2, and both in the same place, in the same scenario. I'm sure it was pure coincidence though. They both happened shortly after I finished Powering Up Poseidon.
---
Oh. Nice. I didn't know that
---
Character challenges in the pause menu I think.
---
There's a challenge to play for 7600 hours and it will say how close you are.
---
It’s for using your fists btw.
---
She's into it. But you know, in that outfit you know she's gonna be into some sketchy stuff.
---
No but I kept hearing a beeping noise like the workshops make everywhere I was in the cranberry bog earlier maybe there is a bug making people hear sounds
---
Yes use 3 pieces and you negate the need for AB.
---
Wtf has Bloodied got to do with it? Like your some saintly idiot who disables the traps if it's a full health build? Nothing more than a Troll trying to justify his actions....BORING. 
---
Get gone.
---
It is very interesting, bright and challenging.
---
Guilty of this today... I set my tent at what I thought was the backside of the fight area- dang firefight kinda 'wandered' and I FELT the embarrassment as my tent became the centre point. She still landed a ton and the fight was over quick but yeah it's not always intentional and usually I set it down a good way out.
---
It's North Cutthroat Camp.
---
Look in your challenegs. There's one in the Character challenges that lists the number of hours played out of 7600.
---
How is it triggered? By going to big bend tunnel I presume?
---
And can you just hop servers activating every time?
---
I recall project paradise being like this prior to public events
---
I don’t grind ever. I jump on when I feel like it and just enjoy myself. Still haven’t completed main quest and I’m lvl 62. I like to build my camp and randomly quest. 
---
Have fun!
---
Two shot or quad would be better.
---
Of course it is but nobody in their right mind would ever do that you're better off using a 1H or 2H Weapon even if you have not invested in any Meele Perk Cards.
---
Suhweeeeet
---
I have only one charisma on my build don't judge me.
---
Bro I got 1 charisma, ain't happening, godd wont let me
---
I guess grim reaper's sprint also does that. It's brutal when combined with gun fu
---
I'd like to see something more for Biv as well. 
---
Biv would be a great host for a funny radio station. Biv's commentary on songs and random things would be GOLD. 
---
Another idea I have is to introduce a robot faction - Biv, Rose, maybe Grafton Mayor... and let them take over Watoga. Watoga would be really fitting for a robot faction, but's I'm not sure if Grafton Mayor would like to move from "his" town. Well, he could always rename himself to Watoga Mayor.
---
Anyway, whatever they do with Biv, he could be a questgiver for some wacky storyline. For example he could be inspired by rumors of Nukalurks and send us on hunt for Beerlurks. When we find none, we'll assist him in making some...
---
The number for your nearest Audiologist and Otoligist is available from your local Bethesda support hotline...🙉🙉
---
Of course not all bloodied players are spoiled brats. However I think it’s more than a few. Of the bloodied builds players I’ve encountered in game the majority of them are spiked brats. It’s be star they think they have an unbeatable build. 
---
Those builds attract those kind of players because the benefits way out weighs any downside.
---
Quad does not exist on heavy weapons
---
The ones that say superior recoil
---
You failed that charisma check I’m judging
---
Just exploit like everyone else. 
---
ZERO reason to grind a game with no endgame content.
---
You can go here to check out all of the available mods and what they do for the Excavator Power Armor: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Excavator_power_armor
---
There is plenty of space for the queen to land. I don't think this is accurate.
---
She's still bugged to not take limb damage (as far as I know), so no cripples. Also, the influx of new players (and clueless vets) staggering her in the air seems to be the biggest issue, like always.
---
A easy one to watch for is swarm of suitors depending on level and build you can solo it everytime it pops up its a easy 2 treasury notes. Feed the people is also a relatively easy event for notes. There is also path of enlightenment, campfire tales and tea time which are all pretty easy you will have the daily 20 in no time
---
Those recipes he gives fly out of my vendors as an added bonus. And they're quick if you keep a small supply of different alcohol on you
---
My ticket, with movie, was closed by Bethesda's support. I will now report it again and demand that they reset it for me.
---
If you place 5 Ammo Generators at a workshop you can generate like 3K 5.56 an hour compared to the 200 from the Armco machine
---
When wastelanders first came out there were emotes in the atom shop menu involving pets also the lunchbox emote that just came out was in there also but they were all removed. So hopefully we get pets soon
---
Everything they said is completely accurate.
---
That's where I'm starting, but I remember someone saying that certain barrels with certain stocks will change the recoil pattern to either be vertical climb or clustered but manageable etc.
---
this!
---
This I can get on side with, at the end of the day, forcing player involvement by any means seems to their modus operandi .
---
I turn around and puke on whoever is hitting me and they usually stop.  I am always in pacifist. 
---
 PVP in this game is absolutely garbage. I have no intention of ever participating in it whether a guy slaps me once or for 10 minutes it does not bother me.
---
 On top of it being garbage there's absolutely no point to it.  I am 100% geared towards PVE with no interests to ever change that.
---
This , berserker should be the real glass cannon builds.
---
It’s been here since launch though, Bethesda hasn’t done anything about it. Blame them for shitty code
---
Your poor post has become a meme
---
I have done the quest line on two characters, but my main, where I really wanted her, bugged. I'm on PC.
---
I have gotten bloodied a couple times from there and a few have been enemies drops. But like nothing this crazy. Where first 1 was bloodied lever action then bloodied fixer and the craziest part is I literally walked away and scrapped another gun to get 40 more scrip for daily limit and I go back and roll another bloodied which would be the Tesla. Crazy and I have gotten two fixers from the rusty pick and they weren’t horrible but I never really used them. But this is my goto gun now.
---
Yeah, big tunnel east. However, I think it can only be triggered every hour on the hour, and maybe just 1/day. Not entirely sure.
---
don't have points to waste in charisma to share perks. and you sharing is nice and all, but really not interested.
---
Yeah would instantly buy the plushie if the company they commission are known to be competent and trustworthy
---
Have you noticed her altitude recently? Her flying low is what is stopping her landing. I wonder if the tents and fence sitters might actually be useful.....
---
I'm just happy the cooking pit can be purchase separately.
---
I reported it some weeks ago. I was asked to send them a video, so I did. They closed the ticket and said it will be addressed in a future unspecified update.
---
Still broken. Found out the hard way now, doh..
---
I have been to plenty of fights with people on tents and she's landed multiple times. Also in open fields and she's been very reluctant. I also hear people say SB can't land in enclosed space but try telling that to the 3 that chased me in to Lewisburg and landed between the houses, at one point all at the same time!
---
There's no single easy to solve problem, although for starters not shooting a thousand laser beams when they do their tell tale tight turn in to the vertical prior to diving down to land would be a good start. 
---
But what do I know, I've only 1100 or so hrs?
---
Not when you have a literal flak gun. A legendary 2 star plasma gattling with exploding shot and vampire. Also with max heavy weapons and demolition expert. Granted any one comes close I kill myself, but it's to much fun.
---
Why would you want quad on something you only reload every few minutes? Why would you only want 25% damage (two shot)for a gun that will break faster and miss more losing some of that 25%.  Bloody or junkies is better. It's a magic weapon from vats hit chance (explosive and over 100 fire rate) and does more damage then even bloodied as such.
---
Unless two shot has same effect as explosive effectively doubling fire rate for the magic damage?
---
Why are you booing him! He’s right!
---
Nooooooooo
---
2* and 3* rippers are legacy. You can still get 1* version from turning in candy from monster mash. Also the cultists blade no longer drops legendary besides the bloodied 1* you can get as a drop from one violent night.
---
I don't have enough charisma on any of my characters unfortunately.
---
lol.  Someone got a bolstering unyielding bloody surprise in PVP when they could almost smell a win.
---
Depends.  Do u have the mods for radium rifle?
---
Yup
---
Nice magic weapon, I think 50% of gauss mini guns are
---
Game to say this as well.
---
My results have been mixed I've been at fights where they're like 10 tents some floating and almost no one on the ground and even fence and she lands a lot and fights where she don't.
---
I've also had fights with no tents and no fence sitters on private worlds and a few times in public and she barely landed or stayed landed.
---
I will say she does seem to break more when the ground is cluttered with tents and I think it has to do with no longing space.
---
The queen and her pathing is just broken period, I think people get frustrated when she's harder to kill or can't kill her and just want to blame someone.
---
I thought they patched explosive bait now? Doesn’t blow up anymore for me
---
Yeah, something changed. She seems to fly under the ground much more often now.
---
I'm loving the trees. Probably the best thing to earn through this whole legendary run tbh.
---
*when did you run into my base Lord?
---
I have the desire to fill the material universe with bullets.
---
Well, since I never play it sober...
---
There is almost zero reason to play outside of groups now. I ditched Lone Wanderer in favor of Inspirational and other perks, and join building teams, everyone just minds their own business.
---
Uranium fever and swarm of suitors are my favourite 2 to do solo.
---
I have to agree.
---
Grinding isn’t much of a problem for me usually, but with nothing new added to the game and almost 2 years in I refuse to grind the same bullshit. 
---
I do play everyday but i do what I want.  Dailies for SCORE are easy enough to achieve in 30mins usually.   And I eventually get the weekly done by just playing.  
---
The moment I gave up the rep grind the game was fun again.
---
Yesterday, half hour before server reset time. On PC.
---
I put wire connectors inside the top left of my red rocket prefab and pulled the roof cable in to those.
---
I run it full specked out and my be laser still breaks real fast. Unequiped it and was breaking at the same speed.
---
They certainly show up from other players even if mine is shared too. Do they stack? Who knows, I take so little notice of the cards except for the odd increase in strength/weight carrying. Even if they don't I share as much for the lower level players who likely won't have the card than those who already have a full stack.
---
Doesn't work still get joining and leaving notifications. Do you get them?
---
Have restarted game after changing settings option, on PC.
---
Thanks for your reply though. 👍
---
That's what Photoshop is for. We don't need an image editor in the game, what we need is bugs fixed.
---
I was so excited when I saw this prefab but I'm happy I waited to buy it. Its got a huge amount of issues and on top of that the floor texture looks wrong like it don't match the whole game like its low res or something.
---
I'm excited for the upcoming bunker but I'm sure they will screw that up too.
---
During the double XP weekend I switched an alt to a bloodied/unyielding build. Now we're back to normal I must say that instead of 5 character levels per day, he somehow gains 10+. So that's a huge increase in 10k repeatable weekly for me.  
---
Maybe they based their expections on players who already were 300+ and used a bloodied build on the test server? Anyway I think it's a bit lame that xp earned is a big thing, as 1 build really benefits from that. Plus you can't do a normal Line in the Sand anymore. You just see people gathering up, glitch it out and aoe the one spawn point.
---
you got all the mods? wow, thats like 10k+ in gold right? I just settled for the essential ones.
---
I think T65 was a bit easier, but not sure.
---
GM has it’s perks!
---
Just to the left of Beckwith Farm just before the cliffs ON the map you will find a big billboard and to the left backside there's at least three cats, two black and a striped yellow one
---
You are “stealing” but they do refil. If the owner leaves them unlocked they likely want people to take them.
---
Same but ever since double xp weekend i havent seen uranium fever pop once for me maybe im unlucky
---
As soon as one player remove water the total available to all will drop so if another player tries they see fewer/none. Technically you are only stealing if its locked, I keep mine open as it refreshes quickly enough and I'm well past the stage where I have to collect and sell for the caps.
---
I’ve noticed lefty seems to take the most damage too ( non power armour). I put it down to that side facing the enemies most in a firing stance and being hit by right handed enemies in melee.
---
It would be interesting to know how its actually calculated, if there’s a different limb damage allocation system though.
---
Forget about the grind. The odds of getting even close to the rolls you’d want are ridiculous. 
---
I still turn in treasury notes for gold, but don’t buy any from Smiley. I don’t stress to max them out daily. Buy plans as I get them and just roll items at the legendary vendor.  Gave up on modules.
---
I still think pure RNG for end game gear is BS.
---
NW: Log in (0/1)
---
It takes a few tries while aiming sometimes and a symbol will appear where your aim is and don't use scoped
---
I think I need to get back into this mindset. Maybe start a new character, I'm at 173 or so.
---
To be fair I’ve not seen it pop up much either. I’ve not seen many events pop up thinking about it. Use to love doing the SBQ on public but that doesn’t happen much anymore or if it does there’s loads of low levels doing it lol
---
Yes you are taking them and they need to make more before anyone can get more. Usually people lock them if they are using them as a water farm. I would say dont completely clean them out, leave some water incase the owner needs something to drink. I leave mine open trying to share the resources for those in need.
---
Too many caps on things is what burned me out.  I have very limited time to play, but when I do have time, I want to play...but then the game tells me I’m done.  
---
Can’t even build stuff in my CAMP just to pass time.  
---
Caps limit, gold limit, build limit, stash limit, scrip limit...  
---
OK, I’ll go play something else if you don’t want me to play anymore today.
---
Yeah same here, strange in numbers and inspirational took place of line wanderer for me its much better.
---
Also wasteland Whisperer is not for Animals in case you accidentally used that perk
---
I get 1 every 20h on average
---
I'm on the Xbox.
---
It's alright if you dont have any other Bloodied automatic AR but holy shit scrapping radium rifles to get the minimum of mods needed for the build took around a 2 weeks since the chance of getting a mod was the same as armor which was very low.
---
Mate, I’ve been playing pretty much the last 4 months, and only learnt how to find challenges 3 days ago hahahaha
---
You’re only stealing if the purifier is locked. Unlocked generally means the camp owner doesn’t care if other players take it or not. But to answer the question, you are removing the owners ability to collect it until the purifier makes more.
---
The helmet is probably the best thing I bought with bullion. The armour looks good but I never really noticed a reduction in damage taken from my old crappy legendary armour, I still die just as easy, but the helmet at least looks cool and has a very bright light on it!
---
Yeah the reputation is a chore. It seems the harder you try the longer it takes. I had a couple days of a few weeks ago so I played every day and did the factions quests every day. Neither bar moved much. It was so disheartening.
---
oooooh ok super good to know.  Thank you!! OK no more camp-raids from us!
---
You have to do somehwere in the range of 1k-2k damage on the queen.
---
Also not sure on this part but I also think you have to be a certain level as well.
---
What you can do and I did this to level a new character on double xp was join the event and tag as many of the other creatures as I could from the safety of someone else's tent.
---
Hmmm... then someone else had the same idea.
---
But it is still very cool :)
---
just keep insisting, beth support is really bad. Here's my ticket if that helps you (read it upsidedown)
---
https://i.imgur.com/9AzZstp.png
---
Got it.  Ive only seen industrial ones locked, I figured that was by design
---
I had a similar idea: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gzlqbj/horde\_beacon\_request/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gzlqbj/horde_beacon_request/)
---
Thank you for all of your comments and suggestions. The problem wasn't windows related but at least I have a shiny new install of everything now lol.
---
no, you can't.
---
There was a news post yesterday that stated the Adrenaline fix will be in patch 21 which I think is coming next month
---
Cobra Kai has a very strong influence in Appalachia.
---
No, I tested last night and after killing a dozen enemies in quick succession my damage output was the same 😭
---
I don't know why you got down voted, it's true in a way. I would just be one of the accounts that would get caught and banned with my luck.
---
Thanks a lot!
---
Ofcourse why hot fix a perk everyone uses it isnt that important
---
Stabilized mods will help with recoil but increase vats cost.
---
And yet when I played the first time yesterday I killed one creature and died quickly and the next game I lasted much longer, even killed a player, and found none. Sure your chances go up if you last longer but that doesn’t mean luck of them actually spawning isn’t  a big part of the equation.
---
You are only partially right.
---
The queen will not land if those high up gets aggro. If they don't get aggro, they are fine.
---
The bigger problem is those idiots not unequipping their stagger-card and shooting when she's about to land.
---
There are worse memes to be
---
I would thank you for your input but I don't think it's good practice to tell people to reinstall their OS without first discovering why the problem is occuring. That would be like a doctor just prescribing antibiotics because it's probably going to help.
---
I will say that you were right that this issue would likely occur in other games with high graphical requirements, I pretty much only play ESO usually, so when this problem presented I at first thought it was entirely Fallout related.
---
I've updated the OP with my solution.
---
I have discovered the cause of my issues, and it may be of some help to your crashes. I have updated the OP with my solution process.
---
Thank you for your contribution.
---
My build has only 1 point in charisma, so... No, I am not going to modify it in order for me to share a perk.
---
There are often no coms, no mics and obviously no in game text chat.
---
Lack of easy coms so you have groups/teams of people playing on their own.
---
Thank you for all of your information and your contributions. I think I might have a nosey around the ini files anyway, just to get the game running as smoothly as it can.
---
I have updated the OP with my solution to this issue.
---
Yesterday I found out that I was carrying 40 rockets, even though I don't use rocket launchers. 
---
That was a big relief for me and my character.
---
Lately when I do this he only drops for me when I jump and get his blessing. He used to drop for everyone when I did it but for about the last 2 - 3 weeks I notice the players still shooting up where he hangs up and jumping too to try and catch his blessing on the way down.
---
What’s your current rank? Don’t forget double SCORE daily event is coming up so you have time to catch up!
---
My main advice is not to make a medics build. This game doesn't really need the classic rpg support role. Everything is about dps. The best way you can help your team is to kill stuff. If there's less to hit them they will be taking less damage
---
I am sorry that you are still having issues. I discovered my issue was related to the power supply to the GPU, but I suppose that is no help to you.
---
It sounds like it could be a background process or something else affecting your game while you play?
---
This is gold
---
Assuming you have enough Perk Coins to do this in the future you might get able to pull this off in September when Legendary Perks are introduced and you can have more SPECIAL Points/Perk Cards to use.
---
I notice almost same thing. For my PA damage applies to left and right legs most of a time and their durability goes to 0 much earlier than other parts
---
Yes, he moves one space each day or so to designate the remaining time you have left. When he reaches the end that basically means the season has ended.
---
I love you.
---
That’s what they want, the daily participation.
---
I dont know but maybe it cant be hotfixed whatever the issue is that broke it
---
Gun Fu for me
---
The problem with this advise is that your also suppressing other mutations and you immediately feel the difference when you lose Marsupial and Speed Demon so people generally don't do what your suggesting it's too much of a hassle.
---
Unless there is something I dont know about...no sense in keeping Happy Camper and such in place of more useful cards.  I see ppl talking about Charisma below but mine is about 4.
---
😆
---
I wonder, does the gauss minigun suffer from any bugs? Pistol and shotgun (since release of Wastelanders) missing 95% vats hits and also occasionally locking you out of sprinting, reloading and using any item. The shotgun seems to suffer even more from the vats hits chance, I sometimes notice many consecutive hits missing in almost point blank range.
---
Extremely disappointed, especially considering how long it took to farm for it.
---
u/Valseek
---
You're having to suppress the mutation because the comments are correct, you get no benefits from the opposite food group while the mutation is active. You could also take another serum which will remove the negative effects for an hour but this still doesn't make the comments less true.
---
You can delete them in a workshop iirc. I accidentally did this with an aluminum extractor in my first few days when I thought they were persistent. Instead I just had an extractor blue printed and I couldn't delete until I placed it in a workshop and deleted it.
---
In today's society...
---
Everyone gets a trophy!
---
I thought you spelled “alcoholic” wrong for a second and I was like damn at least he is honest
---
Ohhh, thanks bro
---
I’m sorry but you are your own worst enemy. The only reason griefers can exist is because some players lack the self discipline to ignore an obvious trap.
---
Beauty of games like this is everyone can play how they want to!

I play unyeilding/bloodied atm, i have all the tanky perks (I don't need to 1shot sbq) and I 1shot/head shot everything else with my plasma caster also I dont die (blocker,fireproof,barbarian,dodgy,evasive,serendipity and rickoshet make sure about that) I dont use stealth at all, I dont use chems or stimpacks... its boring and everybody is playing the same build. This way u can water down the meta a bit, give other weapons and builds some role ... It wont nerf the bloodied it would remain top dps build but leaving it be the best in everything (as u stated in your reply) is what I dont agree.
---
Yeah I'm on Xbox gamer tag:ThatMrDaner,thanks so much bro
---
It's fixed on the PTS.
---
I’ve complained in the past about excessive grinding but honestly for me the Legendary Run has given me more motivation since I want some of the rewards (granted I’m not even a high level character yet, so I’m not dealing with endgame grind).
---
I definitely relate to feeling burned out though, I get bored easily doing the same repetitive tasks and usually only play in spurts - this past double XP weekend was the first time I’d played since Fasnacht. Like I said though now I’m more inclined to go through the motions to get SCORE
---
Yes I know that, but I normally do this at my camp and when I’ve finished repairing and preparing for my next adventure, I can go out replenished. 
---
It just saves on dumping food.
---
Lead and steel is the main ones. I buy if it’s only 1 cap per piece
---
All of them.  Steel is an easy one.
---
He seems so lonely down there. At least add some friends for him! I still visit him every day and it still takes 5 tries before the quest will activate! Love Biv!
---
How much of each do you usually keep around for use?
---
For most junk, keep 50-100 and sell the rest. Only collect what you really use. 
---
Craft all ammos you can, gunpowder and lead are awfullly heavy.
---
You will always collect junk, so there is no reason to hoard.
---
Lmao imagine still missing the point even when it's explained to you explicitly. Smh kids these days.
---
Steel, lead, acid and screws are popular to sell to players at a rate of 1c, 3c, 3c-7c respectively. All others you can bulk and sell. Keep your uncommon resources like asbestos, gold, silver, circuits, etc under 100 or 50.
---
Thank you great advice
---
all restaurants are taco bell
---
Thanks this is what I needed to know
---
Yes, I know that you can take another serum, but while I’m at my camp repairing and preparing, I just pop a rad X and eat the meat.
---
Fantastic, thank you.
---
A sell excess to robot vendors, not necessarily other players.
---
It’s not better to hold up and get a price that isn’t insulting? Haha
---
Depends on where you’re at:
---
1-15 hrs - This is a really cool game. 
---
15-30 hrs - okay I’m gonna seriously do the story and I think I’m going to just leave the radio off now. 
---
30-50 hrs - It would be so cool If they’re just add some of these (insert features) to the game. 
---
50-75 hrs - Ugh. I’m getting really tired of having to open the map 5 times to fast travel, and if one more legendary disappears from a car blowing up, how TF did that car even blow up I shot like 30 feet away from it.
---
75-125 hrs - I’m just going to focus on collecting rare plans and building the best camp I can until they fix some of this stuff. Also FU Ward. 
---
125 - 200 hrs - Maybe there will be a decent update in the atomic shop on Tuesday. I will buy happiness dammit. Oh well, let’s farm legendaries. 
---
200 - 300 hrs - Okay I’m just going to log in do my dailies, then I’m going to collect the junk I need, see what challenges I can complete, maybe change my camp around a little then I swear to god I’m playing something else and done with this crap for the day. 
---
300 - 500 hrs - I refuse to give up on this game, I’ve spent too much time and money to give up on this thing. Come on Bethesda WTF.
---
500 hrs plus - F*ck it, at least its fallout. Hey I haven’t turned the radio on in awhile.
---
Even than it's arguably not worth it in my opinion Herbivore users like myself have it easy where we just munch on Melons to restore both Food and Water at the same time your better of either not bothering to pick up meat,  dropping the meat or selling the meat if you haven't hit the daily cap limit with vendors yet. 
---
You can plant Melons in a CAMP so it's not like your scavenging for this stuff either specially if you have the Green Thumb Perk.
---
I would say depends on the player. 
---
For example, I do not like the inaccuracy of the gatling plasma and prefer the gatling laser because of it. However, the difference in damage is noticeable. So some would say the gatling plasma is better. 
---
Every players definition of 'best' is different. Some people really like the reduced weight perk on heavy weapons while others call it a useless legendary effect. Some like explosive damage, some like faster fire rate (you can't have both). 
---
Also, don't get stuck on 'the best'. A god role combat rifle or assault rifle will be better than an okay role fixer or handmade.
---
instead of looking only for the best weapon in its class, I also look for the the best weapon in its ammo type. I try to use as many ammo types as I can, to conserve ammo.
---
heavy: plasma gatling, laser gatling, 50 cal, minigun, LMG
---
commando: handmade and fixer. The laser rifle is a real let down but I also use it to conserve 5.56 and .45. I really have to mention here that the assault rifle and combat rifle are only slightly worse.
---
shotgun: haven't tried gauss yet, so far it is combat shotgun
---
guerilla: 10 mm pistol is very satifying for some reason.
---
melee (second hand info): deathclaw gauntlet
---
This is why i just drop legendaries. I will not keep that 1* Nocturnal Fat Man for 5 scrips tomorrow.
---
Yeah it's like those stupid tower defense or mobile games where there is a time limit on when you can do  things. Wait a minute there is a time limit.. ugh facepalm
---
You can use the text function on their support ticket page for a faster response but don't expect them to actually do anything helpful.
---
I appreciate the advice but that's not the advice I was asking for.........
---
Regardless of whether it's good/viable or not shouldn't even matter it's a game with the allowance to go a medic build if you want.....and I do
---
I've got a solo DPS char so now I want something new/different with a team that ISNT just DPS orientated it's also a role playing game I'm trying to role play.
---
Pro tip: Equip fix it good when you repair it and run around with a shitload of improved repair kits, and you'll never have to worry about repairing power armor again. I run a max level x01 set with shocks and prots, and I haven't had to actually repair it in more than a month. Currently I think my lowest piece is at about half health, and when it gets a bit lower, i'll just use repair kits to fix it. Ez pz.
---
I've tried it. Doesn't seem to do anything.
---
I've seen someone build a camp once. They put up a huge structure. The queen was having a hard time trying to land. 😂
---
Yea... sorry not sorry. If she didn’t want to get shot in the face, she shouldn’t have talked to me like she did. It was the wrong tone, but I didn’t have a soldering iron handy. 
---
For real though, NPC threatens me, NPC dies. Can’t let that stand.
---
She spends more time underground on her her flypasts that many Radscorpions and Molerats. Frustrating because I'm gunslinging and these close range headshots as she sweeps past could net me several hundred damage points each.
---
Are you new? If not you should know better than to get your hopes up like that.
---
Oof. Big oof. I’ve played while drinking, but that would have to be an angry drunk night.
---
Not drunk... but went to what I thought was a vendor, was actually a stash box, and started “buying” all my good guns that were in displays. 
---
Yea... I’m special sometimes.
---
The trouble is will only get the basic bonus doing this. I get 25% xp bonus from cranberry relish with herbivore and strange in numbers. I'd get 10% from squirrel stew. The only reason to do this would be for hunger but if you're using buff food this is never an issue anyway.
---
I like the empty desolation feeling it had before wastlanders, unfortunately you missed out. Don't get me wrong I like wastanders. The change was good, the world is alive, not static.
---
They should follow Rockstar's recipe, a complete single player game with a multiplayer mode that gets updates.
---
Field Surgeon, Hard Bargain, Inspirational, Lone Wanderer, Rad Sponge, Squad Maneuvers, Strange In Numbers, Travel Agent...
---
If you don't have at least 3 slots in Charisma, what are you even doing with your life?
---
my policy was no more than 10 units of each bulk item, sell the rest.
---
so begins the great ammo trolling of 2020
---
carnivores get their food and water restored by melons and mutfruit. but there’s chance to get a disease.
---
Seriously, berserk needs love. We cant use armor so we lose out on so much legendary effects. I know you can wear legendary armor and when it breaks keep the effects and gain your damage back, but one death or if you want to do anything in a nuke zone and its gone.
---
I play fallout because I find grindy games rewarding and enjoyable. It's nice to be able to come home from work, turn my brain off, and just whale on super mutants for an hour and a half while messing around with my friends. Admittedly, the overly specific and honestly pretty damn unrewarding atoms dailies before seasons dropped were the one part of 76 i made a point to avoid, just because i didn't feel like completing 5 incredibly specific tasks was worth a few hundred virtual currency that had no function ingame. (If you want an example that illustrates how much I despise that "style" of grind, I didn't get around to finishing the tadpole questline until about a week ago despite being level 270ish)   
---
The new legendary run dailies are a breath of fresh air. They're incredibly easy, but also streamlineable, so I can usually incorporate them into regular gameplay without thinking too much about it, they cycle through specific presets that I already have a feel for, so knowing what to expect isn't really a challenge, and if anything, they've made me more enthusiastic about parts of the game I'd stopped caring about: They got me and my friends into nuclear winter for the first time since it dropped, they made me start focusing on leveling for the first time in months, (I've gone up about 40 levels in the 3 weeks since this started, and before then I didn't care at all about leveling, so i doubt i'd have made it this far even in 3 months) and they've reintroduced me to various parts of the game that i only really dealt with as a new player, like workshops, adding to my camp design, engaging with unknown players, etc.
---
Trial and error.
---
Used to do it for the scrip and to sell the extra recipes too, but my gear isn't going to get much better until they release something new, so I'm not that motivated to grind more than the 150 from the scrip machines and I have more caps than I know what to do with at this point. This is one of the main reasons I'd love for there to be more Biv content. Something to motivate me to go see him other than to get a quick chuckle. He's a fun character that could be a segue to some equally fun quests.
---
575 in and level 318 i need these rare outfits lol
---
Yep we are right on track! Well 6 weeks. This is the beginning of the 4th week.
---
Well ofc, if you're not interested in finishing the run.
---
Right, which is why it's good that they put a clear description of it somewhere near where you claim the skin and that replacing a completely built camp is simple and easy so you can use the skin /s
---
I can understand why they'd need you to place the camp over again to get the skin to work, but that's an awful solution since you lose so much effort.
---
that would explain everything. thank you very much.
---
I'd love to dual-wield pistols! That'd look awesome with the Ranger helmet and outfit!
---
never though to look there, it is a "door" afterall. thank you so much!!!
---

---
the trainyard usually gets me one or two if i can avoid actual players
---
I really wouldn't worry about getting done as soon as possible. I would do the legendary run which doesn't take long and then I'd turn in notes for bullion as you go. The thing is, depending what you buy with your bullion, nothing is unique besides the weapon and non-power armor roles. So to me, I wouldn't worry about it. I got everything I need and I'll get more stuff from just playing but it's not a big deal. 
---
Safely, a giant part of this game is playing the lottery to try and get good armor and weapons the events have barely changed since Wastelanders, and it's the same thing again again.
---
I really wish they would or update new events but this game has been slow going awhile now which is unfortunate.
---
I'm taking a much needed break from this game.
---
 It's fun not feeling like you have to play everyday.
---
Holy shit that is EXACTLY what I needed. Thanks dude
---
I found all my legendaries without doing a single event. 
---
 Why compete for them during an event when you know other people will be one shotting them?
---
Bruh you've been going ham on that leveling. I have like 1500 hours and my max level toon is like 278
---
I do exactly what you’ve just posted and I agree with what you say. 
---
What I’m just saying is, you can still eat meat if you’re a herbivore by just popping a rad X. 
---
I’m just trying to let other players know this if they already don’t.
---
I don't necessarily agree with everything in that document but it's a good guide to get your stash under control.
---
I already have the fixer plan, but saw one at someone's camp the other day for 12k caps, i laughed and then left.
---
i have heard about this issue. fingers crossed its gets fixed soon
---
I've seen them at Mononga Powerplant, but I don't really hang around Piosidon much. If I were to guess someone had a workshop claimed there and that was the enemy wave, it may have even been taken over by the scorchbeast. I'm not 100% sure that the ones at powerplants get the scorchbeast wave, but I do know from experiance that the ammunition factory does. So taking a wild guess, that is probably what happened. I know the Mononga power plant workshop spawns generally tougher enemies than the surrounding area usually does during the takeover event.
---
i have heard about this. i have only seen a handful of camps with it and the door was always open, hope a fix comes soon
---
I have a new character build that’s less “medic” but does focus solely on team play. As others suggested, including yourself, the need for reviving players is not high on the list, so how can you help others out? For me, it’s all about perk sharing. 
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=445f5f8&amp;d=l71lu2lb2c62a00cd1ic4cm2cu2ce0cf2a30ao0ar2sv3ej4p53ad2ak2al2&amp;m=051c249fe7b&amp;n=The%20Inspector
---
You’ll need to swap Agility for Strength to pull your shotgun build off, but the idea is the same. 
---
1. 15 charisma allows the sharing of 5 level cards. That’s the baseline. 
---
2. Every special category is high enough for running the highest level perk. So Perception is 4, to allow Refractor, Endurance 5 for Ironclad, and so on. Of course the perk cards get swapped around with others, but the ability to share those less common high level cards is available.
---
 3. Empath mutation is a must, I’ve included the other mutations that also work well in the URL above. 
---
Some ideas anyway, hope it helps even a little.
---
Beer is the cheap beer. All other beers are more fancy in some way. I think New River Red Ale sounds good, but you never know in Fallout.
---
(whispers): the mannequinns...
---
I leveled 60 levels at weekend with double xp just kept jumping to every event I could see even low level ones.
---
Yeah I’m clearly packing waaaaay too much of a lot of stuff
---
I’ve ran into this kind of noob on a few random occasions. After they message me, I usually just go to them then re-drop all the shit I bought back to them 😅
---
Though when I was there, there wasn't any powering up events or defend the workshop events active and the nearest fissure sites was near the whitesprings or within the ash heap so it may have followed someone there...
---
I sell it all, and it all sells. It can be a lot more profitable than some people give it credit for. I keep 2x bulk in my stash, up to 10 of each in my vendors, and the rest goes to robot vendors to keep the stash weight in check.
---
Non-bulk trash includes adhesive, lead, steel, circuits, screws, acid. You can make more from these but they also weigh more per item so I mix and match.
---
The 'anything and everything' works better around the North and West where people are still camp building and don't have durability perks. If camping in high level zones you may find selling odd unbulked junk works better for armour and weapon repairs plus ammo making.
---
Yeah honestly I stopped caring about leveling when I hit 150. And join int public groups then grind mutants, it’s more efficient
---
Could also be Scorched/Feral Ghoul officers's radio backpack beeping.
---
All of my chars have 1 or 2 charisma lmao
---
A lot of the high use stuff (lead and steel) I'll keep 10 bulk of, some of the lower use stuff (cloth and armor)  I keep 5 of, there's no reason to keep cork or bone shards, but if you make Halloween skeleton costumes, you'll make more when you sell them. I absolutely hoard -do not touch - screws, ballistic fiber, and adhesive. From my vendor, bulk acid sells the best. I also don't keep too many weapons or armor anymore. I scrip most of what I get, and I only sell if it has certain prefixes, because otherwise it just sits there taking up space. I'll also scrip heaviest objects first. Nobody wants a nocturnal bone club.

i just drank a fifth of nukashine, dare me to drive

Ghillie pip-boy?
---
Somebody had killed those NPCs before you got to them but if no players are around the game simply resets them to their default state they spawn in as a data management strategy. However if a player shows up the server says "oh crap someone is around" and tries to restore the NPC to it's previous Dead state. This is also why you sometimes seen unmoving enemies, floating bodies falling to the ground or scattering about. 
---
It's just your usual server jank nothing to see here.

---
Thanks for the tips, I'm new and lose a lot of time deciding what to throw away or keep. I thought that the card perks related to items weight also affected the stuff in your CAMP. Will try following your advice.
---
Not for me. I did a 1 month Fallout 1st, cancelled it, but I couldn't use the tent or scrap box within an hour of cancellation.
---
Happened to me and it made me so damn mad!
---
I think we get that one during this legendary run, if you take a closer look at the marine armor reward page the player appears to have it. I could be wrong though
---
bruh, who plays video games drunk. That's a bit sad lol.
---
The only exceptions are ballistic, aluminum, screws, gears, gold, nuclear waste, black titanium, cement if you like to build.  Some of those are heavy but I like to craft and repair weapons/armor and don’t want to be out.  That said I ran a strict 100 for normal easy junk, and if I knew I would be making ammo or something I would let the steel build up just before and go through it for ammo.  That worked for many years, but honestly 1st was a huge blessing as it took junk and flux out of main storage.  I love the game and i don’t spend much time over managing weight now.  That said I did the above for over a year before 1st and it worked well.  If you are going to do bulk to sell it to vendors you need a lot of plastic.  Check out videos but I had plastic runs while getting XP, so I have plenty.
---
I'm just grinding for the rare outfit from events so I hit every single one I can now only the got the responders helmet and western outfits so far drop rate is terrible.
---
It's a shame that BGS won't stop trying to force nonPVP players into NW.. But, They already shun the PVP community so they dont have any other way to force interaction with the mode.
---
i'm glad you resolved your issue.
---
that's why i did a re-install because i thought there was a rogue process.
---
It's pretty stable if I the system cool. 
---
When i play on my desktop PC though it's night and day. 114 fps vs 40
---
Yeah when you get frustrated and angry and react. That’s what they want. Ignoring them, even after they kill you, ribs them of part of what they are looking for.
---
Sir, this is a Wendy’s.
---
Yeah pretty helpful for the most part I can deffo use some of those tips but as mentioned in my post the reviving isn't needed I know I agree the revive perks aren't useful as none of my team die I'm fully committed to not having revive perks included just food/water, rad sponge, healing and sharing perks
---
With the added benefit of being able to use shotguns one of the DPS people are going shotguns too so I only need the basic stuff to give me more oomph as I can get that player to build/upgrade my shotguns further
---
Then can I get a chocolate frosty and small fries to go?
---
I do the same.  My store is full of good 2 star and 3 star weapons and armor (aside from all of the other good stuff).  
---
I give away items that should be making me $, which I would do by choice anyway, but that’s not the point.  
---
It’s like giving food to the starving, then someone pulls a gun and tells you to do it...Dude, I am giving this stuff away!  
---
Yes you are, because I’m telling you to do it.  
---
Well, this ain’t enjoyable anymore.
---
Got plenty scrip on Xbox if anyone wants any free
---
Potentially fair, I work with a group of devs on website development and they prefer to do things all at once so more likely it's a lack of concern, but it's fine it only really matters in boss battles for me currently
---

Excellent!
---
You can reverse the effects of Rad X with Rad X diluted, but personally I agree it is kind of a roundabout way to satisfy hunger. I personally run carnivore which is perfect since I hunt scorchbeast fairly commonly and you now get double effects from cooked foods. +6 to w/e stat the scorchbeast part gives, +8 with strange in numbers. Love it.
---
Legit how it played out... 😭
---
I built a mistress of mysteries build long ago, that acted as a de facto medic. All you'd have to do, is swap out one handed melee for shotgun. The way the leveling is done they'll always be some unnecessary cards. Say you're level 12, but the next card you need doesn't unlock until level 20; even if you save your level ups, you still have to choose from those lower level cards until you get that level 20.
---
I got you.  
---
I have a spare that I'd be happy to give you for free.
---

So many mutations don't match the description.  It's just one small series of items on a massive list of bugs.
---
Thanks for that, :)
---
 it is really annoying
---
Just added you (snazzzah)
---
Now your kind of people make this community great.
---
But do not say FREE too loud... Liberty Prime will notice it...
---
Diluted Rad X reverses the suppressed mutations. It's kind of a roundabout way of satisfying hunger but, yes it would work with both carnivore and herbivore. Your post is a bit misleading at face value,  till you get to the rad x part. Any mutation effect should be temporarily removed, both positive and negative while using rad x. You can also use a mutation serum of the same type and suppress the negative effects for a while. For instance if you use a herbivore mutation serum while you have herbivore, you would get base benifiets of meat, but still get the bonuses for plants. Its limited time, but the same general theory.
---
It would be cool if we could find him wandering around aimlessly in the wasteland after a NukaShine trip. (2x pun intended.)
---
that could also get more players to go help him with his fetch quests.
---
There are no real good build outs for medics because no matter what you pick it won't really matter or help much. I'd second this posters opinion. Medic's builds are just not really helpful in reality and doing literally anything else will really help the team more.
---
Boosts in medics are based on the dmg you do on crits so if you do want to go this route you'll want to just build a crit build and use a medic's gun for whatever setup you go for. In your case, a shotgunner crit build based on what you said.

"so... shiny..."
---
(mannequin begins to cry)
---
Some of those limits need to be thrown out if you are planning to do something like craft a bunch of lever action rifles to scrap and learn mods.  You'll learn when and what to adjust as you play more though.  Screws, ballistic fiber and adhesive you can basically never have enough of in my opinion. 
---
 Steel gets used a lot but no reason to keep a bunch on hand because it's so easy to get.  Grab some guns and scrap them WHEN you need it instead of storing a bunch.   Whenever the scrapper perk becomes available pick it up as it will give you 15 to 20 steel when scrapping most guns.  Just need to equip it before scrapping stuff and then swap it back out.

What lvl do you recommend a newbie being before trying this ?
---
Yeah! I was wondering that too
---
Its been like that for ages. It broke after one of the patches and like the twats they are they rerelease the bundle without fixing it. So my advice would be if you bought the thing this time around ask for a refund since it was sold knowingly broken
---
its a gtx 1080 ill check temp though
---
Not stealing unless locked. I leave all of mine unlocked so anyone can take if they want. It regenerates so better for someone to pick it up.
---
It’s been nerfed to hell, since it was duped and glitched to other players. Not nearly as awesome as it once was. Still cool though, even duped and nerfed it’s marginally better than the other sets. That one time hit of acid damage used to stack. By the way, it’s a lot, not “alot”. I’m guessing your Air Force tag doesn’t represent your service.

This is what Guided Meditation used to be before they replaced the SM's with Ghouls.
---
It's not just power armor. I constantly have to repair the legs - and almost nothing but the legs - on my normal armor as well. And yes, it's more often the left leg than the right.
---
I can kinda understand ghouls and melee scorched being right-handed, but maybe it also has to do with the player character's stance when in combat?

drop it all. can only start it with a fresh one

L50 non legendary scorchbeasts are a random world event spawn in the Forest region. It should have spawned as a neutral, non-hostile mob however. Unless of course you started taking potshots at it. A neutral L50 also spawns and flies around for a bit whenever you start the cargobot event at the responder camp airfield.

The ones you can spawn by approaching one of the two forest fissures will be immediately hostile, just like regular fissure spawns.
---
Ghillie bullets
---
I saw a really clever fix for this. Place a power armor station at the back where you can clip thru.
---
Yeah it wasn’t a subtle trick this time. It’s the obvious selling point.
---
Scorchbeasts can appear anywhere although it's rare to see them too far away from fissure sites. Sometimes they will simply circle high or fly past such as the one seen frequently at the airport during Collision Course. They can also appear in the rotation for defence quests and tackling 3x Legendary SB simultaneously is 'interesting'.
---
Shotgun build
---
You need to pick one up in the world
---
But you can't vats yourself...
---
Depends what your goal is. I tend to accumulate a lot of rubber for some reason. No player is going to buy that. Might as well bulk and sell to robots to free up weight. Same thing with asbestos, antiseptic, etc. Sell to robots.
---
Sell it at a Vendor for 1 cap each.
---
You can only start the quest if you find new Technical Data in that server you are on.
---
What PA are you wearing? Just curious.
---
Ok, I do this for a living and have learned not to waste my time on a snipe hunt, just format it and get that question out of the way. I suppose we all have different approaches. That's interesting that you had a power issue external to the machine, good job finding it.
---
FWIW a lot of doctors prescribe a Z-pak for just that reason, the antibiotics might help. Then again it isn't like your computer builds up a resistance to being formatted. :)
---
Lol, hmm...🤔
---
It was an explosive shotgun
---
Ghillie Glitches
---
Because most of these assholes(sorry for the language) have rad spoonge equiped and as a bloodied build that isn't really good I know that not every team as one if these players but I don't want to search for a team that does't have such a dude in there so im a solo build and want some love for these builds.
---
2*BFFR Ultracite Gatling Laser and some fusion cores for the road 🙃  
---
Enjoy!
---
T-65 with emergency protocols and calibrated shocks.
---
Shotgun builds are a ton of fun
---
Radium rifle is not as good as couple other automatic rifles. Namely fixer, handmade, combat rifle.. But if you do not care about that, it is kinda cool looking/sounding weapon. Also, it can be a pain in the ass to try and mod it. Unless you know someone that can do it for you. Radium is the most difficult weapon to learn mods for by scrapping. I had to craft/scrap \~750 radium rifles to get a suppressor for it.. And i'm still missing 4 mods. Fortunately nothing i would want or use. EDIT: Typo, as i'm a silly willy.
---
Mire for me. 
---
Have my camp out there since I reached the area. Love the color and light filtering through the trees, and it is nice to have a free travel spot on the other side of the map.
---
You have to finish the BOS questline and only then does the Tech Data counter start. Any docs found before cannot be used and are worth 1cap, and if you find one then stumble on another the second is again cap fodder only.
---
Something isn’t right then because you paid for a month. You get access for a month. You should have filed a ticket.
---
From the fallout 1st info page:
---
my favourite events to do
---
Surface to Air (guaranteed at least 1, sometimes 3 legendary scorchbeasts if you have the build to take them out quickly enough for more to spawn)
---
Monster Mash (2 -3 is normal here)
---
Rad Rumble ( 2 -4 normal)
---
Super Mutant Horde ( farm this right at least 3 -4 legendary's)
---
Another good tip is to place camp near a fissure site. legendary's will be a regular feature when you go back and forth to camp.
---
and then of course all the usual others
---
etc
---
Brother, get the flamer...
---
the HEAVY flamer!
---
This is hugely not lore friendly. What would he be doing so far from the state of Washington?
---
PS: You should add a pic playing guitar :)
---
I'm sorry but that's kinda dumb haha
---
I'll probably just stop playing tbh. Maybe I'll pick it up again in like a month or something. I got it on sale for $40 so I got my fair share of play time outta that money.
---
Thank you for being kind :D
---
It's the only thing worth getting a bounty for! My raider character will pick your ammo machine every time hahaha!
---
My pioneer scout helps out new players though so I guess that events out my karma.
---
Normal black powder rifles are still in as legendaries. If you are RP'ing those were more common anyway. Or go for that "yankee rifle you load on sunsay and shoot all week".
---
Gauss mini gun naked and no perks is a good build
---
IMO the only benefit of taking herbivore is the soups you can make that refill hunger and thirst. And the fact that the 20% xp recipe is far easier to get mats for than the carnivore's squirrel stew recipe.
---
Having said that, i do feel that carnivore is far more convenient than herbivore. Water is plentiful, and carnivores dont have to carry any food at all. Youre constantly killing things that drop meat.
---
That might annoy some players, I guess they will just leave your team or message you if that's the case.
---
Can you tell what fps you're getting? Your card should run this game over 60 fps. Maybe try updating driver or go back versions. Could be vsync issue too.
---
...detoxing salve? I swear I’ve never seen those
---
I'll bet 10 caps that they will add more ghillie weapons in season 2 rewards.
---
I had no idea. I use a gauss rifle and all the rifle perks and normally one or two shot everything else in the game. I usually am there for the hordes or flux but I tried to help out the other day when only 3 of us showed up. I knew the survival tents were off limits during the fight but didn't know this part or that the bunker roof was a no no.
---
Shouldn't be on a tent roof so fuck all sympathy here.
---
I’m fairly sure you can’t roll Explosive and 50 vats crit damage at the same time as they both take up the same slot?
---
Yeah I noticed you can walk through the glass sides a while back. On the plus side, it doesn’t rain in through the ceiling 👍🏼
---
Honestly so many frame rate issues and simple things that just don't work. Probably gonna put that game down for a while. Like the game can barely handle its own title screen
---
It was actually someone's camp... but thanks for your input. Have a wonderful day!
---
I imagine they have to be gaining at least 4 levels on their characters a day in order to be getting that repeatable SCORE. I just don't have time, or patience,  for all that grinding. I'm lucky if I gain one level per day.

nope, the garage door is just a normal door. Linking the garage to a energy source is only to light up the rocket, the signboard and the inbuild lights inside the garage.

It may be not lore friendly, but it's fun.

I accidentally scrapped my x01 jetpack armour whilst hammered!
---
Back in the days when you could only get the jetpack as a super rare mod from the enclave.
---
Many sads.
---
Holy smoke, thanks for the info man 👍👍
---
I wish you all the quad two shot ffr guns in existence then :)
---
What a legend! Fave Nirvana track - ‘Come as you are’
---
👍🏼
---
And then charged you for DLC
---
I don't even see the 'C.A.M.P.' device shown in any of the skins in my shop, so I'm assuming I never picked it up when it was available.  Too bad, I was hoping it was an easy fix like that :D
---
And no, I haven't moved the camp or anything.  This is me just arriving at my camp after everything was working fine, I haven't moved anything, and suddenly nothing is in the inventory anymore or in any displays.
---
Those who are out of weed.
---
He should go on roll-about and as a quest you have to escort his drunk ass back to his basement.
---
And a Ghillie The Fixer since we're going there.
---
Stealth weapon needs stealth skin. Or any skin at all.
---
Fyi, just because a high level isn't sharing a perk card doesn't always mean that they don't know, or "should know by now". You're misinformed. I have 2 mains, one is level 308 and has enough charisma to share a perk card. My other main is level 382 with only 1 charisma... Therefore, with this character I'm unable to share a perk card.
---
Absolute legend. Thanks again!!
---
Yeah game passers are ruining it completely. There's a couple decent folk but most of them are like 
---
"Give me that, Give me this and i want that." That's pretty much how lfg on xbox looks like these days
---
Chameleon is largely useless for actual stealth builds.
---
Id try to fill my non-Unyielding slots with Bolstering pieces at the very least. (Bolstering = more defense as your hp drops). Even the best stealthers occasionally get hit by blind fire.
---
I keep one point in charisma for Strange in Numbers. I have zero need for any of those others.  Not everyone plays the same.
---
I have an RX 580 also and I find the default fan settings too noisy. With just a little tweak to decrease fan speed on higher temps, I can play around 60fps with not much noise. Temp never goes above 70 even though it gets got here. Before, it sounded like a jet engine anytime I play.
---
You need to wait until update 21, is one of the rewards from the new endgame boss iirc.
---
Message me? how?
---
I've not noticed people leaving teams after I join but how might Gun Fu spoil another's playstyle? I know that there are perks which spoil Bloodied playstyles but not sure what Gun Fu might spoil.
---
I found several in Mosstown:  in a house on the west side of the town (southeast of the fissure site), in a bathtub.
---
yea maybe it's the ambient occlusion or maybe it's the antialiasing, i don't know but it keep flickering all around the edges of the objects, it is more noticeable if the contrast is high or in the buildings... maybe the problem is that this game have a lot of white light on all the textures? i will make a video soon
---
Might want to edit your story rather than just change it then, even though you're blatantly lying.
---
I mean, with any selection of people or players it's going to be a mixed bag.  I've encountered this issue a lot.  Random low level on your public team messages you "hey do you have any 556 ammo?"  I try to respond with farming tips to help them.  Sometimes they are grateful and take the advice sometimes they don't respond or keep asking for a handout but there are lots of nice newer folks that I've encountered as well.
---
Ghillie currency, ghillie food, ghillie junk and whats most important GHILLIE SBQ!
---
Aww thanks. xD
---
As far as I'm aware luck only benefits critical right? Not everyone uses criticals so it's a bit of a hit and miss.
---
This is good news. Is VATS fixed as well? 
---
I wondered if the two (bugs) were connected somehow. VATS was bad-ish before adrenaline broke, but it's much worse since the adrenaline bug.
---
Ah I see! I didn’t know Bethesda added content/rewards to the game before the actual release makes sense though to keep the actual update smaller, Thankyou for the reply!
---
It wasn’t that they couldn’t work it out, it’s because it was duped “to infinity and beyond”. That’s what happens, squids.
---
No rad sponge for the love of god (bloodied). I share squad maneuvers tier 2 normally or bandolier if my mates on because he’s always struggling for weight.
---
... why would you share lone wanderer, that’s a perk that only works if you are alone (not in a group) and to share a perk you need to be in a group..?
---
Sorry you've encountered that, I have yet to see it once myself but as a fellow bloodied doesn't seem like a big deal leave team and rad back up.
---
Also maybe create your own team and if someone joins with it kick them.
---
But also more solo love in general would be great especially when it comes to content like when we had raids as a fellow solo I never touched it because no easy way to find a group and back then I wasn't good enough to solo it.
---
wow I lost all my atoms to that new dream glitch.  Know wait I just spent them:))
---
It's silly to wish, but it would've been nice to have some basic colours available for free. Even just red, blue and green options to pretend like they aren't just money grubbing whores.
---
I’m hoping that there will be an in person trade in when the Bos joins the world later in the year.  Like FO4 had
---
Im sad for you. May your day be more positive than your mouth 🙃
---
Well some of these problems have been around for the entirety of the game so if that’s why you’re leaving don’t bother coming back because it’ll still be a problem in a month.
---
You can do it if you farm hard. We're on day 22 today of 71 or so days and I think if you were planning on finishing and played from start you wanted to be at lvl 42 or so yesterday, so you're not too far off tbh. Definitely reasonable to catch up.
---
Fo2 takes place like 100+ years after the events in Fo76.
---
Yeah, having a Grocer's backpack and the max Traveling Pharmacy makes life a LOT better in the wasteland.
---
The bugs are unacceptable. There are far to many, and every single new patch or content drop fixes about 3 and brings in 10 more. 
---
Its a joke at this point, the game is over a year and a half old and the bugs are just as frequent, if not more so.
---
That should always be priority, to fix bugs. Not wait a month to fix a couple and ignore the rest. While the same patch that is used to fix the couple brings in countless more.
---
Mate, have any 2mm cartridges?
---
PSN Passion4TheHunt. I have 5 playable characters so please message me before joining so you do not join if I'm not holding many plans on that character.

---
There's no mention of it.
---
Man... I recommend getting the Charisma perk that amplifies mutations if teammates are also mutated because you thought you jumped high before with Marsupial? Now you jump significantly higher! I assume sharing that also gives the other mutants in your team the benefits also.
---
I ignore,  if the individual persist. I block and server hop. Ends the encounter and prevents them from showing up in the future.
---
"Yeah, I remember grinding my feet on Eddie's couch."
---
Two shot ups the rate afaik
---
better is to sort by weight and first scrip 1\* -&gt; 2\*. in case if u play more than 2 hours / day u will eventually get a lot of legendaries so better to throw away all 1\* items in any public place.
---
Definitely the worst time gated non-mobile game I've played, I'm sitting on 800 tickets for gold and I'll never get them used at this rate just keep going up.
---
I'm always sharing the bodyguards perk maxed out... but I'm running a heavy gunner build and I'm in power armour but I like to make sure I have tenderiser, suppressor, and field surgeon on along with bodyguards because who doesn't enjoy more defence..?
---
&gt;Hey I haven’t turned the radio on in awhile.
---
Too true. Luckily I have my own playlist with 1000+ songs. I've learned most of them, but at least they don't repeat enough to become boring.
---
I know. :( 
---
I thought i had it as a favourite but obviously had somehow unfavouritied it.. thats okay. Shit happens right? 🙂
---
Yeah that's what I'm saying
---
I’ve been using both WW+animal friend, and I’ve been pointing at them, though it hasn’t worked. I met both a sting wing, a gulper, and a Yao Guai at a random encounter spot, yet I’ve sadly never had the option to tame them. Been looking everywhere for some help on this.
---
Ghillie rolling pin
---
I didn't list the ones you'd share, I listed a bunch of useful Charisma perks that would warrant an endgame player having at least 3 slots. I would agree that since public teams I can't say I've used Lone Wanderer at all. Strange In Numbers and Squad Maneuvers are my jam, paired with Class Freak on Luck my mutations are legit AF.
---
#"You're either the boot, or the throat."  
---
The Raiders took that philosophy and ran with it - albeit sprinkled with booze, chems, and some cabin-fever from their beginnings at The Whitesprings. I mean.. they're *raiders*. They literally raid the vulnerable to kill and take what is for the taking, because "might makes right".
---
I think it is incredibly human tbh, especially when you consider the origins of their figureheads rooted in the cutthroat business exec world.
---
Plus.. who doesn't like heads on pikes? 🤷‍♂️
---
Do they have any other benefit than just fertilizer ? 
---
The brahmin also gives milk, which in itself is good but can also be used to make other food.
---
yes, that is exactly what these crappy game mechanics cause: burn outs.
---
I had it also a few weeks ago until I decided that not getting 1400 caps + 150 scrip + 200 gold bullion + all dailies is not a big deal. That really reduced the burn out, along with a few days of not playing.
---
Typical wanted those for ages and my sub just ran out.
---
i tried to do the rug glitches with the confetti to no avail, maybe i‘ll get lucky with the vendors. thanks! 
---
i submitted a ticket already yesterday only to receive some completely unrelated answers. so today i sent a Karen response and got my 500 atoms back real quick. :b
---
Rad Sponge is great to slot in and share if you're grinding a nuke zone for flora with friends and not super concerned with damage output.
---
Should've called the season the Chicken Run
---
OP, dressed as Kurt Cobain, dressed as Eric Clapton.
---
Good option if you want to solo impostor.
---
We waited 4 years for you to fix a bug and you just said it works
---
Sadly flannel and jeans is underarmour... I haven't found a good outfit for this
---
(drops fertilizer)
---
I wish they would just make this as one thing rather that having to use multiple items to make this
---
You are mistaken. Heavy BOS combat armour is prob, overall,  the second best armour in the game.
---
shop around and build yourself an unyielding/bolstering set.
---
I see lots of people sharing on PC. I share Inspirational x3 and half the time I end up in a building group with someone else already sharing it at the same level.
---
Yeah she says something along the lines of "I saw you talking to that Overseer of yours" and wont continue past that.
---
You have another quest in your main section. I can't remember the name of it offhand, but the objective is to go to Abby's bunker. Once you've gone there the Strange Bedfellows quest will continue like normal.
---
I started playing after wastelanders and ran into this issue on all three of my characters. This fixed it everytime ;)
---
To be fair, if someone doesn’t know about the Brahmin plan, it’s possible to get hostile labels on a creature right when you zone in to a camp after fast traveling. There’s been times I almost fired on someone’s tamed pet.
---
First time I ran into it, didn’t happen to my first character. 
---
Thank you I’ll give it a shot see if it works ☺️
---
Nah PC for me!
---
Yeah everyone is concerned with not completing the season....
---
For me, my goal was much easier. Raider tree. Only thing I cared about. Fireplace door is nice.... But too pristine.
---
I need that Raider tree to complete my creepy Mire village
---
I like the ash heap, its got the dark creepy authentic with the consequences  of rampant industrialization, also i love punching mole miners with their own gauntlets
---
After the last update all foods got a massive boost. 
---
With herbivore mutation cranberry relish gives you 20% xp also hp and ap have been boosted. 
---
Firecracker berry gives you 20 Crit Damage, corn soup is now 6 ap. 
---
I believe that there seems to be a problem with one of the firecap recipes, one of them doesn’t give herbivore no benefits at all, that could be a bug. 
---
I’m always fast travelling back to my camp, so I don’t need much food while out in Appalachia. 
---
They’ve also removed the 2 musical instruments from Harpers Ferry, so no more retuning there. 
---
But I can honestly say, I love playing this game and a big thumbs up to Bethesda.
---
You do realize that a large portion of players probably cannot share perk cards due to the unnecessary Charisma requirement right?
---
I don’t think you understand lone wanderer is never worth sharing, not for anyone because to activate it you need to be solo (not in a group) and since you can only share to people in your group, sharing a perk that doesn’t work unless you are alone makes no sense.
---
If you’re playing with friend you can ask them to share perks if they aren’t, OP was talking about the new public teams. Rad sponge is not a good perk to share in public teams because so many people are bloodied (if you join a team of full health people that’s fine but if someone else joins in you could destroy their build)
---
Sold a quad dragon when it was a thing. Mind you, it was lvl 30 so.. comme ci comme ca.
---
This also happens without temporary hp buffs.
---
My bloodied Lowlife char frequently will get dropped to 5-7% hp out of the blue. No expiring chems. No combat. No expiring food buffs. Nothing. Just lose 15% of my health every now and then. It has killed me many times when it occurs when im already damaged.
---
I like when I kill one and it keeps talking for several voice lines even though its laying on the ground with no head... always gives me a chuckle
---
Ok bye
---
The reddit hivemind, if one downvotes, so must all.
---
maybe, but that just seems more suited to them being a permanently hostile faction such as the Blood Eagles, as opposed to someone we can join.
---
I made a character that was only allowed to use animated perk cards and the latest legendary items (one for each slot) she picked up. That essentially means no crafting/modding, no mutations, no damage perks, and 25 copies of butcher's bounty. I didn't get a legendary until level 17 (AA walking cane for anybody curious) so I was just using grenades, throwing knives, and fists until then. Last I remember she was level 80 something. Oh, and I was sober for the whole thing though
---
How do you display the guns like that
---
&gt;seeing
---
ok i made a video:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhfEpechlMQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhfEpechlMQ) 
---
Sry i was playing inultrawide but i registered in widescreen so the video is a little bit stretched but you can see that all across the panel with buttons there's a lot of flickering, after that a little bit is visible too in the window and in the grid after that (for some reason youtube compression codec made the quality worse so it's barely noticeable)
---
Imagine that this is the Vanilla graphic, but when i use Reshade and the Sharpen effect all the flickering is increased exponentially
---
Glad you managed to find a solution! 
---
I forgot to mention that the game has a built in vsync and disabling it (presentinterval set to 0 in the ini files) helps a lot at making the game run better. You better cap your fps at around 60, though .. to avoid visual glitches. The radeon chill thing can do that. 
---
He’s the one who buys all the pretty guns
---
Then he dupes to kingdom come
---
Til Todd Howard comes along
---
Now he cries "Bethesda’s mean!"
---
Cries "Bethesda’s mean!"
---
And I say "Yeaaah"
---
My ghoul, my ghoul! Don’t lie to me. Tell me where did you sleep last night?
---
Literally the whole point is to make you play more than a few times a week. The entire design philosophy of these kinds of events is to get players logged in for as long as possible every single day. By design, those who grind succeed, and those who dont grind fail. Its all about driving up MAU numbers. And it cares absolutely nothing about "fair."
---
I disagree wholeheartedly. First off, part of the draw is that they are the bad guys and some people actually want to roleplay as such. Additionally they aren't so bad that a more nuetrally aligned character might stear clear of them.
---
One of the reasons I personally sided with them was because they actually felt more respectful towards my character and seemed more genuine to me than the Settlers. With the right SPECIALS Meg will  hear your character out and will usually side with reason and logic. Paige on the other hand is extremely distrusting and I felt came off as a much less confident leader compared to Meg. The whole Raider questline is you getting to know the experts that are getting you into the Vault and getting them in on the job. It felt like you were setting up for a real heist. The Settlers in comparison felt like you were doing a bunch of people's busy work because no one had the tools for the job. It gave me a very negative impression on the faction.
---
You're also wrong about the Crater Raiders not having Ghouls. You can frequently encounter them in the Wasteland. I can't say I've seen them in Crater itself as far as I've noticed, but they definitely have more Ghouls aligned with them than just Lou. And while Lou is teased about his condition, this should be expected of a group of tough as nails raiders. You shouldn't discount that they also give him a good deal of praise and clearly consider him a valuable asset and member of the group. 
---
If you're judging them based purely from the perspective of a good character then yeah, they obviously have some major faults that would turn you away. But I honestly feel Bethesda did a decent job of switching up your typical expectations for both groups and made the Raiders like enough to attract more than just the players playing pure evil characters.
---
The bug somehow makes the popup in the top corner have the bass sound. I noticed it happen to me when I had the radio set to track something
---
Yeah, it's like an American sitcom and I've just walked into a new scene.
---
It's Bethesda, if they sell it, It will give alergies
---
+ ghillie raider armour, only set missing it
---
The encounters I've had with role players is really what helped me get over the box element of previous fallout games.
---
I get them coming by my camp or tag along the wasteland with them occasionally and they help produce the best stories
---
Some people don't realize, so you have to give them the benefit of the doubt.
---
nothing to teach. discover as you go. it's fun
---
Wow didn’t even know about this quest you sir are a champion.
---
No problem at all! A small handful of these quests can be finicky sometimes but I've managed to find ways to get by lol
---
With stackable dupes, don’t go crazy and get greedy. Only do about 5k of each flux (sounds greedy but it’s really not if you use automatic Ultracite weapons and have the Fallout 1st box) or a few powerful but not legacy weapons.
---
He has a luxury scrapbox.
---
The raider faction you can join are like, the most sympathetic raider faction in the series lol
---
Most of the raiders that currently live in Crater were originally Die-Hards, the old raider gang that refused to kill and left Appalachia before the scorched plague wiped out the region. Meg isn't above killing like her old boss (The Die-Hards' methods were mostly ineffective), but as far as raider bosses go she's still pretty pragmatic and a whole lot less bloodthirsty, to the point where it frustrates some of her underlings. 
---
Compared to the Blood Eagles, the raider gangs from before Reclamation Day, or even the raiders from previous games like the Nuka-World raiders or Caesar's Legion, Crater is much easier to sympathize with. A lot of people complain that they're not evil *enough*, and that they feel more like a gang of misfits than bloodthirsty killers.
---
Ghillie nocturnal walking stick
---
I just added you
---
The state of Appalachia is brought to you in front of a live TV audience!
---
It's not so much about the fire rate displayed in the pip boy but the number of hits you can get on a single target. So both Two-Shot (one additional projectile per shot) and Explosive (one additional hit for each "normal" hit) increase the effective hit rate, and if you have one of the effects that trigger this bug, this can be enough to make the weapon magic. Also, keep in mind that this effect depends on server load, and sometimes the conditions can be just "right" enough to trigger a mild version of this effect on weapons that would not normally do so.
---
I share travel agent but realize I should share something different
---
No I’m not, thank you though!
---
Oh right, I'm on Xbox, we can chat with each other.
---
Only Betas need her to land.
---
Right and the way they were watching me as they backed out of the building 😂
---
I don't think you understand what I actually posted or commented. I not only didn't say anything about my list of perks being ones one would share, I specifically addressed this already in another comment. My list of perks were SOME examples of great reasons why a player would want at least 3 slots on Charisma. 🤦‍♂️
---
This game is already a slot machine. It’s not like I need more gambling to be addicted to.
---
Harpoon gun has quad ;)
---
Playing as chaotic neutral, screwing them over and keeping it all, and Meg being like "shiiiiiit guess we had that comin'.." was amazing tbh

How do I improve my guass damage? I.e what mods and perks?.  I'm stacked on heavy guns in strength so far, and it just seems to tickle the AI

Oh right! I have an QE one. Forgot. This is the exception

&gt;Place three short gun racks, place guns then finally place the poster.
---
I don't know how to feel when I realize that some of the coolest shit we can pull is done by utilizing glitches etc. oh Bethesda...
---
Anyway, it's fucking cool what you did.

Occasionally someone would also ask on mic during events ‘hey anyone have any 556/45/308? Any one?’

The round filing cabinets and desks in the Whitesprings Bunker always have some fresh ones.

It's the BASS MAN!

Dumdum dum dum diddely
---
Hey thanks for all this plans! But do you have any power cores, plasma cores, and 10mm ammo? Also, I have power frame and wouldn’t mind some power armor if you can make me some? 
---
Just wait out the Game Pass and those broke ass mfers will be gone cuz they can’t even afford a game that’s under $20 and bundle up with other products
---
unavoidable in any online game unfortunately. there's always a few of them.
---
"IM A NOOB, GIVE GOLD PLZ".
---
Thats a great idea!
---
What greifing? There's almost no means to do it.
---
I lose 3 weeks of challenges and I'm actually level 28 of the legendary run m, do you think I can complete him (sorry for bad English)
---
Actually they *do* exist - they have even pre-war. They went underground when the bombs fell, and twenty five years in? They’re not anywhere near as advanced as they are in the 2270s, but they might be able to make a power armor for surface ops as in 2101, the Coursers haven’t been made yet.
---
Actually no have separate gear load out for charisma checks.
---
I got a vampires w/25% faster &amp; +1 perception as my first. It's great because it lets you tank without having to use tank perks. Soloing Encryptid 👍
---
Can you explain what exactly you mean by griefing?
---
I don’t think so but I always pop some day tripper anyway.
---
I mean, I can't say for sure but I'm going to go out on a limb and say no
---
It's cheaper for the server to run the calculation numerically in the background and play the screen elements and sound effects once than to check each and every time and run the routine for each time it happens (even if right now it's done after the fact once you finish crafting).
---
It's not like the game makes it super clear after the first one what you've actually super dupered anyway.
---
Well in terms of lore, it *could* exist, especially if they developed it in say 2095 for surface ops pre-Courser.
---
Ngl perfectly embodies fallout 76
---
The queen, the power armor, the weapons, the rads, it all just looks perfect
---
Apparently, you’ve never had a person use a monitor during an event and just stays there, while no one else can use it to start or save the mission.
---
Looks cool! I like the oil lamps placed up high 👍🏼
---
I play it on the game pass, did not ask for anything and some dude dropped me 50 stimpacks. I love it!
---
I probably went 7 to 8 hours straight server hoping.. this is stupid and annoying
---
I refuse
---
No how do you make the guns show on the racks? I tried but the guns didnt show up
---
Just very disappointing that they don't ever play with what they already have ready in game. instead add new and really not that exciting content we already had the brotherhood in 3-4 and new Vegas's. Like I'm not joking modus feels like Mr house play with him a bit more he's terrifying case he's subtle and his smile 😱 freaky I personally think he should be a master mind and a main threat to the settlers and raiders and bos cause he has the means with the robots and we all joined the enclave and the brotherhood but there really should be a massive choice you get one or the other not both to choose.
---
You could be damn sure if players found out a way to glitch the adrenaline card to make it twice as powerful there would have been a white-hot hot-fix the week it happened.  
---
General rule of thumb.....if it makes players more powerful or makes something significantly easier....fix it as soon as possible.  If it makes the players experience worse.....we will get to fixing it eventually, but don't hold your breathe.
---
They’re trolls. They just released a skin to a gun I’ve never fucking seen before 😂.
---
Its 25% crit damage not 50, its a b e a m
---
How do you define “griefing”. People throw that term around for a lot of things in this game.
---
Enclave where there before the brotherhood you couldn't make a vault in 10 mins
---
Maybe, just *maybe*, dont go to a popular xp farm event for getting your three legendary kills with the expectation of actually succeeding. There are many places with frequent or even guaranteed legendary spawns. And its even easier if you have 1st and can hop on a private server because the wolfpack event spawns like every 20 minutes up by the fairgrounds and has three guaranteed 1 star legendaries by itself.
---
i do not have that but i got a nice legendary rolling pin and it counts for both improvised and blunt, im using it with the metal and spiked mods
---
They nerfed the unlocking chance so it’s easier to unlock mods for Radium now.
---
I think the explosive meat grenade you can craft makes them more likely to come down. I've only tried it once but was unsure if the nade worked or it was just coincidence.
---
It takes a while to learn all the mod plans, I’ve been playing since beta and I still don’t have the silencer unlocked for it which is essential for stealth commando.
---
It’s a really fun weapon but I find it too chaotic to use for stealth commando, it’s got really high recoil which makes it hard to use long range or without VATS.
---
Nah I think luck at most influences what you find in containers (thru perks), but to my knowledge doesn’t affect items in the overworld
---
From a coding perspective, it's such a trivial problem to solve in theory. 
---
The real issue is whether or not the engine gets in the way of just running a super duper check loop for each item BEFORE you play any super duper animations/sound effects.
---
An end game bloodied build has 1 charisma

Fallout 76 is not cannon
---
As new player. How much is 9k?
---
To all the peeps explaining the MnM to me.
---
Yes, i know who Eminem is. And yes, I've heard of his song, Stan, which is the name he choose because it rhymes with fan. And I know about his song 8 Mile, because I used to live on 8 Mile in Detroit. 
---
And that's about it for my knowledge of him, other than I know what he looks like. 
---
That said, while I didn't get the song reference, I did get that it was a humorous post about not hearing anything back from Bethesda about their banned account. 
---
The forums has a lot of those. And while I get they are to mostly vent frustration. They also aren't going to help or do anything. In fact, they just cause a lot of negative feelings in people.
---
Luck has no bearing on what  drops
---
There is a good cap sink. It’s called PvP. Sometimes when I get max caps I’ll go around and try to initiate PvP with a lot of players. Especially high levels who probably have OP legacy guns who can melt me. I went from max caps to like 27000 the other night by just having a 2 hour PvP battle with a player that had way better gear than me. But it’s all in good fun.
---
It's canon in its own way cause it's developed by Bethesda but not all story's are written
---
I avoid teams for 2 reasons. I would like a cleaner UI (it's feeling more and more like an amusement park and not a wasteland). I know you said people mostly mind their own business but still I feel obligated to help the team out, contribute something. Sometimes I just want to be a lone wanderer and get lost in the game.
---
Why are you acting like this is a personal attack? Are you one of the devs? Hahaha
---
Well after around 8 hours of trying im just going to do it now anyway .. but thanks anyway . I just have to know for sure.  Im already level 12 on my new character and the max level special is 15 so it shouldnt hurt to level up few more times.  Also will help with the weekly level up score.
---
Also, if you're already sharing a perk, when you join the team, see what else people are sharing. If you're sharing the same thing, consider changing to something else.
---
I am currently up to about 130 hours of looking and still haven't found a red. It's completely RNG! I hadn't even found a yellow or forest until a couple of days ago and i've found 2 yellows and 2 forests in about 10 hours.
---
Doing events in a event team
---
I always block people from starting certain events, things like line in the sand are much better when at least 4 people are there.
---
Youre getting a swirlie after class nerd.
---
You didn't have to *join* them. You just had to get them inoculated so they didn't plague out on us. If you joined them, it's because you were lured in by the sweet sweet payoff that you were happy to put aside your morals for. Even if that meant killing.
---
Maybe you resonate more with the raiders than you thought? 😉
---
There’s a method where you repeatedly craft/scrap assaultron helmets using super-duper rank 3. In about 30-40 minutes (or less) you can have 150 or more scrap assaultron heads. You then scrap each of these for 3 circuits, 1 silver, and 1 screw. That can easily give you 300 circuits.
---
Nice! So the Gauss Pistol can’t be dropped or sold but CAN be displayed!! Thank you👍🏼
---
If you see public teams available that suit your style, don’t start a new one if current teams have open slots.
---
Idk man Ive found ward to be the biggest asshole of them all lol. Hes such a manipulative liar. He always says its the only osmosis kit then when you get it back he says they have dozens but its the principal that matters. Also the way he says shit is condesending af.
---
please sir. i need just 5k of 5.56 because this level 5 FFR handmade burns through so much ammo.
---
i'd love to do more, but the constant waiting is too annoying to bother all the time.
---
fast travel there, go inside, talk to him for ages before the quest starts, fast travel away to do the objective, fast travel back, go inside, wait for him to give you the reward. so much faff could be cut out and lose nothing in the process.
---
Killing stuff
---
I think it's just gas.  You probably ate some bad Chinese food the night before......
---
Take them to the nearest body of water and hand them a fishing pole. Now they are set for life.
---
Finally I thought I was going mad😂i asked my mates n they said no
---
Whatever happened to this getting fixed? Gauss shotgun is heavily affected, I sometimes miss many times in a row for no apparent reason. Also, both pistol and shotgun (in first person) always lock me out from using items, sprinting and reloading, have to holster to fix. This means death as a bloodied build.
---
So damn sad.
---
Yea pvp is a good Cap sink but we need more, like a casino or someone we can pay to repair our armor, if we have enough sinks we can get rid of the cap limit
---
Nice to know it functions without a hitch. The way things have been going lately, I was expecting the chicken to have the voice of a scorched or something.
---
this used to happen in FO1 and FO2. Not sure about 3 and NV.
---
Hard to say if it's intentional or not.
---
Luck only affects looted item condition (aka durability) and recharge rate of critical hits.
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Luck#Fallout\_76](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Luck#Fallout_76)
---
I have a level 1 mole rat I found.  I keep checking back when I play for an upgrade though.
---
Well, I don’t get why most of you don’t understand what griefing is when there’s TONS of YouTube videos. Griefing is ruining someone’s time just for shits and giggles. Trolling.
---
Also don’t kick someone from your team because they’re not running a high level character. Got booted from a team on my new character (level 9 at the time) with a message saying they didn’t want a noob on their squad. Offered to bring in my main account (level 350) and they’re all yeah that’d be great. The guy who booted me was only level 40 so I kicked him from my new team saying I didn’t want noobs on my squad either.
---
Exactly clearly ignorant about the issues. I definitely still have a camp with a staircase leading to no where at the back, not a big deal as it is out back out of sight, I am hoping one day they will fix this BS and this bug has been around for considerable time, my. camp in this this case was one of my first. I gave up on my mire camp as even the floors were bugged plus stairs, but yeah this is real and we shouldn't have to destroy a camp to fix this nonsense. There is also no real logic to have stairs locked to floors, it wasn't the case in FO4, so why now, it's stupid .. we definitely need a camp overhaul, but they too focused on making money and couldn't care less about fixing game impacting bugs.
---
As in at least 3 levels in Charisma or the ability to share a level 3 cards?
---
Also lone wanderer does go to tier 4.
---
Just wish the explosive harpoon didn't tear through durability lol.
---
I've got a quad 33 vats with flechette that works like a magic shotgun. Pretty much worse in every way, small 'clip', heavier gun and ammo, longer reload, etc. Redeeming quality is ammo is recoverable (inifinite) and ya hardly ever see anyone running one!
---
You know if someone's using a monitor you can also use it. It just comes up on your pipboy instead.
---
Not just that the fixer just needs a skin
---
To bad there isn't a sweater and jeans with sneakers in the game. Very cool thought.
---
No, I did not. Ty!!
---
Level up
---
As for calling it griefing. Nah griefing has to be continuous. Otherwise ya just got trolled.
---
Isn't magic applies on heavy guns with rof more than 200 or i'm missing something?
---
Oh God no, not sharing 3 cards. I wouldn't ever recommend 9 slots in Charisma unless you're taming creatures.
---
I leave mine unlocked so people can help themselves. People will lock them if they don't want to share, but it's hilarious when they locked. They only generate 2 or 5 at a time, and will regenerate once removed within a short period of time. So unless someones camp is in a high traffic area or they use their water to sell at vendors, no reason to lock them. All my camps are free for the taking and I do take peoples water as well.
---
i wouldn't be so concerned about legendary weapons until you're 45 (some weapons have a max level of 45 for some reason)
---
We’re you placing small guns or large guns? It does make a difference on what rack you use
---
I’m having a tough time learning this game, how exactly does that work?
---
Already have fast travel costs and 10% tax on vendors
---
You seem to be under the assumption that everyone plays a good guy, or that they should. Some people want to play the other side instead. It's nice having the choice.
---
This is why I love playing. My job is extremely hectic and this game offers a nice, relaxing change of pace compared to my normal day.
---
Uranium Fever is your friend at level 30. The miners will spawn at level 40 which can be tough, but the event always has three legendary enemies. You will get so many shotguns, which you can sell or scrap for learning mods. 
---
What kind of weapon are you specializing in?
---
I find that is the most important part of becoming strong. Make a choice about what you want to focus on. 
---
Very quick guide:
---
Strength: Heavy Weapons, shotgun, melee
---
Perception: rifle, automatic weapons, bows
---
Agility: vats and sneak 
---
Once you streamline your SPECIAL points and find a decent weapon that matches, you will start killing things a lot easier.
---
You can either start a public team or join one you look on social tab and move to right of it and it’ll say public teams and stuff
---
I've had no problems wiring it for vendors. I used the, forget what they're called, the conduits that go through walls. No tricks needed. As for the bugged large garage door...ditched it and put up the straight red curtains instead. Been getting lots of 👍 and ❤️ emotes from players.
---
Look for yellow octagons on the map. When you select one it will tell you a recommended level (although I wouldn't always trust that, guided meditation for example says level 25 but if I had tried that at 25 I would have gotten my butt kicked by the charred ghouls)
---
If you see other players on an event that should increase your likely hood for success.
---
Some early ones to consider are 'path to enlightenment' 'leader of the pack' 'back on the beat' 'death blossoms' and 'bots on parade'
---
I’m sorry if that’s not a good explanation but I can’t say since idk Xbox controls
---
Are you stealth? Getting a shitty 2 star shotgun with a suppressor and 50% limb damage will one shot most things in vats. Or a piece of armor with block damage reduction will let any shotgun do crazy damage in vats. Then just farm west Tek and the burrows, they take about 3 runs to learn the optimal farming paths.
---
The Fixer doesn’t even have a paint option tab lol
---
I was thinking about Biv a while back. He has a human brain, but no other organs. No liver or kidneys. So he will surely never sober up. He'll just get more and more drunk.
---
I'd like to see all the social events people can think of. Grahm's bbq, Helvetia's winter thingy. Let's have parties of eating, drinking, dancing and making music.
---
I agree... a lot of this stuff should have been there when the game initially released but they rushed it out to cash in and get a second grab with wastelanders. And now they’re finally adding bits and pieces of end game content that have extensive grinds around them to do while we wait for another small piece. If you can even call a lot of this end game content.
---
Worst idea ever biv
---
Hmm i'm not sure if this has anything to do with it but i you know aimed first, not just pointing at it
---
download reshade and mod the textures to suit your liking.
---
At the very least they could fill up his underground bar with some NPCs, company is nice in the wasteland
---
Yes mate but that's never gonna be enough ideally they need to work with what they made not patch it out of existence
---
Or a flannel outfit... The flannel at the moment is just underarmour.
---
Find one always at the Military Wing of the Enclave's Bunker (the room full of desks)
---
Zomg, you griefer!! This is actually reasonably practice, especially at Encryptid.
---
I was putting a pump action shotgun
---
I only can share my traving agent. Not much, but still...
---
Can only share 1 rank perk so my goto are strange in numbers, scrapper, magnetic personality, rejuvenated.
---
Yes
---
Those ones will only go on the longer weapons rack. Try that and see if it fixes it
---
I like to sneak up and kill the enemy, I guess I’ll need to find a build video. I’ve just allocated my point in no specific order would it be better to start over new?
---
what's being implemented?
---
WS train station got me good.
---
Awesome, going to add this to my camp. Thanks!
---
Nothing has changed. Perhaps some stuff spoiled in your inventory... Some things become heavier after they spoil.
---
its not enough, also having a casino sounds fun
---
Yep, caught one last night.  Unfortunately everyone is using their new legacies so it's hard to get hits in.
---
Yeah. I insta-bought the current Dragon skin, which I quite like.
---
Now I need them to fix the Fixer skin application, add some Deathclaw Gauntlet skin and some Gauss Rifle skin. But that would be it only for my current arsenal... When I start my alts with legendary perks, I plan on using different builds, so I'd really appreaciate more skins in general.
---
Oh, and Bethesda please, stop making new weapon models into "just" skins. More weapon variety is always a plus. If you feel the need to monetise, then introduce rusty base variant into the game for free and then monetise some fancy skins..
---
I share thru hiker. Not sure if people like it or not but it’s a nice QOL perk.
---
But it’s always continuous, a troll doesn’t stop at one. I don’t get why this is such a semantic discussion when I just want to know why?
---
I don’t honestly think the patches are better with the PTS. It just enables them to draw out how long they release stuff and then when the patch does release it still has a bunch of problems. At least year 1 had a patch every 2 weeks now it’s every 2 months. No adrenaline for this long is ridiculous. Same problem where every other patch breaks something, but patches are few and far between.
---
For example we have no high level areas really and it's disappointing that there isn't a glowing sea or a repeatable boss that's decent besides the imposter sheepsquatch and it's easy nowadays (not mentioning the queen she still doesn't land flying boss🤔😅 )
---
Huh?
---
They've been talking about making bases instanced. You go in the front door and BAM you load into a house. Dunno how this is gonna work, but I'm stupid excited to see it.
---
Everyone loves to get most rewards for least amount of risk. It’s like proposing a bonus for clock punchers at work and remove overtime pay. ‘We should be paid the most for looking at the clock really hard’.
---
Happened during the white springs when running in the bunker for modus missions.  I would enter a room and all the bots drop dead.
---
This guy Fallouts
---
It’s appreciated. Every bit helps!
---
Quests and events
---
Yes I remember that and they patched everything even things that didn't need worked around aka shotguns in patch shotguns no one is destroying bases anymore and Bethesda just banned 30% I'd say of dupelicaters now so they have breathing room now since they killed of exploiters sort of
---
...did you win?
---
It’s reasonable practice to not let some1 start the mission when it’s down to the last second? Do you guys really understand what I’m saying?
---
For the reasons that have been amply described in excruciating detail literally hundreds of times in r/fo76
---
Same when I play nw then come back to adventure I only hear it when I pick up something
---
The doctor and repair NPC's aren't a bad idea, but it'd be tricky to balance them, I imagine.
---
If they cost too much, then it's easier to grind for mats to repair or buy cures off a Player Vendor.
---
If they're too cheap, then it's usefulness as a cap sink is reduced, even including FT costs.
---
If they're Random Encounters, it's definitely easier to grind/buy what's needed from elsewhere.
---
Personally, I'd prefer more in-game items we can purchase for Caps, or at least basic colour skins, but the Atom Shop means that's never gonna happen.
---
I expect it to be some kind of 'basement'-feature where you build a hatch on the ground in your normal camp and it loads you into an additional space for your camp
---
I actually tried a uranium fever for the first time yesterday and I believe it recommended level 25 so I though it would just be a slight challenge when I got there it was a bunch of level 40 to 50 miners it it wasn’t for the few level 150+ people there I would have had my ass handed to me lol
---
You probably will be ok. At 30 you still have 20 points to distribute. You usually want some in each category anyways. 
---
If you like sneak, you can choose between sneaky melee, (agility and strength), sneaky sniper (agility and perception) or sneaky commando (agility and perception). 
---
It all depends if you want to sneak right up to them and kill them by hand (death claw gauntlet is a good weapon for this, as are some swords)
---
Or do you want to snipe them with one shot, in which case invest in the rifleman perks. 
---
Or do you want to use automatic high rate of fire. In which case invest in the commando perks. 
---
In agility there are perks that multiply the damage done if you are hidden. One card is for ranged attacks and one card is for melee attacks. Again choose the one you prefer. 
---
And yes, you can watch some good videos. Angry turtle on YouTube has amazing videos for all of these builds.
---
10g please, I want to learn riding!
---
i could've used that a while back.
---
im on ps4 -_-#
---
For public teams, I try to stay away from cards that could negatively impact certain build types (looking at you Mr. or Ms. Bloodied). Lifegiver is a great card but can wreak havoc managing 20% health (when you leave the team, the health drops, in some cases it causes death). The same goes for other cards that are amazing for full health, but terrible for Bloodied (Rad Sponge).
---
I like to stick with defensive perk cards or QOL cards likely no one is running. Lucky Break is fun, will keep newer players guessing as to what is happening, same with Richochet, Mysterious Savior, and Suppressor. 
---
This assumes of course other players understand perk sharing. Lately, I've run into more and more players who don't even notice that a 5 level Ironclad is being shared with them :) .
---
Drunk or no I am consistently stupid on this game. 
---
I play almost exclusively in the wee small hours. 
---
More often than not I'll fall asleep playing, spoil all my food, and lose all my junk. 
---
The logged out due to inactivity message is slowly burning it's way onto my screen.
---
Friggin' slick. Slicker than an oiled hotdog going down wavy willard.
---
That's handy to know! :)
---
Yes.
---
ghillie trees and ghillie succulents??
---
I'm having a brain fart and can't remember the name but I believe you still get 1 star Dragons from the vending slot machine thingy at the end of that Wastelanders quest.
---
...but more than 1 star, yes is legacy
---
As in LVC?
---
I’ve been just randomly putting points in my stats which I see now was a big mistake
---
Heres the thing I understand your issues, they are completely reasonable and super frustrating.
---
The problem is you don’t want to try and solve the issues yourself (or at least partially fix it) you want to say that the game shouldn’t be this way (which is shouldn’t) and complain about it happening.
---
You want to continue playing the same way only to have the same thing occur just to get annoyed at it again.
---
It’s like this.
---
Let’s say you live in a house and someone’s build a door way to low and you have to duck every time to avoid hitting your head, you shouldn’t have to duck because it shouldn’t have been built that way. However it was built that way and now even though you know your going to hit your head you refuse to duck out of some stupid sense of pride, ok your choice. However every time you hit your hit (because you choose not to duck) you blame the doorway, you’re the one refusing to duck.
---
Youre melee. You went into this knowing what the drawback was going to be. You decided ahead of time that you were okay with those drawbacks. Then you get to the point to where you have to start facing one of the biggest ones and you want Bethesda to make things easier for you.
---
Reputation is everything in the wasteland. Foundation gonna learn, they might be here to stay... but I’ve always been here. ;)
---
I didn't make it, complain to them.
---
No worries and thank you I found the tab
---
Why would they even care? I've only joined one public team where the players even vaguely ran the same content.
---
It's a big help for lower levelled characters and it's not nothing for the higher levelled ones that have to sub in the card whenever they have to travel across the map.
---
I wouldn't underestimate its value. There are certainly worse cards to pick than Travel Agent.
---
One of the benefits of a public team is you can return to the same server (assuming the rest of your team didn’t get booted)
---
Anyway sorry for your loss. That is annoying.
---
What, no shotgun?
---
Lmfao! #MeToo
---
Oh right sorry misunderstood you on that one.
---
Xp farming is less about magic spots than it is about high damage, clearing an area fast, and then moving to the next one.
---
Having said that, montgomery airport has a decent density of scourged. Clear to the airport terminal, enter and clear the interior, then exit and clear the landing field on the other side of the airport. And the cargobot event (that only spawns when someone gets close to the helipad with the flare mortar on it) has 5 waves of scorched that you can kill. When it starts a L50 neutral scorchbeast will spawn overhead and fly around for a bit. I recommend you *not* take a potshot at it. It will leave after a while.
---
What about the"i cant believe I just got scammed for a godroll "tear jerking stories?
---
Oh my God..............
---
Yes!!!!
---
Weight reduction perks are nice, but when you leave the team it can cause over encumbrance problems. 
---
I like the idea of scrapper and lucky break!
---
Hadn't thought about putting stash boxes out. I have a non-trap museum tower built but a lot of people don't bother going in to check it out. I'll put a few boxes to see if that helps.
---
Where you not on a Public Team? When that happens I usually have 'Play in Team' as the option from the launch window instead of just 'Play'.
---
Keep your spirits up though, with a bit more time you'll be launching nukes so often if may risk getting boring.
---
I’d be down to play sometime.. just started a new character/account and would love to have someone to do the vault 76 raid with me
---
Do they not show up on the racks normally? Have you had guns on display before?
---
It’s like any time I do an event that’s recommend for a level that even lower then mine I still have to face enemies that are 10-20 levels higher then me.
---
You shut your filthy mouth!
---
Thanks. Sometimes finding new ways to glitch is half the fun. xD
---
One of the things I find completely ridiculous in this game is the lack of text chat.  Messaging party members is something you have at pre-alpha in a multiplayer game.
---
I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if a team of solos is the most common team composition out there.
---
You're welcome.
---
Ok I’ll focus on leveling for now, thank you
---
LOL! Thanks!
---
The doctor at foundation can heal us and the settlers keep saying " i know a guy who could fix that" so i dont think it would be a random encounter.
---
The prices for healingwould probably be based on how much damage is being healed (addictions, diseases, radiation ect), player reputation and charisma perks. 
---
For repairing it would depend on the durability and level of the armor.
---
You'd think weapon skin *sets* are an easy, common sense enough concept........ (almost seems like it almost occurred to one of them, with the whateveritsnameis Gauss weapon skins tbh)
---
I am a new player and encountered a other player yesterday that was clearly trying to communicate with me (as in, hello, here a gift) and dropped 50 stimpacks for me (jeej).  
---
However that made me wonder, how many ways to interact are there? is there a in-game text/speech chat that I missed?
---
Schizophrenia Nukashine?
---
hahaha sounds about right. from that i’m guessing i’m about 75-125 hours in.
---
thats light dawg
---
Reflection wet 'layer' normal always been there, I used to turn it of in Fallout 4 PC, maybe it is a setting in 76 also, never looked tbh.
---
&gt; pretty much how lfg on xbox looks like these days
---
To be fair if your new to the game it's very hard to get ammo consistently.
---
This may not be your fault. Sometimes the “interact” prompt doesn’t show up for things that you can interact with.
---
The first time that I did the “A Real Blast” Enclave event (the one where you have to engage 6 relays and occasionally repair them to set up an orbital strike), it didn’t tell me to interact with any relay when I walked up to it. So there I was, standing right next to my quest objective, perusing the internet for what to do and getting mildly frustrated with the fact that every guide just told me to “activate” the relays.
---
Then I just decided to press E on one like a normal person and lo and behold, it turns out that I was being the dumb dumb the whole time.
---
I love pacifist mode for griefers. I did a event with some guy yesterday. He was in his pip boy and he got swarmed so I took all the enemies out while hitting him a few times. He runs over to me and started unloading his fixer. 
---
After the event ends he does his thing, and I can't find him anymore. Hes unloading on me, I stand there for a few minutes, dude wasted like 300 rounds. So I left him a gift with and emote of 35 spoiled meats.
---
Tesla rifles have suppressors?
---
I agree the caps are stupid, but even then, what would I spend my gold on? As a bloodied non-pa, I don't want or need thorn, solar, or t-65. I've bought pretty much everything else available, much of it only because I was at cap
---
I have had it for a while and it is by far one my favorites for it. There’s only really a couple for this power armor but this one is probably one of the best shines in the game for power armor
---
My favourite are pistol and sniper rifle, thanks for the YouTuber recommendation
---
Gauss are explosive by default ,hence double fire rate if your target isn't immune to explosive dmg
---
I was but when I got kicked it just said "play" so there must have been something funky happend there and trust me I will at the end of the day I launched it from the base and that's all that matter for me atm 👍
---
Being as end game as I am, durability is a minor inconvenience. Despite this, I share your feelings. In light of the durability, it’s a monster on my heavy gunner pushing 1k Damage per Harpoon. It’s like a sniper shotgun. I love it.
---
It depends on the event. You're much better off picking events by area and not by recommended level. 
---
In other words, favour events from the Forest, Toxic Valley and Ash Heap. You're less likely to run into those levelling issues that way.
---
I meant radium rifles :D typo
---
It happens, my ghoul slayer’s one star revolver duped itself right before my eyes, so did a nocturnal baseball bat, I thought it was just visual glitch but nope I could drop both. The game does weird stuff on its own.
---
Happens to everyone.  The glossy effect is overkill these days, and makes everything look quite ugly when it rains.
---
Is it a proper backpack or the small one?
---
you cant
---
I'm a total newbie, but my rule of thumb is to share Inspirational if I don't see anyone else sharing it, because I figure people who aren't sharing any perk can't or aren't running it themselves.
---
If I see inspirational I try to pick whatever 1* card I have that seems useful but not likely to be in most builds, like the one that lowers sprint cost.
---
Almost blew my mind.
---
Buying levels probably your only choice unless you pretend this game is a full time job and grind the repeatable challenge.
---
We can have some more:
---
God Mode to boost our S.C.O.R.E.
---
I wanted the Chicken Coops
---
But I made an "Oops"!
---
Aaaaaaand he's the one....
---
Wait, you can sort your inventory by weight?!?!  Must try that tonight...
---
I think its the small one, is there anyway to get the regular one?
---
That's a pretty dumb analogy.
---
It's a AAA title, it's a massive open world RPG game, I paid money for this game and it's content. Your only "solution" so far is to just not build in a workshop. God forbid somebody enjoy the building aspect of a game that has an extensive forge mode. Not to mention 4 medium water purifiers and the supporting generators can absolutely be within what you claim are the basics and the bare necessities of a workshop; especially one that takes 12 seconds to walk to from the center of my CAMP. 
---
Following your weird door metaphor, the first 2 times it happened the door just shrunk when I was walking through and clonked me on the head. Was I expecting that? Absolutely not, doors dont just shrink in size. It happened a second time, and now I'm nervous to go near the door for fear it'll shrink and hit me on the head again. Your solution is to either crawl through this door that I paid for so it won't hit me on the head when it shrinks; or just accept the fact that I have a shitty door that will just hurt me every once in a while and I have no power over that.
---
My solution to this is to buy a different fucking house whose doors don't shrink when you walk through them and hit you in the head. There's a million AAA titles to choose from that don't crash. 
---
You clearly really like this game and don't mind the bugs. That's absolutely fine, but don't try to pigeon hole me into a single play style because the game will crash and ruin all my fun
---
Nah, barely got it :D
---
I do not think he needs a new e-mail adress, the ban is for the account, not for the user.
---
He just need a new PC version of the game.
---
Also, I hope he wont dupe. We have way too many cheaters already :(
---
MY THOUGHTS EXACTLY!!! That enforcer card just waiting to be equipped
---
Heard about bonus challenges, will this help me?
---
The offer sure is nice but I'm on PC and not really using heavy guns currently.
---
When you make the backpack you have to select the level 50 one.
---
Yep, you've got to do the pioneer scouts quests
---
If you go to grafton dam, the scouts camp is on the north banj
---
That's just my own foible honestly and something I look out for. A lot of people probably don't care. As long as it doesn't spoil the aesthetic you're going for then I guess it can't hurt. A lot of cosmetics are also stashes so it's not too bad I guess if you do it that way. 
---
Good luck!
---
That happens to, very annoying, missed out on a fair amount of flux from nukes I've launched through a crash to desktop.
---
A Colossal Problem was supposed to release in Patch 20, but after many complaints and concerns were voiced in the Public Test Server, it was held back for more time in the oven.
---
While there is a lot of stuff in 76 that hasn't seen the light of day, most of the time, they add CAMP objects, outfits, etc. in the patch that uses them.  That's why on patch day, you'll have dataminers digging things up.  What gets added is usually dispersed over the course of the following month in the Atomic Shop or events, so it's a good way of seeing what lies ahead.
---
I like it! Are you listening Bethesda??
---
Grind a crap-ton of xp and see where you are at the end and buy the rest that you need.  Based on the fact that I went up from level 51 to 73 over double xp weekend makes me think you still can.  Just extrapolate that out to 8 days spent for that rank up due to no double XP and since we still have 7 weeks left I think you will be fine.  Will just take some good ol' fashioned grinding.
---
Yeah I use to have this happen a long time ago. But I never put food in anymore
---
No
---
Your buddy need to stop being an asshole and get his own copy.    You have done enough to hook him up with a computer in the first place.
---
My 2 cents
---
I am slightly concerned about introducing a "cheater" into the group, but i believe the level 250 wipe was a sufficient deterrent.
---
You are talking to yourself.
---
As a new player a question.   
---
1) Is there a faster way to convert ammo you are not using? I tried the ammo converter and it wass horrendles.
---
ah that sounds about right, thanks for the help
---
Okay! I'll send you a pm with my gamertag
---
Just adding more ideas
---
Howdy, wanna get it from my gauss shotgun or mini?
---
Same here, I think it's a sound bug that triggers with notifications on the left top corner.
---
Well I think you use it for flux but it's also just idk a waste of space sometimes.
---
I’m still waiting on mods lol
---
Just don't want the new one linked to the banned account. 
---
Ordered him a 2070 super FWIW
---
Nah, missiles and mini-nukes are good for easy ammo converter currency
---
Ah, it was a long shot :P
---
Thanks buddy looks dope :)
---
So the same person keeps targeting you. Or lots of people over time being annoying. Ones griefing ones just a lot of trolls.
---
If you have money, you can use Atoms to gain levels. I believe it’s 150 atoms per lvl. I’ve been grinding a lot and I’m a 46. Doable if you play everyday but it is too grindy for a casual player.
---
Honestly, I finally just went and got 1 month of 1st. I really think it was the best decision I could have made, honestly.
---
Oh, yeah, there's lots of ways it could be implemented, there could be a Doctor/Repairer in each Factions main Settlement, as well as random encounters, or even Companions with a quest to gather their supplies/tools to get that function at our Camps.
---
It's just... Look at the Ammo Converter; we got what we wanted, just not in the most user-friendly form (it's getting changed soon, but likely only because of the complaints, not their own initiative).
---
When it comes to player suggestions being added, knowing Beth, it's likely to be stupidly over priced, a random encounter, or just dismissed outright because we already have the Repair Kits.
---
I honestly wouldn't be surprised to see First Aid Kits being added to the Atom Store before we get an in-game doctor. 
---
I still think your idea's a good one, I'm just worried about how Beth will implement it with their Monkey Paw.
---
Edit: More clarification.
---
I'd settle for Ghillie Trapper.
---
No, really.  If any type of armor has trouble blending in (or not looking like a complete visual disaster), it's Trapper, but was there a Ghillie option for it?  Nope.
---
Wait you can mod the small pack now?!
---
I heard you can skin them now. didnt know you  could mod them
---
You need to try to change your perspective. It took me a while but I've changed my mindset and now I enjoy the game more. Sure, I still grind, but it feels less obligatory. And I don't force myself to do a challenge (NW challenges especially) if it'll potentially frustrate me. I've missed a few dailies as well as having over 2000 score worth of challenges autocomplete and not reward, and I'm still slightly ahead of where I need to be to finish the run on time based on the one chart that has been floating around.
---
Before I felt like I was penalized for not playing, when in reality, you're more accurately being rewarded for playing. While there isn't a huge distinction, it has helped me, on a personal level, once I got into that mindset.
---
You obviously haven’t felt the gratification of crafting 1000 minigun ammo in batches of 140, before realising that that gets consumed in less than 3 Scorched Earths
---
Not necessarily the grind but the daily limits/logon gimmicks.
---
I stopped playing RuneScape because it quite rightly became known as dailyscape. When the game becomes a chore, you know it's time to drop it.
---
I can't spend money in the game but I can buy some level with my atoms
---
I’m level 410 and still don’t know all the mods. I haven’t seen any increase in unlocking them
---
I’m sure they’ll have some double SCORE weekends and events, I honestly wouldn’t stress about it until later in the season - there’s a chance they give us more opportunities for SCORE because so many people are losing points because of the auto complete glitch.
---
Fuck.  Can I be your friend....    mine need to be water cooled.  😀
---
Just create gmail or other account and register with that
---
i have 830 in my vendor for 2 caps a piece.  LOL
---
If he gave up cheating, he is welcomed :)
---
Why dupe when you can ask a hacker for Mirv Miniguns :(
---
Strange fruit.
---
Maybe wait until closer to the end of the event to buy levels. That way, you can see how much you can earn by grinding until then. This weekend is a double SCORE event so keep an eye out this weekend.
---
Yeah that’s not what I’m asking for
---
Very true. PC is infested with that shits :(
---
Nobody helped me and I survived. This is the post apocalypse prepare to suffer.
---
I don't have the antidepressant part, but being cold in general and then getting into a cold bed is one of the greatest simple things to me. That few minutes of shivering, but then the temp is perfect all night. I sleep so much better in winter.
---
Oh and also the sweating. I have that too. It's terrible. Nothing else to take off in summer.
---
Just make sure not to let your beaver lodge dry out.
---
I just started playing yesterday. Still learning everything but my plan was to go solo as long as I can but I am thinking I may try to do some team stuff.
---
Rank one radsponge coming right up ...
---
How do you do it? I wanna try it
---
Yes it's a good idea
---
S.M.A.R.T. machine
---
I have never seen a rad storm in 76, I played the beta and still play to this day
---
Thanks, I'll make sure to nuke harpers ferry and do the flux farming in two parts.
---
Its definitely not spoiled stuff. I never put spoilable items in the stash to begin with. And certainly not that much to go from 780 to 803.
---
😂😂 love, stan.
---
My charisma stat isn't high enough to share inspirational as it's at level 3, so outside of the common ones you typically see, I share out Suppressors. That 20% damage reduction is handy breathing room against the assaultron head laser for example.
---
I have two main characters, one unlocked all the mods by crafting and scrapping literally thousands of radiums, each mod takes dozens of units minimum. After recent patch i noticed my other character almost unlock a mod every other time I scrap a radium.
---
I kinda of feel bad for this but I killed someone for doing that since I'm not in pacifist. It happened to fast and he was dead before I saw his level 20.  
---
Just let me shop in peace
---
I'll take up to low 70s if there is no humidity. But around 60 during the day and 40s at night, that's good weather. Shorts and a t shirt, throw on a sweatshirt at night.  Yard work is enjoyable. No real need to run heat or air conditioning so the power bill is nothing.
---
no one likes to travel in this game. But squad maneuvers for those that do is great.
---
The Gauss Rifle in particular is puzzling. They just released a bundle of covert skins for Gauss weapons but left out the Gauss Rifle.
---
Bethesda devs don't play their own game.
---
Wish you could do this with old armour or clothes that you like, they should put mannequins in the game or something, that would be cool.
---
**edit -- tried to use implement but phone auto corrected to implicate 😆
---
Dont really matter much to me. Just dont use rad spounge please. You Will likely loose alot of bloodied teammates by sharing that
---
Its "boys soul"! 😂😂😂 
---
"Do you have gum in your mouth?
---
this is the best upgrade since lights underground and make the yard glow
---
well done sir, bravo
---
Easy way to get a queen the land quicker and for longer is hit her with cryo-later she’ll slow down and she’ll be there for longer and also slows her in the air
---
I just got a new set of ghillie couches
---
Some can't handle 4 people.... Hell Fort defence just needs 1 auto bloodied... Which is generally 1/3 of the player base
---
I gave a level 2 player power armor i dont know why I just felt like doing it so yea
---
Unyielding/bloodied is the least amont risk ALL the rewards in this game. Before i repplied i went to check maybe they fixed the game but no. Dyer Chemical against 2 major gutsies lvl52 and a lvl50 anhiliator still cant die. maybe you r one of the rare people that dont know if u have adrenal mutation,speed demon negative and lifegeaver there is some crazy bug when u run around u get healed at max health. Even if the bug was not still here I would argue that the top insane dps is enough reward for the bloddied build.
---
edit: the anhiliator was lvl60 and they all attacked me at once.
---
This. Living in Appalachia is fine, living with so many restrictions is torture.
---
I've had the same exact problem on every single one of my characters
---
But that would get in the way of adding more dumb tchotchkes to the Atom store, and we can't have that now can we?
---
I tried to explain it in terms that made sense to the game and you didn’t seem to understand so I tried a different way.
---
The door was an analogy so “your door” didn’t have to shrink because their was never a door. (You could have just moved house and it was never “shrinking” it was always small but you would refuse to duck)
---
The point was you where doing something it didn’t work so you thought I’ll keep trying the same thing and it keeps not working so I’ll just get angry and throw a tantrum instead of trying to look for a solution.
---
We all paid money for it, I paid a lot more than you I preordered the bigger edition and this game is riddled with an insane amount of bugs and glitches. If they are too much for you to deal with than save yourself the headache and move on. The main reason I’ve come back to this game is because unfortunately there’s nothing else like it.
---
It’s not a single play style I said don’t over build and waste time at the workshops, that’s only a small aspect of the game. The building is by far my favourite thing about this game and I’m quite happy to spend hours every few weeks redesigning my base.
---
As far as I’m concerned this conversation is over. You have decide that the game crashing (which causes you to lose your workshop progress) is so detrimental that you can no longer play this game. Hopefully you have more luck with what ever game you move on to.
---
never had any bother.
---
Weird I have been using teams off and one and have not had any problems at all.  Most of the time unless I am doing something for a challenge I don't stay in the team very long.
---
The only problem I have encountered is people using perks that remove rads which mess with bloody builds.
---
That's not the point genius 😂
---
I'm saying it's useless allowing different builds so everyone can play how they want then making the boss require specific builds when literally everyone needs to face it for the story. It makes the former useless
---
Yeah I'm sitting on a crap of those treasury notes too. What's the point of having so many when you can never cash them in.
---
I've seen her land on the roof, people in power armor scattering like radroaches is a sight to see.
---
I've joined about 50 teams now. Haven't experienced anything like that. Most of the time people come look around and shop, or fast travel to me if I'm near somewhere good. I do the same, and if there is a big event like Scorched Earth, I'll get near whoever on my team is there and pop open a lunchbox. 
---
Sorry man, nothing will get rid of assholes.
---
wade airport and beckley mine workshops both have oil extractor nodes. capture both, put a travel mat near one extractor, then visit every 30 minutes. make sure you crouch before going there if you're not a pvper so nobody knows when you visit. stash your junk.
---
~~Sorry for mentioning a probably typo " excuse for~~ **~~b~~**~~riefing"~~
---
I see how good public team is and only a few bad experience, when the leader kicked out everyone before the event.
---
The concept is still good cos social UI is bugged (autoinvite) and you can have inspirational active and free travel to some location.
---
I usually start building team due to INT gives exp bonus to all activities.
---
Junkie build!
---
I find it hilarious that they add a skin for The Dragon about 2 years after people stop using them... Their timing is impeccable!
---
Junkie/Shotgun!
---
Just change teams. A-holes seem to get more and more common nowadays. I have barely had any issue so far tho
---
Yet her aggro seems to change at random... so no.
---
People can't damage your camp, OP. Unless you're in PvP with them. There's also a bug which can be exploited but can only be used when you first load into someone's camp
---
Unfortunately this doesn't work when the server crashes. It comes in real handy the rest of the time though. Assuming the team leader isn't trigger happy with the kick button.
---
I think this might have been a rare occurrence.
---
Now you're kinda being an ass. No need to be condescending. I'm allowed to not like a bug riddle game. 
---
Peace.
---
Exactly, some people don't get it. I have 2 mains. One is a heavy with 4 charisma and I can share a perk card. My other main is a commando build with only 1 charisma and can't share a perk. I'm not changing my build to suit their's, no way.
---
It is still happening....
---
Surely the mod is increasing capacity To 120 not By 120. If your backpack was 30lb already you would see an increase of +90.
---
I've seen people as low as 20 there, but they find out real quick how dangerous it is. The other player pictured there is 42, he would die every time she landed.
---
damn dude, that's awesome! hope yall have a good time :D (im on pc)
---
The event has only been active for 3 weeks.
---
It's in the fraking walls!!
---
You're clearly a cylon about to be switched on.
---
You monster!! Jk that’s probably the only acceptable ammo to sell for more than a cap.
---
How do you share a perk?  I have been joining public teams for the past few days and I had no idea this was a thing.
---
lol if bloodied is the most reward for least risk then go for it and stop proposing something funny like ‘high hp high reward’
---
team up with Courtney Love
---
I've been using the grenades you make from the frost floater.
---
I wish I just done that instead of grinding NW for the Halloween/Christmas rewards.
---
Seen one at Poseidon once when I had the defend workshop quest.  Normally its Gulpers or Scorched.
---
Plasma. 2mm. Gamma all go for 2 a piece. Harder to find and less likely to bulk. 
---
All my other ammo is 1 a piece. 
---
Plasma and fusion cores at 65 a piece at 100 percent charge.
---
Seriously, I never got handouts or even asked for any. Every now and then I find some spoiled meat and .44 that’s good enough for me😄
---
Im pretty sure there's a shooting range in Grafton
---
I feel ya but that was a good opportunity too.
---
This is one of the extremely rare instances I'm glad Bethesda is such a dirt cheap company they won't even implement a basic messaging system for PC.
---
Now that I think about it, this is the only instance I'm glad for this...
---
Anyways, a solution for this is to invite them on your team, go to the Bog and leave them right next to a fissure site so the screeching cunts can take care of them.
---
A.g.r.e.e.d.,.l.o.o.k.s.i.n.c.r.e.d.i.b.l.e
---
I’d say that’s good prices 👍
---
So two things here!
---
First one we identified and fixed the bug causing atoms to not award properly and you will receive the atoms that you missed out on soon. Keep an eye out on your email for more details on that.
---
Second one you'll have to file a support ticket to see if we can reset that quest for you. This is assuming you've already scrapped her station, logged out, then replaced the station.
---
Yeah if I didn’t only have 300 scrip and couldn’t scrip anymore I would’ve kept buying. I mean I just said screw it I had 268 so I went and rolled and got a 3 star bloodied lever action faster fire rate I said nice, then second roll the fixer I freaked. I then went and scripped for the last 40 I could do and went back over and got a bloodied Tesla. Like what are three odds. I might actually just try to solo the queen once I mean what’s the worst that can happen? I lose a nuke card and I don’t kill her. But at least I’ll know if I can. But thanks man
---
This. When I join a server and see multiple building teams with 2 members I'm just like "...for what purpose?"
---
I died at both these comments. 
---
Don’t worry, M8. I feel they will lift the suspension. If they haven’t issued an actual ban at this point, they’re just dicks... but I have a feeling it’s going to be a while.
---
I mean, here's a thought: Unyielding boosts your attributes for every conceivable context - vending, XP gain, CND of found/crafted gear, AP, speech checks, sneaking, carry weight, etc. 
---
Perk sharing is I think the ONLY thing not influenced by Unyielding, and that feels cheap. If I've got 16 Charisma, I should be able to share 5 points of perk cards. Feels like a bug that we can't, to be honest.
---
Yes, nothing more annoying then some prick starting encryptid, I paid for the recall card, I'll decide when it is time to start.
---
Especially when there is a Kill Creatures challenge. The fertilizer Brahmin counts a kill towards it.
---
It honestly makes a lot sense. Now that I think about it, I remember seeing a few people use the one stash box I have up in my work area before going into the tower.
---
 I might use one of those bear proof trash cans by the door and maybe something about no food allowed inside.
---
Maybe it's bad luck or your region. I've always played in a public team since it launched &amp; never had even remotely this issue
---
Clarksburg, but it's just for show there's no feedback when firing at the targets, same goes for Camp McLintock.
---
It would be a nice consistent way to test damage. Would have to be VATS targetable and let sneak work aswell.
---
?
---
I don’t even know man. It’s not like you get an extra bonus for certain levels being on your team.
---
Pretty sure buying gold bullions was intended as a caps sink.... But ofc it had to have a cap because endgame currency.
---
Personally, I'd love it if I could buy simple skins for anything and everything with caps. Just - basic colour versions, you know? Let me spend my caps on unlocking a basic red dye for my walls, a basic gold for my weapons, a basic ANYTHING for my paper bag..... Things like that. Not textured skins, but adding colours to our stuff would be nice. Especially with all the various paint cans we keep finding anyway, it's not much of a stretch.
---
Some items don't always register the correct weigh when moving between carry and stash. It can make for some odd errors such as your stash being over the limit when logging in or even just a normal access despite being fine earlier. Another example is taking items out the stash or a vendor and being unable to return the exact same because it now registers as over capacity.
---
It's another of those little bugs that make FO76 the wonder game it is today...as in 'I wonder what will trip me over today?'
---
Welcome to Fallout 76. Next, when you do get to defeat her, you’ll be issued your nocturnal rolling pin. 
---
Sorry, that this is the way it is.
---
Maybe they could modify those areas?
---
2-15-3-1-5-15-15
---
Mini, please. I imagine you could give them to me faster that way.
---
It might be a rare occurrence, but twice in a row? FML!
---
Can you read mate? Adrenal reaction and nerd rage for low health build ads additional damage up to 70% combined, on TOP of 15 str from uny gear (80%). So high health build gonna do atleast 70% less damage, than bloodied, and thats alot
---
Yup, of all the NPC's Biv was the one I liked most. Would honestly love to have him on my CAMP.
---
With the option to have targets measure damage as if they were for example, robots, or scorched.
---
The explosive bait grenade can destroy camp objects and kill players, PvP or not.
---
Saw it at someone’s camp a bit over a month ago and been using it ever since. It works really well
---
As a new player myself I can tell anyone that you DON'T need to beg.  Ive had several high level players drop stuff for me just because they want to be nice.
---
Biv ally? That would be just as cool.
---
No idea
---
probably the first one was full when the second was created, and they both had some players switch servers/leave?
---
It doesn’t work like that lol. With the right build u can one shot the queen with a DCG. So even if, as u belive, it’s 1/3rd of the damage you’d still 3 shot her with high health.
---
That would be cool too, maybe with added weapon vendors.
---
Thank you.
---
Wait I didnt even know you got get recipes form
---
Bivs dailies😱
---
Once spent 30 minutes devising a plan to successfully buy junk from a trap vendor. The plan was flawless, the execution was not.
---
Oh cool, didn't know about that, thanks
---
Yeah dude that sounds like a hell of a challenge, and you've not much to lose :) good luck!
---
Public teams won't grant access to locked items in camp.
---
If they don't know that, they are idiots.
---
Never had a problem with public teams....but there will always be the few rotten apples who try to ruin the whole bunch.
---
Maybe some folks don’t like locked camps? Joined teams all the time and never encountered aholes. Then again my camp doesn’t even have a door lol
---
Stick with junkie
---
Managed to get a fur lined jacket that I’ll never wear. Lol
---
Unless they do it as a static item where you have to destroy the armour in order to craft the stand with it on, it's going to hammer server performance.
---
With limited time I really like the legendary run because I can put in a huge burst of activity right in the beginning (finish challenges, sell off 1400 caps of stuff, do the raider and settler daily, turn in legendaries, buy legendary modules). All this can be done in maybe less than an hour.
---
As a side effect, I’m liking NW more and more.  Not sure how I’ll feel after achieving my ideal perk loadout though. I enjoy the whole customization and perk concept but if I don’t have much to work for I don’t know if I’ll like it as much.
---
&amp; a Ghillie Lever Rifle.
---
Seriously I'd pay Atoms for Ghillie walls &amp; roofs for my C.A.M.P
---
And I know what I'm doing when I get home. Gonna hunt down some Assualtrons and rip their heads off.
---
Let me insulate my camp with caps? Either to show off how worthless they are, or if you want real use, maybe they will stop rads from nukes or rad storms.
---
Anyways... what been up man?  Hows the patch going?
---
I would say keep taking unlocked water if you need it, they refill really fast.  I go home, collect water, scrap, fix guns and armor, cook, and then my water purifier is full again!  If they are unlocked, the owner is sharing.  Now my collectron is locked, so mess with him, that is stealing.
---
My first nuke was Whitespring, no other players in sight, as soon as I walked into the nuke zone i got a blue screen. Glad I took one selfie right before that.
---
My cap sink is purchasing Encryptid recall cards (\~25 or so on hand). Also don't use "hard bargain" perks.
---
lol that's fucking aweaome. dudes probably like " wtf mate??"
---
It's a quite rare drop. And most likely because of this also semi-widely duped. Still, getting one for 50 caps was a very very lucky find. I have played from the launch of the game (\~2000h) and have not had the thing drop for me once. Only one i own is from the early weeks of the game when you could sometimes find and buy it from enclave vendor.
---
Luck has nothing to do with it.  Run 28 (11 base) luck on my main with gear.  Been playing since the weekend after launch.  I farm the dresses on and off and always stop in after line in the sand and every time it's on my way anywhere near it.  In almost 2 years I have never seen the red dress. Random is random bud.
---
Agree 100% - but this kinda works for both sides of the discussion tbh. Is it due to his raider roots, or his settler ties? Maybe you can take a man out of the Raiders, but you can't take the raider out of the man? Maybe his Settler life has made him into a new monster altogether? Hard to tell. But obviously it's easy to be a "reformed raider" when you can still kill anyone for their transgressions against your group, or just for the principle 🤷‍♂️
---
I was thinking maybe like a display? Cause you can display masks, why not armours and outfits right?
---
There's plenty of other and better ways to farm legendary gear than this ridiculous  event.  Uranium fever is a complete clusterfuck.    I never do it  and  I always have more legendary gear than I can scrip.   The legendary gear that drops at Uranium Fever is never above level 40, which makes it a waste of time for anyone above that level.  I am still baffled as to why anyone bothers with Uranium Fever.
---
Oh yeah. Post-SBQ is time to panic store all junk unscrapped lest you lose all your stable flux.
---
I make sure to store all known plans whenever I'm dropping junk. Same for ore, unused ammo, and certain crafting items (blood packs, nuka cola, frags, stimpaks, disease cures, base chems, etc.)
---
I put unused ore up for sale (10c per) and it sells okay because one of the possum badges requires smelting ore.
---
Pleasant Valley Claim Tickets and magazines sell well, too. I charge 37c per and they always go fast, even though they don't have weight.
---
Or to do it another way. Take a junkies high health melee build and then add another 15 strength on top. U don’t think that would be massively powerful with no downside of low health?
---
yea i play bloodied now but not because is broken op but only to get the extra xp for the legendary run... i feel like riding on a merry-go-round whit this comments
---
Maybe don't stress over it? 
---
There aren't that many functional things that you miss out on &amp; there will be future legendary run content in future.
---
You probably won't even think about or remember any of the score rewards that you missed out on in a couple of months anyhow
---
I'm a long time fallout fan and finally just got into this game 2 weeks ago after 2 years of reading all the negative things about it and the only thing I really can't stand is that literally every camp item needs a "plan" to build. That and everytime I encounter an attack dog it's invincible and I have to switch world's to escape it.
---
Bethesda always pulled at my last straw with this game and now this game it’s doin it again since they added hunger n thirst now a requirement I’m dying out here lmao literally I need to vastly adjust how I play this fallout compared to old
---
Or just a slider. Either, really. It’s ridiculous.
---
:D
---
I share Bandolier rank 2. It is always useful for non melee build :)
---
Na coz the screen will be covered in leaves
---
Option 1: Pull out my Tesla so I can still get a hit and maybe the others can as well. 
---
Option 2: Pull out my B/E laser rifle or shotgun and murder everything faster than they can. 
---
You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.
---
Teach a vault dweller to craft and you feed him for life.
---
This double xp weekend was tremendous for me. I think I broke the level 100 mark 1-2 weeks ago and now level 150ish. And that's with intermittent play. Love me some double xp sentry bots.
---
I would love this unironically
---
I grabbed one for 30 caps - they are an extremely rare drop (only certain Savage Divide events have them on the loot table).
---
The FO1st reward that lets you have infinite junk
---
F. O. V. please you can do it in photomode but in regular gameplay you need to look through a cardboard box.
---
Explosive ones are nice pvp weapon
---
We used to be able to, I was able to share any perk I wanted with my unyielding gear, but they either patched it out, or it's a bug that we can't do it anymore.
---
I've never seen this. I ALWAYS join teams because I'm addicted to the +25% mutey bonus.   Also, maybe you are joining the wrong type of team for your style of play. Try the Building Teams.
---
I've honestly had NO negative Public Team experiences since the roll-out of public teams.  
---
I'm a daily grinder, so i'm on a lot of teams.  Also, Public Teams doesnt' allow teammates to do anything to your camp.
---
Deathclaws always add class. No lingering odor from all that radiated wet fur of the sheepsquatch
---
I think the horns go really well as part of a display with the deer antlers set, but yeah the head just looks... off?
---
You actually used to be able to do that. Bethesda removed it. 
---
And honestly, the fact that one playstyle is so ridiculously overpowered... Yeah, I don’t think I need to say it. Mainly because it’d get me downvoted to hell.
---
You could always mod them. Ever since the moment they were inplemented. It is even written in the same section of the patch notes as the backpack originally being introduced.
---
[edit: see below for Sept 10 2019 patch notes]
---
Sounds like a tosser.
---
It's probably you, you're the problem
---
I'd love to come try and do the best I can! I'm only level 53, so I haven't gotten anything spectacular yet, but I'll definitely do my best to chip away at her and the mobs at the very least! Is your GT same as your user name?
---
Well I have a level 250 on nw for ps4 and have never seen one. So it seems like it’s not an exaggeration.
---
Only teams I partake on are building teams
---
Assassins.is a scrip prefix, except for armour. Keep the junkies.
---
Why does this feel like a Budweiser commercial ... ghillie ghillie
---
All savage divide events/quests/dailies can drop it.  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p\_2jw2yNRY8JIE7qTfUwXTgivFDcuy0Xltb4N8kct4o/htmlview](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p_2jw2yNRY8JIE7qTfUwXTgivFDcuy0Xltb4N8kct4o/htmlview)
---
Know what I have seen a lot of lately are people from the public team chasing me around the map trying to open trade windows with me. It drives me crazy.
---
If you want to see what I'm selling selling go check my vendors please.
---
You're kidding right?
---
The only teams I do are Events.
---
Ps4
---
even thought it is FF, ok I thought FF was like the thing for full health builds appreciate the help :)
---
I agree wholeheartedly. A waste of a very cool character!
---
Philanthropist is really good.  Any build specific perks aren't really good since they don't stack, and I don't care for weight reduction perks either because when that person leaves the team I'm instantly over cucumbered. Sometimes strange is numbers doesn't seem to give me the benefits if it's being shared and I don't have my own equiped. Not sure if anyone else is having that issue.
---
thx
---
The double XP weekend definitely helped. I did actually gain like 3 levels from one round of Radiation Rumble this weekend, and I'm now at level 93. I think I was still in the 60s when this all started, and I've been playing since BETA.
---
Thats an awesome idea! Customising basic colours on armor like in eso!
---
Displaying armour pieces and an armour display are two very different things.
---
The former just required Bethesda to add the armour pieces to existing displays, easy. The latter requires a bare minimum of 6 items (5 armour pieces + the stand itself) and up to 8-10 items if you include other accessories all to be rendered dynamically. 
---
Per stand. 
---
Add multiple stands &amp; you compound the problem &amp; likely impact the server whenever you or someone enters your camp.
---
If Bethesda can pull it off without killing performance, awesome. I just don't see it happening unless they make the armour stand just 1 object to render and not up to 10 objects.
---
Looted my Stash a few times, the other stash skins didn't "click".  Bought out a few player vending machines because it wasn't consuming my caps, turns out they were my vending machines at my camp.
---
And gunpowder.
---
Nah, It's icing on the cake if the prefix is a good one, but assassins is useless.
---
Not even toilet paper for 30000 caps.
---
But it’s subtle enough to make yourself question if you DID really just hear it. Maybe it really was just your imagination 🤔
---
Nice.  It is my favorite power armor. I am level 109 and i wear it all the time.  I only put my Ultracite PA on if i need the jetpack.  Yiu can get calibrated shocks for it from the vendor in Camden Park. Gives you even more carry weight
---
thx appreciated
---
Bethesda: keep a *callin* but you can’t come in
---
Sometimes this is the case, I’m talking about the times that I have a team of 2 or 3 counting me, and someone else starts a new one instead of just joining the existing the ones. I totally get it for the people that want to run with their friends and want the benefits of the public system tho.
---
STILL TOO SOON MAN
---
I still dont understand how people find "griefers"... almost 1900h ingame time and have  met one jerk , and it was partially on me lol
---
Could it be that people are over sensitive ? 
---
Not saying , just wondering
---
Wish it was just a noob issue. Had a level 71 say proudly. I am a grub and want all the stuff you don’t want after we took down the SBQ. I don’t know how much work he put in to take it down. Had to fast travel away because I got tired of hearing “o am a grub and I want all the free stuff
---
As you come out from the vault, you lack the skill and ability to scrap weapons with the finesse they require (and tools). Therefore you just smash them with an rock, mostly resulting in steel and wood only.
---
This. 
---
The RNG in this game is so heavily stacked against the player it's beyond laughable but the fanboys will never get tired defending this shit.
---
Try different servers, switch your build, use different weapons for a week so the system gets confused, etc. pp.
---
I wish I was joking but these are some of the replies you read on here whenever someone dares questioning this shit system.
---
I run a high level character, so usually a trip to Fissure Prime is enough to spawn legendary SBs, or wandering around Cranberry is enough to make mean starred things attack. So when I get into events like Uranium Fever or Campfire Tales, it just feels cheap and scummy to take shots at the legendaries. Even pulling my punches, I can still deal a lot of damage which might be robbing a lower level of a chance. The only event my altruism takes a back seat is Line in the Sand ... I’ve found that event severely lacking in any sort of player etiquette. I’m often the only one bringing steel to the event and making repairs to the sonic generator to keep the event from failing, so I’ve run out of sympathy for other players showing up purely to XP farm. I will take my shots with my better weapons in that event.
---
I don’t get the hate this game has. When you think of ESO and having to buy expansions, ffxiv and wow needing subscriptions, etc etc I don’t get it when people say the company is greedy for putting such and such an item in the Atom store.
---
Even in the beginning when things were sort of a cluster I loved this game to heck. I lost steam when I finished most of the main story but I started over in wastelanders and love that there is so much stuff to grind for.
---
No it use to be but I changed it to kingsites12
---
Radical, right??? Who'd think people would want to wear/use different colours! =O
---
Im pretty sure you couldnt mod or put skins on the small on pack until the last few months. There was posts here almost everytime the atom shop upated asking wby they couldnt put the skin on their packs they just bought . Always had to use the one you got from doing the tadpole quests if you wanted a skin.
---
I never tried to mod my small pack  though. When i got my tadpole pack the grocer/chemist packs werent availible yet so had to complete the tadpole quest to unlock possum badges anyways.
---
Ill have to finish the vault raid and grimd rep on my alt so i can mod his pack.
---
I keep going back to visit him in desperate hope for the firecracker berry whiskey recipe. But his demeanor makes my whole day worth it even if I don't get it.
---
&gt;I typically have Four Leaf Clover 1\* shared and it’s just so disappointing joining a group and seeing nothing shared
---
Then join another group or start one of your own. No one is obligated to share a perk with you or anyone else if they don't feel like it.
---
I don't have enough charisma to share anything more than one star cards. And I don't run one star cards.  And I am under no obligation to just because some random player thinks that I should.
---
People join public teams for the bonus XP, not for shared perk cards.
---
Scrapping armor and weapons is useless in 76, even with the scrapper perk. They should just return the scrapping perk with multiple levels from fallout 4 because that one actually gave you useful materials for scrapping
---
maratonist the only one I can share 1 star. hey it's something already.
---
Because they can play the game any way they chose.
---
We should start filing bug reports. Just snow them with it until it's fixed.
---
I like when people share 3\* Bloody mess because then it free's up a card in Luck that I can use  that I really like for that extra punch
---
That’s usually why I do it. My husband and I will switch our private team over, because we want the bonus but realize not everyone wants to hear our banter.
---
It doesn’t work. It seems like misinformation.
---
It cracks me up every time.  Just keeling over out of no where like that.
---
But, I admit the first time I saw it (back and launch) I was on edge every second thinking another player was going to try and snipe me at range.  So, when robots would suddenly explode (no human NPCs back then) I'd instantly draw my weapon and scan the horizon.
---
My first thought is still, "who's out there?".  Then I laugh.  At the glitch and myself.
---
Walls made of nuka caps would actually look rather ... *rad*. 
---
^(I'll see myself out, dw. xD)
---
They're just revolutionaries fighting the scourge of locked water purifiers. Seriously, why do that?
---
Scrapping weapons with scrapper perk is far from useless. Get yourself an unyielding set and you get \~20-25 steel from assault rifles (as an example), as intelligence directly affects the amount of materials you get. One run in West Tek Research will give you 400-500 steel if you loot and scrap everything.
---
*Coldy assesses situation.*
---
"Sweep the leg."
---
I wish I had more than 1 upvote today give. That was quality. 
---
I’d give you caps, but the vote is worth more.
---
U on PC? Got a junkie gatling with FFR and Reduced weight for sale
---
Maybe he could have a New Year's Eve event? For the people I hang with, NYE is a HOT night for drinking.
---
I play around 8 pm eastern time usually but sometimes earlier
---
Uhhh they weren't that much before the duping. 10-15k tops.
---
Either Inspirational lvl 3 or Mysterious Stranger lvl 3. I'll swap ones in and out though to do things like cure newbies of rads or auto heal them during the day.
---
Then they're doing it wrong.  Before teams Lone Wanderer was one of the best perks in the game.
---
With teams Inspirational is 15% bonus XP.
---
Where are you putting your points exactly?  Would you rather get 15% bonus XP or do you want to one-shot things even harder than you already one-shot everything?  I'll take 15% more XP, thanks.

[FALLOUT 76: PATCH 13 NOTES – SEPTEMBER 10, 2019](https://bethesda.net/en/article/4bGHdIFQ27EzLbZp1EoWoW/fallout-76-patch-13-notes-september-10-2019)  
---
Small Backpacks: A new type of Backpack, the “Small Backpack” has been added in an effort to help more players acquire a Backpack earlier on during their Appalachian adventures.  
---
A Plan to craft a Small Backpack can be found inside the Overseer’s Cache inside the Morgantown Airport Terminal. This Plan cannot be traded, sold, or dropped.  
---
Small Backpacks have 50% of the carry capacity provided by a standard Backpack.  
---
Small Backpacks can be equipped with all the same Mods as a standard Backpack.  
---
Players can still learn to craft Standard Backpacks by completing Pioneer Scout Quests.
---
...  
---
The skins were definitely a recent change. But the mods weren't.
---
With the Chemist's backpack mod on the Large Backpack, it saves me over 1000lbs of carry weight. With the Chemist's mod on the Small Backpack, it saves me over 975lbs. Basically the Large Backpack is not urgently worth getting anymore unless you're bored, and it's just a **little** added luxury.
---
My leg armor is always the first to go.  I do hero land off of tall buildings as much as I possibly can though.
---
Extractors like aluminum can be built by a player and removed like normal. The ammo factory extractor thing in my experience cannot be moved, deleted, picked up, or anything.
---
Trolls gonna troll
---
Yea last time I give something out
---
If walking around their camp is already considered griefing, then probably yes...
---
Let's us trade with other character like the settlements fo4
---
You do learn mod plans from scrapping... so not completely useless
---
Mostly the look and it keeps me playing for a bit
---
&gt; what are you even doing with your life?
---
Keeping it at 19.9 what else?
---
Oh for sure 
---
Same exact skins but in fall colors
---
I don’t see how never having seen one = script kiddies not being exaggerated. Especially since script kiddies require third-party software that’s on PC, not console.
---
Ballistic what's it's name
---
Well, it makes you invisible in sneak mode and has armor mods, so makes sense to me. Also it’s just a cool looking armored hazmat suit, which aren’t under armors.
---
The very fact that many people propose high reward for full hp proves that bloodied is high risk and those players don’t want it, although they want the reward. A build with strong pros and strong cons is balanced, high hp and high reward isn’t. Don’t get me wrong I’d love a full hp full reward set too but i just don’t see how it works. Essentially they will be giving everyone free bonus SPECIAL points nothing else.
---
Okay, so this is completely news to me! Thank you for the information! Can you help advise on where to go to find the mods/plans to do so? I never knew that was an option at all, but it would surely help until I can finally grind out the Scout requirements!
---
agreed. I used to even buy ammo from train stations.
---
automatics should be avoided early game because you will always be out of ammo.  Not to mention the carry weight.
---
In FO1 and 2 the SMG was such a great weapon early game. When i got the perfect storm, i was so excited. Then i used it and realized how flimsy it is in this game.
---
Go into the atomic shop. It lists exactly what is included in the bundle in the description.
---
Great ideas everyone thank you.
---
bloodied/adrenal/nerd rage will still be much more powerful than extra junkie/+80% from 15str. even now if u r proper perks/gear/buffs u can play full heath melee and 1shot everything... i don't think it would change anything in the meta
---
speaking of perks, would you guys rather have tenderizer 2 or squad maneuvers 2? i usually share tenderizer.
---

---
Casino sounds fun and useful. It would be a nice place to exchange any in-game currency like caps, scrips, bullions, mr. fuzzy tokens, pleasant valley tickets, mine tokens, ammo tickets, etc. for casino chips and vice versa. Or bet them away.  
---
Game has really cumbersome economics and currency system. There has to be something in-between all currencies besides caps, which became almost worthless.
---
A bit off topic, but anyone have a spare dense marine armor torso plan?
---
i still need to be able to lock off my vending area without having to go into build mode so curtains won‘t make due
---
Yes, I have been frantically searching for the cause
---
I've read somewhere that it might be a bunker like Free States. I'd love a single bunker and a little bit of stuff outside, like workbenches, water purifiers and vendors.
---
Cant wait for that update. Always short on camp budget.
---
Steel is still one of the easiest materials to get and it can be acquired from almost every piece of junk in the game. I said that the perk and scrapping is useless in 76 because it barely gives you any of the uncommon materials like screws, gears, or springs like it did in fallout 4.
---
But each to their own, as a junk hoarder I never find myself needing steel and whenever I scrap a weapon it would be for the mods
---
I was not expecting the answer to be summed up in 3 words but damn.  Nice work.
---
There're no legendary dragons un the drop pool buy Beth still sells a sweeeet skin for it
---
Pc problems
---
Nice!
---
It depends what you put in your camp
---
Turrets, crops, displayed items, and lights take up a silly amount of your budget
---
Awesome pic.
---
I share Scrounger, I think, but I'm not sure if it's a good one to share or not. I know not to share anything that'll mess with radiation stuff, at least, though!
---
So a full strength properly built junkies melee build now with another 15 strength wouldn’t be ridiculously powerful but also extremely tanky. It wouldn’t rival bloodied obviously but would be the best full health buikd by a mile. Far to op.
---
Sometimes when I go to Walmart and pass clipboards and office supplies I want to cry knowing I'm passing up springs.  Making power armor really changes a person
---
Yeah I’ve had to deal with this once, though I’m not sure they were doing it on purpose.
---
Yeah, canonically I think all the rad storms in the Commonwealth blow in over the Glowing Sea.
---
They are still around. I got one last night.
---
in the perks screen (T in pip-boy on PC) one of the options at the bottom should be share when you have a perk selected
---
Only happened to me once since the public teams were added. I joined a couple of players and visited one of their camps. They had a few of the glitched ammo machines in the camp. I then noticed the rest of the team was at my camp. I donno if public team members can build stuff in each other’s camps but I think they wanted to build this ammo machine in mine. Luckily I’m at max budget. Two of them proceeded to throw the explosive bait at my bench area. I guess to destroy them and build the ammo machine. I logged out after the first volley of bait.
---
It does but I didnt sit behind a desk I was a mechanic and dont give a shit about grammar
---
I came from imgur so I got very used to compressing my comments to very few words. 140 characters is difficult.
---
Yeah, I'm amused by people with bright neon Pipboys in NW.  I at least am using the OD green one. I might switch it to the black one if I need to spend a lot of time in NW again.
---
Some kind of special biv nukashine event sounds like good chaotic fun. I don't know exactly what it should be but it needs to involve drinking lots of alcohol and completing tasks. It can be setting up for new flyers around morgantown while getting rid of unwanted guests. Idk but he deserves something more and something kind of silly.
---
If you scrap CAMP items it can get you over the weight limit.
---
When I price fusion cores and plasma cores I do 1 cap per 1 percent of charge.  (25% cap core is 25 caps, that sort of thing.)  May be more expensive than some vendors, but the buyer knows how much charge is on the core by looking at the price.
---
I rolled very similar! It’s so fun to stand toe to toe with a squatch and know he can do nothing — absolutely nothing — to you ... except absorb a lot of your ammo.
---
isn't this "feature" dumb to have the server work twice just for the sak of it? just register once that the npc is dead and let be dead. this resets to the default is just poor coding.
---
Do you have kids?
---
Dont forget the warden from the prison; such a robojerk. I have no doubt he and the mayor are in cahoots.
---
It does not at all take up very much budget. Maybe as much as a regular extractor 
---
And it is true you can't move or deleted...kinda 
---
If you place it on top of a large rug you can both move around and delete it 
---
Honestly, there are no downsides other than the fact it is technically an exploit.
---
Im grown man. Lol
---
Lmao
---
If you are able, the Chemist's or the Grocer's backpack mods are 100% the way to go. They can be purchased from the Raiders (Chemist's) and the Settlers (Grocer's) upon reaching a certain reputation level with them for 350 gold bullion. Chemist's reduces chem and stimpak weight by 90%, and Grocer's does the same for food and drink.
---
If not, you can purchase the High Capacity mod from Possum Vending Machines for 5 [Possum Badges](https://www.reddit.com/user/wickedychickady/comments/gwpnze/a_comprehensive_guide_to_the_pioneer_scouts_with/). Can't recommend u/wickedychickady highly enough! Not sure if you can actually earn these without having progressed through the Tadpole Scouts questline enough to have unlocked the Large Backpack anyway. **But** the plans are also trade-able, although they have a hefty price tag attached. Don't think you'd see one for under 10k caps. There are other backpack mods available from the same machine, but due to the diminishing returns of DR/ER and the hidden Rad Reduction of Power Armor and Hazmat Suits making RR on your armor next to useless in comparison, they aren't worth the effort - *especially* for your first mod.
---
That is the problem its hard to determine.  So I just left the group and found a new one.
---
My friend cane running out of camp screaming "It glitched, everything in the vendor was free!" 
---
I described the camp to him and he agreed it was the one I had been to. I then had to explain that camp had a little stash box on top of his vendor, and because it was dark it was hard to see. 
---
My friend then took a moment to reevaluate his inventory, only to come to conclusion he simply robbed himself.
---
Dam! I was preparing a very similar post myself! With pictures, and hookers and blackjack and booze!
---
And yes, I think new plans need to be added to the basic game, and not just through events, quests, or the Atomic Shop.
---
I'm still going to make my post. With the pictures. And keep the hookers and blow for myself.
---
Gourds are the hardest part of that recipe, because for some damned reason they're hard to find in the wasteland. I gather the other stuff, turbo-fert a few gourds I have planted, and I am good for the day
---
It's a big stretch for the last couple rewards
---
Yes. Reduces food decay significantly, but you have to assign the food like you assign items to a display or vendor. 15 slots, if I recall.
---
It can be. All of those things 
---
Just build it on top of one of those big rugs
---
I can assume that your a fucking nonner if your in then? Lol
---
When you pull up your perks, look at the card you want to share.  On the bottom of the screen, it will say to press "y" to share it.
---
Hahaha!   He's shame staring at YOU, yet HE has her dressed only in underwear?  Bit hypocritical no?
---
What happened to switching to melee if you don't have the ammo? That was my go-to method until I got a bit of ammo built up! What is wrong with people? High levels like to GIFT assistance to new players, not be hounded into helping entitled toons!
---
I wanna see it!
---
I've probably been in 6 teams a day since it came out and yet to see a rad sponge.  Saying most have it is just ignorant.
---
It’s all about the grind.  Grind for everything.  Then keep grinding for more stuff.  As you get to higher levels you’ll grind for different stuff, but it’s always grinding.  The grind never changes, not really.
---
Logged in next day and had six fusion gats.
---
Apparently i was trying to build and buy a screamer.   First SBQ that day dropped a *** furious fusion gat and ultracite charging barrels.....   scrapped a lotta cool gats that day
---
I just got the glow in the dark skeleton suit last night, but that XP grind for that &amp; the winter jacket are real
---
It’s gonna take a day or so. I ran around the wastelands taking pictures.
---
The best one is the secret service with a shielded mod. You get it by finishing wastelanders and buying the plan
---
For ones you can buy from people you'd have to look up shielded linings and see which one fits your build best
---
Have you ever visited Camp McClintock? It is good place for materials you are looking for.
---
Looks tacky to me but if u like it, that’s all that matters.    With that said. That is one of the best looking camp items to date IMO
---
I wish I could with my chick's face. Sometimes she looks like she just stepped out of a vat of baby oil.
---
Ghillie power connectors (drops mic)
---
Word. I clip anyone that gives me guff.
---
Yeah man I wasn't gunnu farm for the jacket. But that double xp was up and I had 6 levels to go to hit 100.so I got it lol
---
If screws and such were easy to get, they wouldn’t be fun to find. I’ve got a bazillion screws, but I still like grabbing typewriters and desk fans.
---
Doesn't it include the floor and walls too? It said so in the description at least.
---
Sounds good! I'll most likely be on around then, too. I'm in Central time, so I'll have a look for your server when I'm on!
---
You trade or you die. Raider punk shoulda traded.
---
Shielded secret service, hands down the best. You have to buy it from Regs with bullion though. My next favorite it's shielded enclave. +3 Strength +2 Perception if I remember right. Depends on your build though.
---
Can those plans be transferred to other character or the armor once is crafted, even to the ones that have not completed Wastelanders?
---
whichever is fine, but if you ever buy atoms or Fallout 1st make sure it's from the same launcher as those wont transfer.
---
Raiders at least give you a modicum if respect, once they stop shooting at you. Foundation? They never learn.
---
Never had an issue but then I also don’t lock anything. Most people are curious about other people’s camp builds and teams make it easy and free to visit and take a look around. I do it all the time; trying to get new ideas for my camp decorating.
---
Yea dont think most players modded the small  ones because you had to unlock the possum badges anyways to get the mod plans or shell out 30k plus caps.
---
The chemist pack is amazing, i picked it up asap after wastelanders released and i grinded enough rep.  No  turning back now.
---
Time to grind rep on my alts lol.
---
Can you hand it over to other players?
---
I bought plans from him after he destroyed everything. Might be why I’m still here. That punk only cares about his radio
---
I’ve actually witnessed this happen at some other player’s camp while I was visiting his/her vending machines...He was battling scorched (I believe) and trying to destroy said camp. I continued to just watch and see what would happened next..of course with the intentions of repairing all the damage done..Grahm finally “died”...when he got back up he was nice again. I believe he aggro’d because he got hit on accident by the camp’s turrets, while they were trying to defend against the scorched. He didn’t quite like it...so he attacked the camp...it was honestly weird to watch. Anywho, I killed off the remaining mobs, repaired the camp and went about my way. 😬😬😂
---
Biv is the best NPC hands down.. (I'm running a Party boy melee build)
---
I love that mailbox idea! A way to improve on that idea further is to add a functioning typewriters that lets you write mail and lets you send it to a friend or a random player in the world. But a profanity filter is required because I’m sure not everyone is going to be civil about it lol
---
TIL that there are short gun racks in 76. always thought there was only long gun racks.
---
Lol your saying make unyielding even more beneficial than it already is.  Bruh
---
It depends on what you are trying to do.  Do you want Str, dex, int, , luck, Agil???  Shielded is great if what you want is what it raises.
---
no. both the plans and actual crafted items are locked to the character they were purchased with, they cannot be sold, dropped, or traded. this applies to anything bought with the Bullion currency
---
I still wouldn’t take him down and steal his junk though, what’s the point, since he caused no harm only entertainment
---
Only if they are free range, fresh and prepared right. Otherwise they taste terrible.
---
This. So much so.
---
But I find the green circle quite small already. Can I fill it up with building blocks without reaching the limit? + the needed items like workbenches.
---
I feel like they need to fix this if it’s a common occurrence, I’m still new to the game and this is the only camp I’ve made. So this has really set me back
---
Don’t give them ideas
---
I agree. Too much limitatations makes 76 feels like a phone game that says you played enough today.
---
How about just a scientist armor prefix.  Doubles effects of mentats and gives 5 int and endurance at max life
---
I've got a Nukashine hangover right now... Biv's a real jerk! ;)
---
Negative
---
Are you on PC? If so, I can come help repair your camp.
---
Watch you tube for "decorating ideas", there's a lock in my house in real life and there's a lock in my house in the game, if I invite you to come into my camp is one thing, my doors are wide open, I have put a lot of time in building my camp and my game house and don't want uninvited "guests"
---
Yeah they should definitely fix that. When u first start out in this game you have limited resources...and it’s such a pain to fix all the structures in your camp. I’m sorry this happened you. 😅
---
&gt;I play since BETA and i know all the tricks. I just see it not logic at all
---
Sadly no, I’m on xbox. But I really appreciate the offer, thank you
---
That happened to me a few times in last two weeks. I thought it's happening because my character is drunk, but it's not.
---
Really need a pirate cutlass skin for my revolutionary sword. Because, you know... pirate, so yeah.
---
It happens everytime notification in left top corner shows up
---
Functional typewriters. That’s dope. Bethesda should hire us as product managers.
---
The issue with cap sinks is that they will never make higher end item affordable. No matter how many cap sinks there are, a 3*B2525 fixer/handmade will still be a trade only item worth roughly 70k in caps (if you could ever find someone to sell it for caps).
---
Imagine making a cool monster, making him super rare to see and then making his possible loot drops absolute garbage.
---
But see, that "Whoa wtf?!" is what kind of makes it special. See plenty of Snallygaster, Wendigo, and Grafton Monsters. Mothman, moreso since Wastelanders and there's an Event so you can see the friendly one easily. It's nice that one has that "rare" status to it.
---
Had a ffr gatling, in test didn't shoot any faster than the speedy receiver
---
That’s fine I’ll message you on here or you can message me. And we can run the silo. Have you ever launched a nuke yet for the main story? If not this will give you the completion for it
---
As long as it's not a banjo, you'll be all right.
---
Yeah I’ll find a way to get the resources, thanks
---
Yeah, I did. 25lbs of space available in my stash, 333 rounds of ammo in the machine. 0 rounds of ammo in my stash. Not sure where the ammo in your stash came from but it wasn't the ammo machine. Unless you're talking about that hack that's been going around where you could exploit the ammo factory's ammo machine...
---
I’m level 260 something by the way but I’m still just getting use to some builds and using different perk cards for damage
---
Yeah, should be the other way around
---
Needs to be holding a shotgun.
---
Sweet!  Thanks for the tip.
---
Why would you put it in there is no institute in west Virginia btw that is the institute power armor
---
I got the skeleton suit so long ago and the beanie but have no idea where I am on the grind to the jacket. Was it like 14,000 NW XP after the beanie?
---
If you move your camp in the pipboy, it stores all the damaged structures and you can place them in the new location, they’ll be fully repaired and it will only cost you the caps to relocate
---
Btw that is institute power armor
---
The only thing remotely looking like an M4 is the screaming eagle skin for the handmade rifle from the atomic shop.If that’s not it then I have no idea what you mean.
---
Glitch. Capture the ammunition factory and blueprint the machine. Can be placed in camp or any workshop.
---
I’d love to see Fixer skins and more skins that make your weapon look new. I love the dark matter theme as it would be great for stealth role playing.
---
Known glitch using blueprints at the converted munitions factory.
---
It was never released in the game, nor it is mentioned in the lore anywhere. We gold.
---
oh no more steel. i sit on 50k in my scrap box. the rare mats i want. i´m not new to the game. is just not logic for me
---
true
---
That seems like a huge oversight on Bethesda's part. Should I report them?
---
If you kill and enemy and it has a gatling laser on it, it'll also have a bunch of fusion cores. If I recall, even if you just loot one, it comes with a core.
---
i know all the mods already
---
Best item I ever bought was the skin for my favorite gun so I can’t trade drop or sell it accidentally.
---
Generally, 'll share Strange in Numbers or Inspirational. The guys I normally run with all have mutations so Strange helps a bunch and since we all run different builds I try to stick with stuff that will work for everyone.
---
I have heard this can absolutely ruin your camp budget permanently. But could be fake news. Also Don’t be a rat.
---
I like to think I just tripped on a branch or stubbed my toe.
---
Your best bet is to check the lfg page on xbox

The nickname you gave the scorchbeasts made me lol 😂

I don't get why there's a cap on Caps in the first place.  From a code standpoint, it's just a number - it's not like the inventory system where it has to have tons of entries for each item that's in a player's Stash.  It's one field with a value.
---
sweet, I didn't know they had that functionality.   
---
Also, random question, is it possible to repair a weapon without using a repair kit? I am low level still but I have some heavily modded guns  that I would prefer to keep. as far as I can tell, repair kits are only available from the atom store
---
Everyone one wants a rework.  The need for new end game content has been going on for over a year, and wastelanders did nothing to help.
---
There isn't a way to check on [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net). However, we found and addressed the issue where atoms were not awarding and you will get an email in the next few days that grants you the missing atoms.
---
After researching the screaming Eagle that's the gun I saw! Can't wait for it to come back to the store again!
---
I've never had a crashing problem with FO4. Must be an Xbox thing?
---
Exactly. Very situational. For instance, I run shielded casual on double XP weekends because of the +3 INT. Otherwise, currently shielded raider for the PER and AGL bonuses for my rifleman
---
I guess. A lot of people are doing it lately. Planting up to 10 in a workshop. I can't imagine on private servers capturing all the workshops and just slapping down as much as possible.
---
Collectron is really the only CAMP item with functionality. I like weapon and PA skins.
---
Also depends on what you care about customizing more, your character or your CAMP. 
---
My first toon, I sunk all my Atom into Skins and Outfits, occasional CAMP things. Second toon, already had the skins and outfits, and wanted to do a Jason Voorhees toon so I got the Log Cabin bundle to make my CAMP a mini Crystal Lake. Got a few other cosmetics to help get the result.
---
Also, there's Legendary Run. You can dump some Atoms in that to push your progression.
---
Secret Service gives 4 str
---
Can't build at other people's camps with public teams.

If you make a new character and run out the vault, hit escape twice during the fade in and for around 3 seconds you'll see some crysis looking stuff. I like that look but it fades back to shiney clothes. They can do it, someone likes the way it is now.
---
I read on the Red Dead sub that what helps from making your guys look less plastic-y is by giving them subtle imperfections like moles, scars, and such but dropping their opacity low enough that they don't take away from the face. I considered doing the same as well.
---
Shielded Secret Service Underarmour gives 4 strength, 2 perception and 4 endurance.
---
Next time it happens, go to social, recents, and pick the top players in that list and join their game (aka your old game) via their xbox profile.
---
This is going to become a mainstay in my camps
---
I have literally 1 Charisma. You get an extra bond bonus out of me and that’s it. 
---
I’m joining your team so we all get benefits out of it, nothing more. Shared perks are just a bonus on top.
---
You can repair a weapon at any weapon crafting table. Perk cards that help would be weapon artisan which can give you up to a 200% repair job.
---
Yeah they’ve had this problem for a minute, the contemporary floors look absolutely horrible from that glossy effect.
---
Thank you.  That was quick and easy.
---
You can just repair with junk at a crafting station.
---
It's delayed damage. You took damage during a fight but the game didn't register it and it got queued instead. When the server and client caught up, it applied the damage and the sound fired off.
---
I love helping people, but I don’t like being pestered into feeling obligated to help. I guess we are lucky on PC not to have text chat, although I’d love to have that so I can actually communicate with others as I don’t use voice chat. One of the major elements of the game is survival. You can get help from others but don’t pressure them into it or harass them. I’ve given people several stims, radaway, 10mms, 44s and other ammos. Now 556 and 45 I’m reluctant to give as those are my main ammo types. Lol.
---
I know about that particular issue but its definitely not the case here. I didnt touch my camp at all when this happend
---
SS is cheap too. All for what 500 gb. Can’t beat this.
---
I don't know bro...  Alcohol: Good!  Video games: good!  Why would you not combine them???
---
Also, it's not like trying to play COD when drunk...  that sucks since you get owned by everyone else on the server.  76 does not require you to be on your A game to have fun.
---
Get the shielded one
---
Nah doesnt happen to me because I dont play that much.
---
Yes, you can repair them at the weapons workbench.
---
That's very true, now that I think about it.
---
The added endurance is a nice match for Unyielding
---
All I know is if Fallout 5 doesn't have mutations it will be hard to play.
---
Ok, the large water jars. Place them in your camp and fill them up with your caps.
---
It’s 500 good for the under armor plan. And then I’m assuming to buy the shielding mod is more gold correct.
---
This is a bug and not intentional.
---
This happened to me about 5 times.  I read that it happens when you join a world where your camp can't be placed and you click "find another world".   I now alt f4 when I see this and it hasn't happened to me since.
---
Luck affects if you get that goddamn Preserved Pie Slice!
---
It also weighs upon your opened loot both in quality and quantity.
---
Being drunk is literally the only way I can tolerate this game...
---
They're going to be like "bunkers". Underground facilities.  I don't care where they are, I just want """unlimited""" budget XD

---
 &gt; This is a bug and not intentional.
---
Been a minute since I bought them. I wanna say it was 200 or 300 for the armor. And another 300 for the shielded lining.
---
what ever will you do without those three level 25 items
---
Totally amazing luck you got there. I rolled 1000 scrip yesterday and the best was an Executioner fixer, everything else was like ghoul slayers black powder with extra bashing quality.
---
Can't wait to try it, thanks!!!
---
Thanks. I wasn’t sure. Guess they just wanted to destroy my stuff.
---
I wouldn't mind Scrapper becoming a Two Star perk card, with the second star letting you get more rare components from scrapping stuff.
---
If only there were more bushes for me to hide in, man I'm leveling up so slow! Congrats on reaching 100, wear that Hellfire paint in pride.
---
Once you complete Wastelanders, public events with the ! will award treasury notes. The four main daily quests for factions will as well (Vital Equipment, Importance of Communication, Retirement Plan, Photo Opportunity). The t-notes can be exchanged for bullion. You can exchange up to 20 notes for 200 bullion each day. Buying bullion from Smiley at the Wayward is available once a week (post Wastelanders), and you can purchase up to 300 bullion for caps (6k caps for maximum bullion). This is best when you have caps to burn or are chasing a specific item. In terms of good t-note events, don’t fall asleep on Jail Break. Also worth mentioning, there doesn’t seem to be a limit on treasury notes you can earn, but you are only able to hold up to 5000 gold bullion.
---
Collectron is cool, there are also coolers that slow food degredation (theres the nuka cola cooler and i think the antique cooler is back in the log cabin bundle if thats still around), the water wheel doubles as a power generator, there are new vending machines to setup at your CAMP in the slocums bundle, weapon skins stop you from being able to sell and trade the weapon that its applied to (though theyre not the greatest value if im being honest) I would consider wallpapers to be up there on the list of worthwhile purchases if you take any pride in your base, simply because the default interior walls are gross. Theres probably more but thats all i can think of off the top of my head.
---
Awesome. That’s not bad at all. Good to know. Guess I’ll be giving wifey my old Under armor since she’s always looking for more Carry with.
---
Congrats!!!!
---
People destroying camps outside of PvP is pretty rare. If you join public teams then you take the risk of people going to your camp. There really isn't much reason to lock most camp items other than extractors.
---
I'd love to see the OG sniper rifle skin. Whether that's for semi-auto combat rifles only, or a weird variant of the hunting rifle, it sure would be fun to see in action.
---
Don't be discouraged. I didn't get any feedback when I originally posted my idea, either. You should still submit it. 😬
---
That's why I don't care too much about people AFKing in events. If they don't hinder with the event/legendaries I literally don't care about what people do.
---
Sometimes they show as workshops
---
Hey there! Sorry the response wasn't what you needed. However, we were able to address the bug causing atoms to not award properly and you will get an email in the next few days that grants the missing atoms to your account.
---
There has been a bug in endurance from the launch of the game. Gear bonuses do not increase your health.
---
Noiiiicceee. Gonna steal this idea *thumbs up*
---
The problem is the tree has a specific detail added to it, a hanging skeleton body, so duplicating it to make a forest just looks absurd because the image is so far outside reality. Maybe if you're trying to recreate a surrealist matrix glitched simulation CAMP, but in general it just looks like copypasta.

They do, I dont use marsupial for this reason (well that and I don't like it). I was asked to share another card because my friends were jumping way to high. For me it just stacks damage so I love it.
---
Fallout 76 was cool..... except there is nothing to do once you get to endgame. That was the whole point of putting into an online environment being able to play with friends and do things. Now, if you count harassing other players something sure... but it gets old quick and you can't do all the cool things you still can do with fallout 4 mods. 
---
My hope is that the next version of Fallout has a single player and multiplayer component but doesn't require you login and fail all over the place like this release has.
---
Well that sucks.
---
Perhaps I should just go back to my private server, I'm done with the whole run anyway, I already reached level 100, I'm just leveling up at this point and I can do that without the pesky grieffers
---
250 for the armour, 100 for the treated, 150 for the protective and 200 for the shielded iirc.
---
If you’ve been playing long enough to learn all the mods, screws and springs should be a non issue
---
Rule 10, you will probably be taken down. Head over to the trading sub
---
I also a bloodied biuld and the worst is when you start your own public team and a guy joins with sun kissed on and I politely ask them to take it off or change it and they get shity with me and tell me if I dont like it I can find another team... bruh it's my  team you leave. This has happened so many times that I dont even ask if you join my team with sun kissed your getting booted and if you rejoin your getting blocked
---
Mutant perk.
---
So cheap.
---
I got mine Saturday! Definitely go in to third person and check out the back end lol
---
I mean, how else am I supposed to make Lemonade? 😂
---
Could be. I installed the unofficial patch later and it kind of helped, still crashed pretty regularly though to the point where survival really was more trouble than it was worth.
---
Bloodied ranged is the definition of overpowered lol i mean boom dead.
---
Do some magazine runs. It’s better to find them than to buy them. Collect every issue of every title is a 40 atom reward.
---
Do shit in my CAMP I can't remove later because 'structure blahblah'.
---
Damn, wish you were on PS4! Would’ve loved to join you
---
I use the minigun a lot. It kind of balances out in the amount of ammo crafted per pressing. Throw on Ammo Smith and Super Duper and you're Scrooge McDuck, swimming in 5mm. Thank god that Bandoleer drops 5mm  weight 0.
---
Yeah because I seen this somewhere on Instagram
---
How about hiring a guard to protect CAMP that also does repairs over time?  Or hiring a companion for extra firepower during quests?
---
If you don't like VATS auto targeting the next character it can be annoying. I use it regularly but I turn it for the imposter so it stops tracking robots instead of the imposter. And before you say "use the d pad to change targets." I'm using that pad to spam stims as I always tank all 3 pylons (as a bloodied build, yes you too can do it) and I don't want to have to manage more buttons.
---
Yesterday I was about to the same. I love this tree xDD

I’ve tried posting there but it keeps saying i’m not doing it right so I got mad and posted it here instead :(

I was once outside of a Head Shop with my Dad and someone had set a banged up clipboard on the edge of a trash can. We both looked at it and said, "Springs!"

Definitely!

You can file a support ticket [here](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10) if you'd like!

If not, your progress will carry over between the two platforms. Your atoms, however, will stay on [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) but your Fallout 1st atoms will show on steam. Hope that makes sense!
---
They literaally have a whole game full of mods that they could pull inspiration from!  I would love to see all of these added as plans and NOT atom shop items.  But it is Bethesda.....so.
---
Are you sure that weapons and Armor have specific id? I have only heard The opposite really.

I’ve seen cranberry relish give me 25% with an added Stranger in Numbers perk being active.
---
Guy probably had it hanging on his wall for a reason, from what I hear it doesn't look great in use. Probs get fixed if it hasn't been already though.
---
Grahm actually killed my miurlurk king. And I lost him because of it. The worst part is my pet didn’t even fight or anything. He kept doing his little walking around thing.
---
I guess placing the poster first and than just place 3 gun racks over it?
---
Items do not have unique IDs.

" A dead hanging radstag carcass stand."
---
I have one under my Camp. Love that monorail tower and the raiders they added with Wastelanders.
---
I'll be on tonight around 530 (also east coast) I'll help you out I unfortunately haven't had the same luck the only fixer I've got so far is a medics but my BEfrs combat rifle does the job and my B2525 10mm auto pistol makes quick work of the mobs
---
Thanks, ya, you can only place it in a few spots. It won't work on the lower branches.
---
Yeah man, I was struggling to find myself the shielded BOS plan and I was so rapt when they finally added the shielded ss plans and it was only 200 bullion.
---
Those fucks are the most annoying gamers.
---
They started showing up 5 years ago. They destroyed fortnite pve mode. Other games. Now they are here. Kill them on the spot. Then chase them until they leave.
---
My nuke, my nuke! Where will you fall? I’m dropping it where the Scorchbeast Queen goes
---
Thx
---
What's really annoying/funny/creepy is when you approach a location and hear the banjo being played, only to find everyone dead.
---
For rifleman/commando build, you want Shielded Raiders for AGI and PER.  The plan is a very rare drop from Uranium Fever.
---
For melee, secret service is the best with +4 STR but it isn't tradeable.  The next best would be Shielded Urban/Forest Operative for +3 STR.  That plan is pretty easy to find near Tanagra Town...you just need to google search for the door pin code.
---
Shielded Casuals are also helpful in specific scenarios, like selling to vendors or hacking terminals.  The plan is a rare drop from Queen of the Hunt.
---
I got the glow in the dark bones costume and the ghillie suit. Never touched NW before The Legendary Run, and I'm glad it's part of the event. Love the prizes.
---
Fruit that never goes bad. 🤔
---
Oh believe me I know what you mean. I’ve been just spending all my scrip there instead of getting modules because I only had to roll almost 80 each secret service leg to get unyielding and they don’t even have weapon weight reduction and took me two rolls for the arms and chest to be unyielding so my luck wasn’t good with crafting other then first time with the guass shotgun I got a 2 star bloodied. So I’ve probably have spent 6000 scrip on the 3 star guns from purveyor and nothing at all until last night and I only could do three rolls and everyone was bloodied and just the fixer alone is enough. But to be able to roll twice then walk over scrip a gun and walk back to roll my third one. I don’t know what happened but I was rolling a hot streak. Lol I would’ve scripped my whole inventory if there wasn’t a stupid daily scrip limit just to keep rolling. Best I got for bloodied from purveyor was. 3 star sub machine gun and 3 star mini gun but that was a while ago
---
Mate.....it gives +90 to the 30 that the backpack already has without mods =120. It doesn't give extra 120 weight.
---
&gt;Sometimes she looks like she just stepped out of a vat of baby oil.
---
Makes sense. I mean, we're practically raiders, and have you seen any babies since they let us out of the vault?
---
I'd settle for damned stairs that goes up two walls in an L, like the ones in all the prefab houses. Drives me nuts having this... thing dead center of a square with void on either side.
---
It's because you're not formatting your title right
---
[XB1] W: Magazines H: Caps
---
Then list what you need
---
That is how you format it. It tells you how to do it when you do it wrong.
---
You get improved repair kits from the queen fight.  I didnt realize that until one day I found out that I had 58 in my misc. Inventory.
---
Ah I see :) Thankyou for sharing that!
---
"Events don't pay the bills" said by Bethesda Marketing probably
---
I leave my purifiers unlocked to share.  It would kinda suck to travel to my relish farm to not find anything you liked.  Least I can do is give you a chance to make back the FT caps
---
Also, I leave my crops unlocked so you can grab gourds for the cranberries you collect nearby.  I can just use my Turbofert to regrow when needed
---
That's your intro music
---
Really, any NPC interaction that tips the Time vs. Money economy towards the money side would make a good cap sink.  I think Smiley has proven that- or he would if they'd fix his dang weekly reset timer.  Making it even easier for players to get in on that market would also help, as they can create the disposable items to sell (and pay cap-sink taxes).
---
Make NPC vendor ammo cheap (e.g. 1 cap/bullet or less if bulk ammo is introduced) and plentiful (several thousand instead of a handful), and wealthier Commando/Heavy Weapon players will routinely dump caps for ammo instead of spending time grubbing for scrap.  Introducing bulk ammo, so the 1 cap/bullet limit can be eliminated, would allow players to remain competitive in ammo sales.
---
Adding NPC chefs with reasonably priced high-stat food might do the same, saving time spent hunting for perishable food components.  On the player side, refrigerated vending machines that completely halt food degradation could make selling player-made food viable. (Conventional refrigerators would need to change that way, and move out of the ATOM store to avoid PTW. ATOM skins could still be sold as they are now.)  Food sales might be a lucrative market, especially for lowbie players with more time for scavenging than available caps.  And given that food is relatively heavy, STASH limits already discourage oversupply.
---
I'm sure there are more items like that, but you get the idea.
---
I actually have the game on ps4 also but I just got it couple weeks ago and only level 5. I gotta start building that character. On Xbox I’ve played since beta and stopped playing for a couple months until October and been playing everyday since. But I wanted to see how PlayStation community was so I will have to work on leveling that character up and we can launch some nukes then
---
Long time no see, and still obstinate as ever. Never change!
---
A ghillie ghillie!
---
I still regret that I never progressed further in the scouts quest line. Since update 20 though I’ve actually been able to complete Campfire Tales a couple of times!
---
I was going for the creep factor. I'm not one to spend countless hours on base building, but it was fun trying to fit the tree in every spot possible.
---
yeah I have a couple of go to runs, but lately i’ve just been getting duplicates so i’ve given up.
---
I don't think it's a common enough occurrence to warrant switching to private servers.
---
You’re so wrong and misinformed, it’s not even funny.
---
My end goal was obtaining the tree.
---
Items sadly do not have unique IDs
---
thank god lol so repair kits allow you to repair without a workbench?
---
Before Wastelanders I was on a mission to obtain all the shielded plans. I got my last plan shielded, marine armor, the day I bought the shielded SS plan.
---
Sure thing let me just put on a Two Star Sun Kissed😁
---
trade caps for atoms / s.c.o.r.e. !
---
Cant complain at the bit of extra damage though ;)
---
We implemented some tracking so we can get to the root cause of this issue and put in a fix that resolved it for most players. We're still seeing some reports of this, though, and are still tracking to resolve this for everyone. I know this doesn't solve this issue for you right now, but I do want you to know it's a top priority for us.
---
If I had more things to buy with my caps I'd be a lot happier to earn them. Unfortunately all the new CAMP items are coming through the atomic shop instead of being purchasable in the world, which I totally understand; they need to make money to support the development of the game. But once I cleared out Studio 58 there wasn't much to save for, except for the neon lights and a few serum recipes, so now I every so often will just buy something I don't need or want to satisfy the cap cap. Even my vendors are really just a method of getting rid of stuff from my stash.
---
Yeah but sometimes I wish i could walk around on a swimsuit or something else for a change lol
---
It's the only way to get the plan without trading as far as I'm aware.
---
I'm curious to know how this is known for certain, if its just because previous games on this engine don't have unique IDs for weapons, or because we're assuming the only ID a weapon uses is its ingame ID, then we don't really know for certain, surely? You can datamine the game files all you like but unless someone has access to the server software surely we can't know absolutely what is and isn't tracked? If it is 100% known, then how did bethesda track the duped weapons they supposedly removed from peoples accounts, without issuing a ban? Not trying to argue, just genuinely intrigued.

This is a good suggestion too.
---
I was wearing my power armor and went to the legendary vendor to sell off legendaries after a SBQ fight.  Didn't realize i was selling the armor i normally wore.  Also (and i have shamefully done this more than once, or even twice) i have accidentally scrapped my power armor which made me too heavy to fast travel and since my stash was full i couldn't store the pieces.  Dammit, i get scrap happy when i've been drinking
---
Yeah that just showed so much personality. It was great 😂
---
I spend a nice bit of time in my camp. I’ve come to love the quiet Vault Tec generator. I really appreciate the no sound and no smoke, especially after visiting camps with the base ones.
---
It's the small backpack. From the over seers box in morgentown airport. It has half the carry weight and can only take the grocer and chemist mod.
---
It was 39 upon login this week. Hopefully it does a big chunk!
---
Sorry to hear that, I didn’t know you could get pets like that
---
I am willing to help you if you can wait until after the dailies reset.
---
People are currently posting obviously-duped weapons.  This isn't how bethesda determined who duped.
---
Well I got 2 other fixers. A mutants and then a zealots. Zealots got the 15% vats refill and 25 faster fire rate. I can trade you one if you want?
---
no you can't really enter any vaults. sorry homie
---
great suggestion. the generators are super annoying
---
They closed the only open vault, 94, with wastelanders
---
You don't use any stimpack with unyielding....
---
You just need to have rejuvenated lvl 2(and eat)or lifegiver ,and hp always reset to a fixed amount.
---
You're basically immortal like this.
---
I have like 6 to go now. I found one last night. Keep it up. It’s a grind. Do the run. Server hop. And do it again. If you don’t know, the key is don’t pick it up if you already have it so when you hop there is a chance a different magazine will spawn in the same location.
---
Bloodied metabrain detected. Go cry in a corner
---
Yep! Especially on Events team, I usually just do my own thing but when an event happens and I check the map to see my teammates there, I’m just like “ahh geeze wait up guys I’m coming!” Best game implementation they’ve done after vendors in a while imo
---
Personally, if my team isn't full I'll check every once in a while to see if there's a better team to join. That said, I've have had multiple times where I left a 2 person (including myself) team to join a different 2 person team (plus me makes 3) and then the person on the team I just left joins as well. Easier dealt with than jumping on the mic and hoping they listen I suppose.
---
 I saw a Ghillie pip boy in one of the datamines. It'll probably be an atomic shop item since it's not on the board
---
any other place to farm
---
Time to reorganize some displays....
---
Any sort of large letters
---
Collectrons, water wheel generator, fridge, water sink or water well, the slocum vendor, stackable nice looking vault tec generators... it’s all I can remember right now. 
---
For a few cosmetics or weapon skins you could do nuclear winter and/or legendary run
---
&gt;any other place to farm
---
Yeah. If you inspect the weapon you’ll see the option to repair it.
---
It was supposed to have resistances, but they are just sitting unused in the game files...
---
I agree, it was the last of the set I purchased as it is a vanity item. I find the helm lamp illumination far superior to the Pip-Boy. It is directional and much brighter.  I don't take my helm off now. If I need to go for a swim I switch to the Marine Tactical Helm for the disease protection. Clearly, this is the way!
---
Most people farm, west tek, white spring, harpers ferry, and the generals steak house
---
I love to mess with bloodied builds by sharing my sun-kissed perk with the team :)
---
Live and let live.
---
I had my camp there for a long time. Sometimes he just randomly croaks. he'll be walking around meowing happily, then you hear a horrible "URRRKKK" sound and find him splayed out on the ground, nothing around to have killed him.
---
His corpse disappears and he comes back to life after a few minutes, even with you standing nearby.
---
His deaths seems to happen after several minutes, as I tend to spend hours building my camps, and he'd die and be ressurected several times over the course of a build. You could probably time it and find the length of time he survives.
---
Also, if you or your buddies run the Plague Walker mutation, it can kill little dudes (cats, rabbits, chickens, frogs, etc.) really quickly and passively so I recommend getting rid of it.
---
All this same stuff happens with the cats near the Blue Zip billboard (near Top of the World) too.
---
I'm still missing a few of the marine ones too =/
---
Hehe, yeah , thanks :D
---
It will be close.  I did the math for myself considering the 9 daily challenges staying, and at 39 now, I will just make it probably on the last week somewhere.    
---
Even if you don't get there I think a day or two worth of xp grinding along the way should get you there.
---
yeah okay I guess i’ll keep up the grind. Thanks :)
---
Some people just want this game on god mode 24/7. Any challenge or inconvenience needs to be patched out.
---
3 stars xp just stuff like that
---
I'm really curious about what you thought this was going to accomplish.
---
or use the built in nvidia shader settings by hitting alt+ f3 at any time you are playing any game lol.
---
thank you! I would have never figured that out as it was my first post on that subreddit, your a life saver!
---
Yeah.  I’ve passed it and the jet pack up for now.  I’ve seen very few with it.  See so many people with just the chest piece and jet pack, but Marsupial makes it not as attractive as Dense mod for Gauss guns.  Bloodied GS even with Fireproof 3 was a suicide mission.  Dense alone has saved me so many times from killing myself I am “meh” to jet pack.
---
But...but...there are literally creatures everywhere haha
---
Shadowed Liberty Prime
---
Your focused application changed.  you may have clicked something outside of the window to change the focus.  Happens to me all the time but if you use discord a lot when playing it is something I learned to deal with.
---
Grind Bog events until you get the protective lining, then grind Census Violence for the shielded.
---
xp? whitesprings, definitely whitesprings, going into every mine in the game is something I do, since there's always mole miners, just clear it out and then get out of there, also any events you see, do them, for more xp gain make cranberry cobbler, use leader bobbleheads, get the well rested bonus, and join a building team :) 
---
(really sorry if you meant farming as in like vegetables lmao)
---
Is it still green?
---
Hey thanks for the report! We're aware of this one and the team is working on a fix.
---
Yeah, that's the point. Most people don't want to do ones that require multiple games, or good luck to get done. All of these can be done in the first 5 minutes of a single game. The adventure dailies are also very easy, so these should fit in with those in difficulty.
---
I tried that and they almost never sold, especially the plasma cores, so I started just using PA and a primed gatling plasma.
---
He's not a griefer.
---
He's not a cheater.
---
You're just bad.
---
 only thing "unique" given to items is the server id of items, which changes when you hop or restart  the server id is used when buying items   
---
class RequestPlayerVendingAcceptOffer
---
{
---
public:
---
DWORD64 vtable;//0x0
---
DWORD VendingMachineId;//0x8
---
DWORD ItemServerId;//0xC
---
DWORD ItemCount;//0x10
---
DWORD CapsValue;//0x14
---
};  
---
 Again, the itemserverid is the only thing unique attached to items, and that changes when you hop/restart

How do you mean, like glitching lights underground?

i have quite a few in my vendor for like 50-100 caps if you wanna have a loook. middle of an event right meow so cannot check which ones. i have backwoodsman 1 on me

Camp is near top of the world.
---
no i ment xp thanks
---
noticed this myself, my camp is close to a raider spawn and they just randomly die all the time.
---
The best is probably the marine wetsuit because it’s actually the only one that can prevent diseases. Getting the shielded mod for it will take some time, but it gives decent stats.
---
There is a planned update for the converter. Right now it just button smashing.

---
It can take *any* mod. Always has been able to, ever since it was first implemented. But up until Wastelanders, the mods were super expensive to trade for and you could only get yourself some Possum Badges by getting to the point of already being able to craft the Large Backpack anyway. Pretty sure the ability to apply the Chemist's/Grocer's mods to the Small Backpack was an oversight rather than a decision, but it is one that they know they will never be able to backtrack on.
---
- Small Backpacks: A new type of Backpack, the “Small Backpack” has been added in an effort to help more players acquire a Backpack earlier on during their Appalachian adventures.  
---
- A Plan to craft a Small Backpack can be found inside the Overseer’s Cache inside the Morgantown Airport Terminal. This Plan cannot be traded, sold, or dropped.  
---
- Small Backpacks have 50% of the carry capacity provided by a standard Backpack.  
---
- Small Backpacks can be equipped with all the same Mods as a standard Backpack.  
---
- Players can still learn to craft Standard Backpacks by completing Pioneer Scout Quests.
---
Nope, its white/yellow like the one on the powerarmor.
---
Its quite cool :)
---
There is a caps cap?! What am I even playing for?
---
i dont even look at the challenges. just play the game and get good gear. fuck the ladder.
---
Cheers man, I don't see census violence much, but I'll keep an eye out, I think I have the protective and the treated. I think I'm missing the resistant, but not 100% sure. I'd have to log in and check.
---
ok il be over soon thanks!
---
You can also use the inspirational perk and sheilded vault suit
---
mutant hounds still howling with no head always gets me lol.
---
“Where’s my ally supposed to live?”
---
Circus trailer, my friend ;)
---
A no teams allowed version of NW would be very welcome. If BGS could get the hacking under control on the PC I'd seriously play a lot more NW if it had a solo mode.
---
A simple search here would show this being talked about ALOT
---
You son of a bitch, I'm in!
---
PS4.  I Have lots of marine plans Armor plans/mods, but not sure about that specific one.  
---
I’ll be on in about an hour, and will check then.
---
Good to know. I really didn't think you could mod them
---
Correct. Never go by the pictures, go by the description.
---
It would sure be a long-term process, anyway.  You'd have to introduce so many attractive cap sinks to the world that the overall player money supply itself drops faster than it's replenished by PVE events (which pull new money out of the air).  We're certainly not there yet.
---
I doubt we'll get unlimited budget. Hopefully at least it will be bigger. And we won't have to devote budget to things like structure and defense, so most can go right to decorating.
---
My suggestion and hope is that they put it in Whitespring. In my dream world I would like to see them put a level cap on mob spawning there, so people in their 15-30 levels don't get wrecked constantly by the level 60+ mob spawns that are always there. Though I guess if they do go with the 'One Appalachia' thing that's on the list to equalize mob strength it won't matter. Ghouls there will be as tough as any ghouls regardless of your level.
---
Then I want them to make it so we can use those sealed off rooms and bungalows with the hand scanners as instance housing. Just go to any scanner and activate it and get whisked into your private room. or be able to go to the room of the team leader/friend or however they set up access sharing. Also make Whitespring another free fast travel.
---
Haven't seen that, but I did find some invisible robots on two different occasions. Once near the surface to air battery in front of Watoga, I was coming from that fissure site near there, and I started getting lit up by what I thought was an assaultron, turned out it was a [cloaked Mr. Gutsy](https://youtu.be/TEJLKSdEUHI?t=21) shooting an Assaultron Beam.
---
Yesterday, I was out there doing some of the challenges near the sunken trainyard in the Cranberry Bog, and I found what appeared to be an invisible Protectron. I never could spot it, but I kept getting shot by it.
---
Probably some structure in you C.A.M.P. pissed off Grahm... you now, he is S.P.E.C.A.L. 😂
---
Maybe if they release one. All the jetpack skins atm are for pa
---
Very nice.  I’m currently in big-save mode having mostly everything else useful (except PA).  I’ll probably pick up the helmet when I get closer.  Haven’t really needed the T-65 yet.
---
Is resistant the one under shielded? I forgot. You can buy some then have to earn the last two from the Bog.
---
I just want anything Nuka World related :)
---
Also, wasn't even remotely used for electricity either.
---
Duping has been around since the game started and just about everything of value has been duped including plans. Usually if they ban someone for duping it is because they had multiple of the same item or large stacks or certain items. There are plenty of people that duped or bought the recently duped items that haven't been banned. Bethesda seems to be somewhat reckless with bans at times but they don't track things as closely as you think they do.
---
"if you're going to play the game, at least play the way I want you to."
---
Nah lmao
---
In my experience only 3% of players use their mic.
---
Okay, so if thats the case and theres nothing hidden that only bethesda can see, how did they track the duped weapons across accounts and then remove them or ban the accounts?
---
What am I doing with my life?
---
Nothing noteworthy. Just another future forgotten name.
---
My headstone will read:
---
"He was a dude that did stuff, I think. Played too many video games and spent his money poorly."
---
If you were lucky enough to grind one out of the treasure hunt. Speaking of did that event get scrapped forever? I thought we were going to have the T-man popping up throughout the year in different areas.
---
Quite annoying definitely, every time I come into my camp and see it down, I'm like wth man, half tempted to remove it. Beyond that, it sucks the other garage door doesn't fit to replace it.
---
The issue still remains that it only takes 22 days to get to max caps by just selling to vendors. I would gladly trade 22 days of caps for a high end weapon because I would never dream of getting that weapon to drop for the same time investment as max caps takes.
---
Awesome.  Thank you.
---
I do that when watching movies and tv shows. See all kinds of trash in the show and I’m like, oooh scrap!
---
I have had this happen 4 times recently.  It is hilarious to watch but sucks on the repair costs.  Plus the bug green lug won't trade with you whilebhebis mad.
---
Haha I'm honestly not sure, I'll have to get on the old google search tomorrow when I play again
---
Yeah, people really hate it when you criticize a game you have paid money for. I don't understand it whatsoever. It's alienating and a defeatist unfriendly consumer policy stance to take. Companies already beat the shit out of us with a -lot- of things. I don't think saying that there are changes in the game that need to happen to make it a better experience for everyone is a negative thing to say.
---
When it lands, when it lands, the try-hards will come around, and the server will likely shut down.
---
Yeah it kinda makes the whole Scouts questline redundant, doesnt it? With the Chemist's mod on my Large Backpack, it saves me over 1000lbs. With the same mod on a Small Backpack, it'll still save me over 975lbs 🤷‍♂️ The last thing this game needs is to start making the *functional* content redundant..
---
Gimme Vim or gimme death!
---
I was making an underground base one day and realized I could stick light bulbs to the underside of the ground, like an invisible roof, and the glow could be seen from above. Once you start the connection you can bring it above ground, too, so you can make structures with hidden wiring that way.
---
I thought at first my cards were broken when I saw a broken red link on card menu. I also didn't understand the numbers next to teammate names and had no idea how to share cards or that they were even shareable.. but this was a while back 😆
---
Not me man— I’ll ignore the 3 star to go for the caches everytime
---
Why no fence, bunker or tent?  Just curious on your logic.
---
Ok thanks
---
Lol pretty much
---
I would give up super duper for the ability to create a stack of something. Then again.. when would I have time to read books?
---
well in Watoga these spawn tubes take care of robot spawns, maybe make it some kind of closed-off barracks whose door opens to release some guards to fight the intruders? Foundation already has log cabins around, add a closed one there and a closed space station part in Crater and you have your guard spawns.
---
The event will come back for sure, but they need a free time frame for it. 
---
Meat week is soon, colossal is gonna be released soon(tm) so they can’t just mix that in there. 
---
Also, with all the duping recently I am sure you can easily find a cheap circus trailer on the trade discords.
---
makes much more sense, thanks
---
I like swapping from inspirational to rad sponge when a bloodied build joins my team. Spices things up for them.
---
Can you send me a link
---
Seems like a bug tbh. Even if you cant add the mods, they should be visible at the workbench
---
I managed to grind two out from that event. I learned how to be efficient at it. Spend caps.
---
If you’re on PC I might be interested in buying your extra yellow and Forrest ;)

Looks like all the mods except for the Prime Receiver only require gunsmith 4.

---
Yes. There is one on the new Season game board. I believe it is Captain Cosmos jet pack.. I'm assuming it's like the Cola-girls, but not red
---
Honestly, I'd just like if Julie had a bit more varied dialogue. I miss Three Dog's commenting on the Vault Dweller's actions and stuff. I know something like that would be impossible, given all the different dwellers acting on Appalachia, but maybe some new generalized talk about 76 opening and the new influx of dwellers, or the arrival of the factions, or really ANYTHING new would be welcome, rather than the same old stories about the station, or how she empathizes with our "hard times."
---
Well the institute made it so that's kinda standard

---
Tasty Squirrel Stew does the same for Carnivore, 20 with carnivore, and 25 with strange in numbers. Canned meat stew should also be affected by carnivore, but I'm not sure what it maxes out at, probably 12.5 with carnivore and strange in numbers.
---
It doesn’t bother me. I play the game and enjoy it. I do my daily “grind”, but I also run around the map with friends and do events, hunt dumb dumbs (super mutants) and build up my camp and my collections.
---
That is horrible luck. I've sold or given away 3 reds so far. I just server hop and farm the area for legendaries or straight jackets to sell. PS4 btw

I've been in a fair number of groups with that as well.  Do we know if it stacks?

There's a kid that occasionally shows up in my crew who was bragging about stuff he got out of the bags at Vault 76. He was level 40 something at the time. Needless to say, we lectured him about what level of "low levels" those bags are actually meant for until he finally put the stuff back. Yeah, you're still considered a low level to many, but you aren't "fresh out the vault" so those bags aren't for you. He's also constantly spending his caps on "cool stuff" so he never has caps to spend on what's actually needed, his stash is full, and we all learned real quick to not give him ammo because he promptly blows through it trying to show us how cool a guns reload animation is. When he asks for fusion cores, I end up giving him all my really low power ones I can't sell in my vendor.

Looking at “Treasury Notes” under the Misc tab in the pip boy.
---
I know sometimes events don’t show rewards on screen at all, they just appear in inventory.
---
More often than not, that status/collection  tab shows “0” for everything except caps (which is usually accurate).
---
I have not been to a machine to check.

Thx for the tip :)

it's like the 4th from the end ... unless this is for Capt Cosmos PA.  I dont' know why I thought it was for SS.  now that I think about it, it probably is for the PA :(
---
Yes, if they do not already have equipped Strange In Numbers, you can share it and boost team mutations. Imagine if they stacked? You'll be seeing teams jumping from crater to foundation in a single bound!
---
thats a step in the right direction thanks, however can i play nuclear winter with mods?
---
I've seen this post every day since the ban wave, get some new material
---
Yes. Been asking for this since I decided to take the plunge and start a new character. If this thing existed I still would have some high-tier stuff I lost trying to transfer with a world container
---
its ridiculous
---
Seems like the frame around it from the poster is pretty perfect. Seems like it has to be something more difficult than just placing one on the other to make it fall into that frame flawlessly
---
Honestly if I have to load into a camp to use the vendors, I'll just stop using vendors
---
Looks great!
---
Let us craft bottlecap mines!
---
This is still not lore friendly, Kurt Cobain was left handed. Are we supposed to assume that this is some kind of magic guitar
---
True! Good eyes.. so what is the trick OP??
---
Edit: just read it, place three gun racks, place three guns and finally place poster!
---
I feel you, I recently restarted Fo4 and was getting frustrated that I couldn't jump over walls/fences lol
---
My cap sinks is serum recipes, collecting every single plan and recipe there is, assaultron recall cards, bullions and most of all: player vending machines. Honestly I don’t think we need more. Alltho I am all for variety
---
You know what I DO think we need? Something else to use our treasure notes for. I have almost 4000 and can only spend 20 a day.
---
Why am I an ass?  For not understanding the description of the jet pack?  Yeah, that makes someone an ass... WOW
---
It definitely looks awesome! Glad you got it! :)
---
Here’s a tissue..
---
I don't think we do, but i'm not sure? I don't really notice a difference in how fast I gain xp with two people in group sharing Inspirational at x3. I usually switch it to Party Girl x2 if I join a group and they already have it. Otherwise if I enter a server with full Building parties, I make a new one and keep the Inspirational X3 up.
---
Exactly. I've switched to melee myself . It's a no brainer to have more than one weapon. The guy who was asking me was a level 8. Why the hell dose a level 8 need 5.56 when you can't even unlock a handmade untill level 15..
---
Pre-Millennium more like
---
Yup, absolutely.  I should have been clearer: I meant sales to vendors to be included in "PVE Events."  Anything that just prints up new caps on demand, instead of just moving them around.  You'd need a HUGE amount of cap sinks to balance that out, reduce supply and keep cap value high enough to be viable for even high-end sales.  And those added cap sinks would need to be interesting/entertaining, too, or it just becomes a grind to pay the rent.  We have RL for that!
---
Frankly, this game would have been a lot better if legendaries didn't exist (and it was balanced accordingly).  Then weapons and armor become a matter of crafting, with a few named quest reward items giving (minor) added effects.  Imagine if the Voice of Set or All Rise were considered power items in the game, instead of just scrip trash.  But grinding for legendaries is so much of the game, and there just isn't enough content (yet) to support it otherwise.  Too late to change now, though.
---
Saw a post earlier today about applying the Ghillie Jetpack Skin to the SS armor resulted in no jetpack but still took the materials. Probably check for further details first, cos it might be bugged like half of the rewards in this season seem to be.
---
Edit: here is the post. I'm going to sleep, or else I'd help look further into it.

---
Triple A quality.
---
Pretty much every public team I join is doing it solely for the benefit anyway. We don't actually go around doing content... I might see some of them at public events, but then we go our separate ways afterwards. I just join the Building teams for that sweet Intelligence boost, Charisma perk and mutation bonuses.
---
Yes. I'm always collecting flora 🤩
---
So you give it away? I mean I’ll take it what’s ur username
---
You don't want Bethesda to hotfix things! While it would be cool if they actually could fix things that fast the last few times they attempted a 'hotfix' it was more of a 'hot mess' afterwards.
---
When you unlock it, do you have to have the orange / red paint on it, or can you just make it metal / grey?
---
Love the armor, but would like it without the obnoxious paint job.
---
I could be wrong, but I think the marine tactical helmet is what prevents diseases...not the wetsuit.
---
They will often show things in the atom shop preview images that aren't included when you buy something. For example, the new bundle with the mounted Sheepsquatch head shows a small Sheepsquatch plushie next to the lamp in the first image. That plushie isn't included in the bundle.
---
You have to read the description and if it doesn't mention in the description that the thing is included, it isn't.
---
So if what you bought was the backpack skin, and it never mentioned the tent in the description (but maybe had a tent in one of the images), all you got was the backpack skin, and you won't be able to change your tent.
---
This is from a post I made several weeks ago.
---
* **Step (A)** Go find an Assaultron, preferably more. There are several locations that have assaultrons, but there are at least four that spawn around Watoga. Three can be found patrolling along the southwestern walkway. One will span from a bot machine near AMS corporate headquarters. Destroy the assaultrons and loot them. Each assaultron has a chance to drop a scrap assaultron head. Repeat as necessary (server-hop) to get enough scrap assaultron heads. You can start step (B) below with one scrap assaultron head, but having more makes the process a lot faster. Keep an eye on your total carry weight as you can only hold 1,500 pounds above your character's maximum carry weight. This is important in case you need to fast travel to your C.A.M.P. or other location with an armor workbench.
---
* **Step (B)** Equip Super-Duper rank 3. Go to an armor workbench. For each scrap assaultron head you found in step (A) you will craft an assaultron helmet. Each crafted assaultron helmet requires 1 scrap assaultron head and 2 steel. Each time you craft an assaultron helmet there is a chance for Super-Duper to proc so that you will craft two assaultron helmets instead of one. Therefore the more scrap assaultron heads you initially start with the more times Super-Duper has a chance to proc.
---
* **Step (C)** After you are done crafting assaultron helmets in step (B) go ahead and scrap the assaultron helmets. Each assaultron helmet that you scrap will produce 1 scrap assaultron head and 1 steel. Reminder that each scrap assaultron head will weigh up to 8 pounds.
---
* **Step (D)** Repeat steps (B) and (C) until you get a lot of scrap assaultron heads. Again, keep an eye on your total carry weight. The last time I did this I started with 11 assaultron helmets, and after 10 "rounds" I had 163 scrap assaultron heads.   
---
* **Step (E)** Scrap all but a handful of the scrap assaultron heads. Each scrap assaultron head will produce 3 circuits, 1 silver, and 1 screw. I suggest keeping 5 or so scrap assaultron heads. This way you can go back to step (B) and repeat when you need more materials later on.  When you are done then use the remaining scrap assaultron heads and craft assaultron helmets. These only weigh 0.1 pounds so you can put them in your stash box without taking up too much stash box weight.
---
Probably several ways but here's the thing. They have a lot of tracking tools even without unique IDs but using said tools is another thing. 
---
Most likely, they tracked the method used in the dupe- inspect the inventory - see 30 of the exact same item- done. 
---
Tbh, they could be a lot better at this and should have done a concerted effort a long time ago. 
---
As far as "innocent" players- its quite possible that someone used the method a few times but didn't really abuse it. I know a few people are claim to have been unbanned. 
---
But most ... they are lying.
---
Items **do not** have unique IDs. This is misinformation. Remember, if that was the case, it would be much easier for the server to auto-correct for dupes and we wouldn't even have this problem.
---
Instead, the ban appears to be based around the mechanism by which it occurs.
---
Those who were banned but claiming innocent are either lying, or unknowingly server hopped enough times to get flagged, in addition to other actions Bethesda might be searching for.
---
I just want the pink one.. but still yet not come to it.
---
Gonna piss off many players with that 😆
---
Not sure about paint but it’s worth some scrap oil to test.
---
Right! I know I can console command some of it in, but really hope it's baked in from the start for the next one.
---
Paints and skins counted as modding weapons for a SCORE challenge so, maybe it counts for the achievement as well
---
&gt; usually make my own team instead of joining an already formed one, but last 2 times I decided to just join them. Well, the first team I joined, the leader came to my camp and stood in front of it for a good 20 minutes, just there crouched with the stealth suit on, invisible, I could only see the marker and the name on the map, they didn't move or did anything, just stood there and then before leaving tried to destroy my water purifiers but I blocked them before they could.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;The second team I joined, the team leader showed up at my camp right as I joined the team, trying to get into my camp, looking in every window, trying to get into my water purifiers and my collectron, I have no vendors, I don't sell anything, and everything in my camp is locked with a level 3 lock, because I'm not interested in visitors inside my house, I do have a designated "guest area" with food and water for others to come chill around the communal firepit. So when they realized they couldn't get into my house (which I took a long time building) they kicked me out of the team and started trying to destroy my camp with mines and all kinds of explosives, to which I just server hopped.
---
If a house is locked in game some players look at it as a challenge  to get in and leave some fertilizer and toilet paper on the owner's bed.
---
Provided you have a minimum of 3 charisma, you can share level 1 cards.
---
It should be a wood scrap generating pet.
---
Shut up. Jesus.
---
The cir led area never gets bigger 
---
Again, depending on what you build of course, you'll probably never really be able to fill up that area before you hit budget
---
Materials are practically unlimited in the wasteland, just mod the weapons.
---
Don't make it a Fallout 1st thing. Sell it in the Atomic shop for $20 (maybe $15 on sale?) That should eat up most Season Atoms awarded, and serve as a drain for 1st people with excess atoms. Make the stash size a full 4000 lbs, and delete the individual character stashes and I would love it.
---
While helpful, seems like the opposite of what the major in-game builders would want out of building. The major builders have been wanting to build further out, like small towns or forts, an underground bunker -while 100% cool- doesn’t fix the major concern, which was being able to decorate a cool base above ground. I’m hoping they’ll find a way where you can just lock off certain buildings as “instanced interiors” if you have the enclosed on all sides. Also don’t know how having generators will work for this. Are we going to have connectors that can access an interior space or will we have to put more generators down? Just hope it’s more than a simple trapdoor! The building community has been waiting for a mechanics update since our base stopped being removed every time we logged in.
---
lmao!
---
Just wait til you are literally dropping them because they add weight you don’t need and you never use enough haha
---
The first four bulletin points you listed actually sound great and would improve the game world as a whole making the game feel more alive after you’re done with the wastelanders quests. 
---
All the NPC do after you’re done is just kind of sit there. But NPC he’ll even other players that you can gamble with as a casino would make this game feel even more alive. 
---
NPC that can repair weapons for caps give me some strong New Vegas vibes and it could be a great system for players who don’t have a surplus of repair kits from the queen, or the junks to fit it themselves. But again Bethesda might not want to do that as that means less atoms spent on regular repair kits. 
---
Again these sounds great and I would love to see most of these in game.
---
Both my high levels are mutants, so I always share Strange in Numbers when I join a team if it isn't already. Otherwise Inspirational. If both of those are already shared some sort of utility card like Travel Agent or Lucky Break.
---
Looks like I was mistaken. I hope they come out with one soon.
---
Oh good. We’re all blind. 
---
Will have to see if you need to keep the guns placed. I wouldn’t mind just have an illuminated cork board, but I don’t have the stash for that 🙁

Today we salute you Mr. Ghillie Ghillie  designer of Fallout76. (Mr. Ghillie Ghillie  designer of Fallout76.)
---
I also share tenderizer most of the time if a team isn't sharing it already. Squad maneuvers is always nice to have.
---
What system are you on?
---
Really?!  Wish I had your problems! I guess they need to let us drop caps like inventory items.  It would be nice to drop 50 caps along with the usual diluted stimpack and radaway care packages in the newbie locations.
---
Yeah I’m level 118 and finally getting burned out on the game so I can see why
---
Nice to see someone with some appreciation of coding on an engine rather than just moaning about lazy devs!
---
Do you know if this still works?  Looks like it hasn't been updated in a while.
---
Sounds like it was more a chore with all the repeated location loops and keeping buffs up, congrats on finishing it though thats some dedication I would get burnt out doing that though time wise bit hard for me. Just taking my time with it, it's nice seeing rewards to work towards
---
Yeah, I liked the look of the actual Institue building on the inside, but the clothes and the weapons were ugly. Plua the synthetic armor was horrid too except for the one face mask.
---
It just works.
---
I honestly think that what Bethesda will choose to do is use the current character linked gear system introduced with Bullion to add more weapons and armor that is higher level and considerably better than any current unlinked legendary. This would cause a drop in all high end gear value since it is no longer end game gear. This probably won’t happen though until the next major update; maybe when the brotherhood returns.
---
I had his healthbar pop up briefly after exiting a building today as my reticule passed over the vista..  Have no idea where the heck he was, but he was there.  Somewhere.
---
Hahah, screw jet packs! I feel like shared cards should stack with diminished returns per stack.
---
You can only craft what you picked in the quest. I have found the others in player vendors.
---
I have the opposite problem. I take forever to clear out a place cause I gotta check everything and pickup everything.
---
I'm always the last on my team to leave an event cause I'm still running around finding every meat pile to loot. Then take ten minutes to find a bench to scrap at.
---
I got 76 problems and weight management is all of them.
---
The battery acid is what gives it that tangy flavor.
---
This literally happened to me today on a random team and I run bloodied.. I asked my teammate to remove it but 90% of the PC players either don't use headsets or what.. ignored me so I just left.
---
Nah bethesdas dev aint do shit. Totally not gamebreaking to leave perks fucked for 1.5 month
---
The wetsuit protects against water born disease. Its my go to shielded. I don't wear anything else
---
Yeah I've been waiting ages. The neon signs and letters from vendors look cheap and tacky
---
Thanks for your response man, thats very interesting. So these claims of "I only had one weapon that may have been duped, but I didn't know" are probably totally bullshit, good to know.
---
LOL I ran into one the other day where the NPC stopped walking down the street, laid down on the ground &amp; t-posed. Went over to check it out &amp; was able to loot their corpse.  
---
Not to mention, random dead bodies dropping out of the sky. This game's a damn trip sometimes
---
The only thing you put on display here is Douche logic.
---
I'd like to see more lenses and things. Maybe a flash. More camera stuff in general would be interesting and fun for me.
---
&gt;Then they're doing it wrong. 
---
Players are doing it wrong because... they aren't investing a bullshit amount of SPECIAL points into Charisma to share perk cards? Let's be honest, the system used to share perk cards is total bullshit. No one should be forced to spend their points into one category just to share cards. It really should be level based at this point.
---
They 100% knew about each other and communicated with each other. It says so in the game.
---
Is that the extra xp in a team perk? I have that maxed out and often share that too. However, I never know if it works because it’s never in my Status Effects.
---
It's bit crap when a marine wetsuit helmet is better in terms of defense. Water and airborne
---
Reds.
---
It's the Seinfeld bug.
---
wait why would they not... do this..
---
Would be great especially for Inspiration perk for a edge more for the XP hungry
---
If you see a bunch of level 100+ characters in the group, I always share Sun Kissed to help them out :)
---
It takes a sec for the server to even register my inventory when I load in. Always get the overencumbered sound at the beginning of a session and I'm not even close to being over.
---
LMGs are the worst magic ones. 
---
For starters, if you have a two shot explosive, means it doesn’t have any of the magic effects (junkies, 33vats, whatever) as all magic effects are first or second star and both are taken by two shot and explosive. 
---
Second: not saying you didn’t see a magic effect, but chances are there was another player shooting too or server was extremely laggy
---
Third: don’t just test on behemoth or normal scorchbeasts. If you REALLY wanna know if your weapon is magic, launch a nuke on a private server and solo the queen 
---
I specialise in testing, recording and selling magic weapons. The reason I say LMG is the worst is because (and Angry Turtle said this in one of his visa) the effect usually takes a few seconds/shots to start happening and the LMG has really bad spread/accuracy and a real small magazine. 
---
And yes, server lag and fire rate is when the effect is the strongest. From all my guns and tests (over 50 different guns) the best result ALWAYS comes from a two shot mini gun with accelerated barrel. It needs to be aimed down or two shot screws with accuracy too much. If too many shots miss, the effect is worse. 
---
More info:
---
After angry turtles video about magic shotguns i came to realise something. I talked to Angry Turtle and he said I was probably right, then I tested it and I was indeed correct:
---
Equipping a piece of armour that has the “15% block”, makes any gun magic as long as it’s either a shotgun or has more than 200 fire rate
---
So I tested with a bloody/25FFR minigun + piece of armour and indeed: it was magic. I took off the armour and it stopped working.
---
Explosive, much like two shot “virtually increase fire rate” but SBQ is immune to explosive, I’d never use a explosive weapon on her unless it’s a legacy one
---
To answer your question: two shot alone or two shot and explosive is strong, but not magic unless you equip a specific piece of armour. Which obviously will not work if you are a power armour user.
---
If the paint/skins don't work, then one of the muzzles is probably the next best option.  I think one of them is just aluminum and adhesive...and then its free to remove.
---
I just want a skin to turn my brahman into a pack brahman. The assets are already in game. Ghram, blue ridge etc, they all have a pack brahman, I want one too.
---
share Sun Kissed and watch the bloody/unyielding folks cry
---
My napalmer basically destroys itself quickly durability on it sucks
---
Hahahahaha
---
If you're the team leader, don't be so quick to kick people off your team if they're not sharing a perk. Happened to me the other night, when I was playing one of my characters I hadn't used in a while, I joined a team and was in my perk menu to share a perk, suddenly I'm kicked off the team for unknown reasons. I assume it's because I wasn't sharing a perk when I joined. 
---
I understand kicking people off a team who are disruptive for whatever reason, but if you've got a team of 3 bonded players and a fourth person joins, seems like screwing the rest of your team over to start kicking people for 'reasons'.  
---
I've been on a few teams and keep seeing members of the team getting kicked off with no obvious reason. When that's happening to me, I either leave the server or go start a team of my own. Chill the fuck out team leaders, don't screw everyone on the team over because of your personal preferences.
---
Haha I wish I could say it was cute. I prefer the smaller pets though, thats for sure. I had a little white radrat pup that I found all the way out in the mire and I was so scared for it getting back to my home in the forest. Luckily I was in private and it turns out no enemies will spawn unless a player is nearby, so aslong as you let your pet be (and I assume, no other players venture across it), they should always make it back to their new home.
---
So pretty!
---
also...maybe take your time on that one. That will happen organically...VERY easily. you will mod stuff as you play for sure. you should not have to grind that one out at all.
---
Need an npc who sells scrips for caps ... would be a pretty effective caps sink.
---
what's a legendary banana cost anyway 10,000 caps?
---
Bethesda.
---
Ghillie camp.
---
Showing cards that are already max is actually a good thing, like when it says you have to rank up a card, bit you are using max rank cards already. That isnt as necessary until after 60+ though.
---
Nothing to do with code.  It's the economy.  More caps are coming in than going out, so caps get devalued.  This affects game balance (store items become easier and easier to afford) and player-to-player sales (legendaries costing tens of thousands of caps, because the market can afford it).  Cap limits are the last ditch backstop to try and control runaway inflation.  And given that high-end items just can't be had for caps anymore, even that is clearly not working.
---
Pcs great, players are cooll but there are just tons of people that complain when people play the game. Griefing doesnt happen 24/7, no cheaters on adventure and there mods. Only problem is the pc player base was small and they killed 1/3rd of the vet players on pc so its all just low lvls now
---
Just afk it. In about 2 or 3 days you'll have it. Totally worth it. It's the best looking reward imo.
---
The more reason to lock my house and better yet go back to my private server
---
This is only the fourth week so how have you gone to level 28 on legendary run off one week? Something you're saying ain't right.
---
Appreciate the response, I honestly thought one of your employees had gone full sadist on us :D
---
Some people are just now even realizing that you can share perk cards, as many players were strictly solo before the public teams.
---
Yesterday I had a level 80ish player on my team asking me about the thing beside my name. Neither of us had mics so we communicated by writing with the small letter set at this camp.  
---
Once I figured out what he was asking,  I explained to him how to share a perk card. Of course, I also only recently started using teams, and only then discovered that you can share any perk card, not just those under Charisma (because all the 'team' cards are in Charisma I ignorantly assumed only charisma perks could be shared).  
---
So while I get the frustration, a lot of players are only now learning about this functionality. I've also only been playing since Wastelanders came out, but have fallen in pretty deep (level 168 and a 2nd character at level 42).
---
I used to have a CAMP west of Hemlock Holes that would have all manner of critters around it.  Frogs, Beavers, and Radstags.  Sure, sometimes it was hostile Mirelurks or Radscorpions, but you take the good with the bad.  They weren't tamed, but I treated them like pets.
---
Yea that's exactly what i tried to explain when bunch of dumbasses keep shooting at her no matter what, you can tell how she approuched ive she has the intention to land. I keep wondering why people keep on not noticing it and Just keep up firing hillbilly redneck style whit drool (i Imagine) coming out their mouth!
---
Thank you very much. Is it an item that rotates in atom shop?
---
I swear to God, they did it on purpose.
---
I had Raider rep bar at a level indistinguishable from max for three days before it finally rolled over into ally.
---
Every time I was like "this is it, this is the one" it wouldn't do anything, and then when I was finally like "it's broken, but whatever, I'll use the gold at 79," it popped.
---
If they just put the numbers under the bar like XP or Score, it wouldn't be so bad.
---
Board or baseball bat.
---
Wish I thought of that, I probably wouldn't even bother though, I just block them - permanently.  One less douche to come across in the Wasteland...
---
It's out right now
---
Must be a bitch to mow :)
---
I share the aquaboy/aquagirl perk when joining random public teams. I like having that stuff on when traveling to other camps because some of them make you spawn in the middle of the water way too often.
---
I’ve not tried it for xp farming but would a silo be a good place?  Always loads of things to kill in there lol thoughts anyone?
---
Sorry but you’re wrong ;)
---
Wetsuit protects against water disease. Helmets protect from airborne disease.
---
Man, don't get me started on the interior of Cracker Barrel.  Looting senses go into overdrive.
---
When you‘re in the weapons bench menu, select “Workbench Repair”
---
That lets you repair with materials on hand.
---
I do as well, also everytime I load in, I get 10 syringer ammo and sometimes a new power armor chassis. This is part of the game loading and the data being updated as it loads. 
---
This is more an issue where loading takes time and there are likely other issues going on in the background that are just unnoticeable as they only occur during load.
---
Not so far, also highly doubt it ever will
---
u dont need first to play, just rnb tho if u start using it you wont be able to change the play mentality if quit
---
Those radrat pups are so adorable. Every time I see the encounter with the eyebot playing flute music leading a bunch of them around I destroy it so they can be free. They're always non hostile and once they just stood around which let me get this great photo of the gang.
---

---
Coz it looks like its the size of a jetpack you'd wear with the captain cosmos suit, I made the same mistake. Pretty sure its PA only though :(
---
Im not there yet
---
Use level 5 weapons, low level mods are cheaper.
---
Maybe saving armor state as a single object similar to when wearing it, then display as a whole.
---
You can eat spoiled meat as a Herbi.
---
Ah, ok...that makes sense.  Thanks for the clarification.
---
Yup, still works! You do have to disable all mods for Nuclear Winter, but if you use Cloudy01's Fallout 76 Mod Manager, it can take care of that for you in the push of a button.
---
I don't know. 
---
I got a furious Furious gauss minigun on my first or second roll, accidentally scripped it, bought the clandestine paint so that wouldn't happen again, and rolled a TS shortly thereafter.
---
In maybe five rolls, I also got a TS gauss pistol.
---
Two rolls of SS chest, and one was UNY.
---
Sometimes the RNG Gods giveth, but we boost luck before we roll, just in case.
---
Makes the happy go lucky card (Charisma) useful for something other than VATS or skill checks.
---
That's one of the best parts about building where the level 1 critters spawn, lots of random pets to enjoy having around.
---
hmm, that could be it.  Talking on the dataminer's discord it sounds like this is an old bug that maybe has regressed back into things.
---
/u/ladydevann is this a known new issue, or should I file a ticket?  thanks!
---
Similar thing happens to me - but in my case I hear thunder everywhere. Have to restart my game completely to get rid of it.
---
Not sure if it's available in 76, but in 4, you could remove the hammer of a sledgehammer, which counted as a mod, and then adding back again.
---
I just got the SS under armor and shielded mod. I did this before getting the dense mod for my SS chest piece. It's really a good deal.
---
I took the shielded brotherhood that I've had since before lvl 50 and gave it to the closest new player on the map.
---
Does not work for me, at least on xbox. I keep all of my 5.56 on me at all times and at no point have they shown up in my stash and they definitely do not appear like the items in the fermenter or display cases. Plenty of stash space available. I can only collect them from the ammo machine.
---
I bush wookie, use the ghillie suit... and deliberately use the bright blue and yellow Vault Tech pipboy skin. Makes it so I have to put effort into hiding in said bush :)
---
Didnt they say that they cant track items due to limits of there tools?
---
I don’t know what else to say but “Damn”...
---
have forest on PC, hmu
---
9 charisma is waste imo, no maximizing

Your locked door makes me want to get in even more. I LOVE camp building. I love seeing what other people make, especially if they put in some effort. I see a lot of 5x5 with work benches than line the walls. I cant stand those. But when you've locked your door, you must be an expert camp builder with an awesome design inside. I need to see it. 
---
I lock my green house, I lock myammo machine. I lock my collectron. Locking the house? Nah it's not like someone who comes in can actually do anything. What someone's going to turn off your light or turn off your radio?
---
Showed up 5y ago?
---
Lol I have met beggers in never winter nights and Diablo 2 and that way before world of warcraft, which took the cake. I’m talking 15+ years here
---
There is an option to make your things less glossy ... problem is, you have to *add* new lines in your ini files.
---
The feature "at fault" is called "enlighten" and there's a lot of lines to change to be able to tweak it to your liking but I haven't found the line to actually reduce the "glossyness" of things ... reducing the distance at which the effect happens helps a lot to get some more FPS, though.
---
[Check this link](https://pastebin.com/y8nKA9WE) and look for the "Enlighten" section. You can also completely disable it to see how it look like but it tends to make the water glitchy.
---
^^btw ^^thanks ^^a ^^lot ^^to ^^whoever ^^uploaded ^^that!
---
dont go for the 12m.   Anything could happen in the next year.  go for the monthly.  Also no they wont discount, why would they? (would devalue it)
---
I remember when they found an "unknown corpse" in his house. Inimmediately said it was him, and everyone got pissed. A week later, "Wait, i was right?"
---
Sage has addressed the other issues, but as for your question on returned accounts, I've been tracking this. After the suspension wave, 1 of 3 things can happen to a suspended account. None of the options is to have your account returned without duped items.
---
Outcome 1: permanent account ban.
---
Outcome 2: account restored, fully reset, with all items removed. No items (duped or otherwise) whatsoever.
---
Outcome 3: account restored, with all items (including duped items) fully intact.
---
Yeah I named my little dude Ratticus and one day he died, I was so distraught. So I got a sloth named John Slothy, then he died. Then I kinda got sad and didn't get a pet for a long time til I found a Deathclaw and he got chomped by a glowing yao guai, so I've given up on pets for now until they can be invulnerable.
---
Grenadier works for sure, and stabilized should but I can't confirm it myself. It's considered a Heavy Launcher, as Bear Arms reduces its weight.
---
Hell yeah.
---
I think part of the problem was them removing the gas mask qualities of the veil.
---
That must've been it. I scraped it and put it somewhere else and it worked. Thanks for the advice!
---
Make it so people can be in guilds. Give guild halls. Make caps and junk used to upgrade. Make caps to upgrade stupid high cause it's not supposed to be solo-ed. Something like 10 mill.
---
Take caps out of holiday gifts and mole miner gifts.
---
This is me too.
---
You have a good xp grind for the repeatable?
---
I was going to make a Kurt Cobain character, until I realized that flannel was only under armor.
---
Would also add the [ushanka hat](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/26/85/e8/2685e806a5cdfcd038e3ed81fc9ff38c.jpg).
---
Love it. Yes it would be a cool idea if the pve/pvp factor at workshops could be chosen by a beacon you build that kicks off the defense waves
---
Don't bother with it at all. The way the weapon durability works in game is every time a bullet hit an enemy it degrades your weapon so if you hit 5 enemies with one shot it does 5 times the damage to your weapon I was getting twenty shot out of mine before it broke worthless.
---
Slept on the arm too long. Pins and needles.
---
Yeah. True. But Heavy gunner doesn’t up the same but Demo expert does so maybe stabilized doesn’t because it’s “explosive” for that? I don’t know hahaha.
---
I feel you should be able to share as many perk cards as yer charisma will allow. 15 charisma you can share 5 levels of any cards...so dumb we can’t
---
Was the safe at the workshop?
---
Language please. There are youngins about.
---
Thanks!  I'll have to try it out
---
Just because you put something in bold doesn't make it true. Please educate yourself before writing paragraphs discussing something you have no clue about.
---
yeah the disconnect is real. The devs should be attached at the hip to whoever takes care of support. That's the only way for them to get any useful information before it gets lost in the void. But seriously it just feels like devs make a game and then stop supporting it as soon as it comes out anymore. Onto the next project, forget about anyone who wants to enjoy what they just made
---
Also rereading all of this it makes a ton more sense now that wastelanders is out. Claim a workshop and place a “settler beacon” for pve or a “raider beacon” for pvp.
---
Oooh
---
Like I said, my door is open for anyone I actually invite in, just like me real home, it's called being respectful of others, it's the principle of the thing, more than worrying that someone will "turn off my radio"
---
I sadly cannot drink due to medical reasons, but I’ve gotten absolutely blazed and gone into public events 1 hitting everything.
---
I see you shaved your beaver.
---
Gone forever because fo76 has a shitty economy
---
They’re lost forever in Todd’s wallet.
---
Even then it's hit or miss. I go on the lfg looking to queen hunt but every time someone posts their world is always full. bothers me lol
---
A cap sync that is also capped which takes caps.
---
Heavy Gunner specifically states non Explosive Heavy Weapons. This means Launchers are exempt while Explosive Legendary weapons like Gatling Guns are boosted. Demolition Expert is the direct perk for launcher's damage.
---
Explosive radium is legacy. You’ll never find one and if you try to trade for one, prepare to make a contract for your soul. Alltho with all the duping, a kidney might be enough.
---
Yeah. I just want to try all the “heavy” weapons (explosive included) and I asked because I don’t have the plans or on so was wondering. Like the Fatmas isn’t good at all imo
---
Mate this is the worst con of this bloody game
---
If you kept rolling Todd himself will walk out of a closet and shake hands with you lol. I’ve rolled so many at murmrgh’s but never got three bloodied in a row, not event two, what you encountered is just incredible. Three nocturnal or troubleshooters happens quite often for me though. Your crafting luck isn’t bad at all, from what I read here some players rolled months without an Unyielding piece or bloodied shotty.
---
As someone who has low charisma I love it when people share r3 inspirational (and tbh I rarely see it shared) but if you want to share something different I'd suggest a weight reduction perk
---
Crying even harder with my TS2515 auto grenade launcher.
---
It happens after playing NW then switching to adventure, just close your game and reopen to fix it :)
---
As a daily PC player, no it isn't. Ive never even seen someone using one. 
---
Hacked items are super uncommon, I've only seen reports here on reddit. None of my buddies have ever seen one either.
---
Cheers. Once again, I was only asking due to not really wanting to take sides in the whole "I was banned and I'm innocent" thing without knowing what was really going down. I've seen threads from people saying they never received a ban but logged on to a missing weapon or two, but I don't know the specifics of those claims, they were just random threads on this subreddit in amongst all the other angst and garbage.
---
@OP
---
I had a 1star bloodied radium from lvl 70-150 when I started getting gear for my build. I loved that thing. 
---
But now, I use a Fixer
---
So...you're asking if it's possible to remove the paint?
---
My shotgun is bugged. I love the damn thing. It one hits everything that isnr the sheepsquash ir sbq. I try not to use it in cat with other players around but god damn is it fun to solo things.
---
Fireproof would be handy for lower levels but a lot of people will already be using it as it's kind of an essential. I think sharing must have perks is something best suited fir organised groups. Was grouped with someonw yesterday sharing starched genes. In principle this is a really nice idea but it's not worth risking relying on. The universe being what it is it's safe to say that person would log off just as you walk through a decon arch. I normally share things like inspirational if I'm on a high char toon or something like lightfooted on low char.
---
I want to say there are three different lenses. Do quests for Davenport at the Overseers house to get the patterns.
---
Just stop hitting back, you're aware of this already. Play the game where you try to make them waste all of their ammo on you. I like to start a chase with them when they start shooting at me, eventually, they get tired or run out of ammo.
---
Agreed, it has killed my sales of other shielded armors.
---
Honestly, I prefer people causing her NOT to land, because otherwise she dies in less than 10 seconds.
---
I like it when inspirational 3 is shared. I think most builds are low charisma, so most people don’t run and can’t share inspirational 3.
---
My characters have around 3 charisma, so I usually share either travel agent or thru hiker 1.
---
But it need to cover the display! So you cover that bright light and dont get spotted 😆
---
It's not that hard to make ammo? I just started with the game pass..
---
Ah. I forgot heavy gunner says non explosive Heavy weapons. Thanks. I guess if I get one look at the accuracy without stabilized and the check it again with and if I get an accuracy boost on the weapon stat card then it should work with it? Is that a good test?
---
TOO IMMERSIVE
---
Is it true this armor has a bugged chest piece with a butt flap? I keep reading about that but never see a picture. Butt flap or not I'd still be wearing it.
---
Any locked item in a workshop zone, will give you a wanted level when picked (I'm not sure about terminals, I think theres a locked one at the munitions factory, might have to test it). This includes doors and containers. You can usually tell if its going to give you a wanted level as the item should be red when you aim at it and the lockpick option comes up.  
---
\*EDIT\* Fixed some typos...need to get to bed, if there are anymore, too bad.
---
We have the Gilly suit American, The brand new vault dweller, a suspicious murder, a astronaut!And The Gilly suits brother!
---
It's canny if your on your own at line in sand and glitch the spawn but like I say it breaks so easy and the mods for it don't really do anything are you on Xbox I've a 2 star stalkers you can have for free to try it out you need demo expert 5 for them to be effective
---
I remember before launch the nuked zones were hyped up to be these awesome awesome zones where creatures came from everywhere and would require everyone working together. It seemed like a zone where all the creatures would be 100+ and would be all the biggest creatures in the game and more. Not just a scorchbeast Queen.
---
Yeah I got those. It's just a fairly fun feature for me, and I was thinking it would be cool to see it expanded on.
---
Just a heads up, there's a limit to all forms of currency. Scrip limit is the worst imo.
---
It’s a mouth melting delight. 😂
---
Why would taming creatures need 9 points of charisma?
---
I'm jealous, i suck at in game photography 😂 great job OP 💓
---
It breaks fast but if you have the resources to maintain it its fun
---
That could be. If I had the perk and PA I'd check.
---
The beds have been more empty then usual the last couple weeks. It’s even hard to find the dirty and weathered variants on the beds. Everyone must be farming it. Or, less servers?
---
I appreciate the saltiness over the bug parts, that was uncool, but you remain wanted until someone kills you so it was going to happen eventually.
---
Not sure why you are getting down voted, I mean does the game actually tell you there is a limit anywhere? I don't ever remember seeing one, maybe it pops up a warning at some point? Either way it should be made more obvious (I mean it should be impossible to go above the limit in the first place but yeah) Same goes for scrip.
---
Could you imagine them adding a chance of waking up with a limb asleep or something, so you have to wait 30 seconds before you can start running or aiming. What fresh hell would that be....
---
I've only been playing this ~~he~~ game for like 4 days and I can answer that - because they're divas who say things like "I'm more of a shotgun run and gun type of guy" and refuse to listen when games tell them "you need to figure out an alternate strategy here". I used to have a guy like this on my friend list. That first quote is something he actually said while causing us to fail hard during a  GTAVO heist. *Used* to. I got sick of that dude's shit and wrote him off a couple years back.
---
Nah. Sorry PS4. But thanks though!
---
You know you play too much if One More Pils is *still* stuck in your head.
---
Gone for-everrr
---
Agreed.   Really only need 3 or 4 people who know what to do and working together to get the top rewards.
---
I finally completed it for the first time today because other people decided to show up but nobody collected ore but me.
---
Anything but sun kissed
---
Pictures , posters and signs are some of the most overlapping friendly placed items in camp building. It's really helpful.
---
Glitching them on walls for lights, cliffs, water wheels... You name it. 
---
Hell, on the mothman 4 post bed, you can attach posters on the ends because they just happen to fit on the frame.
---
Yeah it bugs me now that I found out about it in the worst possible way........ 
---
I should have given the bloody gun away
---
Great! Thank you for your help!
---
Hahaha. And if I had it I’d test it too. Same problem different scenarios haha.
---
-30% aiming/melee damage. wait we shouldn't be giving bethesda any ideas...we KNOW they love to create hell for us!
---
edit, noice username
---
Yeah it’s a nice magic weapon except against the queen
---
Its one of my favorite events. I don't mind collecting the ore. I'm at a high enough level as it is to give a fuck about legendaries and xp. Problem is nobody does it on ps4. But when people do it they understand to help me get the ore.
---
I'm glad this comment has more upvotes than the thread itself. I get tired of people railing on others for not sharing a perk when charisma is useless for a lot of players with how they want to be specced perk wise.
---
Haven't encountered a single instance of this and I've been almost exclusively in public teams since they launched.
---
Ah, that explains it. I was kinda tired and didn't really notice if it was red. The pop up didn't stay on screen for very long either and I only read the "damage" part before it went. Oh well, live and learn.
---
Yeah, I'm hoping they're at least planning to add a few new lines and maybe even songs to the radio with every major content update.
---
Do you need to keep all miners alive to get top rewards?
---
I also got 100. Went up some 30 levels in the past 2x. It was awful. Won’t be touching that game mode for a bit.
---
If you really want some skins for guns that aren’t in the Shop rn play NW, there’s a glitch where you can get the Halloween and Christmas skins for some guns like the CR or Minigun, it ain’t much but at least it’s something
---
Yeah they should add a zero at the end of all limits.
---
Accept my humble updoot.
---
I would be tempted to make him my standard ally just to get him out of that basement and give his poor lonely soul some attention.
---
Hah that's awesome.  I am on your same timeline.  My wife asks if I am going play video games the rest of my life.  I said no, not just video games, I am going to browse Reddit and Youtube for build and weapon videos.
---
How quickly is this updated?
---
And of course the RNG would be stupid. Never get the legendary you want, but you know every time you wake up you're getting the "pins and needles" debuff.
---
You're a real masochist there.
---
I know the feeling...I heard helicopters other day at work and my first reaction was to shoot them down...fortunatley my nail gun wouldnt shoot that far.
---
If you are on PC you can select a perk a hit T on your keyboard. Other platforms I don't know.
---
You people. What have you got against mannequins? They never did nothing to nobody. Just trying to pin whatever wrong doing you can on them.
---
I have to assume you got auto completed and meant implement. Lol.
---
Yeah I'm usually the only ore collector.
---
Having high luck, charisma and agility would be my go to. High charisma for sharing top level cards, high luck and agility for faster crit building and more AP. Iirc a medics shotgun can deal a crit every other vats shot if you're up close. Each pellet that hits adds to the crit meter. I'm in the process of changing from a vats crit build to a medic/vampires vats build.
---
Shoot at cars, im not kidding
---
All for finding new ways to spend in game currency. So tired of battling scrip and cap limits. Any attempt at improving the economy is welcome.
---
Yes, you need all of them alive and gather ore to reach 4 out of 4
---
I just had a thought-- if we are all making a ton of scorched Nuka's and them distributing across appalachia-- wouldnt that hurt the bottlecap economy ? I mean, sure-- there are some that are going to be destroyed via wear and tear, or just lost for a long time because they are trapped in a not to safe or easy to find spot...   
---
But i wonder just how many of these we've made--.
---
Bethesda stated in the same notes that they can't reward the lost score directly to affected players. 
---
Probably for the same reasons they can't give lost gear back.
---
Yeah the legendary ghouls are low level anyways. Though the legendary deathclaws and floaters can be max level.
---
If one is trying to grind xp for the legendary run, this event is perfect.
---
Plus you can collect a decent supply of nuclear waste at the end too. If you don’t mind looting 100 or more meat piles...
---
The hell they should...
---
Don't pick locks in workshop zones.
---
Thank you that’s good to know!
---
A few ppl saying this but no roof just because previous games didnt have them doesnt mean this one doesnt Every legendary is unique pretty much not to mention legendarys are new to fallout in 76 so could have easily been added with unique ids to engine.  Nobody has a real idea why ppl getting banned and how bethesda catching them out and this makes the most sense I believe most saying they not using unique IDs are just worried because they probably duped themselves sometime in the past and are thinking this might actually be true.
---
Fuck todd
---
No doubt. I wish there was more info in-game on the Mega Sloth though. Since it counts as a cryptid for challenges, I figure it could be Bigfoot.
---
I'm happy when someone has travel agent shared. I like saving money
---
I usually go Strange in Numbers, but if it's taken I'll go 4-Leaf Clover or Aquaboy.
---
Yes I noticed. But as OP said, they never introduced it, so it isn't.
---
Heck yeah to this!!
---
&gt; After literally one whole year of this thing existing, I finally reached Rank **29** in Nuclear Winter and got the  **Slocum's Joe** PA paint!
---
fixed.  all i want is the pink sprinkles armor!!
---
I dont mind doing it alone. Having all The ghouls to myself is sooo much xp. But i would like to get The rewards tho
---
THAT FUCKING SUCKS!  you really need that one to make way as you're getting into the high levels &gt;:C
---
Or you can be the ahole sharing sun-kissed in a team full of bloodieds. 
---
And yes he did this on purpose because he wasn't sharing it when I was the only other person on the team.
---
I tend to share mysterious savior 3. Who doesn’t like a chance to get revived?
---
TOO true. during the mole miner treasure hunt my RNG was stupid good. insane. nowadays it's back to normal :( thankfully I'm mostly blessed when crafting legendaries though. goooood stuff!
---
pins and needles would be so bad. it's already bad enough, how long I have to watch tgat damn canned animation of getting out of bed....I'M IN A HURRY GET UP. GET UPPPP
---
wish there was an alarm clock feature that forces my character to hurry tf up. the wasteland waits for no one, Drumhead!!
---
Someone doesnt remember the canvas bag. Have a 3rd party make the plushie and let bethesda sell the rights.
---
I always carry a hazmat suit in my inventory in case this event starts.
---
Oh oops ☺ yeah, stupid phone, that better? 🤣🤣
---
Make sure you wash your beaver every day
---
I just miss being able to sell ammunition. Im a melee build: i have a shitload of ammo i never use. And i dont really like the idea of setting up a shop and putting my currently secluded cabin on the map.
---
Dammit! I put on my lucky underwear today.
---
Depends on what you need. Shielded raider is still best from a combat standpoint for any vats user. Shielded vault suit is nice for the int and luck (xp and crit fill boost)
---
"""fixed"""
---
Yikes a nuked zone and a rad storm pass the rad x and radaway
---
I still have ingrained excitement every time I see a bobby pin thanks to the Fallout franchise.  
---
Same with seeing a cigarette carton. "This may weigh 2 pounds, but I am going to haul it to Rivet City for caps"
---
Mine was a TS too. Sold it after repairing it 5 times in a single queen
---
That might explain some of it, but other times, it's downright reliable.  Like, when I used to walk from Harper's Ferry to the nearby Poseidon electrical station, I used to reliably stub my toe, every single time.
---
to be fair the mg42 never even recieved any mods.
---
I don't even sleep anymore. I use the fire pit from the atom shop. It gives the same buff and you just sit down then stand up.
---
Yea its fun for the ones camping a killing ghouls hogging the xp. But the runners dont get shit.
---
Lastnight u/threeball20 and i did one theres was 2 dudes one  215nish another just over 370 both using BE gat plasmas and sitting at the top of the tunnels 100% hogging all the ghoul kills. Such an asshole move. Made zero effort to run at any point or let othwrs get hits. Just sat there hogging xp. Did get a laugh when they killed themselves multiple times. 
---
Might not be popular opinion, but shit like that makes me say , fuck explosive energy legacies they should be removed from the game.  Especially since now theyve been duped like crazy. Theyre not in the loot n pool for a reason. Switch the explosive to FFR so people dont loose the weapon  and be done with it.
---
Now i do I like this event with friends on private or if you get considerate people. I like private with 3-4 people. One person gaurds each side, and 1-2 run the ore grab it and dont turn it in. Than we switch. The ones gaurding run and the runners gaurd. That way everyone gets xp. Only takes a few min this way. Than you hold all the ore until the last 30 seconds to farm ghouls and turn it in.
---
What a crock most are just lying. I hate that attitude of you know better and the internet is just full of bad people doing bad things. Get off your high horse. Inspecting inventories of millions of users would demand SERIOUS manpower and still most times wouldnt prove anything especially wouldnt let them know if you traded it. Going back to my point on people making mule accounts purely to glitch and there main accoutns getting banned too even without multiple weapons in inventory. I mean tts very clear the F76 team is extremly small at this point and theres no way they just went player by player looking for bannable offences.
---
Are you launching them soon? Or what are you tryna do?
---
It doesn't.  You don't get benefits from duplicate perks, you just get the highest level. At least not when any of the perks me and my friends have tested [inspirational, weight reductions, and damage perks]
---
Not to mention those tasty, tasty extra free fast travel points...
---
Pffft.
---
My brother plays on Xbox. He's got the best gimmick for ammo beggars. He tells them he'll show them how to dupe ammo. 
---
He has a camp cliffside just for this reason.  
---
He tells them if you jump from a high enough spot, where you're falling for more than three seconds, it'll let you access your pip boy mid drop...
---
Then you drop your ammo before you fall and die. But you have to be quick....
---
When you drop and die it dupes the ammo. 
---
Some players don't believe him. He shows them some 10mm ammo. Jumps... Dies... Right beside a bag his girlfriend leaves down there with double the ammo so he can prove it. 
---
They jump. They die. He has a laugh.
---
Guess I was lucky I found tons of Lead and just started making my own.
---
So I went to all four sections collecting ore and could only get level 1. Do I need to use the excavator or something?
---
they didnt, they were recording the vendor interaction
---
There’s plenty of sources for all of these. I literally sell them all in my vending I get so much just playing the game and knowing what items have them.
---
Yeah.  The only negative is that they are always considered hostile even if they aren't, which means they force that fast travel countdown to happen every single time they are around. :\\
---
I'm actually going to be getting a few of the camp bundles tonight (log cabin, Slocum's Joe &amp; the set that was released yday) so I'll be doing this at my cryptid Hunters cabin. my main however will be sticking to her bed, though in saying that, my builds are so close to complete that I won't even need the extra xp soon enough (until i decide to waste more time on another new build)
---
Nothing like joining a team where all four people are sharing Travel Agent.
---
Stay month per month
---
I make a space. What do I need, food, water, ammo, a place to sleep, shelter, stash. Okay the basics are done. Now it's time to fill in space. Floor decor and stash boxes are your best friends.
---
Is breaking in and playing the piano, sleeping on your bed and leaving unwanted items being toxic?
---
My bad
---
IIRC the higher your effective charisma, the higher your roll chance at pacifying and commanding an animal. I only know secondhand though.
---
That's what I never got. Trap bases kill you before you even get to the loot, why even bother putting the loot in at a fair price? I'd put a single "You've Been Insulted" paper at 1000 caps.
---
I can still get xp. Not much. I load up on radshield and hop in my excavator power armor. Because I modified it with tesla coils. You still get xp/loot and get ore as well. Though I pick up my legendaries and drop them next to the bodies. For others.
---
Its not heartbreaking for a lot of players, its exactly what we want. Personally I don't care if players pvp or not, but if it isn't in the game at all then it means that only adventure mode pve content will be the focus. And Bethesda has a hard enough time getting that to work right
---
Yes!
---
Did that exploit get fixed? I'd like to put a stash box next to my vending for convenience.
---
the lack of unique ids is what makes duping possible
---
I like to find non beggar new players and leave them some pretty good low level gear and aid. 
---
Nothing too amazing to ruin it, but good enough to help.
---
I think it is actually implied in game that it might be mutated from the sloths that were kept in the Garrahan Estate by Isaac Garrahan!
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Mega_sloth](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Mega_sloth)
---
i've been playing since july 1 and i'm almost level 90, i should take a break probably
---
Yeah outside of the dailies there really isn't a reason fore to want an XP boost. I'm level 143 now, I've got my armor, I've almost got all my weapons, what more do I need.
---
You think I have the budget to do that? Awesome idea though.
---
It's also the minimum for sharing rank 3 cards - the vast majority of cards out there top out at rank 3.
---
I admit that my current stat array isn't min/maxed - but why should I bother with that? Unyielding gives you a +15 to everything but Endurance, and the way the game is designed there is little effective difference between a 20 and 30 stat in that there's no noticeable performance loss.  
---
For example, the monsters that need you to have a 30 in agility to evade them are extremely rare if they are in the game at all - I think the ones that can spot you at that point will just auto-spot you *regardless* of your stealth score.  This also applies to vats hit chance, melee damage and a host of other things.
---
Having a score over 20 is gilding the lily. Meanwhile a full unyielding set guarantees you'll do just that. So at that point your special score determines what cards you can run.  And for a long time I wanted to run as many agility and perception perks as possible - then I downloaded the perk manager mod.
---
That is as major a game changer as the Fallout 1st benefits. The ease of changing loadouts based on current activity theme is huge. My special is chosen to support these rapid change outs.  My themes are Commando, Sniper, Infiltrator, Craft &amp; Haul, and Heavy Guns. I also have a load out specifically tailored to the Radiation Rumble event.
---
They always claim that when someone loses items. I've been told that twice now. I know they have also banned accounts that didn't directly dupe but had stacks of weapons.
---
Modded machete destroys things at low levels.
---
Just an assload of med-ex.
---
The problem is this game isn’t a full-blown MMO, has too many duping bugs, and no grand exchange or similar mechanic -plus there’s no exchangeable currency that everyone can benefit from(high lvl junk weighs too much and caps are worthless now). If it was, the RNG would be reasonable enough. There’s a good supply and generally speaking the players who play longer would be more likely to get the item they want or have a straight-forward way to acquire the items the want. But Bethesda hasn’t done any of those. 
---
First, they need to make caps worth something again, then create a global market so players aren’t getting scammed on trades and can easily find the items they’re looking for. Then they need to redesign a lot of the in-game mechanics so duped items are immediately removed or made unusually and can be fixed on a case-by-case basis. If they can do that, the RNG works. 
---
But honestly, they just need to make each legendary perk where it works just as well, but only for specific builds. Bolstering(still needs some work) and unyielding for instance both work well enough for bloodied, but for very different reasons. I know this is a lot, but there’s just a lot of major moves Bethesda could make that would actually turn this game into a “10 or more” year project like they originally claimed. Otherwise, it will die out with the next major BGS game release.
---
No it's fine the way it is. Charisma support builds need an advantage. Perk sharing is that advantage. Being able to share a tier 3 perk is a boon to a team and it requires you personally losing out on optimization. 
---
If you took that away all charisma would do is influence sell prices. The other stats have more useful passive effects or govern damage boosting perk cards.
---
Not sure. Usually within an hour I think?
---
I'm not sure when they added it, but they added a minimum level requirement to get rewards. Someone else said 30, that sounds about right.
---
I made the crazy mistake of playing it with my lvl 35 during double xp week. All those tagged ghouls I told my self. All that double xp. I spent the whole event running for my life. At one point I had a pack of ghouls and two legendaries chasing me in circles while I searched for the lvl 300 Player in PA to save my wimpy ass. Most fun I had all weekend.
---
I’m interested. I wouldn’t be opposed if legendary enemies dropped these sorts of receipts instead of physical items, either. In fact, my perfectly balanced carry weight limit would be very grateful to not be lugging around 1 star junk to the nearest legendary exchange.
---
I fixed it
---
Just restart you pc and it will be fine
---
I always keep my bathrobe on me for these occasions. Does that help?
---
The raiders skin for the handmade is a mix of gold and rust.
---
LMAO
---
Different honesty ;-)
---
Poof.
---
Seems to be updated now
---
Yeah, that's a fun way to play mind games with the bloodied builds.  Rad Sponge is similar fun.  If you equip and share it and everyone takes off their rad protection in the nuke zone then the rad heal will trigger frequently enough that no one will actually die from radiation, especially if someone else shares rad resistance
---
In fo4 my settlements were massive and uocked budgets
---
In fo76 just having a 2 story house 1 collector and turrets maxes
---
Then displaying anything just blows the limit
---
I have most of the repair kits from the legendary run up to blue path (so like ~25) and I have a decent sized stash of junk.
---
part of why i think perk sharing should be 0 cha minimum for at least 1\* perks so that way everyone can share something.
---
but sadly the first thing people tried to assume was that i was a bloodied build trying to get free perks...
---
i hate bloodied.
---
Unfortunately no I lost where it was and couldn't find it again
---
But is that a bug or?
---
No dont need the PA, but you need multiple people running if you want level 4 rewards.  You get about 40 ore for all 4 tunnels. Need 100 total. The ore respawns very slow . You can about 50-60 by yourself by the end of the event. 
---
You need 2 people to collect all the ore from 4 tunnels , and one person to collect atleast two of the tunnels to get the 100 for level 4 rewards. Its bestnif you can be orginized and have the 3 people hold onto the ore untill the last 30 seconds or so, that way you can keep farming ghouls.
---
You can also do this with long gun racks, just put two posters side by side and run long gun racks across. I like to finish it off with the nuka girl at the very top. 👌
---
I would still want enemies to drop gear for the rolls
---
It's one of the "Defend the workshop form X" types that you can get if somebody owns it.  IIRC it's just 3 waves of a singular scorch beast each wave, but the last one has a decent chance to be legendary.
---
Rad rumble is 100% my favourite event. I wish you could trigger it, or that we had a mode similar to it
---
Want fo1 and 2 a clicker
---
I know people who join scorched earth for the repair kits. It just works.
---
Its 30k, but there are like 5mil in plans and items to buy from vendors. The caps cap really only affects extremely high level players or people playing the game for the market aspect. A casual player might make roughly 3-5k a day if they are trying, so really it takes quite a long time to reach the point op is talking about. Not that I disagree with op, but if you are new to the game this shouldn't be a big issue for you.
---
I like to share aquaboy it's a pretty handy perk.
---
The helmet says it protects against both.
---
exactly. my main is in her 240's, and my melee build is 112. my melee build is 7 levels away from completion (I changed builds around lvl60). all I need to do is acquire full matching unyielding sets but that's not even an issue thanks to the secret service stuff. I'm actually very happy that we can craft legendaries now. it takes a huge load off farming for scrip/wasting time on Murrmghrghrgrh
---
Springs and gears are easy peasy if you tag them for search.  Battered clip boards, phones, globes and desk fans, adjustable wrenches
---
Screws less so. Especially low level.
---
Point them to your vending machine.
---
I run a support medic with 9 charisma. I chose to be able to share tier 3 cards, I don't expect everyone else to share them.
---
I'm glad they limit perk sharing, it should be a more exclusive thing that those who spec heavily into support can really use to its maximum while those who lightly spec into it can give some minor benefits.
---
They would never have enough camp budget to display all the stuff on the walls. Lol
---
I always equip that to whip up some Formula P after a Project Paradise run. Double flora is a solid bonus (especially with how rare Ash Rose is).
---
Get another friend who needs their kill 76 wanted players and you both get something done. Terminals go to 450 I believe.  You can make s shit load of doors and pick lock them too, they stop in like the 700 range. Get those atoms!
---
Yeah Rad Sponge is great for that.  Sun Kissed is just so damn sneaky.  Like suddenly I find myself overweight and unable to damage anything.  AKA my real life build :-D
---
Judging by the number of complaint posts about it, they knew it would be one of the most desired mounts, therefore it will sell well.
---
We've been getting some complaints about the "new formula".
---
The upside to the secret service stuff is that you don't need rep, just complete the raid and you can get it right away, so it's less prohibitive than faction specific stuff.
---
Yeah. Have the same Hellfire outline shown there, just in grey?
---
That's rank 44, and was the only armor I used for months until finally getting some Inferno paint. NW really does have the best PA paints, even better than the stuff in the store if you ask me.
---
I've had it happen twice, not in a row. You are not fucked forever. Just shit luck if the draw today
---
A flame weapon with Friendly Fire perk can be helpful if they get damaged while people collect ore
---
NW def has some cool rewards.  I can't stand to play it, so they will remain out of my reach.
---
One of my favorite farms is as follows:
---
*^((Note, you do NOT want to log out at ANY of these locations. When you initially spawn, you spawn at L1, this sets all the mobs around your initial spawn location to L1-6, unless another person is already nearby, which means the mobs are already dead anyway. Point is, keep your logout/in well away from the areas you want to farm.)**\*\*)*
---
First loop for caps/xp is Blackwater mine (i only kill the moleminers outside, venturing inside will get a lot more miners, but i cba to equip my hazmat suit for the rads) &gt; Welch Station (kill all the moleminers in town) &gt; Nicholson's End (kill the Super Mutants) &gt; Beckley Mine Exibit (clear mobs, capture workshop in passing for the xp, then ignore it) &gt; Beckley Town (visit Sal's Grinder's and kill the Glowing Ghoul or Glowing Wendigo that is always present) &gt; Brim Quarry (Clear the spawn area of moleminers, run up the hill and clear upper quarry of moleminers) &gt;&gt;&gt; Equip excavator set to buff carry weight then TP to a vendor to offload. This should net 800-1000 caps (if you have decent charisma/hard bargain). Moleminers drop a lot of loot.
---
Second loop i run is the good old Huntersville &gt; Wes Tec &gt; N.A.R.A &gt; Sugar Grove route (many high level Super Muties/potential legendaries. Be sure to visit the basement of NARA for frequent Boss Primal or Legendary Mutant. After running this route, TP to Solomon's Pond, turn south and run to the unmarked pond for the L95 Ancient Behemoth.
---
Then my Cranberry Bog route starts at Abandoned Bog Town. Clear the mutants, move to the workshop area, clear those mutants, Kill the L95 Boss Ancient Behemoth, capture the workshop for the XP, move east to the pylon, kill the two Glowing Fog Walkers/Snallygasters &gt; Tp to Quarry X3 for a frequent Legendary/Glowing Mirelurk spawn in the work shed (sometimes a queen will spawn from the quarry lake) &gt; TP to Thunder Mountain Substation to kill the L70-90 Glowing Deathclaw &gt; Run south to the Blood Eagle fortress clear everything (the Boss mob at the top can occasionally be a legendary &gt;&gt;&gt; By now im usually done, but occasionally, i will now go cherry pick some high level Robots at the various Firebases and RobCo RC. This route will require either frequent vendor stops, or very selective looting.
---
\[Edit\]
---
I dont ever bother with Whitespring, because the ghouls dont drop shit. Unless you desperately need anti rad meds.
---
Right. The tactical helmet prevents both. The armour one (and most other helmets, gas masks, etc) only from airborne. 
---
But the marine wetsuit is still the only under armour that prevents a type of disease.
---
Add me Alonzo_4EVR
---
Too many fuckin' times, my guy.
---
That makes a different beeping then the workshops
---
Oh that's not bad then I'm at level 65 I thought once it happened that was it. Thanks for letting me know
---
Good point! I was bringing it up for the score challenges, being that it can be hard to find a locked terminal on the days they're required. But yeah, at some point we all need to get those free world atoms too!
---
I mean, we're supposed to be the best and brightest. I'm pretty sure I could probably get a screw or two untwisted with a butter knife...
---
Or my thumbnail if I'm really dedicated.
---
Yeah, I'm working on the ammo factory from the raiders now, then it's onto the rest of my SS armor. Had pretty good luck on my first two pieces, got 3* vanguard within 5 builds each, so I'm hoping my luck continues once I finish the set. I haven't made an alt except to level up for the daily, so all my limited time has been focused on one toon.
---
I just think of it more as a sample like you get from the food court at the mall. A small taste of a much larger menu.
---
Yes I guess the gods where with me. Oh thank you baby Jesus/Todd
---
Whatever helps you sleep at night. It just seems a little strange to be so uptight over a game designed around creativity. Apples to oranges, nobody really cares about your irl cookie cutter house. "Sweet architecture bro" is a sentence nobody irl has ever said.
---
Yes, eventually.  It takes lots of armor scrapping to unlock mods, noticeably far more compared to scrapping weapons.
---
For the record, I share the scrapper perk because it is one point and that is all I can share because of low charisma. In the past I did not have any one point perk cards, but I do now and I try to share them.  But I don't care if other people don't share perk cards. I personally join public teams for the XP boost.  Joining a building team and equipping the inspirational perk gives a nice XP boost that can help you level up faster. Leveling up has become a daily challenge requirement and it's harder for those of us who have played since Beta and have leveled into the hundreds.  Joining a public team helps to get there easier.
---
Steel, while abundant is one of my best sellers. 
---
Ammo crafters buy it by the hundreds.
---
Agreed, teaming up is great and gives a bit more community etc but  i don't feel compelled to have to do anythign with my teamies. If i see they're doing something or emoting i generally help out but if i'm in the middle of something then whatever - no one gets mad as they'll need to do the same thing later.  
---
Lastly my CHR is 2, i can't share even if i wanted, if i could add another CHR point then i would have already. I have two points into whatever the better trading value card is. That being said i like the synergy that public teams provide that adds **value** to Charisma builds - i think that's good for the ecosystem and doesn't punish people.
---
Or you can just go to Poseidon energy plant and find 2 terminals to hack Whitout getting bounty 🤷‍♂️
---
Sell your steel. 
---
Ammo crafters buy it like mad.
---
Yeah, I always lock my Ammo Converter and Collectron Terminals, but it takes mats each time to lock them again.
---
Not a bad way to grind the Possum Badge as well as any daily/weekly challenges for Hacking.
---
Edit: You can't hack your own terminals, but it's handy for friends/randoms.
---
Some people will wait until closer to the end to collect ore, since everytime you collect 25 the enemies change, and to also maximize the amount of enemies that spawn for more exp.
---
Tenderizer is pretty good for general play, especially SBQ fights, I believe the dataminers confirmed that Tenderizer does stack from multiple people up to a specific cap. [As in multiple people using tenderizer allows multiple procs to stack. One person can only trigger it once] so it could lead to a decent boost in DPS if you don't have someone with a magic gun melting her in 30 seconds. 
---
Squad maneuvers is pretty good if you're doing farming speed runs.
---
That slot is always a discount item for fallout 1st members only so I'm guessing that's why you can't see it?
---
As a Canadian, I approve of this.
---
Yup. It can be brutal. A few weeks a go I hit the cap limit by selling some stuff in my shop. I was able to rush over to Whitesprings and buy about $3k  worth of plans I did not have to give some breathing room to my cap stash. Then out of nowhere a 3 star explosive fixer that had been sitting in my shop forever sold for $13k. I was out the $10k difference and a rare fixer.
---
 [My spooky shop](https://i.imgur.com/SOoVVzl.jpg) is not set up in a way that I can close off my vendor machines easily. In time when I redo it I plan on making a garage door I can close over them so I can close up if I near the limit again. For now, whenever I hit $20k I just start tossing caps around at player camps and buy up bullion.
---
Inferno paints are cool. I am so close to getting my first one
---
Every once in a while when the streets i walk through are mostLy empty and ghost town feeling. My brain just starts up the wanderer song and i start to feel like im in the fo4 trailer heh.
---
Is the little sheepsquatch in the picture next to the duck lamp (?) included in the bundle? It's so cute but it's not in the details of included stuff. 😥
---
That must be it then, he is a 1st member, that answers it.  Thanks
---
It's already a 1st thing unintentionally. 
---
When you leave a private world, and rejoin within a few minutes on a new character, you land in the same world.
---
Drop stuff in suitcase at train station. Switch characters. Rejoin. Collect.
---
My commando was wearing shielded road leathers (perception and agility) but some days ago I went for brotherhood of steel undies (strength and endurance). 
---
I want the extra carry weight, and Unyielding armor already sets my agility and perception at 27-30. 
---
My casual character (the one I roleplay with, no fast travel, no mutations, no mules) wears shielded casual, which boosts intelligence.
---
Not crucial for Power Armor builds.  I've been running one for over a year without it and I'm not extra squishy.  Emergency Protocols is OP.
---
\&gt; dont go for the 12m. Anything could happen in the next year.    
---
ban, for example  
---
lol
---
But that's the thing. She has said, "I hear one dweller has been sighted going into Hailey mine. I hope you can hear this down there!"
---
Random commercial breaks like that for seeing a dweller going skiing at top of the world, or a dweller sighted draining their boots after a slog through the more, that would add a lot of character and if you happen to be in the vicinity that could make ya feel warm and fuzzy :)
---
That’s true, and it’s due to how much it’s needed in many different things. So it makes perfect sense that it’s common to find and also a common component for crafting or repairing many items
---
I don't know about making the Main Stash Universal. I would rather keep stashes Separate between Characters. I don't want my Melee Build having their Stash full of Sniper Rifles.  
---
I really don't want it to be something you have to buy for a large amount of money.  
---
If I had to sell it to be on the Legendary Run I would beg that it be at least on the first Leg so everyone has an honest change of unlocking it even on a casual playing schedule.
---
As someone that always DPSes the ghouls, whats the best strat for getting ore? Power armor or stealth suit, rad-x, hold on to the ore as long as you can to wait out the new spawns? I think I will try collecting next time to see how it goes.  
---
ETA: Yep, Rad-X and my T-51b set did the job. I just hotkeyed RadAway and popped it as needed while piling up the ore. Popped mobs in the legs with Enforcer and my Gauss shotgun as I went, that was fun!
---
PSA: you can place track lights on the top and bottom edges of the gun racks.
---
I appreciate the offer but I'm gonna stick with the cr for now till I get a bloodied one even if only 1 or 2 stars
---
Whatever it is, we can expect it to be poorly implemented and lacking in polish/vision.  At this point I'm setting my expectations low.  Like The Last Jedi low.
---
Havent you watched the ice age movies?
---
If i ever tame a megasloth hes definitely getting named Sid.
---
Interesting facts though,thanks for sharing. Used to watch the nat geo/discovery specials on ice age/dinosaurs all the time as a kid. Maybe thats why i love the cryptids and monsters in fallout so much.
---
Inspirational is not technically a team perk. It says when you are on a team *you* gain extra XP. That's why it's good to share, so everyone on the team gets the benefit and only one person  has to equip it.
---
Yeah at 65 you've got plenty of spare score you're doing fine
---
It doesn’t seem to be linked day to day.  Count your blessings it didn’t hit you on the weeklies!
---
Any idea of what you could have done differently the day before that may have triggered it?
---
I lost some dupe plans because either the Container Respawned, or my friend has a server crash while I was switching characters.
---
I'm guessing guns first, because the poster may block the activator for the racks.
---
Walking past a car with seagull poop on it, "SBQ must have flown past".
---
I think you need to emphasize the "usually" part. I'm not sure it's always red. Playing on PS4, I've peeked at some people's collectrons (that's right, if you have your collectron unlocked, I will probably pick some stuff out of it - it's a cruel world out there), and sometimes the lock info will be yellow (white?) instead of red. But I know that if I were to pick it I would get wanted status. I wouldn't be surprised if this same issue can happen at workshops as well.
---
I think I was level 95 before I ever came across one. Then I randomly found a dead one inside of West Tek.
---
I don't think any shared perks stack, they didn't before public teams and all of mine and my friends tests have shown that you only get the highest tier copy of whatever perk you have. My friend had a tier 2 inspiration equipped, and I had a tier 3 shared. They showed no difference in exp gains when they has theirs equipped or not, they were only benefiting from the tier 3 it seems. The weight reduction cards worked the same for us. 
---
If they don't have the card then they get it, if they have a lower version they get the higher version, if they are already running an equal card I don't think the effect duplicates, even if it shows multiple copies on the perk screen. 
---
Example B I always have strange in numbers equipped my friend shared it. My cranberry relish still only gives me +25% exp. Which is 20% base [herbivore], and the 5% vonus from strange in numbers. If it stacked the effect multiple times it should give me more. Same with all the food buffs
---
Stunning
---
To answer the question though, the cap limit is more to control inflation.  If we can’t have more than 30K caps, then we are less likely to try to pursue more than 30K for an item. 
---
The bigger problems are A.) too many caps in the economy just from overall play time in the game and from people who duped gifts allowing them to have basically a never ending supply of caps, and B.) No meaningful cap sink to keep us spending our caps so we are not going to be at the max as often.
---
They tried adding in sinks with things like the gift wrap and pail plans, but with duping people only needed to make one or two and then never spent more caps (and with duping they got their money back fast anyways).  The rewards weren’t really that meaningful either. 
---
The only other cap sinks we have in the game are Plans and Fast travel.  Plans eventually you’ll buy all of the ones you want, and fast travel is not substantial enough (and with teams you can get around for cheaper)
---
In short: The issue is not that we have a cap, it’s that there is no meaningful cap sinks in the game for us to dump our money into, so we are all constantly at the border of max and the only things we put money into is trades.
---
If the queen chooses you as her target, but can't land in a spot to attack you, she keeps flying
---
Was worried it would get worse but I'll just keep grinding
---
I just play the game. Sometimes I'll jump from event to event to get whatever rewards I can, usually stuff I already have so I give it away or stick in in my vendor for a small handful of caps. Sometimes I'll just wander the wastelands heading towards whatever shiny thing gets my attention off in the distance. Sometimes I'll load up the private server and pick up every piece of garbage I come across while hopping from one lead weight spot to the next. Sometimes I'll spend hours just hanging around camp.  I'll gather my water over and over for diluted stimpacks or make a gazillion corn soup to pass out to anyone that stops by. 
---
If I manage to get enough random stuff I don't need and sell it all for half the daily vendor caps, yippie, if not, there is always tomorrow. If I end up with treasury notes sweet, half the time I don't even know I have them. Doesn't look like the game is going away any time soon seems silly to make myself hate it by trying to grind out every little thing every day. I was level 90 before I bothered finishing the main story or dropping a nuke. I just enjoy the game cause that's kind of the point of games.
---
It was just skins originally that you couldn't use with the small backpack.
---
just more dlc's like biv in general.  new quests, locations, characters, recipies, decorations, etc instead of this half-ass C.H.O.R.E.S. system
---
How do you lock them?
---
[https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html)
---
That really sucks ass. But it's way better you learn about the caps by losing caps rather than scrip or gold bullion. 
---
The scrip limit is 1k i believe.
---
Just look at the terminal part in build mode, and the option to lock them should appear, same as with doors.
---
Only thing I did different was changed character started a new one to get the outfits you only receive once during game I sold like a moron . Swapped to the new character then decided not to bother and swapped back. I log outevery day before reset.
---
Sounds good! Thanks
---
Never knew this, thank you for letting me know!
---
You’d have to find someone selling them in their vending ... they were from the Halloween event this past year
---
The secret is that they played for a lot more hours than you probably. 
---
Especially if theyre at 70-80 they grind more than your average person is willing to.
---
Chameleon is for PvP. Against enemies, just go full Unyielding.
---
My main wears a full set of Unyielding. When I need to PvP, I switch to a full set of assassin's minus one piece for the chameleon leg, which makes you invisible while still and crouched.
---
Shadowed armor might have been fixed. I heard that some days ago.
---
I turned HDR off because the lighting looks so bad sometimes. It helped for the most part, but some textures still look weird.
---
It's an option on the PS4 pro, not sure what options are available on the regular ps4.
---
U havent graduated to the big gauss guns yet, huh? I used to have tons of lead/ steel, truckloads of ammo and thought I am set for a while.....until I got the gauss minigun. Most ammo eating gun ever Sold most of other ammo to buy 2mm to continue feeding the beast.
---
Ah well shit
---
When I worked at 711 my assistant manager tried to use a bobby pin tonopen up a register that got stuck because she watched her boyfriend play new Vegas.
---
 I just sat back and silently laughed.
---
Was offline for 20 hours before the reset, log in 35 minutes after the reset and the three new weekly ones were self-completed for me ...
---
I’m thinking under your proposed system it could work better than the item drops today. Get a voucher with a star value that you take to Purveyor. Cash in for a legendary armor or weapon in the class you might actually use. So if I am a gunner, I won’t keep getting nocturnal lead pipes. And if I’m melee, no more pipe rifles or laser pistols. Don’t like what the voucher gives you? No prob, cash it out at the machine for a fresh receipt.
---
What players do after leaving the vault likely isn’t canon. But the scorched plague, the new creatures, the different factions, humans returning, that’s all real. Hell, even 76 was mentioned in both Fallout 3 and Fallout 4.
---
walked into a hardware store and saw the screw isle and I stopped and took a step back
---
Yeah I said "Should be red" for that exact reason, I'm sure there are times where it doesn't always show as red, but it is definitely supposed to.
---
I've actually soloed her from a tent with no issues. I really think it's mostly airborne stagger.
---
With plans+recipes you have to actually “read” them, so in your pip boy inventory scroll over to the “notes” section and select the plans to “learn” them
---
We out here really getting down votes because this game basically steals your money unless someone else tells you theres a limit. Also fyi, vendors take a small tax from your sold items
---
What was the reason for giving a cap limit? Was it ever stated?  Did they do it for server stability or some technical reason? Or was it done just to make the game more tedious?   When the game launched they said the stash limitation was because of server stability.  And then they told you that you can have an unlimited stash for junk if you were willing to pay for it.
---
This is why I would have preferred the New Vegas method of weapon repair vs what we got. 
---
Crafting a gun can be the same scrap system, but maintaining a gun should require the player to break down same type guns (at lower levels) to repair, and then at high levels +perks similar style guns could be used (like using a hunting rifle to slightly repair a lever action).
---
Since it would take more code to implement my preferred system, I would gladly take the OP's suggestion :)
---
If you tab over to Notes in your pip boy, it'll be titled "Plan". Scroll down (its in alphabetical order) and consume it.
---
Happy to help, only found out myself when I offered to try and lock them for somebody to see if it works. 
---
Turned out you can lock them and it counts for challenges if others hack them. 
---
But, you need to relock after each hack.
---
Dropsite V9 was just outside the nuke zone, but the radstorm threw that spectacular green on the fallout cloud.
---
I think using PA is probably optimal, but I usually run around in regular armor because I dont like the clunkyness of PA, plus you do "enough" damage and rarely get pinned down as long as you shoot first. if you have access to SS armor you are probably pretty fine DR-wise. 
---
if not, PA with emergency protocol mod on the chest makes you pretty resilient.
---
That makes sense, I’m having a hard time finding locked terminals so I might try this as it’s way easier. Thank you for the tip man, I hope you have a great day
---
Sometimes I join a team and I get booted, rejoin because they’ve been sitting at two people for a few mins and get booted again, so I start my own.  I could understand if they wanted to add someone to their team, but they sometimes boot and sit empty. Why?!
---
Also, the number of newbies who will follow you around and keep trying to initiate trade, but then they don't understand how and keep cancelling out. I usually just donate them a couple stims jf they can keep the window open long enough, but when they keep trying it's irritating.
---
You can 100% play how you want to, sadly that isn't rewarded in the current system.
---
Man this makes me wish there was more rad-storms.
---
This also lead to a confusion thinking that someone stole my stash while I was gone, like as if you could go to someone's camp and just take their stuff from their stash. So then as I was drunker I decided to "rob" another players stash..... So dumb haha
---
Everytime i see a bottle capp i wanna pick it up lol
---
The group I play with finally successfully completed the event over this last weekend!  So much xp and loot!  Its like the big boy version of Uranium Fever!
---
She should have gone for the Infiltrator perk!  ;)
---
I love it, any more on the way?
---
It’s a big part of the game. ESP once the story ends
---
I don't mind being the runner as long as the person or people killing everything are actually protecting the scavengers. So many people just let them die.
---
There was no announcement whatsoever regarding the cap limit. I was utterly shocked when 8k of my caps went to waste. I felt bad for the guy who just bought my gun. It was a legacy too
---
I have an exact amount of radaway and stimpacks i carry on me so i usually just find a random low lvl to give all my extra to as im out n about.
---
Thanks I really appreciate the reply do u know how the build goes?
---
I kind of agree with the claim that in essence the BoS is just a glorified raider gang, as per Gage’s comment:

---
Berserker weapons should cause the damage bloodied weapons cause. But they don't.
---
I'd see so much stuff on the road while delivering pizzas. Picked up a tennis ball and a steak knife on separate occasions. Couple days later, someone kicked the gas line support and cut themselves pretty bad, happened every couple months.  Cut open the tennnis ball with the steak knife and it became a handy cover for the support and no one hurt themselves again.
---
Where do I get these!!! What are they called
---
Thanks. Ill test it without discord running. Funny thing is, if I press W and Shift to run, i think it doesnt happen.
---
EDIT: IT doesnt appear to be discord/other application becoming the focus, as it happened when all other apps were closed, and for some reason only the WASD is affected, crouch, jump etc works, and I dont evem consume AP when i look like running in the same spot. Fast traveling seems to help it for a quite a while tho.
---
Unpopular opinion: the last few duping methods that were made public were HUGE cap sinks, and the ban wave got rid of most of the players with an abundance of caps.
---
Too bad you cant get a second one, "two beavers are bettet than one!"
---
Awesome job, ive taken pictures since i started playing dont have a ton but its an awesome way to look back and remember different stages of living through this wasteland, and with the snapmatic camera its so much easier for some pics, i love it :)
---
I seem to remember finding one of them at either the NAM repair yard or maybe fort defiance.  Both places have random plan spawn locations.  One of those locations is on a table in the NAM repair yard.   There is always a plan on the table, and I think there was one time where the marine wet suit appeared.
---
If it was fort defiance, then I am pretty sure it would have been on the fourth floor near the power armor stations sitting on a table. 
---
These are two areas where I think they ***might have spawned***, but it's been so long ago that I can't be sure.
---
They are called fashionable glasses. I found mine downstairs in the whitespring golf club where the wendigo spawns. But you can also buy them by one of the whitespring vendors.
---
When I first finished the base game before Wastelanders I was hoping that you would be able to use something from every faction to take down the scorch beast queen. Or at the very least a unique permanent perk for completing every factions storyline.
---
Although I have the horribly unpopular opinion that the limits are fine, and are beneficial, I 100% agree they don't do a good job informing players that these limits exist. I'm one of the five or so people that actually went through the "help" section in the menu and read everything and it's not stated in there.
---
Because people can do what they want and there's no reason to go around being an asshole for an opinion.
---
Gotta get those nuclear keycards somehow!
---
This is awesome - ill be borrowing and crediting this.
---
Ok thanks , I managed to do it
---
Never stated, but based on other games with caps, it’s to control inflation.  
---
Barring people doing things like having Cap Mules, no item can sell for more than 30K.  This would make the better gear more accessible by newer or more casual players, since it would only take them a few days to hit cap if they are able to get their full 1200 caps from vendors daily.  
---
I’m not saying it was well thought out, it’s just one of the many aspects that failed to hit the mark.  If other aspects of the game had been fleshed out more, you might have been paying people to repair your gear for you, since they might specialize in INT and be able to more easily repair gear, or you might have wanted to buy food from players who opened up stores.  
---
In practice though, most everyone just went off and did everything solo and did card swaps to repair their own gear (among other things). 
---
My take is that there are a lot of great ideas that executed poorly, likely do to inexperience in developing an MMO like this.
---
With the lights out... It's still pretty dangerous...
---
Bullion limit is 5k.
---
867-5309
---
I definitely want the option to sabotage the BOS return to Appalachia. Maybe give the option to steal supplies, damage the facilities at the observatory (maybe outright nuking it), preventing them from taking over or at least do so in a much weakened state.
---
As for a BOS-Enclave conflict, I don’t think it would be a good idea to make it so open, but wouldn’t mind conducting missions for MODUS that would negatively impact the BOS.
---
Ooo I never caught that is what was in the cages.
---
probably a Todd Howard Feature ^TM
---
Me too Im at 95! :D
---
That's a good call. I don't really have time to play 5 characters and have fun remembering 5 different builds, so sharing a stash for 4000 weight would be nice to just have on my two players I really use
---
To curb inflation
---
Everyones differnt i help out everyone i can in game. But i do have to farm for ammo quit a bit.
---
I use the Prison on one character, and a Silo on the other (one can't access them yet)
---
If you are right handed, you tend to stand with your left leg out front. The scorched and most other creatures affected by the fallout can't see well so they see your leg as the biggest target, and go for it.
---
It's probably a combination of inexperience, ignorance, the desire to deal enough damage to get the loot at the end, and probably most importantly, the human desire to go "I push button, big boom, pretty colors. Drool."
---
Yep I'm only doing the NW challenges for score but it's just not for me.
---
I had a guy (in his underwear) call me a nerd and then ask me if I had any noodle cups. Oddly specific, but I did have one so I gave it to him.
---
I think that's the most likely, minimal effort on their part
---
It’s not the length of your title... it’s whether it is descriptive or not. Quality of words over quantity.
---
I share rank 1 of cannibal lol. Most ppl don’t notice until they try to jump next to a corpse and instead drop down and start munching on it
---
If they had good cap sinks then those high end items might actually be up for sale more often for caps and not just trade. Especially if you could list it in vendor for 70k
---
They will probably be back this Halloween. So it's just waiting.
---
like ducks, never feed them or they won't leave
---
Emergency Protocols, Lone Wanderer, Nerd Rage, Blocker. Stabilized. Full heavy gunner perks. Bloody mess. Adrenaline when it works. Revenant and Mysterious saviour if you have the inclination.
---
 I'm working on it... not usually one to post clips though. It's sitting on the dudes profile and he hadn't logged back on since it posted. I know no one believes this stuff without a video though... which is understandable.
---
They were, but still not big enough (and obviously not a legit method) and not permanent since it was an exploit.  
---
So yes, it took some out, and it will take some time to balance the economy because of what it did, assuming a new dupe method doesn’t just follow it (or already exist)
---
I like sharing traveling pharmacist. I wish you could choose to share a card of any rank without high charisma though
---
So you where killed by one guy. Then you make a post claiming it was a team with the title food job
---
Dude... That would be the most overpowered and boring sh*t ever. It is difficult to be killed while using bloodied because of the buff to stats and mitigation perks (like Evasive or Serendipity).
---
You might be a Sith. That's not how you bring balance to the game.
---
pray server doesnt crash in between, but yes.
---
but once you learn all of the plans for the weapon, you should be able to know how to break down a gun and get the screws, gears, and springs out of it. that would actually give incentive to learning all of the plans of a weapon
---
that would be great, I could stop using the bass to get into my basement
---
or should I say bassment
---
If your at 65 you are defintly ahead we are not in week three
---
Lmao scrolled for this
---
Or the Appalachian Antiques place in the bog. It has a terminal and a safe to lock pick in cause it’s either-or that day
---
Thanks for all the info.
---
For a split second when reloading, the left thumb disappears into the mag. That's all. Without scopes the sights are really goofy, but a rear sight is on the way, peep style. Kind of strange, having to patch a weapon skin. 😉
---
TLDR; got killed by a random, am mad now
---
I when do they reset
---
instanced might be for teams only, or even a FO1st toy.. but yeah I get your point, I don't need any more loading screens in my life
---
cant get a spring out of a gun, but we can create jetpacks on experimental power armor, create mini-nukes, and crack nuke codes to launch them.
---
That glitch ... ugh. Brutal on the PS4 frame rate with all the legacies blowing up. Had to point the napalmer close to the middle and hope for the best. And of course all the XP farmers won’t leave their perches to repair the generator. Might start skipping that one more.
---
Because money.
---
Do you have proof of your claims about them having unique IDs then?
---
Are we not I thought I'd missed the 1st week oh that's good to know. I'm slowing now it's taking alot more score to level up.
---
Nothing griefing there. You put yourself into a PVP scenario with taking a workshop, and he responded. That’s not grIefing.  If you didn’t join that particular team, he likely would have come to attack you anyways.  
---
I’m guessing no one was on mics and no discussion of “Hey you guys want to help me take a workshop” or anything like that.
---
Not sure how to but my Xbox say same thing in subscription only has game pass but I still have 1st been trying to figure out how to cancel mine to
---
Thanks.  And I am being honest when I say that  I remember them explicitly stating why the limit was in place. I  guess inflation  makes sense though. Kind of.
---
You can do it from the fallout/Bethesda website if you can’t get it to work on your Xbox.
---
I think you'd have better luck typing the title of your post into a Google search bar or a YouTube search bar.
---
LMG/MG42, Tesla, Plasma, Gatling Plasma, any unarmed weapon...
---
I wish there is a sorry emote for every time I one hit a legendary. I got bad anxiety and my husband introduced me to dying light and now fo76. To quickly identify enemies (because I'm a scaredycat), I learned to use VATS. Now it has become a reflex VATS=shoot, and now that I'm a junkies build, I one hit enemies, sometimes legendaries accidentally. 😭
---
Yeah, there is a bug. You can tell if it is owned by trying to take it: the game will give a different warning depending on its state.
---
I know I PS4 it falls under services, not subscriptions. If Xbox had a similar interface I would suggest looking there
---
You know you don't have to defend your workshop, you can just let them have it.  But yeah, there are some people that are jerkish, but a lvl 230 has no use for Workshops really, so it would be odd for him to want to take it.
---
Okay thanks
---
Thanks I just saw someone did that last night for the first time, a miner almost died but got healed completely. Time to arm myself with my shishkabob
---
You have till the second week of September to finish literally 2 months look how much youve done with what time youve played
---
Unfortunately at least one does exist. Groups of people make it their mission to break this game. As bad as it is on consoles, PC will always be the Wild West.
---
Apply the perk that drops grenades when you die and load up on Molotov cocktails.
---
I think if you're the team leader you can remove someone from the team.
---
Dont forget one guy equals a team now also
---
I may be thinking of a different skin, but isn't this an unvaulting? I could swear there was a Dragon skin released along with the skins for the black powder rifle a while ago.
---
I can repair for you if you are ps4
---
Huh. I had a person visiting my camp recently. She was low-level (26), she tried to enter my house. It doesn't have stairs (you can easily jump if you have marsupial mutation), so I had to asl her to stop jumping and wait for me to build temporary stairs instead. After that I gave her a few plans, some propaganda flyers to sell to vendor (she returns all but one of them though), and even built her a low level Excavator PA.
---
It was a rather nice experience, and I really hope it wasn't toxic from my side...
---
That's great lol didn't realize I had that long
---
Now I give them away to the freshies. It’s a rough life out there they can use the buffs.
---
My guess is they had a friend join the server and wanted them in the group. Or they're waiting for a friend who will join soon.
---
I booted someone for the first time the other day but it was because they joined during a queen fight and were sharing the perk that removes rads. As a bloodied build this is bad for me.
---
Better Criticals is my goto.
---
My guess, they boot low levels and non-Perk sharers. I've been in a few where the leader was booting people and it was usually people not sharing a Perk, and in Events it was low-levels getting the ax.
---
Also, though not witnessed, could be people booting team members at their CAMP so they don't fuck around with stuff.
---
I miss that gun...
---
I use one without power armor mainly because you can get just as good of a damage resistance with good armor, which isn't all that hard to get. Just go for scout and heavy combat pieces and upgrade them fully with polymer and bos mods.  Also use perks like barbarian, evasive, bodyguards to add to your base DR. Refractor is okay but it by itself is not really worth it. Definitely use perks in luck like serendipity and lucky break. If your on PSN I have some extras. I'm always making new sets of armor to have.
---
Yes I think so too.  A lot of great ideas executed poorly.     Limiting caps to control inflation kind of makes sense. Controlling inflation is a good enough reason I guess, but   I just don't ever remember them clearly stating that as the reason.   That's how a lot of things work in this game.  A lot of mechanics are poorly explained.
---
What you are saying about stash limit is close, but not entirely accurate. When the game launched stash was only 400. It increased twice since then. When they increased to 800 they said that any future increases would have to be weighed against server stability. In the months between that and the launch of FO1 they made a lot of improvements to server stability. The decision to only have unlimited scrap in 1st and not all items is due to server stability. 
---
To be clear, I don’t think the scrap box should be exclusive to 1st. Just pointing out it wasn’t as simple as then saying “can’t do it, ok we changed our minds, give us money” 
---
And back to the original point, purpose of cap limit is not related to stash limit.
---
I play bloody and I've yet to have this happen. Most people share Strange In Numbers or Inspirational.
---
Can you tell me how to raise a ticket? 
---
I figured it out. For some reason under subscriptions it only showed Live. But when I tried to remove my credit card it shows it was linked to FO1st. 
---
Eventually a link on console took me to the Microsoft support page where I wasd able to cancel it.
---
Thats what I had to do. Thanks.
---
did you not find the fov slider in the settings?
---
That’s actually sick! Gonna try that later
---
You can’t drop it well then so they’re just kinda dead weight
---
Of course man I had to do the same thing they don’t make it easy to quit it
---
Havent tried lvl 3 yet, but level 2 is very slow to heal, fyi
---
Its on the microsoft website. Log in on console or pc and go to the subscription tab. There I was able to cancel FO1st and stop live from renewing.
---
I’m just not shy anymore. I’ll get on the area mic and say hey guys, we need at least 1-2 more runners. I’ve already tapped out in all 4 caves.
---
I’d guess it’s because some people are trying to use the public team as a way to actually team up with players and get things done.  If you are joining a team and then sitting at your camp, you aren’t actively working towards the goal of the team. 
---
Also if you’re not sharing a perk, at that point you’re basically just leeching from the others.  I’d rather kick someone from a team if they aren’t sharing a perk than keep them around for a measly 2% bonus XP
---
Game does not work for most people using game pass.
---
Or kill anglers at their spawn in the mire
---
Is this still a thing? Can they do anything to teammates' camp? I thought it was some way fixed
---
Not if you keep telling everyone.
---
also toxic larrys meat n go
---
Might be something else, but i had a similar bug like this and it was because i had the encrypted broadcast from the Sophia quests
---
I have 1 charisma and that's just how it's going to stay.
---
My brother won 750 at a casino the other day and I nonchalantly chuckle out "Ah, luck of 8 I see." 
---
He sees me on Steam every night and said time for a break bro.
---
I've dropped ammo a few times for people at the SBQ fights but I rarely give it to people that beg. I did have a guy that was clearly drunk asking for weapons so I told him if he could kill me in PvP I would give him something for free. He actually agreed to and tried which is more than most people will do since my main is level 570ish. I decided to drop him a decent combat rifle for trying. He was happy and I got a laugh. If people want to beg for shit make them earn it.
---
Justified
---
&gt; To be clear, I don’t think the scrap box should be exclusive to 1st. Just pointing out it wasn’t as simple as then saying “can’t do it, ok we changed our minds, give us money”
---
I realize this. But Bethesda does a poor job of explaining things sometimes IMO.
---
Exactly. Im about to log in once it updates. Havent played since week 1 of Wastelander. But I guess thats only been a month maybe 2 so I wont have that many atoms I guess.
---
They need to consolidate scrap considerably so it isn't such a slog.
---
Screws, Springs, Gears are all made of steel...can we just replace every recipe that uses them to use the equivalent amounts of Steel?
---
Fiberglass and Fiber Optics? Can they just be replaced with equivalent amounts of Plastic and/or Glass?
---
Circuits? You mean Plastic and Copper?
---
Crystal? Why not just Glass?
---
Cork? Why does this event exist in game? Can we just use Rubber?
---
Ballistic Fiber? Can we pretend throwing lots more Cloth and Leather into the armor piece makes it more durable? Or maybe we go the Fiberglass route and change it to Plastic and Glass?
---
Consolidating all the scrap items would make the farming and scavenging less frustrating and time-consuming for leveling characters and people with less time to play without really affecting those hoarding mass quantities of scrap in their FO1st Scrapboxes.
---
It should be a dead drop which looks like a tree trunk ala the one near Flatwoods
---
Awesome thanks will have to do that
---
Id boot them too. That and Survival expert. Boot, boot boooot.
---
I'm willing. I have to do that one too lvl79
---
Sharing serendipity 3  and tenderizer 3 are always a go to for me when people share inspirational
---
I booted a player who remained dead for 10 minutes.
---
Oh their communications team is awful. I give them the benefit of the doubt most times but they seriously have awful public relations
---
But why the 2nd team? They booted me within seconds, and its not the first time its happened.
---
Pretty sure I showered recently, might even have brushed my teeth.
---
It's easy enough to just world hop
---
Im over lvl 300, and share perks.
---
I didnt think Public Team members could mes with other players CAMPs, but TBH, I havent tried.
---
Well I was thinking it would be a little bit of a waste because you can fats travel to each other free, but not any ware else.  Maybe I will keep it on
---
Bloodied FFR are queen weapons imo. I like extra vats stuff for anything else.
---
I did this event for the first time a few days ago and it was awesome. I used my stealth suit and sneak perks and collected the ore but i also got 3 legendary weapons from ghouls! Unfortunately it was only me and another guy a level 100+ so of course my lack of knowledge of how to pass the event and the level 100+ dying over and over again didn't help complete the event, but it was fun to do im glad i gave it a chance.
---
Get another Chassis, put it on there with some other PA parts, store it in Stash for 10LBs
---
Hmm, I must have forgotten about that. It does ring a bell. Still weird that they dont seem to be aware of what the players acrually use.
---
Go ahead
---
I do this event with a BE gat plasma but I do burst fire so I don't kill them. Now if no one is watching and some get close to a scavenger. I hold down the trigger and murder them.
---
I've been in to many groups where the scavengers die.
---
I do agree they should probably remove the legacy energy explosive and hacked items. Or just raise weapon cap and then they become useless cause not make level and if ant max level are found them they were hacked in and accounts be banned.
---
NICE BEAVER
---
They may not even have known why they were limiting it, but there are other games that have limits so they figured they needed too as well. 
---
I think a lot has to do with their inexperience (the team that worked on FO76 specifically, not Bethesda as a whole)
---
A fact which itself is a disgrace.
---
You haven’t missed much just a lot of grinding.
---
Wait until you get the Chinese Stealth Suit.
---
I really wasnt "sitting at my camp" for more than a couple minutes. It was 30min+ of doing events, then going back to my base to scrap/sell.
---
Covert Operative was being shared.
---
Legendaries were in Fallout 4 bud
---
truly. it's the main reason I dont use them. no customization
---
I’m talking about the defend from creature event. I don’t really have a use for workshops either. If I was able to complete that I wouldn’t be salty about it, but he was able to initiate pvp during the defend event which I didn’t think was possible. I think I’m mostly salty about being kicked from my team, which I joined for the xp bonus and daily challenge reward and then merced by my former teammate (even though I don’t know the guy).
---
Nah, private teams can build in (and mess with) each other's camps.  Public teams can't.
---
usually a snallygaster down by the Capitol as well.
---
Ah yes because it requiring the time dedication of a full time job is somehow a good thing?
---
This is the best spot as the spawn isn't random.
---
But were you doing events with them or on your own? They may have been looking for people to join them with a specific goal.
---
That's all very well but it's more fun to do this in game. Also damage numbers don't tell you how the weapon is to use, what it feels like, and what it's like for spread etc.
---
What are your Plans ?
---
Can they be sold?
---
Is the wood Paneling the one that's shown in the big game hunter bundle, with the mounted heads? Because that is sexy and now I'm sad that it's not included.
---
You don't get the same sort of feedback that you do shooting mobs though.
---
Damn, sorry you've had bad luck. I was totally solo before the public teams and still mostly solo while on them but I haven't had anything close to that experience. Just this morning I was on a building team with one other person and we kept doing the follow emote for legendaries. Not every team is that good but the worst I've had was just no one ever joining, or events teams with no one else doing events like not just breaks for repairing and selling but just... never going to events. Are you on PC? I feel like I've heard way more griefing stories from pc.
---
sorry I thought you meant players could spawn guards in-game
---
I’m just explaining how I did it. This season goes until September something, so you don’t have to do it like it did. No one said it’s a “good thing” either.
---
I have Daguerre in the circus cage, the barred door fits right on and looks ace
---
That was nice of you, I too like helping low levels, that said, I doubt that low level tried bombing your camp just cause they couldn't get in before you build the stairs, that's the toxic part
---
I enjoy when there is an actual group around and people collect ore like the one I went into last night. When its just people killing ghouls I enjoy it significantly less. Saying that, the one I  last night was a nice one with me and one other guy were collecting ore while around 4-5 other players where murdering ghouls. I think we may have even gotten the full rank from the ore collecting. That or it stopped short of 99. I prefer to think the former.
---
This. Usually 1-2, and it's an easy visit for new players.
---
Like I said, maybe they had friends that were on the way, and were reserving the spot.
---
paid 8000 caps at someone's vendor and don't feel cheated
---
Lol, NW.
---
Yes I'm on pc
---
I have a ton. bunch of power armor plans. Basically I will drop all the plans you take the ones you need and you drop all the treasure maps you dont need. I have a lot so I cant really put my finger on which ones but for scale I have 44 T-45 motion assisted servos.
---
I've been avoiding it because I'm super afraid to fuck up the event for everyone else by not doing it right.
---
From what I understand, cripple the bastards, don't kill them, protect those that need protected and fire heal them? And gather stuff?
---
But, when I'm doing an event for the first time, sometimes I don't exactly know where to go? 
---
So catch 22....if nobody else shows up to the event, I'm going to fail it. If others show up, I might fuck it up for them.
---
Smart but definitely the talk of losers. I didt die one time in that chaos. Lots of running lots of shooting lots and lots and lots of swearing. No dying.
---
I just hit Level 50 this past weekend. Got VIP access to the level 50+ section of Vault 51.
---
Plus if the snally is dead, there is a grafton monster by the train yard.
---
Yeah ultra rare, I bought a forest for 15k and an urban for 10k several months ago. Almost definitely overpaid but my eyes were bleeding from doing savage divide events.
---
I have a 2-star vampire's explosive and set up a wall of power armor frames. I only shoot ghouls that make it past, and I always go into the tunnels for ore once a few people have cleaned a pair of tunnels out so they can guard and get XP.
---
They really need to get the pink sprinkles onto the T-65. I miss my pink armor.
---
Yeah I just really want something to match with the SS armor for the Tesla or Gauss rifle.
---
secret service shielded. only 450 gold in total. it's something like +4 strength +4 endurance, and some others
---
Would you believe me if I told you.. this game is full of bugs..
---
There's often a grafton monster down there too, if the supermutants haven't killed it yet.
---
At least we got skins for the gatling gun finally
---
Why, it's the Bud Knight!! DILLY DILLY!!!!
---
Atom purchase it was a while ago I have it at all my camps.  Someone will remember as it was in a bundle
---
I like it. Good for farming XP but is a real ammo sink though.
---
If shooting bullet sponge ghouls isnt your thing you can spend all that accumulated radaway doing ore collecting.
---
Grafton monster on Charleston Station bridge
---
I think that’s the meat week grill from atom shop?
---
I’m fairly certain you just scrap them and can craft them later, just like the steel mill helmet.
---
The only weapon i find useful in PvP is my bloodied Tesla.
---
I am 100% undefeated.
---
Every time i am killed in PvP it is by a Stealth Boy +Tesla.
---
Every other weapon is Dog shit.
---
And i have tried them all.
---
Griefers will have you believe they are really,really good at PVP,and there is more to it than Stealth Boys and jumping around with a Telsa.
---
PvP is awful.
---
I am always curious what people want shared. I have 9 charisma and a character on my other account with 15 cha and every useful perk maxed.
---
I'll give you the boot if I see you using a hacked weapon or hoarding kills at Public Events.
---
I’m on Xbox, and I’ve sorted the repairs now. Thanks for the offer tho. I appreciate it
---
I've never booted anyone. I dont' even care what the rest of the team is doing. I only care about getting my 25% mutey bump :)   I only join Event Teams anyway
---
No, he's saying un-nerf it (and Magnetic Personality perk and Party Boy) so their Charisma boosts count for perk sharing as they used to.
---
They have an unmoddable Fallout game, and they're selling us FO4 assets as content one bit at the time. Not hating, just observing.
---
Why not both?
---
Never done it and don't know how to, so I'm too intimidated by people on here bitching that no one knows what they're doing...
---
This is the way.
---
I didn't make the first comment you commented on ^^
---
Shotguns are still a finicky with damage. They work well enough with a vats sneak build. I'd play with it a bit without changing your perks around much and see if you like it. It's pretty easy to start a new character and build for shotguns. I've got one that can swap between, shotgun, melee and heavies fairly easily.
---
Would a modded chainsaw with flame yield same healing effect? Or is it limited to shishkabob and flamer??
---
If your on Xbox I'll sell it to you for 7k
---
I was thinking more something rarer.
---
I have a lot of treasure Maps i would swap for possum badges.Even a Fixer Plan.
---
I just want some more allies we can quest for.
---
Having few options like beckett and the space chick are getting tiresome.
---
Better than nothing tho
---
Its a PA jetpack as I am aware.
---
Yeah I have a lot so you would have to look through some stuff I got.
---
I have never encountered this behavior on PC (yet). People seem to leave the team and make a new one or join someone else's rather than kicking people.
---
I’m into the second part of the board too so yeah really need them :/
---
There is all kinds of garbage now, back to playing on private, this is ridiculous. Go to script stuff im there 30 seconds picking out the junk from good stuff and smack smack some low level jerk is punching me because he wants in the machine. 
---
It's sad how it's become.
---
You can select what type of FO1st Tent you want
---
Dont avoid it.  If nothing else, just blast ghouls and get xp.  This event requires more coordination than most others so unfortunately harder from that perspective without knowing who you're with.  I'd suggest putting on a Mic and seeing if anyone else is willing to work together.  If there's alot of people, I usually just start off collecting ore and trust they will keep survivors alive.  But this event usually isnt run correctly on public in my experience
---
No Jet it hasn't been invented yet
---
You'll find little love on Reddit for your post, as you are likely realizing. Thinking through this one, he/she could have fast traveled to you for free, booted you, and then taken you out. It's a hell of a move and a smart one from their point of view. If anything, your post serves as a small PSA for those taking workshops on public servers on public teams.
---
Thought that came as part of one of the Survival Tent skins.
---
Shotguns are second worst build to pistols.
---
Honestly dont know.  Curious about flamers and molotovs, too.
---
Yes, swooping is bad.
---
Good. That's why I asked, I remember people complaining about it.
---
Damn bro you really love writing 😂. I don’t have a story, just letting you know that I liked yours.
---
Wrong.
---
Nah. I mean, surely someone out there can
---
Any suggestion on how to move weapons around between characters?
---
I dont really see the benefit of power Armour.
---
Unless you are using Excavator for the carry weight.
---
Or doing a Queen,and needing Rad protection.
---
Whenever i need it to protect me these days ,An Assaultron,or Gutsie just melts me.
---
So i dont really bother with it,chameleon works well with a bloodied build.
---
Flamers work, but not Molotovs. Card says they dont specifically, ill have to test it next time im playing
---
You (not you specifically) can't grab any ore, and I can only grab so much ore. I can't get it above lvl 2 rewards by myself, but there is a whole room farming ghouls while I try to do the dirty work. Last time I did RR I grabbed 53 ore by myself. I was there from the beginning, and the ore didn't respawn fast enough for me to get any more than that. It would be great to have coordination between 2 groups. 1 group covers ghouls until the other gathers all the ore, then switch. That way both groups get to farm ghouls and enough ore gets collected for everyone to get lvl 4 rewards. I don't do it very often because almost no one even tries to to grab ore. It's not worth it when I don't get to farm any xp, and the event rewards suck.
---
The flame chainsaw i mean
---
yeah, it's where some endgame bullion items are sold.   Have you completed the story missions? ? if not, you need to.
---
Only this colour is available so far.
---
It’s a quest item.
---
It's best when you meet these at a low level. The first sheepsquch I killed I was like lvl 40 and it was 60 or something. I trained into a big raider base and let then duke it while I wasted all my ammo from stealth. Took forever but it was memorable. Now at lvl 126 I mow them down in 4 seconds.
---
have you done the wastelanders questline yet?
---
You make it as part of the overseer mission at the start of wastelanders. It’s one of the choices for the drink you make to vaccinate foundation and crater. After that, you can make it again at a chemistry station.
---
Hot tube time machine ?
---
Wich story missions are you talking about?
---
When you do the wastelanders storyline with the overseer you have a quest where you make the scorched cure and distribute it to the foundation and raiders you have the option to name it. One of the options is Nuka cola my bloods in it
---
Ah hell man, that's mighty kind of you but please dont go out of your way!
---
My moles and scars are shiny and wet too though
---
&gt;Cactasboy13
---
I will add you.
---
If you are on later or tomorrow i will let you have all the duplicates for free. :-)
---
Yeah, I sure as I level up and can get into much better PA I will, but for now it does the trick :)
---
That’s a fantastic price.
---
It's abandoned lately because it gets flooded with people in their teens for level and it just fails quickly.
---
Ope. Well I dropped all mine lol. I thought I read that if it drops it will be destroyed but you know the plan and can craft it later. Oh well I never use PA so I’m not missing out.
---
Thanks man I appreciate it!
---
I don't think digital would work as Nixie Tube clocks were still in use as the transistor was developed in 2023 compared to 1947. I would love to have one of those huge analog clocks with the rolling numbers. that would be amazing!
---
So, can you confirm the soda would be great otherwise?
---
everything glistens in the wasteland
---
Keep up the awesome work!
---
The main/Wastelanders, not the side ones
---
and if you see someone else already on the team sharing what you share, switch it uppppp
---
Doesn’t change what I said, I get what he’s saying.
---
Either use a friend or a courier. What platform are you on?
---
It’s the finale to the Wastelanders campaign.
---
I’m the only player that grabs ore everytime I do this event. If no one shows I kill everything and get the xp and legendaries. And when people do show I feel like a track runner waiting for the event to start so I can haul ass and grab some ore, usually by myself. There’s been a couple times someone helps me and it’s nice but I’ve only been able to complete the event 2 times now out of the 30 or so times I’ve tried to do it. If only one person is running for ore it doesn’t respawn back quick enough to keep grabbing it, at least 2 people need to grab ore but no one wants do it because hurr durr gotta get kills. I guess everyone else already has the rad barrel I’m trying to get..
---
Nope I am level 35 lol
---
I love to see this. I can also see someone accidentally turning 100 stimpaks into 400 diluted stimpaks
---
Still Bugged July 22nd
---
Wait, does the stealth suit block rads?
---
They last all depending on what you are doing.  It's not timer based really.
---
So i need to complete the whole story before they bless me with the access to this vault?
---
I try to share what the group needs. Most of the time im sharing green thumb.
---
there are some fossils in arizona too
---
I would bet they have the game installed on a second drive.. from what I have found that is the common thread.
---
the ultracite ammo will do more damage
---
So you get sometimes 90 FPS, but sometimes it drops to 30? Or you are at constant 30?
---
If so, you have to disable ingame vsync in the pref ini. Anything that is not dividable by 60, will be halved (so, in your case, it will be 30, your monitor is not 60 or 120hz one).
---
If you get 90, but sometime drops to 30, try to disable grass fully, and tweak other things in the inis.
---
Also, must important, run the game in fullscreen mode, forget the windowed ones.
---
You should only need a max of 9 perception, did you max out the damage cards?
---
What can you tell from your experience? Like if you play normally, how much it lasts on average?
---
Are they actually that rare? I feel like I see them about the same rate as fo4?
---
I don’t think it’s your rig man,I think it’s the game.I have a very similar setup and I’m getting frame drops/lag spikes in the game.It was very bad in the BETA and has been improving since release,but the weak performance is still noticeable.
---
Personally my game occasionally just freezes for ~3 seconds and then runs smoothly again,sometimes after fast traveling I get a laggy 30 second period of about 10-20fps and then it’s back to normal.
---
If other games work well,I would not do anything if I were you.
---
I've always just placed 2 posters, and then covered it with 3 display racks for rifles
---
But this also works fine 😊
---
yup. Although I think during the story, there is one time you go in there, but you can't get back in, until the end.
---
I'll place it for you. On in about an hour. I'll do it for free if you go get the pumpkins
---
I had one too, I named him perry lmao. I also had a possum once and I named him larry 😳
---
Bloodied Stealth Commando has the best DPS in the game... But Shotguns are still highly effective. I have my bloodied PA build modified atm to run regular armor and a shotgun and it does extremely well. It only really struggles with Scorched Beasts, but even then that's not because I die too much, but more or less waiting for it to land. If you want to try it out move the points from perception into strength for the shotgunner perks and blocker. Leave 3 in perception for Skeet Shooter, and get Enforcer under Agility.
---
&gt;I am 100% undefeated.
---
&gt;Every time i am killed in PvP it is by a Stealth Boy +Tesla.
---
     
---
I don't think you understand how numbers work.
---
That's awesome. I'm always so jealous when I see these. I'm stalled out at like 84 or 85 and just can't bring myself to log on and play LOL Way to stick to it and accomplish your goal!
---
An ultracite gattling laser has a higher base damage. Those other two comments are confusing it with a primed gattling laser and a laser gun.
---
Exactly what part of this had anything to do with the title?
---
I let's just say reorganized my storage
---
Yup. Also 3 in concentrated fire, 3 in tank killer.
---
Yep.  Who uses their boot drive for games?
---
I've been using Fisher's terminal at the Crater Core for the hacking challenge. It is a level 3 one, but because (I think) that area is instanced it should always be there for you to do.
---
Heh. I stick to Diet Coke these days but man do I miss Coke classic.
---
Strange in numbers does not stack. next time you have it equipped and someone is sharing it take yours off and you'll notice no change on your status page in regards to disease buffs and stats.
---
Yeah I was gonna say the guns name is just Ultracite Gatling laser
---
Every time i port to the pylon next to bogtown, there is always at least SOME kind of cryptid there.
---
Well, from MINE,  I don't worry how long they last.  sometimes I've been in queen fights that I rip through 4 or 5, sometimes, just 1.   The cores are so easy to obtain and have a bunch in my stash as well.. I sell them for 99.
---
I personally, dont' use PA that much anymore after getting the SS jetpack.  SS Jetpack + all  mutations make me fly and zip :) and the SS armour is good for 99% of everything.
---
It works for me. I do get the “Public Teams are available” message when I load into a public server, but that’s it.
---
Its just a waiting game I guess in terms of performance upgrading on their end, thanks for your reply ❤
---
Fallout 4 I would get one every other play session, and immediately fast travel away. They feel rare in Fallout 76, though at the E3 debut Todd Howard said the world is 4x as large as Fallout 4.
---
A gun rack? A gun rack!? I don't even own *a* gun, let alone many guns that would necessitate an entire rack. WHAT AM I GONNA DO WITH A GUN RACK?!
---
Good Luck.
---
My first ever Bloodied Build was shotgun.
---
That depressing feeling i got .after thinking my build was the Dogs Bollocks ,then needing 2,3 shots to down a Mole Miner stood right in front of me.
---
A level 35 Pipe Rifle with no Legendary effects was more deadly.
---
Not seen anyone running with a Shotgun for months.
---
Idk if im just blind or lucky, but I never saw it while wearing mine. 
---
Oh, and you can wear it over the T65, I saw some people saying you couldnt back then but it aint true.
---
Dave Grohl grew up in Virginia alot of his family is still there and he has or does own property there too. It wouldn't be too far off to say Kurt may have went there at some point with Dave.
---
oh I never knew or realized there were different naming options, I just made nuka cola vaccinated, damn I would've loved to give that to those stupid settlers😂
---
THANK YOU!
---
PS4
---
I boot people if I have a full team and one of my friends wants to join us.
---
Mostly around the high 80's/90's then a sharp drop to 30's I deffo have vsync off pal. Ill look at turning off grass. I've already went into the prefs folder and edited things.
---
I've got about 230 hours total, and I've always just went to the Wendigo Cave. That place is a bitch, and should be renamed Mirelurk King Cave. Thanks for the tip, you saved me a lot of trouble and ammo!
---
Me + my team boot someone when they claim a workshop.  Then one of us go contest the workshop, kill them + take their junk. They FREAK out + we laugh our asses off. Remember all u foodbuild:  there’s a warning when you claim a workshop.
---
&gt;There is almost zero reason to play outside of groups now. 
---
Exactly. That’s why there should be an incentive towards both play styles
---
Meh. No.
---
I remember grinding those dailies, he was a blast. Isn’t there still a firecracker drink (and maybe a few others) that he still hasn’t given out the plan for?
---
But thanks now it makes sense guess I should look out for ultracite gat legendary instead of normal ones
---
Yeah, I'd boot them too.
---
It was just so odd, I was booted from two teams. Wasnt AFK or doing anything odd (that I know of)
---
5hen dont, if you dont want to grid and really want the skin buy atoms to rush through it, people cry way too much about having to play the game to get the rewards they want, there is a built in solution, either grind or pay but crying about wont help with either option.
---
If it was easy, it wouldn't have the prestige :)
---
Ahh, yeah, didnt think they might have more than one friend.
---
Lucky SOBs.
---
Oh how sweet this would be. Until then, I consider transferring stuff an end-boss experience
---
Yes the ultracite gattling laser is quite a bit better than the standered
---
It's the game. I've been to whitesprings bases at times and had 35 FPS on my rtx2080ti with i9 processor. Game is so badly optimised. Up there with EFT and early dayz
---
Just happened to pick it up, not out of my way at all.
---
I believe you have to bash them with the flamer.
---
Oooooh I like 🤗
---
So you do not want the ability to transfer items between chracters in the same account?
---
That's a neat idea, as you become more familiar with a weapon, learning its plans and mods. You would be able to scrap more an better components
---
If you can get to leader of the pack fast enough!    
---
They should have a perk or something that gives you a circle to look for a legendary to kill.
---
Currently I am playing around with this shotgun with my 1 perk card increasing shotgun damage by 10%... My average hit is showing around 285 damage but its 1 hit killing everything, while my bloodied fixer would show 1895 damage and most of the time 1 hit killing. I think the dmg numbers are not showing up correctly.
---
Just buy something else then, dont tell people how to price their items in their vendors.
---
I've been sharing Light Footed, on the basis that not everybody necessarily has that - I think it's not even taken on every sneak build. But I figure it gives people an ability they might not have otherwise had.
---
My first was either an SB flying over eating a station for some reason or an SB up in the north western part of the map by one of the BoS outposts.
---
I don’t remember if I actually killed the SB over Watoga,I might have fast travelled away.
---
But I sure as hell spent a shitton of ammo taking down one up north.I know I repaired the SAM turret there,it dealt a bit of damage before it got destroyed and I just dumped everything I had on it until it crashed down and I took a photo.I think I still have it somewhere but I ain’t sure.
---
Ok sure ! Psn priest1503
---
If I wasn't so damn addicted to this game I would have just left it in the garbage and left lol, I've even spent less time in my fav mmo's due to F76 lol!
---
I swear I just heard Ron in my head just now
---
Also, dont forget, this is an old engine. Some places (like the golf course) wont run at high fps, no matter how fast your comp is. It should be 40-60 there. 30 is low, thats true.
---
Also you can lower to mininum the shadow distance in the ini, way lower than in the in game menu.
---
Or disable godrays. Something will help :)
---
Same here, as long as I have marsupial I don't need to jump any higher.  I'll save that for a chest mod which means more in the end.
---
We did Feed The People together, then during Surface to Air only one guy came, the other two were camp hopping to shop.
---
Must be broken on my PC, I'll have to verify my game files.
---
Thanks!
---
I have experienced this as well. When I messaged the team leader as to why, he said he only wanted his friends on his public team. WTF!?!
---
I think this kind of behavior is abusing the public team concept: if they want to be alone with friends, they should move to a private server and enjoy their own 'private public' team.
---
Yeah! From the Wikipedia it says it encompassed the entire US and even up to Alaska
---
I mean, guys, I have a 1\* Berserkers gatlin for 19 caps rn
---
Did I miss something? How was season 1 nerfed?
---
Also, BGS stated all seasons will be free. There was a huge confusion and subsequent backlash over their wording when they announced seasons, and they clarified it by saying all seasons will be free, with the option to buy ranks.
---
It’s not in the greatest hits list...the Fatman Avatar skin sells way more  😂
---
I mean you can build a suit of power armor from junk yet you only get maybe 5 steel from scrapping it, how are you able to build such advance weapons and armor but cant figure out how to take it apart to get half the materials back
---
Hope it does! Make sure to level up as much as possible to catch up a bit more!
---
It's not.  The stats are pretty much meaningless on PA in my experience due to the inherent PA resistance values apart from the stats.  At least with Excavator, you can carry more and load up on ore, which actually makes it better than other PA.   The only annoyance is lack of jetpack, which is really more of just an inconvenience if you're running Marsupial anyway.
---
Hacked weapons still exist? I actually thought they were all deleted.
---
Id also boot anyone kill-hoarding, really wish everyone in the team got XP, and could loot (if they were in range).
---
There is a hint there will be F1st only rewards in Seasons 2, but it is subject of change.
---
Good luck out there cowboy
---
They seem to collect the kindling but never use it? I've no idea why.
---
What the lowest you can have to get the rad barrel or special hazmat suit
---
Same here, I usually join Building teams since Ill go murdering random creatures if there arent any events up that I enjoy doing.
---
I do mine near kiddie corners cabins, near the water park. Usually snallygasters all over there.
---
Are you talking about the legendary run skin or did I miss something in the atom shop?
---
OK pal.......ok. But when did I say it wasnt to do with NW? I didnt. I merely explained for my own experience. So ease off with the aggression. Jesus.
---
There has to be some rare items
---
I only do transfers on my private world with team only option on so its me and me only.
---
I log in
---
I clean out caps vendor
---
Clean out scrip machine
---
I clean out bullion machine
---
I do score daily
---
I log off
---
That's my normal "daily routine" takes an hour or less to do.
---
Then on weekends I can actually play some.
---
Yeah you can. Beware sometimes the tech data glitches out and it gives you like 84 technical date, but you can’t use them.
---
The extra ranks of damage are really just overkill, you're giving up 6 points for an extra 30% damage. That works out at an extra bullet of damage every 3 and when everything is easy to kill already you'd be better taking bloody mess and 3 ranks of strength so you can add shotgun and heavy gun cards when needed.
---
I'm talking about player to player trading not at a vending machine
---
I keep forgetting this game has smaller creatures like that
---
Looks like he drank a marsupial serum 👀
---
VATS hit chance is affected by weapon range and perception. Weapon accuracy affects hipfiring and aimed fire. VATS AP firing cost on the other hand is affected by them. Scopes increase the AP cost while reflex sights lower it.
---
🤔
---
Yes.  And it seems like if you have technical data collected before that, you can't turn them in.  I can't confirm if you buy it from someone else whether that counts or not but dropping it and picking it back up doesn't trigger the quest
---
Ok thanks but where is best place to find some cause I can’t find any
---
For how much do you sell it? I always have a lot of steel so I could sell it to players instead of vendor bots, but what's a good price?
---
No. I’m also not sure if it’s good for the game or not. How exploitable it will be. Could it be used to find a new way to dupe. 
---
There are players that legitimately want to transfers items to new characters. 
---
But consider this. All the things you get in this game are meant as rewards for doing things in the game. Dailies, quests, events, and fighting dangerous mobs. If you give your alt all the plans and gear from the start, what are your rewards for playing this game?
---
You’re just setting up a character who’s playability seems to be just based on grinding xp and killing things.
---
This game isn’t really built for that kind of Gand play over an extended period.
---
Can you link me a suggestion?
---
Same, I started 2 months ago and I'm just passing 300 hours
---
The Black Knight skin a few weeks ago also.
---
yeah, I join the eVents for the XP bump. helps with the rotating 10k  for the season
---
Should still do your dailies, score is not till Thursday so you will lose out on all of todays score points
---
Yeah the ‘free item’ is what everyone wants 😂
---
it totally was that.  I can't thank you enough sir.  if you're on xbox let me know and I'll see if theres anything I can hook you up with!
---
Both?
---
Pretty sure that starts tomorrow
---
Feels like they need to be better integrated. The quests were fun and I get why they wouldn’t want to have companions for plenty of reasons but what’s the point when quests are done? At least the random traders have items to trade. Beckett is broken and Athena rarely drops by, and all they do is just  stand and repeat dialogue. I can only break up with these people so many times before I get bored!!! Make companions great again
---
Oh I’m aware that this place is a breeding ground for vipers. I’ve been around for a while. This particular thing just miffed me. I know the workshop rules. This for some reason just seemed low.
---
Thanks for that, I didn't know, now at least while the xp hunters ply their trade I can get kindling and keep the fire going, hopefully.
---
Hear me out, what if he was on tour?
---
This literally happened to me yesterday
---
You have a chance to find it in containers
---
If you have turrets it’s likely bc of them
---
DAMN!
---
Agreed, It's a huge failure I think from the XBGP devs.. trying to tie a game launcher to windows store.. that is tied hardcore to boot drive and reg... sigh..
---
I had a lvl 17 ask me if I had any plans he could buy. Lucky for him I had a ton of duplicate extra plans. I had him fast travel to my camp, and I gave him a bunch for free. I also crafted him a set of lvl 20 armor and modded his weapon for him. 
---
It was kind of fun, and it felt good to help him out. It was cool because he walked around and marveled at my camp. It isn't necessarily a bad thing to help out new players. This has been one of the nicest communities that I have been a part of. I just wanted to pass some of that kindness along, and hopefully inspire new players to embrace that mindset.
---
Lol, for real?
---
VIGILO CONFIDO!!
---
Unfortunately they didnt attack me, that could have been fun.
---
WELCOME! Got a copy and paste reply. 
---
Put a few points into luck as early as possible and use pharma farma. You will have more drugs than you need eventually. (Most builds require at least 5 luck anyways so it'll come in handy after 50)
---
Melee as much as possible to save ammo in the early game.
---
Join a public team. Building gives a boost to INT and higher INT gives more xp. You can then fast travel for free to your teammates and their camps. 
---
Junk is used to make everything. When you build a camp try put it near a junk pile and build an extractor on it. And once you have 500 atoms your first purchase should be a collectron. it collects scrap and junk from around your camp.
---
Capture workshops. They give XP, loot and caps (and usually a free fast travel point but that's buggered). You can then either defend or let it to be captured and then take it back. Taking back is quicker and easier as it's only one wave of enemies. Defending can be up to 4. When you build in a workshop if the junk needed to build something is green then it comes from the workshops own stash so build away. Workshops are pvp zones though. Someone can come and beat you up and steal your lunch money.
---
Every time you see a workbench get in the habit of scrapping all junk to lighten your load. And then when you see a stashbox (found in camps, train stations, red rockets) store your junk
---
Scrap weapons and armor you're not using as you get components and a chance of a mod. 
---
And this link tells you where to find ALL of the things. It is pre wastelanders so some stuff may be wrong now.
---

---
Sleep in a bed and play an instrument until you get a bonus. Takes like 30 seconds. 
---
Plant some crops in your camp. Corn or Razorgrain. And then make soup.
---
Speaking of glitches. Does anyone know if they'll ban someone for having an underground hideout, glitched into the side of a mountain?
---
Going by the stash box, it comes with the Settlers Tent from one of the Wastelander Sets.
---
Fast travelling to Poseidon Energy Plant and looking across to the dried up river a Grafton Monster usually spawns pretty consitently
---
Oh, you're one of those people? "No matter how helpful or painless your suggestion may be, HOW DARE YOU TELL ME HOW TO PLAY THE GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAME"
---
They might not trust their "friends", but yeah, kinda silly.
---
Damm I missed it.
---
i am indeed on xbox but no payment required glad i could help
---
They happen all the time in the mire. My house gets hit by a rad storm once every two days. I’ve had my house in the mire for 9+ months and I play way too much, so I’ve personally experienced about a hundred rad storms. I think they’re tied to certain locations, as I’ve only seen about ten while exploring.
---
I just hope that they re-do the game if you get me, like with ESO and the one tamerial update a COMPLETE overhaul. I'd even be down for them creating an engine just for 76 that is more stable than the current 15 year old engine they are using.
---
Yea you can. Just need to keep finding new pieces.
---
Whitespring bunker has a lot
---
So this means that in combat the shadowed metal leg eg = shadowed leather leg?
---
It certainly does!
---
Hemlock holes always a Grafton monster and two snally gasters by crashed vertibird
---
It does. In the french version of the game, it's even written that it protects from damage and airborne disease, which could explain the astronomic price of the plan, and it would be on par with a PA, which was the original goal of the SSA
---
Awesome thank you so much this is more than enough info! Can’t wait to play!
---
Yes. You just have to find them in the world. Player sold or dropped ones don't work. Can find them in any of the places where there are computers I believe in the containers. I generally pick one up when running a silo, turn it in, rinse/repeat. Another popular place to snag one is enclave bunker. Specifically the military wing desks seem to generally have one or two. Although picking up 2 won't do you any good. If you find one in a container and you have one, you can go turn one in, come back and pick up the other one and it will restart the quest.
---
There were more bugs around how you could use this quest in the past but I think they are all fixed at the moment so just grab one turn it in rinse repeat.
---
I think they just fixed it.  My atom count is showing the ~520 I was missing.  Thanks!
---
I can't say I've ever timed it but they last pretty long just walking around but anything that uses AP will drain them quicker. Running isn't so bad but using power attacks uses a fair chunk and vats can burn through them in seconds.
---
Yes... but then it directs you to the overseer to do wastelanders quests. 
---
So if you already did both then... ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Im level I think 52 to 54. And only skipped 3 nuclear winter challenges. Even with double score this week I don’t have enough time to grind that repeatable challenge as much as I would like being I have a full time job of 60 hours a week and family time. So I count on all the dailies to help me get to 100 being I only play around 3 hours a night after everyone goes to bed. So I would advise if you wanna reach rank 100 I would do all dailies no matter what. Because I don’t think the double score is going to boost people up as much as they think.
---
Camp mclintock upstairs... No loading screens to go through other than the fast travel. Easy
---
That's a possibility, but what makes me think the Megalonyx is the likely inspiration is that the first documented fossils for it were found in Greenbrier County, where the centerpiece location for this game is located. I'd reckon it came up when they were touring around asking about local cryptids, flora, and fauna
---
Yep. Well, if you killed the queen that's the 'end' of the main story.
---
Huh. Well allright. Thank you for the swift answer.
---
Yeah I’m a solo player too, but the team buffs are too good to pass up! It was a really good idea
---
That's the little fellas. Different rules for the big ones.
---
Awesome!  I haven't done this in a while.  What are a couple of the current farming locations.  The last time I did this I would regularly check Cranberry Glade in the bog.
---
The six packs of the Nuka-Cola you make are quest items. After the quest you can make individual bottles at the chemistry bench.
---
I had no idea. I've been carrying around the prototype rad suit for 100 levels. I'll be craft myself a stealth suit when I get on later. I run the helmet because it looks cool, but I haven't even tried the stealth suit. Here I thohght it was just for the invisibility.
---
I did so much grinding there after BETA.  It’s a good place to hop at low level, same with the high school in town.
---
Ha! I wondered whether Sun Kissed would be mentioned. we had someone join a team the other day and wondered why we were losing rads (Bloodied Builds), then noticed new member was sharing Sun Kissed (removes rads during daytime). We left the team and formed a new one but I felt guilty so messaged him and explained. He apologized and we welcomed him into new team and on party. A new friend was found in game ... It's all good.
---
Someone on my public team asked for .45 and I was feeling generous and wanted to clear my stash so I dropped 1800 rounds (I play melee so I don’t have much need for it). Didn’t even get a thank you! Smh.
---
Thanks, it looks like my atoms showed up today.
---
They have stated 9 is supposed to be the amount of dailies for the rest of the season. So we should expect 7-8 at 500 SCORE and 1-2 at 1000 SCORE
---
I should pick up a book sometime
---
There should be a quest for DJ Julie where you go out and find her new records and at the end of it the station learns like 20 or 30 new songs. Wouldn't that be cool?
---
Yeah I just found them there
---
Wow, thank you. After having spent a lot of time modding Skyrim and now knowing pretty much every line in the skyrim.ini I'm always confused how badly Fallout titles behave in terms of lighting. Even vanilla Skyrim didn't have any such problems, while the bad lighting even exists in Fallout 3. I mean, they are pretty much running on the same engine, give or take a few parts, but the graphical differences always confuse me.
---
They need to fix the rubber banding enemy jealth.
---
Sediment from the Toxic Valley .... Acid rain! 👍🤓
---
Jesus Christ mate drink some water
---
Correct, I have like 100 of them stored up, thinking one day I’ll just turn them in.  Nope.
---
Same here! I loved fo3&amp;4, but only spent a few 100 hours on each. But with 76, I’m into the 1000’s 😂
---
The workshop fast travel is bugged visually but it still works. Like last night it said I would have to pay 15 caps to goto workshop and I click yes and it didn’t take any caps it just says it will.
---
I'll dm you a link for couriers. I can shoot you a shotgun build later.
---
Can  i ask which do you prefer with the Telsa, Automatic,or semi Automatic ?
---
I can not figure out which is the Best for PvP
---
I have a  level 45 Bloodied Tesla which ironically is shit for  killing any thing in the game.
---
I have gone with Automatic.Reason being i know the game mechanics Cap the damage of the first hit.The rest melt players usually.
---
I have found once or twice though i have had to take a Stealth Boy,or crouch in Chameleon to reload and get the job done.
---
Appreciate feed back on this.
---
I also have a Bloodied Gamma Gun which is a lot of fun.Not tried this in any PvP yet.
---
All i do know is conventional ballistic weaponry like explosive 50 Cal etc is useless in PvP .Times i have been Griefed and tried fighting on impulse with Queen Killers i have lost every battle. Embarrassing.
---
Yet i have killed every player that griefed me with the Bloodied Tesla.
---
Wrote as much in another thread and was told i was shit at PvP.
---
Some get a bit salty if you point out there is no real science to winning PvP. Everyone Armour is useless when the Tesla comes out to play.PvP is decided by who has enough Stimpacks.Quantums.
---
I wanted food from it 👀
---
No offense, but you are really blowing this out of proportion.
---
I had dysentery and was at my camp so I just rolled with it lol.
---
Well, until the update, not really, but... The converter does remember your last selection. So on PC for example, first make sure your mouse is not hovering over the monitor, and then make your choice with the arrow keys and Enter. You can go back with Tab. If you then select the same menu options again, the converter will highlight what item you last selected. Saves quite a bit of time.
---
Duration and whether the perk cards are worth it will depend on you. When I have built PA chars in the past I generally use the duration doubler and rarely use full charge personally.
---
I don't generally pay attention to long they last. Just go and kill some sentry bots for some more when I dip below 5 or 10. Normally people are tossing them on the ground so even hunting for them is pretty rare for me.
---
Various of reasons.
---
Wrong perk cards shared, a friend joined the world and wants to join that team, the "rando" is annoying, etc.
---
Until we can make springs or screws out of steel scrap it will be too common to bother farming.
---
DJ would be a great side quest, hunting down the radio station location.
---
Cranberry Glade is my go to location. I've found some great stuff there.
---
I’ll take anything haha
---
How does one tame a creature in FO76?
---
Not always connected. Happens even without having played nw
---
Also, take into account that a NES cart that was new at $70 in 1988 costs $152 with inflation. We expect AAA games to stay at a price point for entry, but with all those additional expenses the gap grows.
---
And the food takes up both Stash space *and* a bit of CAMP budget...
---
Nice. I place sleeping bags on a long sofa &amp; when you sleep, your ally will come sit next to you almost looking like you're sleeping on their lap. I love experimenting with building 😁
---
I do this with the dart board and the responders crossed axes, helmet, and badge, makes for a pretty neat raider camp item imo. Place the dartboard then when you place the responders Crest down and the Crest disappears under the dartboard leaving only the axes and helmet exposed. I do this because it looks like something the raiders that flooded Charleston would do, kinda like a trophy head.
---
Wait you have to actually play to get all items what?
---
I take it you don't like to play other looter shooters and mmos? Because account wide transfer is a very modern feature in many games like 76. And as someone who has 5 cheacarters, I do not feel more proud of the stuff i have because I had to earn it 5 times over. It was tedious and frustrating. 
---
And don't give me that bs about rewards. Its all fucking luck based rng and more often than not I get something good for a different character and have use my private server to transfer it, hoping to god ita not gonna fuck me with a server reset. 
---
Just because you don't want that, doesn't mean it shouldn't be available for those who do.
---
It's not just access to a vault, breaking into that vault and going through all the fights in there etc are basically the end game for wastelanders. So it's not just locked and then you open it and yay, there is more to do once you get in there.
---
You can loot all their locked stuff while on a public team. I had a lowbie clear out my locked collectron the other day
---
why would you not do today's dailies?
---
They already said all seasons will be free to participate in for everyone. 1st May have a few bonus rewards along the way. 
---
They already have rewards that require atoms... it’s called the atomic shop.
---
yeah the price was absolutely insane, so I bought it thinking it would have some resistances or a cool effect but it doesn't really do all that much
---
I know what I'm doing for Halloween.
---
I don't think so but you do have the option of just the greenhouse dome which could be placed over them.
---
BATTUL BRUDAHS!!
---
Settlers bundle for wastelanders.
---
Depending on where you build your underground base, you can see things under the map. I had one near a silo, and you could see the missile.
---
[This is the build I use](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=89136fe&amp;d=sb2s01p02pd0pk0pp2pl0eu0cu1ce0s12ir2a72an2ar2ao0a04la2l71lu2l12lt2&amp;w=sd0so0sp0pc2pe2sq0s30sr0) you can trade out the weight reduction for more damage but I'm a hoarder. Same with adrenaline until it's fixed in 2 weeks. Power user is super useful too once you prime a gatling laser.
---
That's the machine that provides oxygen to the planet.
---
Look like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/evzag1/was_goofing_off_in_sutton_and_came_across_this_in/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)?
---
Wastelanders questline
---
Dont avoid it. If your lower level equipt a Chinese stealth suit or radiation suite and collect ore. If you're higher level either cripple enimes if you can deal with the amount of them or kill then if you can keep up.
---
And this is why you don’t fast click through terminals
---
Had a lvl 2 opossum tamed outside of Harper's Ferry. It survived the trip to my C.A.M.P in the sw of the bog. Can't tell you how, but that madlad is a real cutie.
---
Yes... do the wastelanders questline
---
That's pretty sweet having your own beaver in CAMP.  I just have the Commander.
---
Wait.
---
To add to this, you don't need to pick up everything you find all of the time. You are limited by your stash in this game, unlike the other games. You won't need 1000 pcs of cork for anything unless you're crafting ammo or stims or something else for sale, you really don't need more than 50 of a junk item at anytime in your stash box. You can cut some weight down by bulking aluminum and lead to reduce their weights. The bulking also will aggregate the loose items in your stash and on your character together when you bulk them and it will help a bit, plus you can sell your bulk junk to vendors. Some items won't bulk, like fiberglass spools and you can sell them directly to vendors.
---
I mostly grab the ammo and the caps off the mobs lately, unless I need steel. It's counterintuitive to leave junk behind on mobs, but it will help you in the long-run to get into the habit of being conscious of what you're saving in your stashbox. 
---
Keep an eye on that Miscellaneous tab, gunpowder, ores, some of the tokens you pick up, they all have weight and will hide there and pile up over time. Gunpowder actually weighs quite a bit relatively speaking. 
---
Plus, missles and mini nukes weigh far too much, sure missle launchers and the fat man in the other games were awesome, but here not so much due to the crazy weight involved for the ammo. 
---
Good luck out there!
---
junkies will be doing a hell of a lot more damage than assassins
---
If it weren't for SCORE dailies, (and all previous limited unlocks being available)...
---
If you like shooting things with your rifleman build from melee range, you'll like a shotgun. If you want any meaningful distance, you won't. 
---
Biggest issue with shotguns (sans bugged vats) is the range is terrible. I use one from time to time, but the current vats bugged environment isn't really reflective of a norma SG experience.
---
Look for taming guides. Brief: High Charisma, relevant perks &amp; special location.
---
Yes and no. You cannot directly place them as they are foundations.
---
BUT you can do this: place the greenhouse exactly where you want it to be---&gt;destroy it with a flamer trap or a friend in pvp-----&gt;place the tiles where you want them to be(make them surface a little bit to be able to plant crops)---&gt; repair the greenhouse----&gt;?¿?¿?---&gt; tadaaa.
---
You’re stronger willed than I am friend
---
I think they are foundations and floors, but you might be able to make a foundation with them and then place the greenhouse that doesn't have an attached foundation on top of the foundation dirt tiles.
---
Can anyone confirm this?
---
Additionally if you want something to farm inside of the greenhouse, the raiders and settlers packs each have planting boxes, one looks like a mine car(raiders), and the other is the back of an pickup truck(settlers). They aren't free items but it gives you an inside farming option that you don't hve to grind rep for.
---
Lol wtf are you serious or are you just that great at making amazing lore 🙂
---
I guess so, yeah.
---
Aye. i forgot to change that.
---
Yep this is the only actual spot to go out of the ones listed so far. Fixed spawn of three.
---
Usually the first or second tuesday of the month.
---
Ok just checked and it seems that the Atoms are coming back up... I have to try to complete a challenge to see if everything is right.
---
Your assuming. One the argument that other games do it is not a valid reason. It’s a pretty lame reason which makes all games the same.
---
But since you also went to vulgarity in your response I guess there’s no point in discussing this. 
---
I gave my reasons without him getting rude or obnoxious. You got personal. 
---
In short, your just looking for people to praise you and say your smart and it’s a great idea. 
---
Enjoy it.
---
Rifleman is single fire, commando is only for automatics. Guerrilla is auto for pistols, Gunslinger is single fire pistols.
---
It only applies for the automatic rifles. If you make the fixer automatic the commando perk will work for that
---
They still do, just a lot less than they use to. It was nerfed hard when they were made legacy
---
Dont bother selling things like missiles and nukes in your vendor. nobody buys then and they weight too much. 
---
If you get an outfit from an event google it to see if it's one of the rare ones. Some of them go for SILLY caps.
---
Since the cost of leveling up is 150 atoms constantly, and the cost of leveling up in SCORE increases by 25 score points per level, it makes the most sense to wait as long as possible before paying to level up, since paying 150 atoms instead of 1500 SCORE isn't as efficient as paying 150 atoms instead of 2500 SCORE. There are also 10 rewards in the run that give you 150 atoms each, so think of it as 90 levels since you can theoretically use the 1500 atoms you receive as rewards to advance without actually losing any atoms you had before the run began (you are technically losing your rewards to gain rewards though).
---
I got booted a few times. Think they wanted to add a friend or something. Now I usually just create a build team, and once an event starts I switch type to events team, then back once we are done. If I see no one is at an event I don’t switch.
---
Damn looks cool as hell. I'd love to place that in my camp and make a pillar out of stacking those, but no it's a lot bigger and more of a rectangle.
---
Wastelanders gotta do what wastelanders gotta do. Besides talking big and having a big ego is part of my raider in training checklist.
---
Downvoters suck when they can’t get a tongue in cheek response.
---
Ah I see. I'll log in and try to take a picture.
---
I think the whole "enlighten" thing is quite recent, actually. I'm not even sure if there's such a thing in fallout 4 ... I doubt it. In fact, if I understood correctly, it wasn't even there at the beggining of 76!
---
yup, when i used to farm acid, this was on my daily route.  always 3 of them.
---
Thanks for that picture btw 👍
---
How you send pacified creatures to camp...? They’ve always just walked their spawn points with me
---
Initially they implied it would be a monthly thing but it turned into whenever they feel like it. If you buy atoms regularly, want the scrap box and like the tent then it is worthwhile. I wouldn't buy it for the cosmetics. The customer support for 1st is also pretty terrible. I've been arguing with them off and on for 2 months trying to get mine working again to no avail.
---
For countless times I've placed the camp evn if it's red. It just works.
---
That one is my favorite.  I imagine they’re the same people who leave their mics on full time so we can hear them breathing, coughing, and rattling around in their chairs.
---
Yeah only from shooting corpses apparently.
---
And also making him super weak, you can kill him instantly pretty much
---
Fair enough.
---
I've done this one a few times and didn't even know collecting ore was a part of it lol usually only one other person shows up and it's all we can do to keep those miners alive. Usually fail this event and just thought of it as a shitty waste of 15 minutes.
---
I'm on camp build 25ish. Yeah.... this is a problem from launch. Attempt to place item, item goes green showing it can be placed, cannot be placed. Move piece, make sure it clicked to other items, yes it did, green, cannot be placed.
---
If this is the same way Bethesda builds shit. Its no wonder content takes so bloody long to come out.
---
trainyard is random spawn.  there are like 3 or 4 different things that will be there, but yeah, snallys is one of them.
---
another good one kiddie corner cabins.  its either snallys or rad scorps.  while you are there, run badge repeatable.
---
Also the treehouse village in the bog Usually has 3 to 4 anglers and one is usually at least glowing or legendary
---
That’s also Bethesda service in general, not just in regards to Fallout 1st
---
Except when fighting assaultrons. Whenever I see that floating invisible red glow of the eye beam, I quickly go from being drunk to being an Alert, focused tactician.
---
Well. Fork. I just finished my weeklies and todays dailies. Totally forgot about this.
---
Penitentiary visits are great sources of easy lead and one shot enemies.
---
It's a fixed spawn now. Always spawns snallygasters now...
---
Oh so all this time I have been using it wrong
---
I booted myself when I became full health fighting the Queen lol I freaked, no damage whatsoever! I see food build nancy has her rad removal perk shared, I left the team.  The fastest way to have Bloodied players leave the team is by having shared perks that remove rads.
---
Cant launch a nuke without you guys! Thanks for all that you do!
---
If other people loot the body first you won't get them back.
---
To much work.  Go to the prison.  Level zero hack there.  Done in two seconds
---
I remember Fallout 4 having ... problems with believable metallic surfaces. Don't know if it was cubemaps or shaders, but there was always something off. The combat armor for example looked more like plastic than metal. This is the one thing that's now correct, with having everything else looking like an oily, wet, metallic mess. I guess it might be something gone really wrong that the Devs just wanted to subtly fix.
---
4 sure my favorite event
---
Not sure how engaging in pvp at a workshop is 'griefing'. Why would it matter if the person was on a public team with you? If you take a workshop on a public server you are basically asking for pvp because that's how the game works.
---
You can find them at players vendors for around 300 caps each usually.
---
I believe they're lowering the amount of dailies and weeklies back to it's original amount.
---
I would say you are unsung hero’s, but everyone I know sings your praises! Keep up the good work and have some gold!
---
Rad barrel is The highest tier, not sure about the hazmat. Think its The highest tier aswell
---
Weeklies are not affected by it and dailies would've reset by the time event started, so nothing wrong with what you did.
---
Just use the serum of the mutation that you want.  You can have all the mutations at one time if you wanted to.
---
Yeah the rifleman perk applies to non automatic rifles. It’s under perception as well
---
You can sell the duplicates to vendors a cap each
---
Just take another serum. Radaway will remove mutations unless you have Starched Genes equipped if I’m not mistaken
---
they just happen to you as you soak up rads. Not sure if injecting the serums works either (other than marsupial, mine all occur via rads). 
---
I've got 7 or 8 currently, and they stay as long as you don't use RadAway. 
---
I use the sunkissed perk to clear up my rads in the daytime.
---
Last night I got a pet tamed for the first time ever 3star legendary albino death law
---
Full budget. Just by having one now
---
Even then if the server crashes your still SOL. I refuse to transfer anything of value this way because of server instability
---
Which one should I make auto? The fixer or handmade?
---
I mean, why not? x2 starts same time dailies will reset so you'll lose them if you don't do them.
---
Skinwalkers...
---
look around. are there other people in front of you who get all the attention?
---
you sir are a bass player
---
Post it. I’m curious.
---
You say that like there's anything challenging in this game to begin with.
---
Awesome
---
People sell them in vendors or you can soak yourself in radiation in the hopes to get a random mutation. Best bet is to buy from a vendor or post on one of the FO76 vendor forums for the mutation(s) you are looking for
---
I use a automatic handmade myself I like the damage and it’s easier to craft and make ammo for it. Find yourself a nice legendary one and you’ll be good to go
---
Dang, that sucks. How they get a fix out.
---
My base is by this spawn. Everytime I return to my base I kill the grafton monster for easy caps/loot lol
---
I was saying I would not fail the charisma check because I have separate gear load out with charisma on it. Just saying
---
Got it mate!
---
So this was fun — I had this bug while doing Ward’s quest, so the constant notifications of the Foundation property tracker signal were giving me constant bass music! I wasn’t aware of this bug yet,  so I thought that there must be a NPC nearby playing the bass. It was maddening though, because I knew that there was no bass nearby. I’m glad I eventually figured this out haha.
---
I hope but honestly you do lose a percentage of damage but I'm sure it's not half.it probably still a damn good weapon just mod it out.put on a good receiver and give it a go.if not I'd love to buy it of you.get 1 piece of armor with the blocking effect and use it in vats.i bet it would melt w the vats bug
---
If you're on the xbone i can hook you up with any mutation you need
---
I was under the impression that serums were time limited
---
Unyielding armor is what you want to start looking out for, best legendary effect for a bloodied build. After that you'll want a bloodied weapon, one handed melee is best as it benefits from both one handed skills and unarmed skills!  Incisor will be a good skill to go for as at max level it ignores 75% armor for melee attacks! Martial artist will help with melee weight reduction and a faster swing speed! As for mutations I use adrenal reaction, carnivore, healing factor, marsupial, scaly skin, speed demon, and talons, obviously if one doesn't fit they way you like you don't have to use it. This should help start your journey to become bloodied.
---
Yours truly, Your neighborhood human deathclaw!
---
I have one but just didn’t know. I thought the non automatic was meant for sniper rifles
---
Ghillie Thorn Armor Pls
---
Maybe that character shouldn't join a public team because he's a self-serving dick?
---
You're missing out! If you have got the .308 to feed it, it'll have your back.
---
With max power user my fusion cores last a decent while. Using vats, running,using the jetpack all seem to drain them faster. 
---
I have the marsupial mutation so I don’t have to use the jetpack as often which helps. 
---
Iv never really timed it but i would say since i only run when needed. Don’t use the jetpack unless i have to and avoid vats as much as possible while in power armor. I have to switch out a fusion core about every hour. Maybe every 30 minutes if its been a hard session like running queen fights back to back. 
---
As for farming cores. Workshops help but the line in the sand event usually gives 3 fusion cores. as well as having a max gunsmith card and super duper when you craft them will have you swimming in them. At last count i think i am up to 30 standard fusion cores and 40 ultracite ones for my primed ultracite gatling laser. Early game its a pain but late game. Youll be swimming in cores unless you burn through them doing stupid things like running all the time while in power armor.  The only headache is farming flux but hoping into a queen fight every time you can and deposit it into a box as soon as the fight ends will help as well.
---
I made a video falling lol
---
I'd like it if we could kill the DJ or run her out of the station to stop getting her commentary between the music. She's the worst part of the update imo.
---
On PS4 ?
---
Well hold on I'll try to jump to it
---
Lol, I spent 10 minutes yesterday smelting all of my ore into scrap ... yeahhhh ...
---
Also another quick question 
---
What is the effect of the -4 intelligence from marsupial it clearly doesn’t effect special/perk cards so what is it
---
I'm sure you can post in the market if you formatted it right. It tells you how to do it.
---
You can't trade here it's against rule 10. You will likely be taken down.
---
I just realized there's going to be an entire weekend of people posting here because they mistakenly assumed weeklies were going to count double on the weekend.
---
You would think they would care more about keeping money coming in but apparently not.
---
there are people who have been farming for literal months and not found a red dress, that's all people want
---
ahh yes laddy, the good ol' scortchbeast! first time run-ins are usually the first "shit your pants" moment, lol. Good job on helping your low level buddies out and having one of those higher level folks jumping in to save the day always helps. taking one down solo is always a challenge the first couple of times, but good job for getting the deed done.
---
my first time seeing one i was like level 15ish doing the overseer questline through morgantown. i was walking underneath the tracks near the airport and heard \*flap flap flap\* "what in the sweet lord is that?" sure enough i see a level 50, i nearly shit myself but noticed that it was neutral so knew i had nothing to worry about, in turn a level 10 super mutant ended up shooting at it. my first time fighting one, like you, god my ass handed to me. i was in the low 20s for my level and wanted to check out The Whitespring as i heard many stories, well little did i know at the time about the fissure site near there and one come flying at me. Ya my puny level 20 hunting rifle was no match. and i got butchered several times trying to get around it. I finally took one down at about level 30, with help of course.
---
my first time helping a friend with one, this goes back about a year ago. he was roughly level 20 at the time, i helped him get through everything up to that point. he asked me about the biggest baddest enemies in the game. i said i can show you one if you really want, sure enough "It's A Trap" pops up in The Mire. Wanna go for it dude? "hella yes brother lets do this!!!"
---
we get to the location, i flip the switch \*flap flap flap\*. all i hear in my headset "HOLY SHIT DUDE WTF IS THAT THING?!?!?!?!" oh that was a good laugh, i made sure he got a good few shots on before i took it down. now i have another friend who just recently joined. got him from level 1 to 10 within a couple hours on the double XP weekend. no actual questline just events. told him i would take him to meet a bat on steroids once he gets into the 20's
---
If you're on Xbox one I'll invite you too so you can get a personal views of it too, but anyways I'll try to send you a video.
---
well that's too bad.
---
Yeah I did too when I saw it don’t worry it’s a common misconception 😂

Ghillie Thorn armor pls

Dev room?

I use a fusion generator and havent had an issue, that combined with advanced connectors, theres no reason to have little generators around.
---
I use something like this, and I dont claim its the best.

---
Difference between a level 25 and 45 is 25 base damage. Still a fantastic weapon. I'd say you're losing up to a quarter of the potential damage.
---
She's adorable. You have no soul.
---
Happened to me outside West Tek last night. Killed all the muties and the turret, but something was pumping damage into me at the rate of a minigun. No visual or sound, short of my guy grunting at being hit. Had to run inside to get away.
---
I wish he would move from bar to bar triggering different events or give different quests.  Once you get everything from him he is just wasted sitting in the same building day after day.
---
Hey, maybe we will get lucky and they will accidentally enable them for the weekly ones lol.
---
Or just activate the pylons, people. 
---
“Oh, but I’m a bloodied build! I’ll die right away!”
---
Yeah, well, I’m bloodied too. I take radaway so I can have full health because nobody else ever wants to do their part, just farm the eyebombs and shoot the invincible assaultron. 
---
I feel your pain, OP. I had 4 stims left when it was over yesterday.
---
It effects how things that are calculated off your Intelligence stat. Your Intelligence determines how much XP you receive and the durability of your crafted items... So you will get less XP per kill, and crafted items will be less durable. You can mitigate this with the perk Class Freak though.
---
Crazy stuff
---
Do you get some of the benefits of having a public team even if you are the only one on the team? Like still getting +25% xp from events or whatever? If so, That could be why a "solo" player would create a public team but then kick anyone that joins.
---
Edit: For whoever down-voted me: I wasn't condoning it, I was just theorizing on why the OP \*might\* have been kicked when he was the only person on the team other than the leader.

As a fellow Canadian I just want to point out that BGS blew the scale of their beavers. 
---
Apparently theyre not familiar with the tank beavers we get here
---
How dare you
---
It's might be a room, but it's far too small. At least from the outside. It might be a teleporter though lol. Who knows. I'm not sure how to use imgur to post a link, but I took a picture and a video of me falling towards it. If anything I might find a way to get to it. 
---
Uherrmm this is uh not my camp. I can totally not create a pathway to it, but ya we will see...
---
You should have a high strength stat as shotgun/ heavy weapon perks are based in strength
---
Are you kidding? Gamma gun is an absolute pvp powerhouse, it's killer.
---
The train car came with a sliding door, if you got that.
---
Put it up on a display.
---
Did you miss something? 
---
" Currently there is a free version  which will reward the player with a new item every five ranks and there  is a premium version which rewards the player every rank.
---
The  Premium version is 10,000 Auric cells. If The Rift is completed, the  player will recover the full amount of Auric cells in the process which  can be used for the next Rift.  If a player completed the free version  of The Rift and wanted those rewards they missed out on, they can  purchase the pass and instantly be rewarded them."
---
If Bethesda implemented a similar system that can still call it free for everybody.
---
Wedingo cave
---
Did wash your feet that'll do it for me sometimes lmao..nah man reals sometimes they boot if ya dont share a perk with my 1 charisma build.
---
Serums suppress the negative effects for a limited time, but the mutation stays. Make sure you have Starched Genes maxed out to avoid losing your mutations from rad away.
---
Yeah I'm guessing they've never seen a beaver in real life. Every other creature in the game gets an upsize except the beaver. It should be the size of the hermit crab.
---
Wow, that is pretty annoying. Good thing I'm in first person the majority of the time.
---
Yes, you will keep everything but the tent and the ability to put junk on the scrapbox
---
Building teams are just people farming xp- so they usually dont want your help. 
---
Now your first point I couldn't agree more
---
Implementing a similar system, Bethesda can still say it is for free.
---
Looks like you DID miss something, such as not actually reading the post.
---
If you get certain legendary effects on shotguns they can be stupidly powerful without an perk points into shotgun abilities so means you could rock a shotty and another weapon without any downsides.
---
Bonus: use small letters to put the requested price above/below it
---
Lol oh I don't have a set
---
I was so traumatized by Encrypted after my first two times I swore it off for good. After awhile though I slowly started to come around to it, and now it's one of my favorite events.
---
Yes, shadow should be boosting sneak now.
---
Tried all that, I typically run it at 60fps due to using a flat-screen tv as a monitor. It does usually make 60 but some game areas or large CAMPs drop it down to 40 at times. Huge stutters and fps drops.
---
I believe less intelligence also means less scrap when scrapping items down.
---
Fishing, more gardening plants, and farm animals are all I ever wanted.
---
let me nuke different areas for different bosses and events!  What a wasted mechanic.  If i nuke Hemlock holes it should be filled with golfing ghouls armed with golf clubs, if i nuke the Light house spawn a nasty Mothman event, if i nuke the pioneer scout camp it spawns a crazy ass Queen Mirelurk event.  So many things they could do with this.
---
Can you change the name and put it in the vending machine? I’m never sure how that works.
---
Nope

I will try this thanks.
---
😂
---
They've said a lot of shit they reneged on, to be honest.
---
I won’t disagree on that front, but at the same time, it’s not exactly a commonly used round, which is why I find it odd that it would be included.
---
Thank you sadly being one of the few to respond with something intelligent and articulate. The speculation here is if Season 2 will have a "Premium Route" exclusive to 1st.
---
3 snallygasters + 2 Grafton Monsters in …. Charleston.  
---
all low lvl.
---
High charisma is not required, you only need 3 points to have rank 3 of Animal Friend. 
---
Source: Me with 4 charisma and dozens of tamed animals having been sent to my camp.
---
there's a handful of snallygasters there. i have been adding it to my xp route. not a bad spot at all for a quick in and out.
---
BOTH my feet!? That's asking a little much.
---
I guess picky people are just going to be picky.

Get a Vampire high ROF weapon - it makes stimpacks almost obsolete.

the trainyard isn't random either though.

You can have SO MANY mutations.  Here is my build:

---
The time limit on serums is for the "suppresses negative effects" feature.
---
Strange object underground. Fo76 https://imgur.com/gallery/CctKOfd
---
Most topics have amply described hundreds of times here. The guy asked a fair question, since "magic shotguns" are a new thing. Some weeks ago, shotguns were useless. Now, they're popular again.
---
You need to use rank 3 of Animal Friend and they have to be special spawns at random encounter locations.
---
Unfortunately the vast majority of players never have an issue, so they’ll continue to spend money. But I will day for the most part I’m pleased with Bethesda’s products
---
Didn't know that, will have to check it out! I believe I did get the train car. -Thanks
---
No shit!?  Just came back and didnt even know this.  How far into the board do you have to get?
---
Don’t fast travel in power armor.
---
Some things work, some dont. For example: Strange in Numbers seems to work when there are 2 people in a Public Group, bu not one. It also seems to stop working sometimes when I am leader of a Public Team.
---
Don't be a prick you said "season 1 was nerfed in to the ground" but didn't elaborate on that.
---
Scrapper or equivalent actually netted a lot more materials in f04.  It's like this by design now
---
I like semi auto for sneak builds, auto for loud.
---
Gnarled Shallows, I think it's called. That's what I was going to suggest too.
---
Actual intelligent and thoughtful response #2
---
Are you saying that Iron Fist and the Gladiator perks stack for one-handed melee?
---
They recently mentioned this glitch, Juicehead covered it but basically "it's one of the more difficult issues we are trying to fix, we are working on it"
---
It looks like it’s just floating there. I have no idea what it is.
---
Unyielding gear is very important.invest in strength each point in strength I think gives you 5 percent towards melee.adrenal reaction plus 50 percent damage at low health I believe..nerdrage perk and invest in iether one handed unarmed or 2 handed damage perk cards
---
Hopefully Xbone has settings to turn of messages from randoms. One thing I wish Xbone had that Sony has...
---
Can you add link? A search only brings up 1 post about the fixer getting combat rifle skins where Bethesda replies, and it's just one of those "I'll pass it along to the team" comments after someone suggests they should be compatible.
---
Philanthropist is handy aswell, your water? You me OUR water
---
I just gave up on this event and bought a rad barrel plan because of all the assholes who do nothing but sit in place farming XP and not gathering ore. The event is fun but 8+ people and only getting enough ore for rank 1-2 rewards is awful and happens the vast majority of the time.
---
I think one of the past few updates broke melee. I started off as a melee main and found it great, recently though, I seem to be missing a lot more
---
Ye. Though, I have no idea if it can be used on things besides the train or not.
---
Can you confirm for me if the ore turn-in needs to be coordinated? I avoid this one too for similar reasons as OP. I turned in ore once, and it seemed to complete the event and piss a lot of people off. I expected it to work like path to enlightenment.
---
This sums it up very nicely
---
Just go to any camp with ammo on vendors, buy a single bullet three times and enjoy your free SCORE.
---
Mines a quad FFR and FRL . It ices them in matter of seconds ..
---
They added more challenges and a recent post suggest the 9 challenges daily is here to stay. The free, except not totally free aspect I did elaborate on.
---
The sliding train car doors don’t work wit other buildings and walls.
---
 All reflex sights but anything that says better focus should lower vats cost
---
Yessir it's quiet nice being as a deathclaw gauntlet or mole miner Gauntlet or bear arm all count as both one handed and unarmed
---
As far as I know there’s nothing we can do about it besides upvote posts like these so Bethesda gives more opportunities for extra SCORE... the support tickets are useless and frustrated me more than when I got two vampires tire irons from the SBQ. sorry for your loss lol
---
Yeah, this happened to me during double XP weekend.  I was taking damage and it sounded like a mutant hound was attacking me...but no enemies were around.  I ended up switching servers and it stopped.
---
I wish I was like you
---
Easily amused
---
Their flag I would hope for starters. Then maybe a Vertibird or something would be cool
---
ha
---
Thank you. Welp let's hope double SCORE pays off.
---
only you see the name change
---
Had the same thing happen today! Two in a row, one right as we were finishing up an event which was annoying. Hopped servers and my entire team left, then joined their own team. No idea what's up with that.
---
Already have I've had enough with em . Just had a level 13 asking me to build a radshower 🤣 . Dropped a nuke on his base ..
---
why no love for the pipe weapons? they need some non-rusty love
---
and the capital building. I find a more reliable spawn there than at the bridge
---
The next season I believe will be brotherhood related.
---
And ruin the backyards of people who build camps river side.....
---
Whats considered a hacked weapon?
---
Same but what I do is wait for double exp weekend , pop in. And play hide n seek vgame (you get lots of exp). Get perks that assist you with survival like rad resistance and other ones. Sprinting etc.
---
I get around 600-800 (on double exp )for 1 match and I usually die. Takes like 10+?
---
I do it everyday a single match before hopping into adventure. It's not much but after few months you will slowly progress
---
More like we'll get what we already know: a flood of "My double score is gone because everything autocompleted". Brace yourselves...
---
Bows are buggy right now, so while the perk card build is available, the bows themselves have an accuracy glitch, especially in VATS. 12 points into Perception will get you Bow Before Me 3 which ignores some armor, and all 9 ranks in archer/expert/master. 4 points into Agility will give you Covert Operative 3 and the one rank of Escape Artist. 
---
With those perks set you will maximize your bow damage for sneaking, which is one of the only ways to reliably use a bow.
---
No shit!  I found it a couple days ago for 10 caps lol.  I was just jumping from vendor to vendor buying shit i didnt have.  What is the selling price for a fixer itself?
---
Wish it was black skin paint
---
Bethesda: we got you fam.
---
Brenda: *finally, someone with the guts to help*
---
I Don’t mind grind , I mind the cap and time gated content 
---
I should be able to grind to 2,000 gold bullion in a weekend if I want too
---
I was referring to the public team bonuses like +25% xp from completing events.
---
Once my video uploads I'll link it. Taking forever 😭
---
Thank you for the info
---
You can mitigate negative effects of mutations with the class freak perk.
---
When is double score
---
Same here, I was attacked by 2 invisible enemies during the double XP event. This never EVER happened to me before. I guess it came with the recent patch. :D Small indie studio, what can we do.
---
Lolz
---
When the music playing in my head sounds like the top 40 for 1947 I know I have been playing a lot.
---
Oh, I don't think so.
---
If this event pops up on my private server I just run it solo for the quick and easy xp.
---
I always pickup these glasses planning on doing this... then immediately forget and sell them by accident. 😂
---
It cant. Saddest part of the whole thing.
---
Nope, I don't think she tried to bomb it. She looked a bit upset that there's a camp w/o a way to enter it (it's near the edge of the rocks, so it has to entrances, on from the top with lead extractor in front of it, and one from the bottom).
---
Interesting, I think I need to go move around some cards.
---
I found some random chick walking around that’s now an ally. Her ally station (or whatever it’s called) is a chair with a guitar and she plays the same guitar loop like 50% + of her time at my camp. I hid her chair from her in the lake and now she swims around.. and doesn’t play the guitar all fucking day and night, which is cool!
---
Any scrap in the box can still be removed after your subscription runs out at least.
---
new kid : " got any 5.56?" 
---
me:  sure do its for sale in my vendor 2 caps a each.
---
I have melee/heavy guns with no vats/sneak perks that runs 1 rank of each Rifleman and concentrated fire. With unyielding armor vats is still very effective. Something along those lines is about your only powerful viable option.
---
He left a note. That must have been a confusing week for you
---
Cool!  Where are those wood/red upholstery chairs from?
---
Got 300 atoms but I'm 300% sure I had over 1k banked on the bethesda account...
---
Nope, they still exist and after the recent duping exploits, a lot of people are packing them these days.  There's some debate over whether or not Bethesda even can delete them without screwing up legitimate weapons.
---
the combat rifle finally got its first 76 skin (the Halloween one from NW is from FO4 CC) after a year and a half and it is in the Seasons system. 
---
the amount of Handmade and Pump-action shotgun probably have more skins than any other weapon
---
*hits a monkey with a bone*
---
That's, just, wow.  I picked up a VSS Shishkebab which is just about a god roll for healing, but can never seem to do the event with other people going for the rewards.
---
He sucks.
---
Pretty sure him &amp; the Wanderer don't have missions.... I know the Raider Punk does, along with Beckect &amp; Sofia
---
How do you tame something?
---
Wow, I posted I trolled some doing this but I didn't know it was wide spread.
---
I believe they’re the modern chairs plan. Pulled them from a vendor in White Springs.
---
Yea trying to remember the road map guess its in sept to nov? Idk
---
Depends.  Jetpacks and vats consume lots of core.
---
The poweruser perk reduces consumption.  Without it, you may fine your PA eats cores like candy.
---
For about 100 levels, I was in PA full time, but not using vats (melee player).  A 50% core would last 6 or more play hours.
---
Now I’m in/out of PA depending on what area of the map I’M in. but I’m also using vats a bit more regularly.  Seem to get about the same life.
---
Also don't forget even 1 point into Barbarian will help with damage resist as being a melee your str should be maxed at 15 anyway but being bloodied with the unyielding armor you get an additional 15 points into all stats except endurance(granted your health is low enough) so that's an easy +40dr right there. Not to mention if you take any perks that grant +str as well and don't forget chems and food to boost damage as well!
---
I have a 2shot dragon in my stash and completely forgot that the weapon, or even black powdered weapons even exist
---
Oh funny enough when this happened he was at my Base .. and my vendor had over 3k of 5.56 . Just amazes me how stupid people are . Went ahead and hit me several times . Whipped out my Tesla and turn him into ash. Then i proceeded to t-bag the ash pile
---
I had the same issue with Beckett a couple weeks ago. They fixed allies giving dailies with the last update but after the first few days after that he stopped giving dailies again. After 4 or 5 days of no daily from him I scrapped him and placed the space commander. So far she’s been working fine.
---
Isnt there a way to get a vertibird...I thought I had read a post there is a reward or something idr
---
Yup, I was pissed the other day.  For the first time ever, I joined a world, with my Camp in a nuked zone Near top of the World.. .and sure enough, when it finished loading, my camp was completely destroyed.
---
For real, no one uses public teams as teams anyway. Not sure the freak out especially so that private teams do not get buffs.
---
The wanderer definitely gives a mission everyday. A lot of times it’s a weapon cache fetch quest in which she’ll reward you with a three star weapon. I got my JE15% Combat Rifle from her.
---
Lol and you sir have the best of luck.  I don't mind though, completeing the ladyfriends dress collection gives me another reason to keep going back in there other than aluminum scrap runs and when I do finally find one it will be something special lol
---
The most common one I have seen is some heavy weapons rocket launcher.
---
The rocket was shot from a gatling gun I think.
---
In case you haven't noticed, people in this game don't like a challenge
---
I had one for months and never had any issues
---
I grab ore, but am usually the only one out of 10 people it’s frustrating. That’s why I gave up on it.
---
As a 2nd side note It would be cool to get the ability to display outfits/armour/power armour
---
How do you tame animals? I’m level 22
---
My friends and I launched our first nuke on a private server a few days ago. One of the guys spent the time collecting the code fragments, working out the cyphers, and then trying to figure out the codewords. It is not as easy as I expected, with cyphers that are too long and obscure to reliably search for and codewords which are devilishly devious. I think we'll probably start using this website from now on, now that we've had the authentic experience.
---
Mine never has as long as the nuke has already fallen
---
This....the extra xp and the free fast travel is literally the only reason anyone should need to join a team. You all dont have to do stuff together or even be near eachother...just join a group with building and go do your thing, perk sharing is great but def not necesary
---
That's funny...I've been working on a new hybrid character as well.  Here's the build I've settled on so far: [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=aa155eb&amp;d=s90ss2sg2sq0s30sr0pg2ph2pi2eu0c72cr0ic4a71s72ar2an2ao0a00a30lb2l71lu2lt2p00&amp;w=i44c62ce0&amp;m=51c2fe8gh3](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=aa155eb&amp;d=s90ss2sg2sq0s30sr0pg2ph2pi2eu0c72cr0ic4a71s72ar2an2ao0a00a30lb2l71lu2lt2p00&amp;w=i44c62ce0&amp;m=51c2fe8gh3) 
---
It's essentially a Bloodied/Unyielding build, but I keep my health around 55-60%.  That way I still get a significant damage boost and +5 to SPECIAL, but I don't really need damage reduction perks like Serendipity.  For weapons, I use Bear Arm, Fixer, and a Flamer.  The Bear Arm has puncturing mod and Fixer has perforating magazine since I don't have Incisor or Tank Killer perks.  Good With Salt helps with food buffs for melee...mostly the basic recipes for glowing, mutant hound, and yao guai meat.  And I use the chemist backpack for weight reduction because I'll use different chems like Fury and Psychotats as well.
---
Or (for low levels) there is almost always a grafton monster in the riverbed beside Poseidon energy plant.
---
Cause your so called non toxic players are becoming what they persecuted for so long. they won't fight or attack another player of the same level but they sure as shit will fight a lv 10
---
Don't mind the down votes this sub reddit is bad for downvoting suggestions
---
Yeah
---
Radicool is one of the few I can share and I figure it’s pretty damn helpful to the oh so common bloodied builds
---
Ballistic bock is op and super cheap to make, def worth the lil grind for that alone!
---
Not sure if it's related but I've had my turrets randomly attack the wandering traders that visit your camp. Not sure why, the trader doesn't fight back or die or anything.
---
A gun that uses 5 mm ammo but shoots out mini nukes. Had a fella at encrypted spamming it and holy shit the lag. 
---
That's just one weapon. There are plenty more, shotguns with scopes or machine guns with flamer attachments. You'll know when you see one, though.
---
Weird... Had her at my camp for a couple months and never got the first quest from her.
---
I don't think that works anymore. Just tried it with a Mole Miner Gauntlet to be sure. Used  a Meat Hook and Power Fist as well and no difference. I don't have a Deathclaw Gauntlet or Bear Arm atm, but I doubt it works on just them. Best setup is probably a power fist with the armor pen mod if it doesn't stack with perks to save you 3 points in Incisor.
---
Also your post is fake or you are missing something cuase camps are indestructible
---
take your award and go
---
Looks good, i'll keep this in mind when getting my perks.
---
I assume thats only pc thing? I havent seen anything like that on ps4
---
I’ve been invited to numerous parties, and close to 10 messages asking for caps or weapons
---
Awesome, they look like an Atom Shop item.  Thanks!
---
she's the only NPC they did right
---
lmao im glad you appreciated my shitpost. thanks!
---
There’s no story line quest for her like the other allies but once a day I get a fetch quest for weapons or a kill quest that rewards script.
---
My guess is the sudden surge in players from game pass. If they're level 13 chances are they're here because it's free and weren't really interested in the game beforehand.
---
In what way?
---
Does moving your camp get rid of it?
---
The question is that how was he able to do that with a grenade launcher? As I understand it, people should not be able to damage another person's base unless they engage in pvp with them. There is an exploit where people can destroy a base using explosive bait. But, I have never heard of being able to destroy a base using grenade launcher. 
---
Are you sure it was the player who destroyed it? Maybe some high level ghouls came in and started wrecking stuff - meanwhile that low level was trying to fight them off with the grenade launcher. Just a possibility.
---
I thought I remember a mention of this being fixed for the meat hook a couple of patches ago, so that makes sense if it doesn’t work for the other unarmed melee weapons.
---
They can't destroy your camp unless you start pvp
---
It's ironic how you're telling me how to play and that I should play how YOU want me to play. Your self entitlement just show how you're the dick here, bud. Get off your high horse and I will play how I want. Get over it.
---
"nice beaver!"
---
"thanks, i just tamed it"
---
Nice, good to know. May have to swap her back out! Thanks!
---
Were you sharing rad sponge or sun kissed?
---
I had the same issue! I finally gave up on the worthless idiot because the Daguerre one came up and I like her better anyway, and when I scrapped his chair it showed a failed quest. I was kinda mad, because he sure never gave me a single quest the entire time he was there with his stupid one-liners! Every time I'd try to interact, he'd just tell me to buzz off. I was like, dude, I'm the owner of the camp you're squatting at. You might want to check your tone, there, buddy.
---
Ah I don't have a Powerfist, mine just disappeared on me somehow so I forgot about that my bad.
---
They fixed the explosive bait?
---
If you worry about messing up, just go into the mine shafts (there are FOUR of them) and collect ore. Hang on to the ore until the event is about to complete OR until someone else deposits a lot of ore (meaning 20+). Easy peasy.
---
Haha yeah it seems to be a bug. I actually 100% love it. The little jingle gets stuck in my head and I catch myself humming along whenever it pops up. Hope it doesn't get patched honestly xD
---
I've heard of it raining cats and dogs, but this is getting out of hand!
---
Couldn't imagine the thought of playing fallout without a scrapbox. Bethesda should raise the stash cap to 1500. 800 is a joke
---
Don't worry I boot people all the time to add my wife or brother in.
---
People are worse when it comes to one shot legendarys and this forum thinks it's fine so just do you own thing
---
And a lvl 13 player can’t use a grenade launcher.
---
She's repetitive and cloying. You have no ears. I can remove the companion furniture from my camp to avoid hearing it from everyone else, but I have no choice but to be subjected to her if I want to listen to the music. If people like her that much, give her a Talk Radio station. Obnoxious chatter is the exact reason I ended up almost exclusively listening to Minutemen Radio in FO4 and don't listen to the radio irl.
---
That's all my husband is waiting for now. I know he's hoping for a collectron skin and power armor paints. TBH, I am too. I like their whole aesthetic.
---
None taken. When this happens repeatedly, it gets old real fast.
---
“Some men just want to watch the world burn”
---
Sadly some people are just jerks and have nothing better to do. Luckily I haven’t had any run ins in awhile. But the last one I had, I was just getting back into the game probably level 130 and two level 250+ came to my camp and started jumping around. I just waved and thought nothing of it until they started shooting all my turrets, crops, and the camp itself. My remaining turrets started shooting then they attacked me and basically stayed at my camp not letting me live or move if I spawned there until I left. Some people are just dicks.
---
Makes sense I have also been respeccing to heavy as I got a bloodied 50 cal and lmg! Haven't used my melee in a bit
---
I avoid it because no one helps gather ore. I always end up having to grab it to get a reward...and I am a darn bloodied build. There will be full health builds defending scavengers ( rather poorly) and I am thinking " this is @**backwards"....so kinda lost my drive on that one. Every now and then, I will do it myself on a private.
---
Yep, it happens if you load in while the nuke is about to land.
---
As I remember, it wont. They thinking about adding some extra rewards for f1st owners, but they will see it, so nothing is set to stone yet.
---
Yeah true its only pc
---
You can create Public teams on Private servers. You get the buffs just like on Public servers.
---
just an NPC that's just wholesome, and makes the radio station nice to listen to, even given the limited rotation
---
drowns out the: "finally, someone with the guts to help even though we have dozens of these i want you to go kill to get this one back" that haunts my nightmares
---
Very nice!  Good use of the existing wrecked cars.
---
Appreciate the Skyrim reference.  :-)
---
The arms get you the extra mats
---
Get ur hands on a junkies bow
---
Ive never encountered a gatling laser unser
---
I would still try to submit a support ticket. To be honest, I have never gotten much help out of them but because Bethesda is actively looking into this, there is a possibility that they might refund score or do something about it in the future.
---
I'm starting to hit the limit on my stash, but 12 bucks a month is really steep
---
Man, yeah, when you're on a pylon, that thing hits you and kills you before you even realize your health dropped! The real joy is in the rare occasion that you actually complete the event, only to have the body completely disintegrate or launch into orbit or fall through the ground or whatever the hell happens and you can't even loot the stupid thing.
---
I actually just switched to a PA heavy guns build myself but have yet to get the perk for long fusion core duration. I keep a few on me at all times and haven’t had to farm any, just keeping up with finding them as I play
---
If you think 800 is bad it was 400 at launch.
---
You guys are the only thing that's keeping my playing this game! Thank you for everything you do for this community!!
---
I always wondered, if two people share the same perk like bodyguards, do they stack? I kind of doubt it, but just confirming. Best to share something that a teammate isn't already, I expect?
---
Why earn something when you can buy it for money from the company
---
Oh gee! Didn't know everyone had fallout first! Boy howdy, I'm glad that we all know so we don't have to play with more than our friends!
---
Im pretty sure I got the hazmat suit with 3 alive but the barrel is only when 4 are alive. The thing that sucks about the hazmat suit is that it cannot be repaired, not at a bench or with repair kits.
---
Freshly minted L50, spec’ed for melee, and still terrified of SBs....
---
On my way to see Jack at the Pumpkin house.  L45 PA, unmodded, and missing a few pieces.  Carrying a combat rifle and a cultist dagger.
---
Coming from the South, found Hopewell cave.  Managed to take out the resident beast.  On exit, attacked by a SB.
---
Combat rifle.  Fortunately, I had a couple thousand rounds on me.  Took what seemed like forever....  
---
Took the obligatory picture.  (Little did I know there was a fissure across the street)   Immediately attacked by another one.  Ran back into the cave for refuge.....
---
By the time I made it from the Cave to the Pumpkin house, had killed 3 more....
---
and I was no longer afraid of SBs.
---
Killed one yesterday, such a cool monster.
---
Yup, guess it's mostly for climbing instead if dropping 
---
Been on the look out for armor pieces that negate fall damage but they're pretty rare apparently
---
Oh wow, people are being attacked by ghosts now? Where are the ghost busters when you need them?
---
I have 240 atoms because they told me in the support topic...
---
Yes and no, like most people know there is a vats bug but it only effects close range or low elevation shots.
---
The bows themselves are amazing and you can really specialise each legendary bow to use a different modifitiaction based on what you need
---
Hell ya man me too. Full health build with max life giver and whatnot. I grab all three, tap the imposter a couple times hit a razor grain flower and jetpack up.
---
I just assumed it was a side effect from using explosive weapons too close.  Like with my shotgun character, if I use my 2 shot explosive pump action point blank outside of Power Armor, my right arm gets crippled 100% of the time.   In power armor my right arm and left/right legs are the only things ever damaged.
---
It really is. I just wish more people would mine ore
---
this weekend, but ONLY DAILIES.
---
When you fall in PA right now you still get the visual effect and grunt like you took damage when landing. It makes me wonder if they broke something with falling recently.
---
But you have the option to remove them from your camp and your life with the click of a button. There is no choice with the DJ, and I think if you had a choice you'd ideally have to allow for a more settler (diplomacy, subtle sabotage) or a more raider (murder, mayhem) method of going about it. Shrugs.
---
Put the shotgun down
---
hi I am kinda newbie could you explain these so I can stay away
---
Id take some 5mm and a little politeness to low lvl players.
---
Wish there was a way to catch up.  I cant play everyday.  even if you play everyday and finish every daily/weekly you still come up short which is crazy in my opinion. You need to level up 16 times a week for the bonus 100 points to make it.
---
I get as far as i get I guess.  It sucks but it is what it is.  Other then that I like it.  The daily/weekly bs isnt something crazy like take a pic of a scorched megasloth while petting a cat or some shit.
---
Lol.. glad you had fun.  It can be pretty tough, especially the pylons.  They will suck all the life from you until you figure out how to handle them. 
---
I'm bloodied, and I solo encryptid with about 45% hp.  Get some troubleshooter's armor (any troubleshooter's really) and only carry super stimpaks or spam the hell out of regular ones. Use the First Aid perk.  Eat hp regen items before the fight and take radshield.
---
It is much easier if one person runs the pylons and another just focuses on killing the ISS.
---
I think a big reason people avoid it like the plague is the initial bug that had characters steal from your inventory while there. And no one bothered to check back in when it was fixed.
---
I wasn’t using them for the challenge I was just doing the event and was seeing level 16 and 10s getting nothing
---
Yikes. I'd have filled up by the time I reached first overseer box 😂
---
TBH, until recently, I always thought the share option was to give a person the actual card and you'd not have it anymore. Not like I've seen an explanation about it in game at all, not that I looked very hard, but there's nothing obvious about it that I saw.
---
As a baseline, On a solid run through Lucky Hole mine, you should be able to get about 600 lead ore (along with a good amount of crystal and other ores)
---
Right? "The Grind. The Grind never changes."
---
ATHENA or a trader destroy chunks of my camp at least once a week.
---
All in all it's just another bug in the wall.
---
I missed that, thanks!  It's gonna be weird/nice re-equipping it lol!
---
I'm confused. Are you saying some of the rank rewards on Season 1 require F1st? I'm trying to remember what all I've seen so far, but I truly don't remember any of them requiring it off the top of my head. I could have completely misread this though.
---
Edit: I read further down in the comments and it answered my question. Sorry for the confusion on my part!
---
Which is so so true
---
Don’t worried group play will get better once lvl sync come into play
---
For unarmed, you can increase your damage output with a lot of food buffs.  The basic recipes for glowing, mutant hound, and yao gui meat add 25% melee damage each.  If you don't have the refrigerator backpack mod, good with salt can provide more damage over something like bloody mess.
---
Also rank 3 gun fu seems out of place for melee.  Adrenaline is also broken currently, so you won't see any benefit until the next update.
---
Wait we just cripple them? Fuck I've been killing them
---
It's a noble creature
---
Now there's an idea. Late game plans for screws and springs out of steel.
---
Working as intended.  You can (eventually) get 2 pieces of 50% fall damage reduction armor by visiting player vendors and/or buying 3* armor from the purveyor.
---
Pray. Pray to whatever gods you believe in. Then despair as your prayers go unanswered.
---
For real though, losing 5 weeklies is rough. Hopefully you can make some of it back with the repeatable and the double score coming this weekend. Good luck.
---
Yeah, at this point I only pick up weapons and armor that I want to try and get mods for, because I don't need steel...like ever.
---
Do you get lots of mobs?
---
As others have mentioned, there's the Grafton Monster between Charleston Station and Charleston Trainyard (just past the bridge).
---
The bonus of this spot is that running across the bridge triggers a random spawn near the station that sometimes will be the Responder Vendor Bot, who can sell rare items like the Longshoreman Outfit, Hunter's Longcoat, Ranger Outfit Clean and others. The vendor also always has the Nuka-Cola clock and Cuckoo Clock plans.
---
Hope you bought it! That’s lucky. 
---
The standard fixer isn’t worth much. But the plan unlocks the possibility to get a legendary fixer.
---
I think Angry Turtle meant something else with "magic shotguns" but I can't complain.
---
Think of XP gain..not a total waste.
---
I farm 100 last week I have like 40 left ... I often get 2 as rewards from line in the sand and ask group if they need them so they also donate them lol
---
Yeah, I found that frustrating, too.  It takes a bit of practice, but you can lessen fall damage with short controlled bursts as you fall.  For some reason, a single continuous burn isn't treated this way.  Odd.
---
Basically, if you can apply enough thrust to change your direction a bit (up instead of down), it seems to take that point as your new starting height for calculating fall damage.  But if you wait until you're falling too fast, or if you run out of AP, you'll be in for a hard landing.  You'll likely never be able to jump off the top of the monorail elevator, but decent sized cliffs without damage are still doable this way.
---
Otherwise, you might consider swapping in the Goat Legs agility perk when you are around heights.  You can also use the Bird Bones mutation to fall slower and get a little more time for maneuvering, if you are willing to put up with the downsides of that mutation.
---
I think that's instanced interiors, I'm not so sure
---
Same idea as them you can have your play style without one hitting them but you don’t cause you’re a asshole, you see the flaw and you know of a way to make it fair for the community but you don’t attempt it cause the devs designed a bad system literally the same excuse the duper’s and glitchers use to defend their shit actions good one m8 and I didn’t have to scroll to find your shitty comments I swiped down once and it was there
---
I've been having to switch back and forth between gramps and the punk for this reason.  Eventually they just either stop giving quests or stop accepting the completion (which is more annoying honestly).  Seems to work but I always lose a daily in there from swapping.
---
Jesus christ there are like 5 answers and only half of one is correct.
---
That BBQ is part of the settler skin for the F1st tent, that came as the monthly free item for 1st, when wastelander launched.
---
You cannot get it in any way right now as that skin was available for that month only(even tho it's possible they'll release it again later).
---
That said there was also an atom shop skin for the cooking station,that is exactly that bbq. That tho is a camp item an not applyable to any tent. It will very likely be sold again when meat week comes back in a month(again the camp bbq)
---
SO:if you want it for the tent,you're fucked. If you want it for your camp,most likely just wait 1 month.
---
There is a trick to it. You can't really let yourself fall a long distance before your first boost. Every time you stop your fall completely, it resets your "height." You can slowly glide to the ground this way with short bursts without damage.
---
I love doing it but my current character isn’t strong enough to solo. So I only join in when some other person does
---
Forager Ally? That's the old "Pull my Finger" guy right? I had him in my CAMP for literally 15 minutes and I got tired of his schtick I got rid of him right away. I've had the Settler Wanderer as my main CAMP Ally now for about a month. I couldn't stand Beckett, Sofia wore on me after a week or so, the Raider radio dude lasted all of 2 days Pull my Finger lasted like I said 15 minutes. Settler Wanderer is the best, in my opinion, though she's never had a kettle on when I got back to CAMP after completing one of her quests
---
My favorite fallout comment in a while. Been there...lol
---
The ore mining only requires the arms (each arm is 2x bonus, so both arms will provide a 4x ore bonus.
---
The +100 carry weight bonus requires all 6 pieces.
---
EDIT:  I just checked this on PS4 and the torso is the key item.  Bethesda needs to either fix this (if it’s a bug), or correct the “increases mining yield when both arms are used in tandem” description for the arms.  😩
---
Again you leave trash and food on tables 100%
---
I’m a little slow, what does instanced interiors mean?
---
I’m having trouble finding info on this. How did you get this? Looted from a legendary like any other? I’ve yet to find any gauss weapons. I know you can trade gold for the plans is it just luck to get a legendary one?
---
I could see some sort of player indoor stall being implemented maybe with real player housing this could be a priority.
---
You could hire an npc to sell you goods and they have a private separate inventory but we shall see.
---
Consider using max rank Lifegiver instead of Ironclad. There is an auto-health regeneration bug associated with health bonuses and the mutations speed demon and adrenal reaction. If your HP drops below your highest health bonus, it jumps up to that bonus upon running. Ironclad is bad because there are diminishing returns for damage resistance above ~350. Ironclad is also expensive to max out.
---
Low levels always be hounding me for caps and stims..I just hit em with an "lol"
---
Screws and gears are all I'm regularly out of.  I was expecting it to be adhesive and aluminum!
---
I just want the rad barrel
---
Sucks theres not many cool interesting pistols or other items that will fit on the smaller racks.
---
Most people with one of those guns and half a brain don't use them in close quarters like that and also for courtesy but I guess since lots of new people have them they are still learning.
---
Private basement. Think loading screen like into any interior.
---
You get the achievement if you complete the quest, not if you already had the quest completed (same as with reach level 100 for example - it doesnt work if you are already over level 100)  
---
No reason to ask support because they mostly cant/wont do anything
---
Maybe it landed as you loaded in.
---
Epic.
---
Yeah it's a stupid bug since it's supposed to be your FLAMES that cause them to regen but flamers you have to bash for it to work. At least shishkebab works though.
---
Tried to fall to the strange object for a better view. https://imgur.com/gallery/cmWbdRy
---
At lvl 35 during Radiation Rumble..I am impressed. He can cower behind me if he needs to..lol.
---
But I did complete the quest
---
Very fair point.  I've thought about that in the past, but this is a great place to bring that up, very relevant.
---
Thanks! I am on PC. ES-Mindflayer
---
I only use the INT perk that increases fusion core duration. Never really have to farm for cores, always sit at around 30 to 34.
---
Wait I don't have to kill the specific one, any cryptid will do?
---
also go to happy holes golf course and the Grafton monster walks in the area, also Grafton triggers the monsters on parade event. killing him counts twoard events and the mob type, also windago's so either the custom shop top right of the map or windago cave.
---
I’ve started selling ammo by trade only now can’t deal with the vendor loss haha
---
Oh wow indoor would be an amazing idea. You could have multiple Ally's at your camp that way for sure. That could be cool!
---
Haha definitely!
---
You can do it pretty effectively if you are heavy in strength, and run just two levels of each of the rifleman/commando cards and concentrated fire in perception.  If low health build, you can still do major damage and have enough agility points to use all the sneak bonuses and luck for bloody mess and starched genes.  Melee doesn't need a ton of boosts, especially unarmed, so I'd focus on the swingspeed one and maybe full ranked incisor.
---
Goddamnit I was expecting this lol
---
Well shot, im on Xbox...
---
Flesh piles, bags, hanging hooks and corpses for my raider camp
---
No way. Im evil, but not THAT evil.
---
Wait which poster did you use?
---
I just looked at the fallout76 wiki and it says the quadruple bonus is from the torso not the arms. Has this been changed to the arms in a patch? Nbd as I have a whole set
---
Honestly at high level the plans just pile up, no one buys them from your vendor and you can’t sell them to robots.  Many people just want them out of their stash and give them to lower level players hoping to do something worthwhile with them.  My point is, their act was not necessarily 100% altruistic, there’s some self serving intent there as well.  
---
There was a dupe rather recently that flooded the game with plans and the glut still had not leveled out.  It’s a plague of plans.  Many people are just leaving stacks at train stations, that’s what I do, even listing them for free in my vendors they just sit there (usually).
---
I wish you had the option to build one of the SAM turrets instead of an artillery piece at your base.
---
B-bu-but my karma!!!!111!
---
My first attempt with encrypted and had no idea what it was about, I asked them if I had to know anything. They just said be careful of the damage. As soon as it starts I go to a pylon and activate it. Had no idea that would cause me to be targeted. Fortunately I was playing a medic build at the time with a medic shotgun and survived through it with stim paks and medic.
---
I always get goosebumps from that song.
---
Haunting.
---
AFAIK its the torso that gives the bonus.
---
Yeah, I had a level 13 do it today.   I made him a heated coil baseball bat and told him it's a lot easier to do melee at the low levels than to have to continuously worry about ammo.   I struggled; they get to struggle too on the ammo issue.
---
My camp is topped by the greenhouse with no base placed upon farmable floor tiles.  So yes, you can do it but sometimes that greenhouse with no base is a pita to place.
---
This is the answer. I have 2000 hours in, tried all builds and weapons.
---
If you choose the bloodied way, you can cause fantastic damage with no perks or even points. To go an example: my unarmed bloodied melee carries a bloodied rifle which oneshoots most enemies. 1 perception point for concentrated fire, that's all. 
---
A bloodied shotgun makes enemies explode in vats. Be sure to equip perks which apply to all attacks, like bloody mess. 
---
A junkie can do something similar.
---
What event?
---
It’s flamer and shiskabob BUT it requires bash damage to work (bug). So shishkabob with flame jets and the Perk works
---
I don't think you understand what literal means.
---
anything is possible. But I didn't hear it or see the winds blow, so it felt like it happened before I got there.  What was odd this is a place that I've never seen nuked before.  Either way, I needed to use Flux to rebuild my camp.. wasn't happy.
---
It could be that one, i gotta search for since i didn't reply to the Post
---
Sell the kids for caps
---
With the help of vats
---
Spring is here again
---
Selling dupes of plans
---
Ohhhhhhhh
---
Hes the one who
---
Who buys all our pretty guns
---
And he want to nuke someone
---
And he likes to kill for fun
---
But he plays the game for free
---
Plays the game for free on gamepass
---
We can have some more - deathclaws are a whore
---
Mutants kick his ass - time to spend more caps
---
There are at least two different rationales behind high level guys' actions.
---
One is to not waste the stuff they can't hoard and give it to someone who would find a way to use it (that includes plans and other things).
---
Second is to actually help. 
---
Once I've stopped selling plans (my CAMP is South from Foundation, and low-levels rarely if ever appear there anyways) and started giving them away for free near the Vault 76 entrance, I felt way better. I don't want to move my shop to the Vault or Forest area in general, and don't want to see found plans to be wasted. So that was a cheap solution (going to someone's CAMP and leaving them there isn't as guaranteed as leaving them near the Vault entrance; people don't always return to their CAMPs before logging off, and in that case goodies I'd leave would just stay unnoticed until the inevitable server reboot). So that's thing number one. 
---
As of helping the low-levels, it's a different part of the story. Sometimes I do help cause why not when I have time and low-levels actually can listen and wait. But it requires time from both sides, and ability to communicate. It's cool, and maybe even cooler. But it's a different thing to do.
---
It all depends on who you have. Some don't mind as much if it completes early since you get the max gold bullion tickets.  There is a counter on the side and once you hit 100 it ends in victory.  So if you want to be kind wait til the last 30 or 15 seconds to turn in the last ore.
---
Ultracite ammo more than ok to sell for more.
---
not following what are you talking about?
---
that’s a super bittersweet situation huh
---
as a pretty low level myself, when i pick up or find super high level items i wont be able to use anywhere in the near future, i either keep them on display in my camp (if i reaallly want it) or i vend them for a resonable price. 
---
some high level with eventually come across and pay for it, then i use that money to buy supplies more important to me at the moment.
---
it doesn’t make me feel as bad cause im technically still using it for good lol
---
nevertheless, word for yall kind high levels: i know it sounds whiny, but gifting guns, plans or armor thats level 10/15 rather then something level 50 is much more useful in for us :D every gift is still appreciated tho
---
Would be cool but I highly doubt it. If they didnt even put much effort into the main Allies I dont see them puttin much effort into other side characters.
---
I heard that if you get to 100/100 you get top rewards regardless of people up.
---
Id gladly pay for dlc if the rewards in the atom shop were earnable fucking content
---
 A-la-carte gaming is trash
---
It's a really easy event to be a runner, you don't even need stealth Armor just grab one of the rad suits at the door on your way in. The ore is in your misc not junk so dying doesn't matter. Even bloodied builds can just use the decontamination arch and focus on running not camping at the top. There are plenty of rad sources to top up again after the event.
---
Who knows but I bet after they drop all the new stuff and systems (I won't spoil) they might go back to what we had with wild appalacha quests.
---
I really like the small grinds, with collectable or achievements as the requirement, like the pioneer scouts.
---
Except I've noticed now that xp is 'more important' due to the repeatable score challenge pretty much no one actually does the objective and just grinds the mobs instead (these include high level players who I have actually seen doing the objective in the past, no more).
---
This is awesome!
---
The discount comes if you buy it yearly. I wouldn't expect there to ever be a different pricing model.
---
I’ll need to check that out, as that statement about the Torso is news to me.  It has been over a year since I tested my Exc PA; things may very well have changed with patches, although I don’t remember ever seeing a Patch Note discuss this...  so I guess my comments are “pending verification”.
---
Whaaaat
---
Just the torso and keep in mind, you can't use the jetpack and deep pocket mod at the same time; one or the other.
---
Hah! Offer appreciated anyhow! GL, HH!
---
Oh shit I'm 3 ranks away from that
---
I share aqua boy/girl, a huge quality of life perk.
---
Just torso.
---
Deep Pockets for arms is currently in the PTS patch and should be out with Patch 21 in early August.
---
killing them gives exp, if you can take the hoard of ghouls, do it.
---
A nice flamer can make very short work of them in the tunnel
---
I can typically get my 1400 caps daily from this event. Between glowing blood and excess radaway/Rad-X this event makes me rich with minimal effort
---
Mostly Enlightenment. I just did the whole event on my own at level 20, took fucking ages, while several level 100s just stood there.
---
The fake this player did this to my camp with out me Attacking posts there have been already 40 of them in the last two days
---
Even then whenever you do the challenge you get xp so I guess it's a good way 
---
I mean, I've won a few matches surprisingly lol gave me some youtube content too
---
On Xbox you hover over a perk and hit either X or Y and you need 3 charisma per rank
---
F76 players love you Nukacrypt...we don't even want to imagine how rare the excitement in the Bog would be without you.
---
Strange in Numbers only works when you're grouped with someone who also has Mutations - if they don't have any, it shouldn't work. But you do definitely get the base buff for public teams no matter what - I haven't tested it directly to be certain for the Events team, but for others, like Building and Roleplay, you can very easily see you get the +1 Int or Cha, even by yourself.
---
When I submitted my ticket they said they were unable to refund SCORE. Then I asked for an amount of atoms so I may buy what I lost but they just didn’t respond
---
I'm on 26 lol only reason was due to the 130 odd packs I had lol I was able to get a decent build and since then I've won a couple matches
---
It's tough to find random people to do that with. I actually picked up a junkies ss from a vending machine max level for 300 caps. I was getting almost 1000 damage per swing when all my modifiers were kicked in. But I just switched my melee to heavy guns for something different. After 280 levels melee I needed a change lol.
---
More ore brings bigger enemies too. So some people hold off to avoid the death claw swarms and so on. I like the chaos and always turn it in.
---
I have a junkie's archer/crossbow build and I have done pretty well with it but It's not an events type weapon yet.  It can do some serious damage but like another respondent here vats can be wonky.  It's also not great when you get swamped with a mob, so I carry a shotgun as a back up.  For PVP I have no idea because I don't play that but for killing SBs and such not bad at all.  But like I said I don't think they would be an option at an event like uranium fever.
---
Yes, the 255 item limit counts anything from any objects laying around the world. What I typically do is run Whitesprings and using my auto-fire AHK script to just hold down my loot button and just collect everything on my way to the golf club from the train station.
---
By the time I finish collecting the sugar bomb, pepper and spices at the golf club I strip the club for random junk on the upstairs tables then server hop to repeat. Its easy to hit the 255 item limit just in a fast Whitesprings run if you are not manually single-clicking on objects to loot or being picky about looting junk in general.
---
Oh yea, I did that already. thanks for the heads up though.
---
Bethesda, please just remove the inaccessible error, we don’t need it.
---
I just ran into this again for the hundredth time last night.  I am used to getting this with the big stair/floor pieces so I avoid those like the plague on both new and on mature builds.
---
Last night I attempted to add a watch tower to an existing camp, a place I call New Summersville up along the river with a new Slocum’s Joe and a few extra buildings, makes a pretty sweet little addition to the vanilla town.
---
I got as far as adding a foundation and two switchback sets of normal stairs to half-floors before I got the inaccessible error on every piece of the build.  I added more stairs back down another direction to a different foundation to see if that would work around the error and now none of those items are scrappable, and now I have a big eyesore of floors and stairs in the middle of my camp.
---
This error is useless, we all can see it doesn’t stop people from making janky camps, but it does stop people from making nice ones.
---
I'm going to just assume you mean arms AND legs, right? They can't seriously be only adding mods for the arms!?
---
That would be awesome...maybe have it cost all 10 turrets that are allowed at your base...or maybe 5...idk still cool
---
Wait what’s the connection between turning in the ore and spawns?
---
People actually beg for ammo?
---
A lot of people sell ammo for dirt cheap at their camp. Yesterday I bought 100 .44 ammo for the same amount of caps. Even if your too green to have any caps, low leveled scorched also drop ammo if you farm them.
---
I usually have Tenderizer 3 on and I don’t even know what squad maneuvers does
---
Brutal.
---
3int/charisma and 10carry weight per piece ... that would put a big happy smile on my face
---
Nope ,what's the deal with everyone that  feels the need to tell others how to play.
---
Your not the boss of me
---
How bout a vertibird heli pad and asam for your base
---
maybe it does. I didn't open the build menu to check afterwords.
---
Thanks! And hi, fellow knoxvillian!
---
I know they were there first. The bunker under the Whitespring was inspired by the actual real-life bunker under the Greenbrier. That doesn’t negate the fact the Enclave, save for MODUS, is dead in Appalachia.
---
Pre dupe, most of those weapons took alot of trading/time to get your hands on. The folks who had them knew what they were doing and appreciated the weapon. And for the most part were courteous. Of course there is always exceptions.
---
Now everyone and the mother has one or five...and half them folks are clueless and think their a badass because the have a "LeGaCy " 🙄. Like cool dude  you have a mass duped OP gun, how about you put it in your stash, stop being a selfish dick and be a team player. If you wanna be a "bad ass" or  greedy stay on your private and solo the event.
---
look at slow boy here. level 2 is +20% run speed
---
Gotcha, thanks!
---
I had the same issue.  I moved my stuff so he couldn't do anything about it.  But I thought it was weird.
---
Nope. Not legs.
---
How?
---
So you have nothing to back up what you said. Got it.
---
Absolutely! They all come from the East, there’s 8 missile turrets that align that edge of the camp.\
---
\
---
Most common is Mirekurks &amp; Mirelurk Kong’s. Queens every now and again. After that I’d say the Gutsy &amp; Sentry Bot patrols. I never go hungry.
---
I will def check it out tonight and see after work
---
Can you give more info?
---
I'm speechless.
---
Reading all these hilarious comments makes me wonder . . . is there a drunk 76 discord or something like that?
---
Just go to the store, under 1st, you will see 2 tents.. pick which you want.
---
I don’t understand
---
I like to hand those out to the sub 100s at the queen.  I always get a thumbs up or a heart but the jokes on them, that's not my blood.  My collectron gathers that blood and I honestly have no idea where he gets it.
---
I do love it, but I wish more people understood how it worked- I always volunteer to be the ore collector since everyone always goes on defense. And while that’s great and it makes the event much easier, it’s really difficult getting the best rewards when I’m the only one gathering ore.
---
I seen people posting that they have trouble shooter armor sets for this event and generally can find it dirt cheap.  I like the idea because it's one of the few events you can control the start time ( I think) so it lets you get switched out before you go.
---
You can do it on very simple locks, like those on file cabinets and toilet paper holders in restrooms, but to be fair I have also opened those with a flat head screw driver
---
yeah i got it lol.  I didnt know it was worth that much.  I didnt know about that second part!  Thanks for the heads up.
---
Atom Shop, but you have to have it unlocked, it came out with Wastelanders.
---
That’s great actually. I keep meaning to get at least one rank of it to switch when I need it but keep forgetting I’m favor of damage perks so someone sharing it would be useful
---
Oh. This makes me a sad panda.
---
Thank you very much for detailed reply!
---
Ha that’s wonderful. Personally I hate running bloodied
---
oh I see thanx for the info
---
Yea its all good if youre being curtious, kudos to you for self restraint.  Its nice to see that kind of player in public events.
---
Yeah I had a archer build that I tried a while back but ended up deleting it to make another character. I don’t mind the vats thing it just takes some getting used too but like you said with mobs it wasn’t the best but what about for just general play like taking on super mutants, robots, bosses, etc
---
Are people saying it's not acidic enough or is it not yellow enough, should we add more or less battery acid? What if we added nuclear waste?
---
Trust me, I'm pissed too...I was looking for ultralite for the legs, but not there either.
---
“If you’re going to play with people might as well do the minimum to help them”
---
I'm not telling you how to play, I'm just suggesting if you're gonna be a useless fucking mooch, maybe you should play with yourself until you can contribute in a public environment? There is no I in team. Don't be the weak link in a public group with your overly specific alt.
---
If you join a team with three people and they're sharing but you're not, maybe take a look in the mirror and ask yourself if you're properly utilizing the game mechanics, or simply holding others back due to your own lack of contribution. Perhaps find another team who share your philosophy. 
---
It's like you're intentionally bringing down a public teams overall utility while reaping the benefits of those who make sacrifices for teamplay. If you can't see the selfishness in that, I'd hate to see how you go about your day to day life with such a disturbing lack of self-awareness and empathy.
---
It doesn't need to be coordinated. What it sounds like to me for your situation is they left it just shy of completion so they could farm the endless enemy waves. It's not like you would have had a way of knowing that though, and I'm just guessing here.
---
Important things to know about the event: there are three ways to end it. If the four named scavengers die, it fails. If 100 ore is turned in or the timer runs out the event succeeds and you get better rewards the higher stage you are on. However the enemies also get tougher at higher stages too.
---
If you were really being coordinated the 'best' way to do it would be everyone do one run of the four mines and grab a full load of ore. Then wait until the timer is almost out and all turn it at once. That way the spawns stick to just ghouls and you get the maximum reward.
---
Don't let the this 'perfect goal' get in the way of making sure you complete the event though. You can't count for sure to have someone with the Friendly Fire perk keeping the scavengers alive. It's too easy to get overwhelmed with enemies and you can't heal them enough.
---
Especially if there are only a few people there, everyone needs to take a turn in the mines if you're going to get enough ore. Just don't all go down at once. I use a stealth suit, so I normally do a quick run of the tunnels then turn to shotgunning enemies to death. Maybe making a second run if it looks like not enough ore is being gathered.
---
And of course, this event is a real bad time for people with high rad/Bloodied builds. Which is really popular. So I imagine most of them avoid this one.
---
Yeh, unfortunately,... I have to murder one when that happens.
---
Areas like the inside of the Wayward or the Overseer's house are instanced. No one else can join you inside them unless they're part of your team.
---
Good to know thx
---
Honestly I’d even be satisfied if they just had a small repeatable you could grind for caps. Like, say, Brenda wants you to collect Mr. Fuzzy plushies and will pay you for them or something.
---
I do not know of a way to overlap floors at angles. You can angle walls but you still have a square shaped floor underneath.
---
A lot of high levels have all the rewards at this point so they will be happy to help by farming the mobs but if you need the rewards then you should focus on the farming piece.
---
Yes please
---
It’s easy to take a workshop that’s produces fusion cores. Lock the processor and go back every 20 minutes and bam, 3 cores. Keep it up and in a couple of hours you can get 18 IIRC. And you only have to spend a couple of minutes fast traveling between other tasks.
---
One thing I would absolutely love to see is a plan for  mirelurk caress fortifications
---
Welcome and small world in the wasteland!
---
That one has been out for over a year, this is the 3rd or 4th time it's in the store. I just picked it up because I missed it before and didn't have the atoms last time. If anything, it's insulting that they re-release the skin when legendary dragons can't drop anymore after wastelanders
---
I got booted. Started a new team. People joined. Even the guy who booted me! I considered booting him but I thought, I’m not a Raider, so I just let it go.
---
If any players at your event have a public team with an open spot, join them. You get loot from any tags made by your teammates.
---
I was on a team and the original team leader left and I was appointed the new team leader. Fast forward a few minutes, hour, whatever FO makes time meaningless, a 4th joins up and one of the randos that was already on the team messages me asking me to boot the new player because they don't have fallout 1st (the rest of us did) and could use the rest of our survival tents for free fast travel. I rolled my eyes so hard I nearly fell off the couch. I appointed that kid team leader then left the team.
---
Maybe you're joining with FO1st snobs?
---
Honestly probably because very few people use Raider PA. (Which isn’t like a dig at the set; it’s cool armor, it’s just statwise inferior to like literally every set in the game)
---
Nuka Cola is issuing a cease and desist for getting to close to their formula.
---
Why cripple them instead of kill?
---
So can I just use this website rather than collecting the code pieces from the military officers? Or would I need to collect the codes first?
---
I think it would be cool if they let us take these photos, frame them and sell then to other player. I would totally buy some cool photos off people if I could add them to my loading screens
---
I don’t kick people when I’m leader unless they’re being annoying over mic, luckily hasn’t happened when I was leader yet. 
---
I wouldn’t kick someone for not sharing a perk, I just get silently disappointed and hope they start sharing something
---
Ah thanks for clearing that up!
---
I do to, it should be zerg taking and receiving damage build.
---
Not a stealth never get hurt while doing max damage. 
---
Or power armor with massive damage reduction at 20% health (more than about 20%)
---
They're not there for the xp.
---
yea. hopefully Bethesda can do something about it. I feel bad for folks that had this happen to them. it must be a good chunk of budget that you can't use anymore.
---
No. They are there for the drops which you still only get when the event is complete.
---
Good idea.  I would also buy some that I've seen!
---
That’s a valid reason to not share a card, especially since you helped them learn how to, but there’s plenty of people who just don’t because it doesn’t benefit them or they’re too lazy to hit a button
---
Hell yeah!....
---
Now f**k that game mode.
---
We will fight those red bastard to the grave if they try to stop us from producing the refreshing taste that people love and are addicted to. Time to bust out the flammable lemons
---
p.s. they are really just grenades painted yellow
---
Really??
---
i was in one that had like 15 people and all we need was 22 ore for 4 minutes, and not 1 other player would go collect. I'm done doing this event with randoms.
---
THE RADIUM, GIVE ME SKINS TODD
---
Not that I know of
---
I just died LMOA
---
Thank you
---
So headshot’s while jumping? Or jump then vats lock?
---
That’s a great one to share just for the utility, it’s a core perk on all my characters 
---
CAMP fast travel spawns can be pretty bad, I had one where I would get glitched into the rocks every time. They really need to have a way to set FT spawn locations
---
Just use the site, no need to track down the officers.
---
This gets downvoted but any mention of nerfing bloodied get you down voted too.
---
Just make all low health perks temporary and call it a day. It was in fallout 4, bloodied legendary can stay the same.
---
Is the SS armor really worth it all? I really want a non-PA jetpack and I love my Chinese Stealth Armor.
---
I wanna say its a reward for a workbench reward...oh well
---
The last time I was running it i had no issues, pop a psyco buff 1 shot most things. Works great for a stealth build.  I recently got the SS jet pack and I think it work great for my archer build.  I play 3 junkie's builds on one character and I am currently running a shot gun build.  Started it because I needed a J shot gun for my archer.  Then I started rolling Gauss shot guns and I am currently loving this build write now.  I plan on going back to the archer soon though.  I think the bows that are desired are the Bloodied, junkie's, and instigating.  Limb damage works great with them because the head is considered a limb (didn't know that before).  FFR is pointless better  and less vats are ideal.  The vats is kind of like the Gauss weapons in vats, you tend to miss the first shot a lot and it really sucks at close range.  Concentrated fore maxed out is a must.  I run both bows as explosive but I am switching to priming them.
---
You could find a new team or adapt
---
I really miss him. Mr New Vegas from FNV is okay... but we just haven't had a DJ as good as Three Dog (Awoooooo!) since then.
---
Not really bugged I think, just poorly designed. It is pretty annoying.
---
So when you enter certain buildings you go through a loading screen into a different "instance" I'm not so hot with the specifics either, lol
---
Free fast travel woooo
---
Jokes aside that would suck
---
I still try even though I'm not a ton of help. I just usually try to run straight for the ore first thing since I usually can't mow down the ghouls as well as most and repair the turrets as I run past them to deposit before I go running down the next tunnel. It's not much, but it's honest scavenging.
---
Yup. Did the same last time I did the event, some other bloodied build one shot the sheepsquatch while me and my friends were at the pylons. None of us got anything.
---
False. Public teammates can't touch shit on your camp. My friend and I play public teams for the bonuses and the fun of joining up with new people. Only downside is that I can't steal the lead from the extractor at his camp when we play public 😅
---
The higher elevation does it so what ever gets you that.
---
Generally I jump first then vats
---
It's the best armour in the game...
---
Oh ok, I just randomly find the officers I don’t really track them down
---
Sub machine gun
---
Think there is a 10mm submachine gun
---
Usually just wrong perk cards but I've kicked someone repeatedly for trolling at the whitespring traino trying to kick off pvp when clearly nobody was interested
---
I've not launched a nuke yet, but my understanding is you do not need to collect the code pieces. You still do need the nuclear keycard.
---
Does that work with players too? Or just in PVE?
---
Idk why screws aren’t more common they are in literally 90 percent of everything
---
Duh. I didn't realize it until I was at 25% rads and I got overencumbered.
---
Thanks I'm sitting on 8000 some how was seeing how niche the market for them would be.
---
That makes sense, I just assumed they did so I never bothered swapping cards but thanks to you I’ll start changing cards if they’re sharing what I’m using, unless it’s starched genes since I don’t want to forget and lose my mutations
---
Honestly they aren't even useful on an event like this, it's too dangerous. Especially vs ghouls, who essentially have the VATS Blitz attack to close melee gaps instantly.
---
I boot them only if my friends login.
---
I think it's normal to play with your team when you can.
---
Yes but I don't extensively test this
---
Their reactions must be hilarious 
---
Is there any downside to cannibal?
---

---
Hell yea brother
---
Ok thanks for the info...
---
No they don’t. Only iron fist benefits them
---
Sometimes you get credit but it depends
---
I could be remembering wrong but I think this and the similar looking black powder one came more or less alongside the possum scouts update
---
Totally forgot about that thanks.
---
Honestly that’s a sleeper perk, all the ones that double resources
---
Are you sure about that?
---
Let's look at Destiny 2. 
---
DLC prices in USD when they were released? 16.99, 19.99, 39.99, 34.99
---
So, you'd rather spend say 100 USD (135 Cdn) on DLC.... Of actual playable content.... Instead of picking and choosing where to spend on entirely optional, non core game play stuff, that will in no way hinder your ability to access the entirety of 76's playable content?
---
Sure bud. Sure.
---
Today i was on a Builder Team for nearly an hour... Suddenly i got booted.  
---
I looked at the team again and the leader suddenly was alone. I guess he kicked everyone.
---
I thought: jeah f### you, i can make myself a Builder Team...  
---
The same guy that booted me joined the team. What.
---
And you dont really lose much so if you do a couple quick ore runs.  There is still 20 minutes of chaos to get plenty of fo76, imo
---
Well honestly just because it's not happening commonly doesn't mean they're not actually happening.
---
I had her for a while too. She does get annoying. Great idea putting her chair in a lake.😅
---
Because sharing perk cards literally does no harm to you and helps the people you play with
---
Its a low level event. Its damed if we do and damed if we don’t. 
---
I go to the event for the notes but if low levels are there I let them do the event.  I’ll help here an there though.
---
Do backpacks work under the jetpack?
---
Oh dang that sounds great
---
Yeah they do 👍🏻
---
Yup.  
---
Made me sad.  
---
I don't think it's a bug though.
---
This is a pretty rare one from my understanding. Filing a ticket would be great so we can get more information on this!
---
Meaning players who are killing you cannot follow you inside. Which now raises the question, are instanced interiors immune to the nuke? And can you fast travel while inside said interior?
---
I kinda wish they had sexier looking racks and shelves in this game
---
I dont bother as I use perk loadout manager to switch builds constantly depending what I need. Its a pita to constantly re-share the same perk just because my loadout changes.
---
Bethesda needs to fix this by implementing a perk loadout system to supercede the mod, and also add a prompt that says "You will stop sharing X if you change your loadout, proceed?".
---
That sucks then
---

---
So you can’t get eggs from the chickens? Damn... I was hoping we could get an alternative to the other eggs for recipes, rather than Radtoad Eggs, frog eggs, mirelurk eggs, etc.
---
They should change it to add eggs every so often. I’ve got zero use for more fertilizer. I don’t even pick up the fertilizer from my Brahmin 90% of the time.
---
Why don’t you sell them at your camp and then you can buy your own stimpacks and water?
---
They said they are not doing a premium version. 
---
&gt;	Did you miss something?
---
Yup. I feel like some people are doing it on purpose.
---
What are you playing on?  I have a few I could probably give on PC.
---
I've only done it a couple of times, and only once successfully. My impression was it was the new Uranium Fever. Loads of enemies, some legendary, and PLENTY of loot to scrap or sell.
---
My general impression is that events have been much more populated since the Public Teams have come along, which is a great thing to see.
---
People saying arms are wrong (Unless it's changed in the last 2-3 weeks) I know the description says arms, but it is wrong - It's the torso for the mining bonus, whole suit for the carry weight
---
u/MushyWaff1e u/yaboii_Rap-tor u/JapaVu
---
I used to have a video on my xbox dvr showing this, but it's gone now..
---
But I posted those video's here before for others to see and verify the truth.
---
I’m in the car right now, I’m doing 90 in the freeway. Hey Bethesda, I drank a fifth of Nuka Dark, you dare me to drive?
---
Yeah not gonna do it until I get confirmation that I won't lose my end game weapons if I die lol.
---
I wish console had that honestly. I hate swapping perks for modding gear or hacking/lock picking or whatever
---
Nice.
---
But straighten out your water things man. It's making my ocd itch.
---
Well duh stealth archers were op in Skyrim lol.
---
If you have missile turrets its possible that grahm got splash damage by one,it happens to me with one of my alts when his camp at whitesprings accidentally hits the robots.
---
I got one on my base in the bog at Lvl 150 and I was amazed as I didn't know they were in the game
---
This is kinda my point. At the time we were given these, our camps were nothing more than a stash box and weapons bench on the side of the road
---
I met a named npc yesterday. I cant remember her name but she's at the Garahan mansion. Shes a ghoul who used to be a receptionist for the Garahans. I could think of a little.side quest for her. Maybe retrieve a picture from her desk for her. Or a stapler. Kind of an Easter egg to Office Space.
---
The game is just trying to convey Bethesda's sentiment towards its player base.
---
It is not possible to destroy someone camp outside of PvP
---
 You Really Think Someone Would Do That? Just Go On the Internet and Tell Lies?
---
Same here. Never gave me a mission and when I scrapped his chair I got the notification that I failed the Ally quest that never popped up or was listed in the Pipboy to begin with. Cunt.
---
Got Beckett back and he gave me a daily immediately.
---
Servers have been lagging like fuck since last update in my opinion.
---
Why did that give me so much anxiety? 
---
Nice work!!
---
If you’re only looking for the top level perks only, sure those are obtainable. If you are looking for UNY AP refresh WWR chest you have to be really lucky.
---
I’ve seen more than a few share inspirational and that’s a great idea, too bad it doesn’t stack though.
---
I tend to be overly symmetrical in my builds, it’s just a way to introduce an “organic” look.
---
Funny on PC i'm around level 20 and I have random people run up to me and dropping me ammo and stim packs haha. No need to beg for anything. Also seemed very intuitive that I should stick to the slower firing guns and just aim for the head to conserve ammo.
---
Sure it is, only possible way is if you drop a nuke on them.
---
Interesting.  I only do a Mining run for Lead about every 3 weeks.  I have multiple PA's, and just grab the Excavator when I do a lucky hole run, after that, back to my good PA.
---
Came here to mention this. I joined a team last night where someone was sharing it and I was like, "damn that's a really good one." Didn't even know it existed prior to that thanks to being a solo player since day 1. I always default to SiN or Insp but since everyone else does as well I'm thinking about throwing this on and sharing it from now on.
---
I would love a mail box style item where people who visit your camp could drop you items. Even if 90% of players would either take items or just drop me trash, those remaing 10% would make it worth it.
---
Lmao I love all these “let’s screw over bloodied builds” comments
---
With how popular fallout is 1.4 million has to be a mistake or is it not.
---
Has nothing to do with anything I was talking about but go ahead and take the w on your own point
---
It really depends on how many NPCs are alive. If all are alive and fully healthy, I will wait to turn in my ore so I can tag the ghouls. If the NPCs are dying quickly, a tiny amount of xp farming isn't worth failing the event.
---
It would probably be to taxing on the server if 20+ players have custom photos to sell.
---
Only reason I’ll kick someone is for being annoying over mic or harassment
---
I’m sorry that they were selfish like that.
---
13k explosive fixer? Imma need to stop by your shop wtf
---
Destiny is another great example of gaming a-la-carte. Theyve streamlined the process of mass producing content for sale, and are glad to sell each and every bit to you separate.
---
How about wow? They sell an xpack every other year and have a sub you can pay for with ingame-currency. New content/fancy stuff is put in the game as earnables, not an eververse or atom shop. No stupid a-la-carte cosmetic shop that clearly gets all the work, no lootboxes or fear of missing out, no temporary content availability- literally the opposite of 76 and D2.
---
There are a variety of good and bad examples we can pull in, but this is about 76.
---
Id gladly have paid a sub for this game AND bought xpacks if the free states/raiders/settlers/bos/enclave/mothman cult/WHOEVER content rewarded me with skins/camp stuff/something unique other than some rolled safe loot.
---
If they were filling out the game with things to earn rather than grindy challenges with rando loot and a HARD STACKED atom shop Id actually rep this bugfest as one of the best games out despite its flaws.
---
Tl;dr yes, Im sure. Destiny isnt a good example of how games used to be. There was once a time where everything was earnable in games and you paid the companies for new content.
---
Edit: also as an aside I get its totally up to personal preference and Im not trash talking players that just want some french fries occasionally on the side. I get it. :]
---
Explosive bait works just fine.
---
That looks beutiful. Omg thanks!
---
Yea, luckily for me I share a perk that’s uncommon on my main but my alt has had to swap a few times
---
Hello! Excavator repair is very important. This must be treated very responsibly, otherwise, with poor-quality repairs, such a technically complex machine may fail completely. To avoid such an incident, you should read the [cat excavators](https://catexcavatorservicerepairmanual.com) repair manual. I am sure that with this you can find the cause of the breakdown and quickly eliminate it. You also can find there a lot of other repair manuals, even including dozers.
---
I do if:
---
1 there is someone else defending the side I am.  Frequently I am alone on one side just jumping down to do a run is not going to work
---
2 If after putting on my rad suit I don't immediately become encumbered.  I run Unyielding and taking that off to put on a rad suit will often make me lose enough Strength to become encumbered since the currency caps don't let me script/sell enough.
---
If you are in team, you can rejoin the same team and server once disconnected. It's not a real solution but for me was useful when disconnected during sbq.
---
Nah travel agent is good. I lose so many caps because I forgot I took travel agent off
---
It does kick ass. I was thinking next time there's a crew, like 5 to 10, just going hazmat and collecting the ore. I haven't seen it full yet.
---
I think they should make workshops like camps, It would pop up a message when you join if your workshop was taken and if you would like to find a new server.
---
Yep. It's very annoying. I've taken to not even building defenses when I take a power plant, just so I wont lose all the resources if the server promptly dumps me.
---
The game does not encourage participation, Fasnacht and Encryptid are the worst events in that regard. 
---
Sadly you just need to be there when the event completes and may get better rewards than the ones contributing.
---
Should have done more CAPS
---
This may be going over the top. But, anytime I get booted from a team buy the leader, I perma-block that person.
---
Lone Wanderer requires 4 maxed out and pretty much every build I’ve seen recommended that before the public teams so it’s not unreasonable to expect people to have 4 charisma given its popularity
---
If you press and hold the trigger and it goes “pewpewpewpewpew” it’s automatic. Which means commando perks. 
---
If you press and hold down the trigger and your gun only goes “pew” it’s a semi automatic. Meaning rifleman perks.
---
This would be the perfect solution
---
But none of these people have said that they just say oh well it was a miner glove, a grenade launcher, shotgun or my favorite a fat man and they expect us to believe that bs
---
Someone can just build it for you in your CAMP and you can just move it around later.
---
Correct. Just a card and the sequence from the site and you’re set to rain hellfire.
---
It’s rare to be in a open team with 2 or more, counting myself, sharing on xbox
---
Yeah, shotgun with the cripple perk. Don't use cats or you'll kill them. Aim for legs.
---
Edit, that was supposed to be vats, but I like the imagery, so it stays.
---
Grow some balls , its the wasteland not kindergarden
---
Just do \*not\* share Aquaboy/girl plz. Lots of bloodied builds out there that use Toxic Goo to manage their HP.
---
Pretty much yea
---
That’s a very detailed explanation my guy😂 it goes boom when I pew pew it
---
Swear to Mothman, it’s true.
---
That's actually really nice!!!
---
All you need is a nuke card and the code from these wonderful folks. You don’t need code fragments at all.
---
Green Thumb, the wood and meat versions are all great
---
I just did my first one! Everyone was killing, so I gathered and crippled the baddies. But in placed the ore right away....I should hold onto it? Oops.
---
I think maybe there will be some sort of floor entrance, like a hatch, that you place in your C.A.M.P that will be the access point for the interior and I can only assume the nuke won't do anything to it
---
Jump so high you die landing
---
thank you =)
---
Better idea:  when you suspend someone do your investigation quickly or don’t suspend in the first place.  A lot of this game runs on FOMO (fear of missing out).  If people miss out and get reinstated and in essence it was a time out, then you’ve basically just screwed over your customers and punished them because you are slow.  This is especially egregious during a season when every day of score counts.
---
Thing is Bethesda is just awful with customer service.  best of luck to you, you’ll likely need it.
---
No I have not been suspended or banned.
---
Man that’s like insane support king
---
If you read the articles they put out they said it's being patched in 21, August 4th
---
You can’t build atom shop items in another person’s camp
---
Saturation and Gamma slider too please.
---
Oh and a FIXED third person distance slider. 
---
But yeah that shine effect.. my Scarlet sniper outfit looks like she been swimming in cooking oil.
---
Lol that’s a core perk for me
---
Create a public team before taking workshops so if you get kicked, it will send you back to the same server.
---
Agreed, all combat rifle skins should be usable on the fixer.
---
You’re going to want to look into the Talons mutation as well, if you go with unarmed. In order to not lose it when you get rid of rads, you either need to stock up on the serum to get it or apply the Luck perk Starched Genes.
---
You can...but not all of them for some reason
---
Edit: WHY am i being downvoted? I'VE DONE IT!... I've built the sheedy shed to my friend's camp...
---
I have been avoiding it as well. I have a super tanky melee build w/cripple. Can I just kill ghouls and not fuck it up for anyone else? If so, I will join next time I see it. Just worried about ruining others' experience with my lack of knowledge.
---
How about sharing Sun Kissed such that it heals the radiation of your teammates?
---
Yep. Came out back in November last year iirc. All I know is I bought it when it came out.
---
Always need to help my team kill targets faster and get that ever needed exp, and if need be I can share inspirational for even more exp.
---
We(my husband and I) did it yesterday with 2 other people and we did most of the running, while they did the killing, they were lower levels and still only got 2nd level rewards.  : ( you need at least 5-6 people to max it out.
---
Im thinking of doing it on a daily basis since I run a .50 cal/gauss mini pa build.....I go through lead/steel-bullits like a mad man
---
1.4M isn’t exactly a lot, compared to other AAA titles
---
Basically more ore makes harder enemies- plus some people go there to farm xp from enemies. Grab ore, wait until last minute. You should be good - or wait until someone pushes it to 75+ ore
---
No I think it's only based on the level of animal perk you have.   85% chance to tame at level 3.  Totally independent of your charisma level.
---
Why?
---
IMO you want at least 4 for Lone Wanderer alone
---
That's why Gramps and Punk Raider are the true champs. The banter doesn't get as old so fast.
---
When would you like to dry for the late response I was getting glasses fitted
---
1.4mil sounds right, I can’t stress how bad game was at launch and that mess up has followed the game to the point most YouTubers refer to 76 as garbage even in recent videos reviewing games.
---
Yeah only Wikipedia says that so it's probably wrong, on another reddit post people say it is third most sold fallout game. I saw articles that said either 2.6 million or 14 million so idk
---
Personally I’d love that
---
seeking shelter in THAT cave could have ended nasty, too ;) oh, overread that you cleared it before :D
---
Not to be an ass or anything but I seriously do not understand why anyone would reward a company for suspending their account.
---
Wish I had people like you taking on the SNQ last night
---
If you open the cat cage on top of the ramp more enemies will spawn.
---
I'm in that zone and yesterday I received my first nuke, I was in time to move it, not server go because somebody launched a nuke at the same time and I was on SBQ. now I'm rebuilding
---
There's a difference between buying something to "support" them and buying something because you like/need it
---
My shotgun turrets always attack the wandering merchants.
---
I would love to see brotherhood paints added for the entire t-series of power armors and the ultracite pa, also for the sentinel paint to be brought in. Would love for camp items like perimeter walls and things like that I really want to build my camp to resemble a brotherhood base and definitely some new armor and weapon paint jobs
---
Always need to be a team player in the wasteland sure you can go far solo but with the right team there is no limit to how far you can go! 🤘
---
Chinese stealth armor and Feather Bones make it so I can jump from the top of Seneca Rocks (where my base is) to the ground without dying... not that I do that too often since that does sting!
---
My low level gift bag is usually a shielded 76 vault suit, 10 xcell, 10 stim packs. I used to throw in more but it seemed like much more tended to be too much weight.
---
really?   I get about 1k Lead for each run.  With superduper, I can make a LOT of ammo.  I primarily use Handmade &amp; Gauss with a rifle build, so ammo doesn't' go as fast.  I did this on purpose, because one I used the mini and saw how much ammo it chewed, I was like, NOPE, not gunna chase ammo... I like the more steady accuracy instead of spray and pray.  Its good to have options :)
---
If only we lived in a perfect world...thanks tho
---
You might be able to round them off if you place then into the ground. It's still square but at least itll hide part of it in the floor mesh.
---
Ignorance is bliss and if something bad happens it's someone else's fault. That sums up a very large portion of the players that complain on reddit.
---
Hell. Yes. I have the Grocer's (and Chemist's, but I use the perks for those) and would hate to have to deal with that again.
---
I couldnt place a fence gate because of that nonsense. All because it was on a raised tiled farm foundation. So all I could do was put fences all round and jump in. Couldnt even put steps up to it. It wasnt even raised that much.
---
Why its bad for people with bloodied ? You dont have to collect ore. Id say you need only one or two people doing this. Rest just have to kill everything on sight so it will not kill scavengers.
---
That would have been a very useful gift bag. For sure.
---
It isn’t useless. If you don’t want to PvP at Workshops pay for 1st.
---
No, the workshops are PVP.  Period. It would be a bad idea for them to basically make them “First come, First Serve” on any server for whomever wants the resources.  
---
Workshops are easy access to resources that are produced with no effort.  I wouldn’t even consider the “defend this workshop” events as effort because they can actually reward some good plans that save you a lot of caps.  That’s the reward: easy resources and small events that give good rewards.
---
The risk is Players can challenge you for it.
---
You want to remove the Risk from Risk vs. reward.  If you don’t want PVP for workshops, get FO1st
---
aahhah
---
mine live at rusty pick for gambling with mumbles
---
Dude this would be awesome to have and just limit it to one max just like the artillery piece which I think also counts towards one of your turrets if you have one built
---
Well Bethesda has been quiet about that and they did say they have millions of players across all platforms combined so the world may never know.
---
Exactly
---
I know they have the t60 paints but only if your rng is good for the daily with the "forbidden knowledge"
---
I forgot about our controller bound friends from the other side! I am so sorry you have to experience unmodded 76, I dont think I could handle it.
---
Sounds pretty good! Probably explains why it's stupid expensive, grind wise.
---
Except the wood comes from your walls and foundations...
---
Yes they need to
---
I usually just go to Tyler dirt track in upper left of the map. It’s rarely ever claimed and I’ve never had anyone attempt to kill me while I claim it.
---
Just don't take the workshop, it's a pvp mode people can play without going into NW - it's unbelievably easy to avoid
---
What perks are used with the submachine gun auto rifle or pistol
---
Mannequins to display our outfits/armor.      
---
Laser grid doors like in bunkers and silos.         
---
Customizable rotating letters sign like the ones you see when entering [Watoga](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/c/c3/FO76_Watoga_sign.png/revision/latest?cb=20190426141832).
---
I’ve got all the t-60 paints just wish I could put them on my t-45 and t-51 also I mean the brotherhood didn’t exclusively use t-60 only t-45 and 51 were the backbone of the brotherhood
---
It's called a private server. Maybe you should actually pay attention to the pop up when you claim a workshop.
---
Then I probably can't use the dense mod at the same time either huh?
---
Maybe they were role playing raiders and basic law of the jungle just wait for others do the hard work and claim the reward. Heck if I play raider I watch who goes down at event end and eat the downed player to force junk drop. Raiders win for a reason, settlers(excluding tiles with dirt on them) have nothing on our sweet ammo creator.
---
Oh i see, does the flamer do better than kabab?
---
There are ore deposits all over the map. Don't need workshops for those resources.
---
In what way? They suspended you, you want to give them money. Wether or not you want to support them OR just want the item makes no difference to them.
---
Yea I am starting to think that way...the gauss mini is just for SBQ since I rolled a hunters ff on it. And my 50 cal is a 2 shot exploding...idk Id like to find somthing better for a heavy gun pa build
---
NSFW
---
Let me guess, some 9000 hours guy came by and dropped you 1000000000 presents?
---
We need them to crate ranks 2&amp;3 of Scrapper.
---
Scrapper rank 2: Increased chance of learning recipes
---
Scrapper rank 3: Chance to receive rare materials.
---
There are technical limitations that make this pretty impossible, never mind the risks of people (especially on PC) spoofing in real life pornographic images and basically selling porn.
---
It's just mindless shooting wave after wave of glowing ghouls
---
That’s nice, I hope that’s the case, I’ve done the event quite a few times, only three times everyone was alive and reward was at 4/4.
---
Workshops are dedicated PVP zones. You clicked a button that says you accept that. You shouldn’t get unlimited access to their resources just because you got there first and turned pacifist mode on. That doesn’t make any sense.
---
Tru...Im still trying for the paints...I have enough of the papers for 78 dailies...lol
---
Next level pvp: Maxing out my agility so I can hide from another player and play my bass until they go mad
---
Congrats!  I need to work on this. I was never big on PVP but would like the rewards.
---
Yeah..but it does to me...cause when i get unsuspended I'll have something new and cool to build in my camp...and something that I've already been looking for
---
Yeah, those are good for the queen. I believe the Gauss Gatling (Primed or not) is the most damaging Heavy.
---
Something like that
---
Thanks man. All good though, we threw a couple thumbs down and that was that lol. On the flip side I've had super high levels "come here" emote during events so everyone can get a hit on legendaries. It all evens out out in the end
---
Shooting with cats reminds me of Postal so I'll allow it. ;)
---
i do this everytime it's up.    i usually run ore and try to protect when i can but most of the time people just show up and stand around and kill stuff.    been trying to get the radiation barrel plans.      does anyone know will it only drop on 4/4 reward scale?     most of the time i can only get it to 3/4.
---
You could, but it would take longer.
---
i was running this solo, or trying to, last night and thought it was so weird people didn't join up at all, but that ended up being a server wide thing where i was the only one trying to do pubs. 
---
my actual question is about the ores since i am probably a quarter way through the story i don't have anything to protect me from rads. do you just go down the hallway until you see something?
---
It’s hard to be BER lol, they really need to buff it, by a lot.
---
It doesn't.
---
When the game was released all unarmed weapons were considered both unarmed and 1h melee.
---
They then fixed this issue but forgot about the Meat Hook, which still benefitted from both.
---
A few patches ago they finally fixed the Meat Hook as well.
---
Needs to be done... Itd be 🔥🔥 on a fixer
---
That 1.4 might be referring to physical sales only.
---
Collect water from a river until you die and get a mutation and server hop. Drink the water until you get a mutation and hop. Rinse and repeat until you have all the mutations, takes 30to 45 minutes. Enjoy being super op!
---
What you really need is at least one person willing to forgo exp to gather ore
---
Lol you know you can turn the technical data in at any point it’s not a daily thing. Just make sure your only carrying one at a time cause it won’t activate the quest until you pick one up.
---
Good job. I am working toward the Hellfire myself I went on an exhausting, almost non stop grind during the double XP weekend and made it to level 92 in nuclear winter. Reached the point where I can see light at the end of the tunnel.   From here on out, I'm going to just play it a few rounds every day until I hit 100.  Could take weeks or months I don't care. I am in the final stretch. Feels good.
---
Are you saying you think it’s higher or lower?
---
True dat, u might be right.
---
This guy camp builds.
---
I’m not fucking paying 12.99 just so I can have a private server to do one small thing I’m just saying that it’s annoying that lvl 300+ feel as if they own the server
---
When xp grinding I share 3* inspirational. I know not everyone can share 2*+ cards so good 1* cards like strange in numbers are good enough. 
---
Also:
---
Good with Salt
---
Travel Agent
---
Well, I got my answer. It's your decision anyways so hopefully you get your account back in time. Good luck.
---
How is he not banned for “duping” lmao
---
Workshops are pvp zones, it says so on the big yellow box when you claim it. It is  much more efficient to farm materials outside of workshop areas. You may want to avoid naming people, as your post will get removed.
---
Should I throw other goodies back in there? I usually give things away on Saturdays and feedback to make sure the gifts are appreciated is always welcome.
---
I could throw some purified waters and rad aways in. Maybe med-x?
---
agreed - if anything, it should be around bloodied level of damage, if not slightly more?
---
grahm's ruthlessness knows no bounds.    he's killed people's pets noW he's killing collectrons!    what's next? 
---
\#JUSTICEFORSAMMY
---
I think it’s more at least 4 million plus copies but I could be wrong.
---
Laser! Grid! Doors!
---
Give this man what he wants, Bethesda.
---
Never thought of this idea. How do you work it. I have too many guns to keep in my stash.
---
I don't have her station. She's still in the place you first meet her. I'll probably try to do support tickets but Ive heard it's a real pain to get this fixed, and was hoping to hear that the bug is being worked on.
---
I personally think if it was possible to pick the flight recorder up after you've already done it like you can with some other disappearing quest items like keycards, that it would be easy to bypass. The item needed to turn in seems to disappear from the inventory, possibly as a result of load-in from leaving the game before finishing it.
---
I'm also FO1st, although I've never cared if other people have it
---
Maybe because my tent isn't in a very useful place.
---
I used 300 scrip on my level 5 mule last night just for fun. I got a level 1 vampires explosive hunting rifle. Level 5 bloodied aim damage hunting rifle and a level 5 1* instigating pump action. So my mule has some nasty low level weapons.
---
Wait a sec, you’re in workshop and that automatically put you in PVP situation. Walk out of there and stovell will leave you alone.
---
Could be. I don’t think anybody really knows. I know it’s a top 20 game on Xbox right now.
---
Ahhhhhhhh I did not know that....i had a bunch on me and it onlY allowed me todo it 1 time....I just assumed it was a daily thing lol guess ill be moving my survival tent to just outside venture lol thanx
---
Then you shouldn’t be whining about how you keep being killed in PvP zones. You don’t own the server either.
---
It'll be because they know they deserved the ban.
---
  Take the workshop for plans, XP, daily/weekly challenge, and move on.
---
   Most mats are gather-able just adventuring, adn you can usually loot them faster than a workshop can produce them.
---
 If you want to do the defend event against NPCs, many of the workshops are defendable from outside the zone - with a scoped rifle, you can snipe the NPCs and avoid being pulled into PVP while you are defending.  Bonus - if someone comes in to take the workshop during the defend event, then they have to kill the NPCs first - and you get the credit for a successful defend event.
---
RNG
---
If low levels fail a low level event that should be on them. You guys complain that we steal EXP and low level legendaries constantly when we do "help" so what the fuck.
---
Personally I find it better if you have enough people, make at least one person run through A, B, C, and D to grab all their ore. Should be around 10 per wing so 40. When they're all stocked up, do NOT deposit the ore just hold onto it and someone else runs down and grabs ore. Do that with at least 3 total people or more in case someone crashes. Wait until there is about 40 seconds left and everyone deposits.
---
If people deposit it slowly over time it will start spawning some floaters and snallygasters instead of just straight ghouls. The floaters can do some massive damage if they make it to a scavenger and explode on them.
---
Maybe I'm lucky but every time I go to Radiation Rumble there's at least 10 people so I just hit whatever I can and watch the health closely so I can friendly fire heal any scavengers taking damage.
---
Well that’s because it’s on game pass.
---
I couldn't remember when it was supposed to be fixed I remember seeing something about it but not the timing, thanks though your answer was actually the most specific
---
the game cannot even cope when i make 5 corn soups in quick succession
---
Fishing would be, almost heaven.
---
Yea definitely more, since we basically fight butt naked. It’s hella lots of fun but Beth need to match the reward to the risk.
---
the inside of Whitesprings is immune to nukes despite not being instanced. so. probably, yeah. they'll be immune to nukes.
---
and since you can fast travel from inside instanced interiors, im not even gonna wonder abiut that. i'm just assuming that you can.
---
Yeah...even issues beyond this and before Covid, the customer service was/is awful
---
addictol gets rid of addictions
---
Gotta get addictol to remove addictions. There's also a food that removes addictions but I can't remember what it is.
---
You’re drunk until you find an addictol. Or just keep drinking and the downsides are only from the alchohol you drink from.
---
Pray to talos for more photos
---
Idk why you guys are downvoting, but he’s right. That 1.4 mil number is what was reported at the end of 2018. As of July 7th, the number is closer to 2.46 million. Still quite low in comparison to other fallout games, being less than half of what NV sold at 7.25 million.
---
Was the oil made from real babies? Or is this some BS synthetic?
---
Facts
---
Personally for 1h, I'd say deathclaw gauntlet or power fist, I have a BSS + 1 STR power fist and i love it, I wouldn't mind if it were a DCG, but the power fist looks more aesthetically pleasing to me.
---
Only if you put points in endurance.
---
Hey no problem happy to help only issue now is I think they are marked as quest items once you start forbidden knowledge so idk if you’ll be able to store them in your stash could be wrong tho just gonna have to science it lol
---
This. Only reason i even go to low lvl events is now is for completing dailies and easy treasury notes, not like the xp or legendaries are worth it.
---
All I get is photos of that damn Kelly monument.  One of these days I’m gonna empty my gallery as I guess BGS ain’t gonna increase the pool of phot op locations
---
I just launched my 1st Nuke today using your site, keep up the great work.
---
No you'll only have it until you take the chem called Addictol or eat a radscorpion egg omelette. I'm not sure if there is anything else that cures addiction that I'm aware of.
---
There are also weapons with the prefix “junkies” that give you a damage boost if you’re addicted.  Something to keep in mind if you want to mess around down the road with different builds
---
So are over 100 other games.
---
Yup. The irony to me is you see complaints about people one shotting things which has again generally directed at higher levels with God rolls. and then complains of the other end of when they're not one shooting things but now you're not helping. Just can't win I guess lol
---
I’ve completed it once and that was with a few people. I had no idea what it was the first time I tried it and failed miserably.
---
Oh that sounds cool!
---
Delete then reinstall
---
Honestly the xcell, I probably would have sold that early on but radaway and purified water would come in very handy.
---
On to of that, at that low of a level, HP was low enough that full strength stimpaks seem like a waist, diluted stimpaks on the other hand are something that are more useful and hard to make that early on. Even with the stimpaks and purified water on hand. They are easy peasy once you get your camp up and running, but it literally made me move my camp 3 times before level 11 just to satisfy mission requirements.
---
I’ve had the same issue since newest patch. Best advice I can give you, don’t die 😂
---
Harder said than done if your a bloodied build.
---
I’m not sure, maybe if you’re running herbivore mutation??
---
I tried recently with some weapon or another.  Slight damage increase with the haz mat suit on but not much.  With the chinese stealth suit on it did less damage than a non legendary.   It should be 50%-75% in the haz mat suit and something....maybe 25% with the chinese stealth suit.  And it should never go below non legendary damage levels.
---
Tldr: it blows
---
Edit:  that said...I'd be interested in the reduced weight 50 cal and the handmade on future spec.
---
the idea of bloodied is OK on paper but Serendipity breaks any form of balance it can have along side its ability to go 100% bonus damage from just bloodied itself.
---
Serendipity needs an internal cooldown or reduces damage taken by 50% while below 40% at MOST so its no longer able to be the lucky godmode it currently is and bloodied needs to do 40% bonus damage while below 30% health so then you have the balance of staying around 30% hp rather than "HOW LOW CAN YOU GO?!" bullshit it currently is
---
I went from 49 to 51, while getting 70+ glowing blood packs to sell, and got three legendaries. Truly one of the best events.
---
Gotta make it challenging some how. But yea this is one thing that has always bugged me. should let you skip a couple parts for doing it already that week.
---
What glitch
---
They also said a lot of things they went back on
---
Mine is only level 9 so I have no use in turning in scrip with him lol. I just put stuff I wanna sell on him usually.
---
There are BER connoisseurs on the market reddit who'd probably be in these
---
Now I understand why sometimes server hopping caused a respawn and sometimes not. Thanks!
---
the pistol can be used with gunslinger if it's semi auto or guerrilla if it's automatic
---
Radscorpion egg omelettes
---
f**k around and find out.
---
Ahh ok, thanks!
---
I play bloodied bow and vats isnt that messed up and I can hit the sbq for 800 per shot, more every 3rd shot that's a critical. Idk about pvp though. You have to play it stealth too though I think
---
Ok. Remind me when they add a premium track to seasons.
---
Thats actually where I have them they are under the "notes" section I beleve...will have to test it out tonight after work.
---
Like most events where this role is needed, I just focus on healing the npcs and see the event as a good way to get some treasury notes. If I'm lucky I get a shot off at a legenday before they get taken out. Main problem I've run into is no one on Xbox collects ore.
---
  Different experience - at L20ish, got brutalized at Tyler by a group of four high levels, for whom one kill was not enough - they proceeded to chase me  across the map and repeatedly kill me.  I finally just quit the game.  
---
  After that, I no longer stuck around -  started doing defend events with a scoped rifle from outside the zone line :)
---
I’ve got Fallout 1st, so I just go to Sutton station in a private server on my main account. Drop anything I want to transfer into a suitcase there. Then load into private server on the mule account to pick it all up. It works like a charm. I’ve never lost any items. But it is possible to lose items.
---
You can also get a lot of ore of various kinds outside of the load-baring mission. You can use the power armor glitch to get into the mission area when it's not active and then with your excavator suit pull a ton different ore
---
in update 21, which should be in August, we're getting two limited time events where we build up Atlas Observatory for the BoS. I suspect there will be BoS themed rewards for them.
---
in update 22, which should be in November, will habe the actual queatline where the BoS comes back to appalachia. which damn well better have BoS themed rewards for the end of quest loot.
---
bgs?
---
You just need to reach level 88. The other 12 levels can be bought with the atoms given to you along the run. If you cant make it to 88 on your own then yeah you'll need to reach into your wallet for a few levels.
---
I guess it depends on what you use them for. I run a bloodied PA heavy gun build and go through 1 or 2 every couple of hours. It's also worth noting that if you have the perk that doubles the duration, gatling lasers have 1000 shots vs 500 every fusion core.
---
What about using those floater flame grenades? Those deal flame damage. Sorry if it's a stupid question.
---
Thank you for taking your time to write such an insightful comment.
---
Good you thought ahead unlike me lol, my dumbass was carrying like 100+ when I picked up the quest so fml lol
---
Kind of sad his dialogue didnt at least get expanded upon in wastelanders like some of the other quest givers.
---
The picture preview must run off the same RNG as mama murmrgh 
---
That is to say, some of your pictures are nocturnal or mutant slayers, some are rolling pins and wood armor, and some are bloodied fixers.
---
Bethesda game studios
---
To clarify I can clear the enemies in radiation rumble 100% solo in vats the entire 9 minutes and not lose an engineer as well... so you know... do with that what you will
---
Simple answer... if it gives you an unintended benefit (of any kind) than yes!
---
I have not done that one yet completely. Got into it just as it was ending and I died inside because I had no clue what was going on
---
I just remember when you used to be able to nuke places  and get at least a decent amount of high-level mobs to show up but now you pretty much can only nuke one of two places and that's either the Whitesprings or the Queen and that's about it
---
Did you count my pre-owned copy?
---
Here is the build that I have been running (with only minor tweaks here and there) since I started the game.
---
250 levels and going strong.

You should be able to find a hazmat suit Arthur facility there. A few inside, and outside. They might be level 50 though. The ore are glowing rocks on the walls when you go into the tunnel.
---
You aren't gonna get banned for that.  No way to prove intent.
---
You weren't supposed to say that now the secret is out
---
Scrapper should have a second rank.
---
I didn’t do it!!
---
i have tried before but to no avail - ill try again :)
---
If you target the super mutants arms in VATS sometimes they drop the weapon they were holding as well. I've been netting around 800 per run using this trick. Pretty neat
---
Reasons I have kicked people...
---
1. They were sharing stupid perks that are detrimental to other builds. I don't care if it's ignorant or on purpose, you get the boot.
---
2. They were being an ass at an event and were yelling at people on team chat, probably not knowing they were on team chat and not area chat.
---
3. They were jabbering constantly on team chat to people at their camp, who probably can't hear them because they're on team chat (really, set your chat back to area chat).
---
4. They were on an open mic on team chat. I don't want to listen to you chew the whole time I'm playing.
---
5. They were following me around after I told them not to.
---
6. They were spamming emotes. Everyone on your team can see your emotes no matter where you are, it's annoying, stop it.
---
7. They were being an ass to other players, harassing them and trying to lure them into unwanted pvp. Make your own team to do that crap. If I see you doing the taunt emote a bunch of times and you're at someone else's camp that's enough proof for me.
---
I've only been kicked from teams about two times out of a hundred so I'm guessing that you were doing something to get kicked, maybe something that you're not aware of like a chat or perk issue.
---
make me an offer i can't refuse :)
---
i got mine fixer and handmade plans so i can try and get some god rolls.
---
haven't had a fixer in like 1000 rolls
---
I know I have done it a few time from ones I found out in the world...i have never tried takeing one out of my stash and trying ...maybe that is the diff?
---
Which is so frustrating. I hate farming things like ballistic fiber...if I'm scrapping level appropiate items I should be getting level appropiate materials. It doesn't have to be 100% chance, and scrapper should be a garuntee on usable materials.
---
Same. I jumped from lvl 32 to 46 on 2xp weekend by running it twice. It was awesome! Walked away with lots of steel scrap and scrip too
---
rad x?
---
does it say you have the mutation?
---
That's what i was thinking. At the end of the day. My friend is just placing a tent down (:
---
Ok good to know, the xcell is probably the most difficult thing for me to reliably farm anyway. I was thinking it might help with stat checks with the new wasteland additions but +2 probably isn't enough to matter. 
---
I'll switch the stims for diluted and throw in purified water and diluted radaway instead of the xcell. Thanks for the the input.
---
Nope. there's no other full set it compare with it's not something that can be traded as far as I know and if you drop it it destroys like anything with the skin.
---
Wow. That is thinking outside the box. Guna do this with all my plans and have a dedicated basebuilding account. Thanks. Does this work with the transfer of gold bullion, caps limits (1400 daily) and scrip vendor sales? Like could I do all that twice. Level 129 and I'm asking all this. 😂
---
Technically there will be three don’t forget the imposter sheepsquatch lol, but I definitely would like to see something like this. They could do region bosses attached to events similar to sbq and maybe add in world bosses like eso has they aren’t as hard as event bosses but still give a nice challenge
---
No one knows. It’s never happened. Is it possible it will be? Of course. Anything is possible. It’s technically against the rules/spirit of the game. 
---
The more people that come here mentioning it increases the chance by 0.5 percent per post. We’re currently at 475,000 percent. So any day now I’m sure (not really). 
---
Only way it’d be enforceable is tickets and videos or names etc at time of abuse/placing tent on purpose. Take far too much work. They’ll just fix it eventually. 
---
Snitches get ~~stitches~~ whack-a-moled.
---
personally once you have scrapper it should do exactly what fallout 4 did, allow you to get the rarer components from items and gear.
---
Chad [Scrapper](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Scrapper_(perk)) vs [Virgin](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ac2q2c/does_the_scrapper_perk_or_anything_else_help_you/) scrapper. 
---
76 scrapper is so bad it doesn't even have its own wiki page it shares fallout 4's scrapper page with a weak ass little description of " Scrapper is less effective than the *Fallout 4* version. All that player character recovers is more common materials, such as steel and wood. "
---
Cushioned leg mods work well for me
---
Ask your card company to send new card with new numbers. You will get card in a week and if you have any subscriptions you have forgotten about they will all be gone
---
Did you just assume its number?
---
Never had a single player on xbox beg for ammo. Frankly, I'd drop it for them. Mostly a meelee build anyway so I'm swimming in ammo most of the time.
---
Exactly. Its better to let those low levels get experience otherwise we'd just wipe out everything. I only step in during low level events if it would fail otherwise or someone is obviously struggling.
---
Yeah just snag one at a time, every time you pull one out of your stash it should trigger the quest just like taking one out of a container
---
I think some of those makes sense but I think the most obvious one is to open a spot for a friend
---
I’ll make sure our defence is sound first on each side. Then I’ll go do my turn and collect ore from each tunnel once. Shooting ghouls on my way to help the defenders. 
---
I’ve only got the rad barrel once, but I’ve traded for a few plans prior anyways. Never got the rare hazmat suit from the event. Had to acquire it from trades.
---
It would, and without being on a Fixer it’s basically wasted for me (and many other people) as a reward, since I never use the base combat rifle when the Fixer is available.
---
Placing a survival tent in a certain locations causes all the scorched ads to rain down in one region. Easy killing if you have the right weapons.
---
Yeah that would be awesome. I’ll take any end game challenges I can get at this point. Plus mutant slayers, or exterminators might actually be useful if there were events that incentivized holding one of them in your stash
---
I am usually on around 9pm to 12am central time. I'm listed in game as redzone04
---
Thank you, I’ll keep that in mind
---
I tried to fast travel to my team mate but accidently kicked him. I was so embarrassed that i left the world.
---
Guess I better clarify. I'm on pc not a console
---
3/4 is definitely the minimum for most builds out there. The issue at hand though is whether or not you can share a perk in the first place. Sure, I can share a 1 star, but all my 1 stars are total shit and moot. Am I going to share sunkissed? Fuck no, 90% of the teams I join are bloodied. Plus, considering the grind, I really don't want to waste a level up on a 1 star instance of say Tank Killer, or Inspirational. I already have those maxed out, but can't share because of the BS charisma requirement.
---
Makes sense I also phased out my combat rifles in recent months for fixers. Sometimes use a b2525 on .38 auto for trash clearing but... My fixer can do that aswell 😅
---
Love them skins thou only reason I carry a cr still
---
You can get free Addictol every time you complete the event Guided Meditation. Addictol can be pretty tough to find at the early levels. If you're low level just tag some stuff and let others complete the majority of it.
---
You saying that you don't appreciate the glorious lag?
---
ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?
---
I think differently enemies spawn based on the amount of ore turned in
---
Pretty sure this bug happens with all of the companions.  At least, I've experienced it with Space Lady™, Raider Radio Dude™, and Guitar Lady™ after Patch 20.  I don't have Food Finder Guy™ yet, and Bartender Supreme™ has been in storage since before Patch 20.
---
I'm not sure of the cooldown period on them.  I've noticed sometimes when I start playing, they have no quest available, but an hour or so later they do have a quest.  Is it 24 hours from when you last completed the quest?  Some other thing?
---
Oh man that's nice looking!
---

---
 &gt; Oh man that's nice looking!
---
Maybe the door is all of the problem. I decorated and wired up the whole thing before I put any doors on and I didn't have any issues with anything sinking in. I hung lights from the ceiling and put down a rug, no problem.
---
Try storing the doors and see if it helps.
---
Definitely it would be a good way to make other legendary effect more useful for certain situations
---
Others have pointed out that the flamer only works by bashing, so I'd guess no.  If it's like the vampire effect, again damage doesnt matter, heal speed is only based on frequency of hits.
---
That must have taken a lot of effort, well done, just a shame the paint doesn't look very good :/
---
I have a 1* bloodied. Does that work?
---
Yeah, I’m on Xbox and I’ve been kicked off teams a few times now :/ it made me sad at first lol — I’m a nice player who doesn’t pull bullshit things so I took it personally at first until I realized that they wanted to bring their friends in, which?? Again just make a new team, don’t boot strangers lol.
---
Hey, did you ever have any luck with this? I've been trying to find those damn plans for the past two hours! I *swear* that when the game first came out, I used to see those plans **EVERYWHERE**!
---
Anyone that shares inspiration level 3 I immediately as a friend because that is one of the best. I share the night person perk to at least add on to that XP during the game time evening hours. I think there's a number of great perks to share like strange in numbers that way folks who don't have it equipped could still benefit and radicool is kind of a nice perk to share
---
&gt;I actually had one guy get pissy because I only crafted 100 rounds of .50 for him.   That's when I stopped handing out ammo altogether.
---
yeah its pretty lame right now.
---
Ahh that's right that's before she goes to your base. Sorry about that. Well if you go the ticket route feel free to send the number to me so I can escalate it for you.
---
Isn't the max that one person can collect 40 ore?  You need at least 3 to collect to get 100.  But you can collect your 40 fairly quickly if not overcucumbered.
---
Yep. Take a break. Screw the grind.
---
Um Chinese stealth suit at least requires level 50 to equip
---
Strange in Numbers, Tenderizer, Travel Agent, Serendipity, Ricochet, Blocker and Radicool
---
Zombies give rads on hit too. Sure you're probably going to have decent rad resist and killing quickly, but with so many it's hard if not impossible to avoid taking any damage and having the rads chip away at your tiny health bar. I haven't done that even since going Bloodied, but I'll probably hit a rad-away before starting it and  just live without Nerd Rage for a while.
---
yes that is perfect
---
Wha... why?  I'm always in PA, never seen a problem with it.
---
There are plenty of perks that are good at 1 Star though, they’re mostly utility though and that’s why people don’t regularly have them on
---
It's the result of a bug using standard, albeit flawed game dynamics, rather than a glitch that requires underhand and often complex player input to game-the-game.
---
Banning people for such things is very highly unlikely and would set a bad precedent, you might as well then ban for spawn camping when enemies use the same point every time, 'magic' weapons with higher than stated damage, and other quirks.
---
Duping is very different barrel of fish.
---
But don't be surprised if Beth turn around and extend the no-camp zone or rewrite the spawn codes.
---
It's my favorite event in the game! So many times I'd go and wait for people to show up. Most of the time they don't. Even when I'm on a public team.
---
Do the Wastelanders NPCs react to it in any way? That was the main drawback in older games
---
Let me think on that.  They are nicer to look at in the inventory than they are to actually use.  That makes their value hard to nail down for me at least.
---
Joining your server now.
---
I think it did, but personally I never trust Bethesda to not reintroduce old bugs.
---
How do I do this? I just started 2 weeks ago.
---
It’s a pretty common practice really. And you can’t transfer things like treasury notes or gold bullion items. But for caps and scrip you can essentially double up by hitting the limit on your main account and then transferring stuff to the mule. So if you transfer stuff to sell to a vendor then you can make an extra 1400 caps but it’ll obviously be locked to the mule. I mainly use this method for scrip. Because I can collect extra legendaries, transfer them and then get more rolls per day at the purveyor. Then if you get a good roll on the mule account you can transfer the good weapon/armor to your main. But keep in mind that if you have a mule for scrip purposes then you’ll want them to be level 50 at least so all the rolls are max level. You can clear a lot of stash space by just storing things like excess ammo and meds on the mule and grabbing them whenever you need them.
---
I’m used to unmodded Fallout so it’s not that bad but man there’s some QoL mods I’d love
---
I'd run silos a ton more if I could skip some of those things.
---
Same. It used to only happen when I died to a hacked weapon in PvP but now it happens almost every time I die without fail. Good thing I don’t die very often I guess :|
---
I’ve only ever gotten one legendary fixer and it was literally my first roll at the purveyor after learning the plan lol. Unfortunately it was a garbage assassins.
---
or for people that want pvp, Import old and fight over in the new server. if you win of course.   
---
much like an invasion in dark souls
---
Well, yes. You’re trash, just like the rest of us. But the Stealth Boy Tesla pricks are using the most powerful build in the game when it comes to PvP. But if the other guy doesn’t have stealth boys, then an explosive laser rifle (BE, JE and VE are best) are the way forward.
---
aight
---
I've known about the code thing for a while. Makes it easy to run the same silo over and over - though I do try to run them all, just to be on the safe side.
---
But no, the biometric card is needed every time.
---
Why do you cripple and not kill?
---
I would love to see them create a entirely new underwater/underground location by the Lake near the Pioneer Scout camp for another Raid Boss.
---
Lazer everything and complete the mission, got it.
---
Just point them to the Lucky Hole and tell them to have at it.
---
I left a team that I had formed because someone was sharing born survivor and I didnt fell like using all my stimpaks that day.
---
I'm not do it by myself strong but when it goes up I go there every time. I specifically use heavey machine guns so I can keep at least two scavengers alive but theirs no ore gathering from me.
---
The more people in the area, the more mobs are produced.
---
If you are standing around why 1 person is dealing with everything, that person is dealing with mobs for two people.
---
If the event is failed, it is on you.
---
I am so grateful for this. Hidden bonus of always being on a public team. Saved my ass a few times, including right after claiming Monongah Power.
---
I don’t know about other systems but on Xbox you hover over the perk you want to share and hit either  X or Y (the one that doesn’t combine cards). You need 3 charisma per rank, so a 1 Star just needs 3 while a 2 star perk needs 6. 
---
Having 4 charisma is recommended since there are plenty of good charisma cards like  Lone Wanderer, Tenderizer, Hard Bargain to name a few
---
Oh my god thank you. I’ve been so annoyed with all the lens flares and glossiness.
---
      I'd just have it in the arty slot. So you can either build the cannon or you can build the SAM. I know there is a book written somewhere filled with issues they should adress first, but the cannon is very mediocre. Different shell types like high explosive, or grape shot, or even AP rounds for penning into buildings would be awesome. Different cannon configurations might also be cool. A long barrel for increased range and accuracy while lowering the shot count would be awesome. 
---
      A crazy idea would be to have a faction specific artillery for the prewar power house groups. It would also make a few cool mission specific rewards that would make doing the faction quests more fun.
---
     Give the enclave a satellite uplink you build in your camp that let's you call in orbital strikes without having to make the beacons (not that they are hard to make, they are just slightly more work than they are worth).
---
     Give the free states mortar upgrades that gives you shell types. 
---
     Give the new brotherhood the SAM since they were so obsessed with Sierra Bravos. I can make a fully functional fusion reactor in a shack in the woods, I should be able to repurpose one of those turrets they left scattered around the bog.
---
     I dont really know what would fit the responders. Maybe a survey beacon that calls in vertibots. Maybe dont give them anything because they are the first faction you interact with (even if was only picking over there corpses).
---
     It will probably never be done, and rightly so since the game needs lots of attention elsewhere. It would be nice though to get some more variety for such a gimmicky part of the game.
---
I thought for sure it would be more active due to the Score event but lately? It just feels deader than before, and this was BEFORE the Gamepass thing even started btw.
---
What perk were you sharing?  Ill boot people if friends want to get on my team or if my rando teammate is sharing rad sponge or born survivor and I cant leave myself.
---
Toxic goo for large rads, glowing blood for smaller amounts, keep a lot on u and u never need to look for dirty water. Also only use diluted radaway for removing too many rads. I find any buff that raises max hp to be the most annoying culprit so i tend to avoid them.
---
Thanks, I am on Xbox (yay Game Pass!)
---
There are team buff levels for 1-4 players. 1 would be just you. You can see the effect in your pipboy. So it's always worth being on a solo team for that alone. As for perk cards, strange in numbers requires at least 1 teammate besides you to be mutated. Herd Mentality only checks if you are a member of a team or not, so it'll work on a solo team.  Inspirational checks if your number of teammates is greater than 0, so you need at least one teammate besides yourself.
---
I have a shishkabob and level 3 friendly fire on all of my characters so I can keep the scavangers alive.  I lose out on the legendaries usually but I the even almost never fails if the others can keep the adds off me so I can keep the scavangers health up.
---
2 wendigos heading south from abbies bunker, sometimes 3 and a hermit crab.
---
Apologies for degrading the quality of a thread about exploiting a glitch in a video game.
---
Do we know if perhaps that means that flamers with the bash damage legendary perk may actually heal with their flames?
---
 Yeah in there for the 3 bottles of water, a leather right leg, and 4 5.56 rounds. Not the Xp. That's exactly how I got to lvl. 490!
---
What happens when it breaks?
---
I highly doubt it. The same goal can be achieved by having someone sit at a certain point on the cliff and they all spawn at the very furthest hole in the wall. Forcing enemy spawns has been in the game since day one.
---
How are ur rads going away?   Only time when my rads go away it’s by my own doing.
---
I was doing none of that.
---
Push to talk is enabled, sharing Covert Operative.
---
Why are your rads going away?  Usually I have the opposite issue and am gaining rads to bring me lower than the threshold. Most people carry diluted rad away to bring up health and green stuff (from westtech)to bring it down
---
I’m glad it was put on Gamepass, it had a pretty bad start but its in a much better place now so being able to try it for free will hopefully help the image
---
Selfishness has nothing to do with anything. Do you have any constructive arguments or do you just resort to insults? If I could share a perk card, I would, but I can't. Simple.
---
In a public team you can increase the team bonus. The bonus stacks the more people are in a team so everyone is benefiting from something. Sharing a perk card is an option, a choice, not a 'mechanic' that everyone must follow.
---
You are always contradicting yourself. "Go find a team who share your philosophy." That's why it's called a public team, I join. So, deal with it. If you have a problem with the public team system then maybe you should create your own and stop being salty over people who join. There's a reason why it's called PUBLIC.
---
Resorting to insults that has nothing to do with the topic just validates your inept ability to create any constructive conversations.
---
Its less an invisivility suit with rad protection than a radiation suit with invisiblity.  I love it!
---
No idea why my rads were going away. If I knew I'd stop doing it.
---
Thanks for your work. Now how the hell do you get all 3 codes in 1 hour? I can't even fast travel/load in to do 1 in close in that time.
---
When I first took the serum, it did not show up in my effects list. But once I joined a team, I immediately saw the stat bonus. Then when I relogged it appeared on my effects list.
---
Dunno if that helps
---
That’s what I’ve been noticing too. Only one person has come in to join me the last 4 or 5 times I’ve done it. 
---
It’s a real easy way to grind Xp for the legendary run. Even if you fail the event. Tons of junk to collect too.
---
What chem buffs are you using?
---
Same for fusion cores. [As far as I know its never been officially responded to and has been present since the game was released](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/cx7ysy/the_gatling_plasma_still_consumes_more_than_one/). Sucks, just gotta work around it.
---
I’m so excited to get that raider cage today... not so excited that I am sure everyone will have it at their camps soon
---
Hope no one takes getting booted personally. I hate to do it, but sometimes it's needed. I have a group of friends I play with nightly and if there's not enough teams nearly full for us to all join a fully-bonded team, we will boot so we all get a team together. We try to avoid it if at all possible, especially in the middle of an event. That's literally the only reason I've ever booted someone. Now, I definitely would for someone being abusive at an event, or over mic, or having an always-on mic, or using hacked weapons, or sharing an anti-bloodied perk. Thankfully I haven't had to for any of those reasons yet.
---
And it doesn't matter to me why you join my team or what level you are. Even if you just want free fast travel spots. But don't follow me around the map like a lost puppy and one shot enemies before I can tag them and run ahead of me to loot all the good stuff. That's just rude.
---
One shotters are scum but in this case you're pretty much only missing out on potential scrip machine fodder as the legendaries are lvl 40 max. It still sucks that people have to be such try hards, though.
---
The opossums and foxes and such are all pretty much the size they are irl.
---
I have no clue. I'll end up dead, which is pretty easy to do bloodied in a stealth suit and com back with less rads. Sometimes I'll fast travel to camp and arrive with less rads. Maybe it's something I'm easting, I have no idea.
---
Some public team members like to share the perk that removes rads during the day time. Funny the first time, rather annoying for bloodied builds
---
No to that either.
---
None
---
Radsponge?
---
Are you by chance overencumbered? This counts outside of power armor... stupid but does happen
---
Not personally no.
---
Nothing like loading a plasma core and have 300 rounds show up but a half second later it needs a reload
---
It's definitely a little bigger than I thought but I'm happy with it I can't wait for the fireplace at the end I just kind of wish they made the fireplace so it would slide up instead of open like a door
---
It’s one of my personal favorites for XP and the few legendaries that show up. Gotta have a crew thats hungry for it though
---
I have fallout radio on my Spotify account. If I dont want to hear her, but listen to the music i can just turn off her radio and background Spotify. I do enjoy her little dialogue though. If you need the playlist URL, let me know.
---
Wouldn't be an MMO unless you were spending 1/3 of your time crafting,scapping and managing your inv.
---
I could see that as being annoying. 
---
I'll tend to eat whatever soups my collectron brings me without paying attention to the effects. Maybe it's one of those.
---
No shit
---
I haven't contradicted myself at all. I suggested you join a team where nobody is sharing perks because otherwise you're a weak link. If you take truth as an insult, perhaps you should re-evaluate your playstyle and your level of participation, because you're a bit defensive. Perhaps it's the nagging guilt? Also, I said your character is a dick, not you, so you started the insults here bro. I'm just not sugar-coating my opinion to make you feel better about your lack of contribution in a team-oriented environment.
---
The radioactive barrel is pretty handy to have for your camp if running bloodied.
---
You gota scrap a few of them. Ive never seen a plan for it.
---
There was a holotape in Big Bend Tunnel and the Garrahan Estate that showed just how much he loved sloths. It was creepy.
---
&gt;The majestic sloth. So misunderstood. So intelligent. Yes, they move cautiously. With great precision. But it is not mere laziness, oh no, my friend. It is... evolution. So many of their predators with their keen sight. Adapted so well to catch prey in flight. But do they catch you? No, no they don't. I am just a branch, aren't you, my lovely? Don't worry. Your protector... Your savior, Master Isaac, yes, I will keep you safe.
---
That's the one event where if more mobs show up the easier it is.
---
And the people that go down and get the ore are screwed out of XP, loot and legendaries.
---
Badly made event.  Would rather server hop and do a different one.
---
.....
---
A skin makes it non-scippable?....
---
I rarely swap pieces and thought I kept having quest-type items I couldn’t scrip. Whoops.
---
Hmm.  I know chem buffs that add maxHP will raise ur health and lower your rads.  Something like psychobuff.   But if ur not using chems I’m at a lost.  Unless it’s some type of perk card like radsponge but u will get a proc on it and need to be by ur teammate.
---
This is more difficult for the low levels or newer players. The grafton at Charleston and two snally to the east are much easier.
---
I’m a junkies build so I don’t use rad-x, and it does show I have the mutation
---
You should be grateful that you got a door. When I got mine the roll up door was missing. I contacted Bethesda, and they said that is resolved in the June patch- which was installed before I got the RRG. BTW I looked in the Wall menu. It's not there.
---
Train yard can be super mutants, though. It's not always snallygasters.
---
Yeah it shows on my effects but not my SPECIAL tab
---
Wouldn’t* launch a nuke without you guys
---
Stored mine before it broke but id imagine its like when regular armor breaks.
---
My mom has a ton of plastic cat dishes and whenever I see them I think ooh plastic!
---
When you do a service you do it because its the right thing to do, not to get a thankyou and a big ego.
---
Not a guaranteed spawn, but the church near the mothman museum as well.
---
I would check each building in that little town though, alot of food/aide is littered around it.
---
Gouls also drop them on occasion, so guided meditation or monster mash could be a good XP grind with added reward of sugar bombs.
---
It's not useless.  That's just dumb.
---
Me too
---
Only to level 50. It’s not like Fallout 4 where you can be level 150 and have like 2k health
---
I never carry flux or junk bundles, they are way too heavy and I do not know why people need like thousands at a time.
---
Pet deathclaws always scare the crap out of me when I travel to someone’s camp. I always hit the deck like a explosion is going off. Then dust myself off embarrassingly as I try not to act surprised the owner is only selling god damn mounted plans.
---
Why is this so true a level 15 tried to PvP me yesterday cause I wouldn't give him ammo
---
Private Servers are persistent? Wow
---
Yep, big advantage of Atomic Shop/NW skins - the item won’t show up in sell or scrip menus, which makes it a lot easier to avoid unfortunate accidents lol
---
I try to run away before they can say thanks
---
Then stop leeching and play solo.
---
There is no legitimate build reason to not have 3 CHR.
---
There is no way that is correct and its in their interest not to share numbers and be as disingenuous as possible in their marketing materials. There is no way there are more than a million players playing the game actively even if they are spread across the world and not all concurrently playing. At best, the active populations right now are probably close to ~150k (and thats being way generous) with 10-20k being pc between steam and beth launcher, and the rest divided between the consoles. [In january the guestimate was 400k](https://www.gamersdecide.com/articles/fallout-76-player-count#:~:text=At%20the%20time%20of%20this,million%20copies%20sold%20at%20launch.), but that was before multiple calamities like vending being disabled and all the press around the dupes.
---
Down-voting doesn't change the facts.
---
Maybe Beth should have Bonded bonuses for private teams too
---
I use it for xp farming and I like the event a lot.
---
Fallout 1st
---
yeah i don't know why they don't remove the legacy weapons. i guess a few people got banned recently since they had a dupped one.
---
I'm completely lost about it. Only thing that I have going on that I can see as maybe a cause is Healing Factor but that only mentions health, nothing about rads.
---
I'm thinking that about to be added.
---
Using the T word may flag you for rule 10.
---
You are safe from nukes inside White Spring and you can fast travel from inside The Wayward.
---
Basically any location with ene.ies will have one
---
I always do building teams, events are random and infrequent, killing everything in sight and running quests isnt
---
Or not because I don't have the blueprint.
---
One more quick question. If I gave stuff to mule to sell and had my friend log into a public or private server and gave him my stuff to hold then switched could I transfer all my caps back to my main?
---
Mirelurk Hive Mother 👀
---
I was so frustrated by this the other day while running One Violent Night. It’s hard for me to solo because I am melee. One of my public teammates was afk outside of the building. It was very frustrating. Finally, two or three more people come in at the last 1:30 of the event, but by then it’s too late. NOW they shoot the enemies around the compound. Thanks. If people had shown up 5 minutes earlier, we could have all finished the thing together and got our rewards.
---
I’ve been playing since launch, have things for super cheap in machines, I am very much well beyond ego in this game or care about the things I’m giving, it’s a simple lesson worth teaching.  If you think it’s ego to want people to appreciate the things they’re being given, you have the wrong idea of ego. And short edit: 1 person not saying thanks, whatever.  3 in one session though?  I just don’t want the crappy trend of expecting free stuff all the time to start, especially with game pass active.
---
To be perfectly honest i don't have trouble taking its just the one shotting that is the issue. I sometimes even tag but still didn't too enough damage to get the legendary for some reason.
---
Maybe your tag gets removed if the legendary enemy regenerates or they kill it while it regenerates. Bloodied does 2x the damage i do.
---
Wait what is steamer trunk?
---
One of my friends does a berserker build, he uses a bere25 radium and a bere90 laser as his main weapons. He doesn’t play this game much any more tho
---
I try to be in DM with them so some higher level dolt doesn’t come by and swipe the bag, which happens a LOT still and sort of sucks.
---
In Nuka World you can join the raiders and many missions require you to kill Minutemen (among other factions).
---
Unfortunately, killing Preston and wiping the MM is not an option, since they are the equivalent of Yes Man in FO:NV: basically the last resort option for when you burn bridges with all the other factions.
---
Hemlock holes as well
---
Farm the 3 power plants, poseidon, monongah and thunder mountain
---
Alex, what is, are there perk cards healing my rads?
---
Thanks!  Figured it out, and deleted my post.  TIL: The robot (after a slight delay) actually sends a message about which rule was violated.
---
My PA Heavy Guns uses rank 2 of the card to extend the life of fusion cores.  I never farm for cores, yet I seem to accumulate them.  If I get up to 20 I’ll drop 10 at a train station.  
---
I only use ballistic guns, and I get out of the PA when not in combat.  No jet pack and rarely use vats (except for those damn poison bugs.)
---
I have been at times but this has happened after every death, even when I'm under my carry weight, power armor or no. All I've been able to glean from Google is there was a power armor glitch last year. 
---
And thanks to everyone for the replies. Right now I can respawn at 76, so it's just going to cost me caps and sanity to maneuver around this.
---
There's a robobrain in Morgantown who wants to be your best friend, find him.
---
\*hic\*
---
Are you running out of AP? Also, have you tried a different controller?
---
I love helping out low levels but it honestly doesnt take much for me to go the other way.  As example, I was at the purveyor and a couple under-100s came in and were sorta following and pointing guns at me.  I went about my business and as I was finishing the scrip/buy rotation they maintained their offensive posturing.  I tapped one and asked for a dance and he quickly obliged with a missle launcher.  Well, that's not how you pvp.  I actually took his materials to hopefully teach a lesson.  Dont worry, I'll pay them forward to another noob.
---
It doesnt make it redundant if u carry tons of stuff without that extra 25 pounds id never be able to fast travel
---
Making them &amp; serendipity lvl 3
---
I like to drop a resistant marine wetsuit, ten stimpacks, 5 radaways and a legendary if i have one - helpful to either save to use later (since legendaries i get all tend to be lvl 50) or sell as they wish. caps are hard to come by at first.
---
That would be awesome! Because sometimes, someone crashes, or needs to switch characters, and in the few minutes between when they leave and come back, some random has joined the team. Feels bad to boot them.
---
One of many reasons people are still duping.
---
Brahmin milk is -25 rads.  Radiation Barrel CAMP item from Radiation Rumble is good for dialing in to exactly 20% health.
---
Or private server and taking one of the power plants
---
Nuka Quantum + Cola Nut card = easy win
---
Probably a lot of players taking workshops in private.  All three power plant workshops can give a lot of cores in a short period of time.
---
Server hopping finding power armor  and hoping that people have not already took the cores
---
Check your endurance perks, there are sun related ones that remove rads during the day time.
---
Also when you die, the game brings you back to about 40% health if your radiated like 85% as a bloodied build will be.
---
Just carry radiated prewar food or keep drinking dirty water to fix rads.
---
I'll  also offer to make armor or a weapon of their choice to their level, if they can tell me what they want.
---
As a bloodied build, I love this event, I can pretty much stem the tide of enemies from one side. My only gripe is when folks Rad Sponge my rads away.
---
Those red/green chests you see in various areas in the game
---
Equip two intelligence perks - energy ammo weight reduced by 90% and fusion cores drain 100% slower, meaning 1000 charge on one core. As for farming, just claim all 3 power plant workshops and build generators, in that way i farm 200 cores in few days and then im done for at least 2 weeks.
---
Hit the right d-pad a million times by accident.
---
That bag would have lasted me my first 8 levels at the very least.
---
I might have had to turn my mic on to thank you.
---
I get so many from events, I rarely need to look for them, but if I ever need them,  I just pick Poseidon &amp; Monongah, and just set up the Generator for the Core maker.  You get about 3 every 20 minutes or something like that.  It doestn' take long...  Be AWARE, those cores can be heavy so sitting 50 in your stash will take a lot of space
---
So apparently I don’t know how the event works lol....I entered my very first radiation rumble a couple days ago (I think I was in the 60s) and we just killed a bunch of ghouls and the few deathclaws that popped up. I died plenty of times. But we completed it and that’s all I thought I needed to do so I hope I didn’t screw anything up
---
I may have to start thinking this way and stop dropping 8000 things for everyone.  I just have a lot to spare and want to do it.
---
If you really want fusion cores go take over any Power Plant Workshop and power up the Fusion Core Generator it will yield one full Fusion Core every 10-15~ minutes. 
---
Note that the machine requires 100 Power to get going so it's a hassle to turn on if you don't have the Fusion Generator plans unlocked.
---
How do you get such plans? Go do any Power Up (Insert Power Plant Name here) Power Plant Event 3 times and each time you do one you will get plans for a new generator type with the Fusion Generator being the 3rd one you get IIRC.
---
That appears to he the plan. I can't find anything in my perk card build, addictions, mutations or foods that are causing it. 
---
You know it when you see it.  If the weapon itself isn't a giveaway (like the wonky Handmade Pistol with a Beam Splitter, the Gauss Minigun that suspiciously makes Cryolator noises, or the Minigun that fires Mini-Nukes), then it is almost always demonstrated by the person using it - laying waste to everything they see, not making any attempt to share kills, etc.  They can't help themselves; this is how they behave.
---
Can also be Yao Guai as well as Robots.
---
Im not running out of ap and i tried the same controller on diffrent games with no issues at all
---
Power User obviously helps tremendously,  it's optional though.
---
Prime your Gatling Laser. You can turn ONE regular fusion core into 3-6 ultracite fusion cores by equipping ammo Smith and Super Duper For the cost of one violet flux. It's absolutely worth it.
---
As for regular power armor usage, it shouldn't really be a problem, I tend to find enough cores in the wild to compensate, note that "Line in the Sand" event frequently rewards 3 fusion cores as it's a BoS themed event. It's also one of the best events for experience currently.
---
Finally, and this is an extreme measure, you could take any of the power plant workshops on the map. They have a fusion core extractor which shits out obscene amounts of them. I would recommend doing this on a private server, PvP and griefer are a risk on a public realm but pretty unlikely in my experience.
---
Got 2 pick lock, 2 rifleman and green thumb. I don't even have that card available let alone equipped.
---
That seems like you're encountering a variation of the power armor glitch.
---
If you are on PC there is a mod in Nexus that gives Fixers the Dark Matter paint.
---
So you don't have to do the powering up quest? I noticed the generator requires 100 power so I'm guessing a fusion generator works
---
No... you can build it at different levels....
---
Yeah, I think there’s a time limit on how long it stays before it resets though. I’ve done this method for a long time and haven’t ever had any issues with losing items. I’ve heard some people say they’ve lost stuff but that’s mainly due to losing internet connection while switching characters and stuff. Of course you wanna have the mule at the drop off site so it minimizes wasted time in case something does happen. The private server will reset if you join a public before entering back into private though. So don’t drop stuff in a private and then accidentally load into a public.
---
But then you could play around by building a lot more non-legendary weapons and trying different playstyles... that doesn't sound as fun as endlessly collecting globes and typewriters just to repair the good legendary weapon you have.
---
Yeah happened to me a few times. Once on Scortch queen and once on a blood eagle that ashed right as he mutated. One was empty, the other body was gone.
---
My friend said that Scrounger helps him find more fusion cores in containers since they count as ammo
---
Were you playing Line in the Sand last night? I saw some guy doing this and it was incredibly confusing.
---
they've been very well received by dozens of baby 76ers the past couple of weeks. :)
---
Thanks, I just had it stuffed.
---
You have to use a Courier player from a trusted site if you want safe trades. That's the only way.
---
Honestly have no clue but I always end up having to drop some as they are so heavy so be careful
---
You dropped it. That’s on you.  The other player sucks, but never trade by dropping. 
---
There’s an in-game trading interface.  There are subs for trading and using couriers.
---
Yeah, that’s pretty much the only way to guarantee. I wouldn’t drop items if you don’t have to.
---
I think they should just follow the example of Foundation and just turn workshops into faction towns: most people don’t like PVP and the fact that whatever you build up at workshops isn’t persistent does translate into building up workshops not being very cost effective.
---
I do would suggest adding the option to have the faction that took place pay you with the resources from the nodes at the location, or if it is a hostile only faction, having several boxes with plenty of said resources.
---
I think alot of the bloodied synergy needs a timer. Especially perks like nerd rage that did have a duration in fallout 4.
---
Easy: I don't. For this exact reason.
---
My friend has the plan and can build it at lvl 50 or higher
---
the plans only craft legendary ones (as is all the wastelanders added gear that isn't grenades or power armor)
---
This is the only reason I kick people sun kissed is my enemy!!! But I've noticed people do this on purpose just to be assholes to bloodied biulds. ( jealousy is the only thing I can think of)
---
Tru but brahmin milk expires and i rarely have any on me when i need it. Also didnt mention the barrel bc its only its only usable at ur camp. I was mostly giving advice for managing rads when out and about. But yes the barrel is great and i love it.
---
I've seen a lot of folks say to cripple and not kill, but I still haven't seen anyone explain why this is beneficial.
---
I’ll look into it, thanks for the tip! Still hoping that they’ll consider changing this in game, both so that the skin will be visible to other users and so that we’ll have the selling/scripping protection.
---
No i  took a few days off after the bug appearing and only now came back to create my camp "club" called club 05 it just started happening out of nowhere
---
this is the answer. maybe add a lighted arrow sign to draw attention.
---
Ah, is this why my Atoms jumped from 20 to 300 for no obvious reason?
---
Kill big bots for big prizes. Keep an eye out for fusion generators on your travels and 'borrow' their cores. Check vendors if you need spares. Risk taking a Power Plant workshop, they can be lucrative...or hellish. 
---
And don't use Gatling Lasers to kill L1 roaches helps eak them out, at least not in Jetpack fueled VATS battles.
---
I went to this event about a week ago. Got there and waited a few minutes and nobody showed up and I was like "Alright, I can at least get a bit of it done by myself and get a legendary or 2."
---
About a coouple minutes in, the hallways start flooding with people.
---
Practically half the server. 2 people guarded the hallway by the main entrance, 2 more guarded the far end radioactive tunnels, 2 stayed in the main room to watch the survivors and me and a couple other people went for the ore in the mines. A survivor still died in all of it because we all rushed for legendary deathclaw drop and left the ghouls to do whatever, but overall, it was the smoothest that it has ever gone for me.
---
TL:DR. Started solo in Radiation Rumble, and later into it, about 9 other people joined in and we slaughtered everything.
---
are you in a group?
---
Honestly, re SBQ, I feel like we'll see her get cycled out/removed as part of a big "change" around the Brotherhood stuff. Earle basically does everything she does rewards wise, and serves as a less frustrating, more themed fight.
---
Hmm, I’m not sure exactly what you mean. If you are asking about actually transferring caps then there’s no way to do that. All you can do is basically hit your cap vendor limit on multiple characters. So if you hit the daily cap limit on your main, you can still gather up weapons or whatever to transfer to your mule to hit the cap limit on that account as well. But there isn’t any way to transfer the actual caps between characters.
---
Also might want to delete the other players name so as to avoid getting this post removed.
---
Edit:  too late
---
Absolutely. The OP mentioned the flooded train yard though, which isnt low level friendly either, was just adding more options for everyone.
---
It’s not easy to understand how to share perk cards. I did not know that was a thing before I read this post just now. Most players propably dont share cause they dont know about it.
---
When was the last time you saw super mutants there? I spent all weekend hopping that place since Thursday, and it is highly unlikely that I wouldn't have seen something else in that amount of time. Maybe it's a rare occurrence or something
---
Yeah, and it's a friggin game, so I'm not going to lose any sleep over it.  I rarely use the P2P trade interface -- I'll take a look at it again.
---
BOYSSOUL  !
---
You can always make them using the stable flux from SB Queens.
---
It's a commando weapon. It's pretty decent for raw dps but it can't be suppressed so it falls pretty badly behind since most commando builds go stealth for those phat sneak shots.
---
I believe the helmet is part of the outfit you can craft and doesn't have to be crafted individually. You tried wearing it?
---
You could always build your main camp underground and only have the essentials for a queen fight above ground.
---
I was gonna say charisma but unless your neil tyson degrasse or Bill Nye the sciences usually arnt known for their charisma.
---
Yeah I know. I have friends I play with. I was just wondering if there is any block on me giving him all my caps then switching to main and him giving me them back. Obviously via overpaying for any item to move caps
---
Is that why?  Thanks for the heads up.
---
There are some options. Lock pick and Hacker can help you in a few spots...
---
So, just to clarify, this isn't a "confirmed bug", so much as just something Beth is aware we want?
---
Underground?
---
my magic LMG does insane damage it shoots SB out of the sky in seconds. One them is magic on the SBQ the other is not (both explosive , neither two shot , nor FFR so might be lag related or I have a blocking item on my armor and never noticed (just have the first unyielding of each slot the I rolled for SS).  Yes it empties it's clips in 5 seconds, but most things die in under 1.5s or the shortest possible burst out of it.
---
Server size is only 24 people so it doesn't matter how many active players there are. It just means there are fewer current servers. If you are seeing lower population it generally means you are on a server that has been up for awhile since they stop adding player after a certain time
---
No, PC
---
As long as we get the same amount of wood needed to repair our walls, I would be ok with this
---
Thanks for the advice. Time to add another layer of grind
---
I would really enjoy more random objects to make a camp look junky or cluttered
---
Do you have Scaly Skin or was a food buff active? Even one point of DR lowers the max damage.
---
OP, if I didn't already have a suite of Bersker's weapons I'd take you up on it. Those are some really nice weapons.
---
I wonder if this is a regional thing because I’ve seen others say the same about “dead” servers but they’re always just about full when I play (Xbox). The last few server hops had 3-5 full or nearly full public teams alone. I have noticed lots of new players though. They say “game pass”.
---
That's pretty cool. Thanks for the info.
---
If you don't feel confident just grab one of those hazmat suits and pick up the ores in the caves to throw in the machine (which is in the middle) not enough people are doing that and it gives a better award
---
Sorry just double checking, I thought the event failed if the scavengers survived but no ore is collected? Or maybe it’s because I lost 2 scavengers and collected no ore :o
---
Do you even read what you type? You contradict every word you say. 
---
For example "perhaps you should re-evaluate your playstyle and your level of participation." This just show's how ignorant you are because everyone plays a different play style to your own, you again fail to provide a convincing argument. Telling people to play how YOU want is the definition of a self-centred person. You don't get to tell me how I play, that's for me to decide. I'm the one playing. How do you not understand that? Are you that narrow minded? How is it truth? It's called an opinion by the way. 
---
Furthermore, I do my part with my participation. I help my teammates, I'm there at events. I help with the kills. Again, you fail your point.  
---
How am I being defensive, lol. I'm just responding to everything you're saying. Again, do you read what you type?
---
"Also, I said your character is a dick, not you, so you started the insults here bro." Alright, but that was poorly worded on your behalf since it could have been interpreted differently. Also, again. What does " nagging guilt" got to do with anything? You love to create assumptions to everything, don't ya?
---
Whats the reason for removing them?  Alot of stuff was duped, not just legacies.
---
I’m getting mine today too! Sounds like we’re on track.
---
Oh I see what you mean, I assume that could work. I never really thought about it. I never really have any issues staying around max caps on my main though so I’ve never experimented with something like that. On your mule you could buy like one bullet from your friend for however many caps you have on the mule. Then go to your main and have your friend buy one bullet from you for the same amount of caps.
---
While this is true it's also true that one can expect some common decency, even on the internet.
---
Quite frankly, if helping is the right thing to do, so is saying thank you.
---
Yep public group
---
This is kind of what i'm waiting for to start playing again. I would love a hoard type survival dungeon too. 
---
I'm really turned off by the legendary run and the attention the atom shop gets.
---
Workshops are intentional PvP warzones. If you are going for SCORE challenge, and aren’t looking for a fight, best to claim one and leave the area right away. Let the next player have it. I usually take workshops just before I log off for the night. There are much better ways to farm materials than workshops.
---
What kinda bow are you using?
---
Never tried it solo. Was there earlier waiting for someone to join. Never happened. I just popped up a few seconds ago. I’m watching the map. I’m tired of going to that one and to project paradise and no one showing up. And there will be like two full events teams.
---
Granted, these dudes sound like some real weinies but workshops are for pvp. 
---
Workshops are actually a pretty lousy way to gain resources so you're not missing out on much.
---
Just checked. You can make it a level 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, and 50.
---
Methinks those may be folks with alternate characters who transfer their "charity gifts" back to their main character. Asking for ammo for a gun they can't even use yet....smh..
---
and your specials don't go up. 
---
May have to apply a new one
---
What exactly are you basing these claims on? Because servers have a 24 player cap to begin so it's not like you can just jump in a server and claim the game's population is dead. 
---
There is a privacy setting you can turn on were players are invisible on the map so you can't rely on simply counting the players displayed in the map either.
---
In fact both the current Steam player count and rising Xbox game ranking of the game would contradict your claims. 
---
At least on my end over here on PS4 I have yet to see a "dead server"
---
The new players are either people who created a new account and bought the game again after getting banned or part of the new wave of players coming from GamePass on both PC and Xbox.
---
I saw the skeleton of one of these in a museum a few years ago. It's huge. Really left an impression on me.
---
Yeah thought so. Thanks. I had 30k but spent a good amount on serums for friend that's fairly new and bought every camp plan at whitesprings. Now have 2k from 30k.
---
Yea absolutely! I hope that one day they will add the option to add paintjobs to fixers.
---
I only ever kick people if I have a 4th irl friend get online. Otherwise I never kicked anyone -- except for one guy that was duping, lol.
---
I don't think people expect anything of you. You're a total stranger. How can they know what they're going to get if you're an unknown?
---
I haven’t fully tested this, but it seems of a teammate kills the legendary you can loot it. I was grabbing ore and kill maybe 5 mobs, one was legendary. I looted 4 legendary corpses.
---
you can, with a little bit of wiring you can set it up to allow access with a pressure plate
---
That and, really, this sub frowns on posts that deal with any sort of trading.  Rules 9 and 10.
---
No doubt.  And I don't need a thank you. But if anyone is knucking, even if I know I'm overmatched, I will start pvping.  My favorite new hobby is trolling trap camps.  I'll unlock their doors, take their resources, wait and warn others, repeatedly kill myself, etc until they leave the server.  I know it's stupid, but that's my jam.
---
Bloody 50vats crit 25 less vats cost
---
Now that I'm actually playing and can look at the map 
---
1. Cranberry Glade is the parking lot I was talking about 
---
2. The mountains are actually north west of the bear icon not the ones to the west. The random encounter (where we got both the deathclaw and the sloth) happens on the western peak. 
---
Good luck
---
You can get the fusion gen plan for like 300 caps at Lewisberg station. Ive heard Watoga is supposed to sell it too, but i didnt see it the last time a looked.
---
Ive heard you get a fusion core every time you scrap a gatling laser too, but i cant confirm.
---
I have definitely noticed in the past week more people joining public teams asking for stuff.  I check their level and then help.  Maybe it’s just me, but it’s been more common than usual.
---
I can't even remember the last time I used large amount of screws or springs on my main character. I repair everything with repair kits I get from queen and encryptid. However the thing I run out of constantly is steel, plastic and lead which 2 of I get from scrapping weapons. Scrapper is probably best perk card for me.
---
I agree there needs to be some worthy trade-off for the loss of purveyor RNG from learning build-irrelevant gear. I do think scrapper could me more incentivised.
---
I had a camp across from the Watoga train station for awhile. I did fine with scorchbeasts when I used absolutely no turrets. But then there would be occasional spawns of Super Mutants or Mirelurks and they’d wreck the place.  Never quite got the balance right and moved out. Good luck!
---
I mean, usually I see Super Mutants. Enough that when I see snallygasters there it's a surprise. Maybe something changed? I'll have to check the game tonight, but I usually hit that area every few days whenever the Queens pops up. I've also seen yao guais there, too, oddly enough. Seems like a weird place for bears.
---
Replying to upper comment cos PSA time: if you have a friend who (and this is what I do) have a guy with enforcer and a explosive shotty. The ghouls move slower or grounds them. Allowing for ppl to get hits/shots and most importantly MEAT PILES FOR ALL!
---
I used to love doing this event but I got tired of people standing in the hallway to one shot all the ghouls so I just don't go anymore.
---
No idea then, maybe just some weirdos that want to be alone in their team.
---
By not having a perk equipped you are lowering the teams effectiveness. How the fuck is that an opinion? It's a damn fact. Maybe my argument hasn't convinced you, but that's not what I'm here to do, I'm just telling you there are people that see you for the player you really are.
---
I usually see it empty and go there to wait, if nobody shows up i leave. I feel like people don’t go bc they don’t see anyone already there, so being there first can attract others. Same with project paradise
---
Toxic goo will give you that right shade yellow and the zesty kick of *efFEVecennce!*
---
And a damn good cup of coffee.
---
I can see that in a full group but OP said they weren't full, so who knows.
---
What's worse are the damned ghouls who freeze upon death and can't be looted. This is getting out of hand lately.
---
Check YouTube. There are techniques to build stairs under ground or crafting stations to warp through cliff walls. That’s one way to stay ahead of enemy spawns for sure.
---
What helmet is that??
---
did you use a proper trade forum?
---
I dont see these weapons u speak of, but i do see 440 scrip.
---
Get a shitty gamma gun and just shoot the ground at your feet, easy rads.
---
720+ hours in, and i just saw the Flatwoods Monster for the first time a couple of nights ago.   
---
Well, "saw" is too strong a word. He popped up in VATS when i was shooting at mongrels, and i fired, and saw the flash of light. Oh, well.
---
Thats great and all but you just cant expect others to do the right thing.
---
i agree
---
I don't know why you think you'll screw it up.   You listed everything that needs to be done.
---
Let's not start a witch hunt here
---
Nope! 100% my fault but I was omw out of the game anyways so this is it. Ya win some ya lose some. Just figured I’d slap it on here for others
---
Somebody yesterday said it was a bug but if you inspect the outfit in the atomic shop the preview photos don't show the helmet. I think the thumbnail for them was a quick palette swap of the original available in the shop and it wasn't meant to come with the helmet, hopefully they'll change that.
---
Yeah, you can just plop down a fusion generator and that will power the fusion core maker. You don't have to worry about the power up event
---
On the topic of this serum it says that when your not near teamates your specials decrease and when your around them it increases? Is that true or can you just join a group and have the benefits?
---
Eh it’s all good. Just figured I’d throw it out there for others. It’s all good
---
Gimmie that Double Barrel Shotgun skin !!!
---
Do the dancers strip for scrip?
---
Don’t be mad at me cuz you got your junk stolen, dumbass XD
---
buy everything
---
yes, i do play a combat shotgun now - powerful enought even without any related perk cards, a nice secondary weapon if the enemy comes too close.
---
That’s lame if someone’s getting mad at you for it. A good tip for enlightenment is to let some fireflies live because it attracts radtoads which give multiple bioluminescence
---
I love this event. Just have not seen it the last few days.
---
Become mayor of watoga so the robots aren’t hostile and build a camp near the city. You can use it as a staging area where people can prepare b4 and after the fights
---
Use the shotgun perk and cripple them silly. It really ease up the tension and everyone get some xp
---
I don't. I predate the internet so I'm used to it.
---
Forager is a wild card, once i saw him sitting down in a house with muties. Menacingly looking at a wall
---
This is the communication we need for this game rn. Props.
---
Grab the Chinese stealth suit
---
Tell me more about your private rooms
---
big if true
---
Of you don't have the private server Option as mentioned simply use a friend.  I will message someone on my list and say, hey man, don't log off for a minute and will drop stuff in a container in some remote location, switch toons and join on that friend with another toon.  And if you're concerned about losing it just ask the guy to watch the container for you.  Most people don't mind standing by and watching stuff like that.  And always be willing to respond in kind of they ask.  This was something my clan used to do a lot when we had more people
---
That's a shame, it should also come with the helmet since it's a one of the end rewards of the legendary run. Doesn't feel right wearing the suit without the helmet either.
---
Don't know, PC tho
---
hoarding ore is my jam.  occasional Molotov or shutgun blast as i'm glowing of radiation myself.  must get that hazmat reward!
---
Same here, I got my rank 100 during the double XP event. Never touching the mode again, unless if there's new cosmetics to earn.
---
I haven't noticed a single change in server activity since the ban wave. PS4.
---
Is it just me or does the fixer look exactly like a combat rifle but with some green bits on it.
---
Its either a bug or another cheap trick to try and get you to buy a bundle. The one in the atom shop has the helmet.
---
I don’t know how to do the event but I’m willing to take direction from anyone that does! I would love to participate. What platform are you on?
---
Secret Service armor is great but be sure you buy the actual body part before buying anything that looks like a mod (it’s not as obvious as it should be). Chest is a good place to start even for defensive purposes alone but it also has the most useful mods.
---
*insert sad but true face*
---
Hey, me too! I’m lvl 139, almost 4K bullion. I already have the Chinese Stealth Suit and I run a melee build.
---
I could be wrong, but it’s probably a One Handed Weapon
---
Another reminder; people who come in PA and don’t grab the ores are annoying af. Help everyone out and get them! You can still get kills and grab ores.
---
One thing that sucks with that strategy is just not knowing who else has ore and whether you need to rush into more mines to collect or just relax and take out enemies. There's been a few times where I've put in all my ore only to realize everyone else either turned in none or like 5 pieces and we missed out on the higher rewards.
---
Someone on your public group has shared sun kissed perk
---
Lately I have been buying what I  need through player vendors.  Around 100 caps for a fully charged core.  Keep it local!
---
Records as well as bringing her more Nuka drinks. She talks about that too. Gives the quests more variety. It would also be cool to see where she's broadcasting from.
---
Haha that gave me a good chuckle
---
Oh this makes my blood boil. I rarely do the Uranium event any more because there's almost always someone oneshoting everything
---
Uh-oh! I didn't know the gun was loaded!
---
Lol. Well, I know when I was level 9 I was afraid of high levels so I always remember that when I find a low-level who seems afraid of interacting with me.
---
What is a runner supposed to do?
---
Line in the sand used to give 2 fusion cores each time you finish the event👍👍
---
I assume you must not be a fan of jet packing your way to the control room?
---
Nope, 9 times out of 10 when I play I'm on a standard team with my wife and she shares pharma farmer.
---
Effectiveness is an over statement. That's your opinion. Teamplay and actual contribution through killing and helping team mates is more effective than sharing a rank 1 perk card. That's my opinion. Fact is, it's not game changing otherwise. Why make a big deal over it.
---
A bit but it feels darker like the non green bits vs the combat rifle. But the skin would rid of those green bits Im just not too fond of on my fixer would rather the dark matter paint forsure 😊
---
And could you share the proof you have that they are fake?
---
Thats what i was doing, then the event came up to defend it from ghouls and i thought id kill two birds with one stone, evidently not haha
---
Friendly Fire is under rated.  I use it in the Blue Ridge Caravan Escort and half the time other players attack me for "hitting the brahmin".  Mostly I let other players do the shooting, but I'll try to get a hit on the captain. Someone usually one shots him though.
---
False
---
Any tips on how to grind for resources?
---
Addictions are gooooood let them remain. In all seriousness though there is a perk that can make it so you never get addicted to alcohol if you don’t want the addiction
---
No but my ruka cola one got turned back into a a tadpole pack and when i fixed it the backpack is sideways now. I get they did something to some of them.
---
It's bethesda's fault. No one wanted to lose inventory the first month.
---
I hear yah, i typically only pull out my LMGs when I'm alone, or fire for a few seconds to get my tag in on SBQ.  Running though Westek gunfu magic shotgun was really fun the first 150 times :P
---
No.  But, if you care enough, it does screw with the world loading and can cause lag for people.  Meaning, the game isn't looking at objects below the map.  So, it can cause minor issues when loading/rendering an area that has objects where they normally aren't supposed to be.
---
I've only heard minor gripes about this.  So, I don't think it's that big of an issue.  Just something to aware of.
---
Mine is tween v9 and the sunken railyard. Not much spawn traffic. Occasionally get a handy or gutsy.
---
You can open it from the inside with a pressure plate. It's a weird mechanic.    I don't use the keypad door anymore because I don't really feel the need to lock my camp up and the keypad was kind of a headache.
---
Yeah, I had to attempt Fun &amp; Games three times, and I know I’m not the only one. Vault raid bugged out on me too. 
---
It’ll be a loooong time before I take a second character through Wastelanders. I almost cried with joy the night I finally finished it because I had been holding my breath over bugs the entire time.
---
The nuke silo code puzzle is actually so much fun and you feel this different kind of pride when you correctly find it in your first try, I love it. But I don't think anyone other than me likes it.
---
Ahh overlooked that detail. Good eye
---
Yah I have, but it doesn't come with it. It should be crafted individually cause the helmet should have that immune to air borne disease effect.
---
Yes cause none of the things they claim have worked when any person on here has ever replicated them, a food example from earlier a guy was claiming you could destroy bases with a grenade launcher
---
That's why I dont like it - but some people get upset if you dont do it. I personally dont listen to them but OP sounded like he was trying to make them happy and figure out their strategy
---
Hey I have a ton of cargo bot cards. I’m not one to get into setting off nukes but I need to get some stable colbalt flux for my power armor jet pack. Anyone interested in taking my cards? Every time I’m on seems like the only place that gets hit is neat watoga and I can’t find hardly any blue flux there.
---
Ok bait is away but non of these people know what bait is
---
It's from dying. The game doesn't keep you at exactly the same health. Stand near a rad source until you die. You'll see it happen.
---
Thanks, I’ll try it when i play today. The guy I saw yesterday healed the workers super fast, they had maybe 1/8 hp left I thought we were gonna lose them, next thing I know this guy hit them with a kabab and all were back to full bar.
---
Did you buy the SS underarmor plan as well? You need both.
---
Plasma bows are supposed to be pretty good, but they are slow firing and require effort to use well, so may as well play a proper sniper build.
---
I subscribe for just one month and then scrap everything I can get my hands on. That should be enough scraps for a few months, and re-subscribe if I need to later on.
---
it's notoriously stingy
---
They pay for foodbuild first. They dont care about how heavy junk is.
---
The perk card says no grenades. I'd guess that would apply to floater grenades too, but who knows.
---
Fair enough. Though I have to say, for the most part (From my experience) The ratio of helpful folks to jerkoffs has swung HEAVILY in favor of helpful people, since most of the jerks got bored with the game long ago. Or they're all playing NW now. Which I've never touched.
---
For sure get the under-armor and the mod to make it stronger from regs, it’s the best in the game
---
Do you mean that when you are at your base site and NOT in build mode (or anywhere else for that matter), going into your PipBoy and selecting what ever the Move CAMP option is at the bottom of the screen, is not working? eta: typos
---
https://youtu.be/TEMRRaHIaU4
---
Captainoob managed to solo the queen in 40sec without chems using a Sneak Build with the same fixer. It’s probably the best build
---
It's classified as 2h, but no perks work for it.
---
There's a daily cooldown for the repeatable quest
---
Greed is by far the biggest problem of this community...
---
Not only is it viable but it’s probably the best build in the game. As for a BE Fixer you’ll actually lose dmg to boss type mobs like scorch beasts, queen, super behemoth and the mire lurk queen.
---
😒that's a bummer.
---
you can only use the lining on the under armor, you need a suit of Secret Service Under armor to mod it with the lining
---
Everyone celebrated dupers being banned. Looks like they got exactly what they asked for but didn't think through
---
Sometimes it glitches when I'm in a tooown.
---
The game is glitching with no battle sooouuunds
---
It's not a big deal at all. That's why there's a kick from team button. Easily filter out the dead weight so like-minded players can optimize their experience by properly utilizing game mechanics to their full benefit.
---
grape nuka if you can find it, glowing fungus soup for resist, lead mimosa/champs - Toxic goo is always available for pickup during west-tec grinds
---
Is there a different one? I started pretty recently but got it at level 26, saw that the biometric fiber was available at the train station by level 30 and was able to build it
---
So what's your point?
---
I’ve had this happen to me a few time and I don’t use PA, just adding in
---
Place the lit poster *the one that doesn't need wired) on your wall.  Then move the Thanksgiving display shelf into it.  If you do it right, you replace the wood back piece with the lit poster.  Looks really good.
---
Btw, not my idea.  I saw it at someone's camp and did it myself.  
---
Also.  You can use the track lights to light up objects from behind to make the object light up.  Example: place a pilot cutout, then place the ground track light on the floor behind it, facing it.  The front if the cardboard cutout will now be lit up, as if it were being lit from the front.
---
I actually know what you mean. 
---
It's a hard habit to break. The urge to have things neatly aligned often makes things seem less organic. I recently did a Mire novel village and it was all lined up nicely. Every thing nice and balanced and even... And it looked and felt terrible.
---
This is the post i meant
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hu2uwn/dark_matter_skin_and_other_combat_rifle_skins/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
However since it's a combat rifle those paints should fit, whether it's a bug or suggestion
---
How do you just suddenly have them complete tho? Do you leave the game on, or do you close the app and shutdown?
---
Just wondering, because I just recently started playing the other day after a month off.
---
Chinese Stealth Armor if you haven’t unlocked it through the Settlers
---
If you already have that, get the SS armor &amp; Underarmor.
---
Yeah, so you mentioned needing ammo. Excavator armor+ lucky hole mine for lead. Scrapper perk+ westek run for steel. Cave crickets/yao guai/snallygasters farming for acid (look on youtube for an acid run vid or map for  enemy locations). And wavy willards or any of the camp grounds, pre war money for cloth (paper garbage breaks down to cloth)
---
Edit: if you use shotguns, Morgantown high school has a ton of plastic plates. 
---
Active farming like this will get you more resources waay faster than using a workshop.
---
Vampire minigun lets me stand face to face with a scorched mirelurk queen.  Flaming Shishkabob with the 'melee weapons swing faster" (forget which; but both are in strength) card maxed and Friendly Fire maxed heals them fastest. Unless you get a kabob with a swing faster perk already on it, then you can really do some healing
---
.
---
Go to a chemistry bench and smelt it. Requires acid. Make sure you have super duper on to increase the yield.
---
Yes, agreed. I haven’t encountered a jerk in a while (ofc now that I say that, I’m probably going to find one lol)
---
Done it the very first time proper way, doubt I'll do it again
---
My guess is it's a glitch because they were previous weeks' challenges. I remember doing them earlier in the Battle Pass.
---
I love this event! I always act as a runner (my rifleman build that focuses on AP makes me a great sprinter). There’s nothing like seeing a team of badasses defend the workers while I jet around collecting material. Love it
---
It was a god send double exp weekend. 72 levels....it kinda makes up for the auto complete bug, it got me back on track. I know they're going to remove it probably with the next update and I will miss it.
---
Urban scout.  Rare drop from encryptid event? I forgot which event.
---
Thank you for the thought!
---
PPro tip: find some Backwoodsman 3. reduces the cost of making weapons by a lot
---
It is known. Had it happen a few times.
---
I always go for the wendigos (easy)... sals grinders 2nd floor, Lewisburg there is usually one wandering the streets, and wendigo cave..
---
My husband and I are on PS4 and have avoided the event because we weren't sure wtf to do.  If you have free time some evening, you would be a welcome teacher.
---
From the little online researching I'm doing now about it, it tends to happen when you're playing while the dailies reset.
---
Thanks for explaining
---
Lol....literally the same thing happened to me over lunch break today.
---
At least when you equip the scrapper perk literally dedicated to improving scrapping...
---
Wtf is "foodbuild" and why does it keep getting used as an insult?
---
Nah I shut my Xbox off over night. I have played sometimes overnight where the dailies reset and never had that issue. I appreciate the research though!
---
I was on my first character not long out of BETA, and pretty much always run solo. A "food build", so soft as hell and still running timid. The location was a little South of the Rusty Pick. Rocking the excavator PA that wasn't quite max level yet and still overencumbered, of course. 
---
I just hit level 50, and happened to have snagged a TSE gatling plasma at Whitespring seemingly only minutes before, but I think I actually just walked the whole way into the ash heap.
---
There was a fight. As much as I would have liked to hide or fast travel away, it just wasn't possible. (food build, remember?)
---
I killed myself a few times blasting the scorched escorts at super-close range. (TSE!) I was using purified water and random food items in place of stimpaks near the end. Eventually whittled the SB health down to zero and claimed my loot. 
---
The only thing left was to take a pic and light up a grey tortoise.
---
You need to lure the mobs to the afk player next time, though it could also be them trying to pull a menu and getting stuck.
---
Odds are they're already running it though. Same reason why you might not share nerd rage
---
I'd love to but my wife doesn't
---
God damned this is awesome. What platform are you on?
---
5.56
---
It’s the hardest weapon to learn mods for currently in game. I gave up after a while.
---
Thanks for that, I'll buy some when I see them 👍
---
I lost all my atoms after this bug and was given 800 out of the thousand I had made
---
If you do a search on this reddit for it, you will find many many stories of people going mad trying to scrap for all the mods. I'm half-assed trying myself. Between crafting and scrapping them, I've done about 500 of them and am only halfway there. It's one of those things that has been labeled a bug, but hasn't been fixed since the beginning.
---
If you only have 1 or 2 you'd like modded, I'd suggest looking on the "other" sub to find someone with high karma to mod yours for a fee. People are pretty understanding and will help you out.
---
Thanks for the help! i cant devote alot of time to this so everything helps
---
Yeah the more I look, it's just all over the place.
---
.45, 5.56, 50 cal, 2mm EC, 5mm
---
.45 .50 5.56 5mm .308
---
Agreed 5.56, .308 and .45 sell pretty well.
---
Agreed! And .45 runs a close second with all of the Fixer users out there.
---
A full set of ss armour or under armour?
---
Sounds about right.
---
It's too bad you cant use underarmor with the stealth armor.
---
Its just a funny observation. Use the gun and you are blamed for a ll problems. Everything doesnt have a point
---
No probs. Good luck
---
Fingers crossed they do the same for Console players.
---
You don't even need to have teammates..I can personally confirm it works when you're alone on a public team. Just like inspirational
---
In 2020*
---
Yeah it is, but the Chinese Stealth Armor with Stealth based perks is good for Sneak Builds, which is good
---
It'd still be a vehicle for griefers as people often don't read those kinds of messages &amp; even if you're open to pvp you can still be ambushed.
---
The system is good as is. Doesn't need changing.
---
Hit the Charleston FD and Green Country Lodge for lead - both have weight rooms with dumbells/plates, and workbenches nearby to immediately scrap it.
---
Morgantown is good for plastic, alongside Watoga High (if you can stomach the robots inside). The cafeteria/kitchen is chock full of plastic plates and utensils.
---
That sucks - if it glitches a 3rd time for me I think I'll just not do the questline. I know Bethesda is notoriously glitchy but this is too much. I only gave the game another shot because Wastslanders update but now I wish I hadn't.
---
I’m confused. You already own the game?
---
Yeah, that can go either way. Sometimes you can skate in and get the defense with nobody around. Other times you can get curb stomped.
---
Larry’s is the spot!
---
Thanks mate I will get the serum then, the description threw me off.
---
You give some people buttons and commands, and they get withdrawl symptoms when they are not clicking them every few minutes.
---
Seen it quite a few times moderating various chans/forums over the years.
---
No, it’s just cheap in my local game store, was considering picking it up
---
Ghoulish?
---
shhhhhh
---
I was intimidated by this event too. I've done it at least 6 times now. It's not as complicated as it sounds. I'm a ore gatherer, I wear my stealth suit and I snipe goul legs when I can. Often, I am the only one mining, but I can't control that. And I definitely can't solo it, but there are usually some tanks there just looking for xp. You won't fuck it up - so def try it with others
---
And now to pop the bubble: Power Armors all look the same to most players.
---
Hope you reported him too!
---
So sick of all the duped items.
---
I can't even craft it anymore.  :/
---
There should be "Secret Service" tab. Hmm maybe it requires you to have level 50. Till then farm Legendary Modules, you will need plenty :(.
---
The Settlers faction vendor. I think they cost 500 gold bullion.
---
Give it a go! It’s still super glitchy but it’s a much different game than it was at launch. As a massive Fallout fan you’ll probably like it and may even come around to playing with teams (not necessary to do so at all, by the way).
---
Cost 500 gold bullion I believe
---
In addition to that good advice, I would also suggest investing in Science Expert rank 2 if you have the extra intelligence space. Reduces the cost of crafting them as well. Also, remember to add Scrapper when breaking them down to maximize what you get back to craft more.
---
Also, anecdotally, people have said swapping servers just before scrapping helps raise your chances. I am not sure if that's true, but it is a popular belief.
---
Edit. Forgot to mention, Super Duper works with crafting weapons too. You may get an extra here and there when crafting.
---
Thanks guys all sorted I didnt realise there were seperate plans for the lining and under armour!👍😇
---
Serverhop the Encryptid  location three times works too
---
Ok cool, I’m fine with the glitches and stuff, got used to them with Bethesda games, anyway thanks for taking the time to reply
---
19.9% for full bloodied/unyielding effect.
---
How can I upvote this a gazillion times?
---
True but my post was directed more towards team pvp then griefing. Being a low level and getting jumped is not fun or getting attacked by 4 people isn't fun for non pvpers so I get where you are coming from. I also agree that players do not pay attention to the notifications at workshops as I did the same thing when first starting
---
When collecting ore is the ore instanced per player or is it set so if someone picks it up it’s gone for all players? When doing this I only ever get 40-50 total before timer runs out and no one else seems to get any
---
I totally feel this. Maybe if I'm brave enough I'll ask if anyone else is mining next time
---
5.56 is really the most sought after ammo. Behind that is .308 I guess?
---
How the game is?
---
Think... a dumpster fire...
---
It's boring standing around it alone, but with people it's acceptable. It stays on for quite a while but after some time the fire goes out... 
---
Basically that. If you didn't get that metaphor:
---
With people its a good game until a certain point when it just... becomes boring af and is just a tedious grind. And when you finally have everything you want... what do you do then? 
---
That's the real problem. The Endgame is only grinding, grinding and grinding.
---
The first 300h are f*cking amazing. After that. Meh.
---
It's fun overall but the bugs are annoying AF. Depends on your tolerance level. My fiance won't play anymore bc of the glitches. I'm currently super frustrated bc the main quest has a quest breaking bug (just posted about it if youre curious). However I really love the CAMP stuff, story lines, etc.
---
Spoiled meat is pretty easy to keep on hand for additional rads.
---
Dumbass about to run the silo the furst time here. Whats the biometric card? I have the nuke card and looked up the key. Is there anything else I need before going in?
---
Yeah the game has definitely reloaded my Gatling laser when the display was still showing several hundred shots before empty.
---
I was actually looking at Nukacrypt's item search for the perk cards and their coding. Friendly Fire is 003E956A, 0051ABC2, and 0051ABC4 (Ranks 1, 2, and 3 of the card). The perk card checks for KYWD - [0051850D] &lt;WeaponTypeFireDamage&gt; to trigger SPEL - [003E956B] &lt;PerkFriendlyFire01Spell&gt; "Friendly Fire". The list above was the only items in the database with &lt;WeaponTypeFireDamage&gt;, and &lt;MolotovCocktail&gt; is specifically excluded by the card.
---
Nukacrypt's database does include "WEAP - [00592EA7] &lt;FloaterFlamerGrenade&gt; "Floater Flamer Grenade"", and it is not &lt;WeaponTypeFireDamage&gt;
---
Edit - I had the crafting code for the flamer grenade, not the weapon code.
---
Nah the ghillie one!
---
I run rifleman just for the extra damage but I see alot of endgame players run commando so its definitely popular. I feel like eventually I'll make that change too much ammo to run through for me.not sure if making ultracite ammo is better as far as yields per material. I kinda drifted the topic but sneak and commando can be pretty damn solid
---
Nah, I haven't notice any change at all. Still about the same number of people, still plenty of heavy hitters at public events.
---
Maybe it's just you.
---
"I'm a huge baby that can't stand others being better at a game than me. If you're better than me I'm going to throw a tantrum and make a whiny Reddit post because I'm an entitled child. If you don't play exactly the way I want you to you're a cheater." -Milk_Mommy033
---
Seriously, your name should be Milk_Baby because all you know how to do is cry and complain. Grow the fuck up you shit troll.
---
And you asked nicely
---
If it's cheap grab it right away... They promised DLCs will be free, so you dont have to start right away, you can wait a year :'D. Well, there are plenty glitches and stuff, but it's just a small indie studio, so give them a bit of time and it they will work it out.
---
I just realized, maybe you want to start now, there is currently "season" going on. There are some interesting rewards like Ammo Converter (which sucks now, but they are reworking it) and Chicken coop. Who knows if these rewards will be "ever" available in future, so grab them till you can.
---
Did I cause this by striking too soon or was it straigh up broke from the start?
---
That happenned to me too!!! I mean... What the...!!
---
It’s in the silo. It’ll be a blue card in the first section.
---
Check every room.
---
Once you have it, go to the med bay (down the hall at the end on the left) and scan yourself. 
---
Then take the card and go to the room with the single terminal, erase the card then create a new one.
---
Go to the security room and scan the card.
---
Voila, you’re through the first laser grid.
---
I suspect it prevents new ones from spawning and lets people get the ore farming done.
---
It gets substantially harder from there.
---
300hours should keep me entertained for a while haha
---
I got the two and four different jump suits in the same event
---
Slug buster???
---
I think you still need the base armor to apply the skin though.
---
Honestly I think a lot of it ( when people don't share) is that they don't even know how to actively share a card, because it isn't very intuitive? I get that some people don't have the points in Charisma because they wanted them elsewhere (and that's ok), but I think the majority just have no clue how to do it. 
---
Also, I had no idea that people were actually kicking other people out of groups because they are low level. That is just sad. 🙁
---
What platform and where? I must go there if I can
---
&gt; I'm just telling you there are people that see you for the player you really are.
---
By the way, what kind of statement is that? This is based off what? Your own judgement based on the perk card topic we had? Lol. Well, actually I'm transparent and people see me as is.
---
I carry my own weight, revive downed players, participate in events with my team members or any other activity they wish to do, I drop extra plans and ammo in suitcases at stations, I give stimpacks and radaways to new players. The other day someone was asking for a treasure hunter outfit because they was looking for one for a while, I crafted one for free while others wanted him to pay for it. So, yeah. I'd say I'm a friendly player and you see what you get.
---
"I'd hate to be that guy, but...."
---
Then, dont be that guy.

On Xbox, I heard there are a lot of robots. Was going to go in chinese stealth with stealth boy, packing my PA just in case. I have a troubleshooters 50 cal machine gun too, so hpefully all will work itself out.
---
Noob question: so, I think people starting PVP for workshops is pretty rare, right? How do people know when to PVP for a workshop? Do you get a notification if you’re in the area that a workshop is up? Or are people watching you on the map and watching you claim the workshop so they’ll attack?
---
And if I’m not mistaken, can’t PVP only happen while it’s being claimed?
---
Would also like to say thanks for that info. I have been taking workshops for lead and steel and have been wiped out by people double my level before I could blink so it’s a relief to hear I don’t have to PvP anymore.
---
I got used to bugs a while ago with Bethesda games haha, but yeah I heard that the wastelanders writing is meant to be good
---
Little plant babies haha 🌱
---
I’d like to see interior walls so I can put wallpaper on both sides.
---
I’ve been booted once or twice. Really was nothing explicable about it, I figured they were making room for a friend?
---
If he’s willing to use PA, Emergency Protocols and Life Giver 4 are a great combination.  Doesn’t make you unkillable, but as close as possible.  Poison is it’s only real problem.
---
I'm grossly inefficient with my core usage &amp; I still have way too many.
---
I only go heavy during high levelled areas or events &amp; it's good to have a ballistic alt weapon to save on cores
---
Yes?
---
Ok cool, getting overall positive comments about the game, usual Bethesda criticism, I’ll probably see if I can pick it up this weekend
---
Too bad a rocking chair is kinda a lame addition compared to the major companion build items.
---
Pick every lock and hack every terminal.
---
You can deactivate the turrets and avoid the reactor room for the most part.
---
I’m on Xbox too...run hundreds of silos.
---
If it drops in to your misc then there was (still is?) an auto complete bug. If however it goes in your junk it's just more scrap.
---
If you have fallout 1st you can set up a fusion core factory at posiedon and play the game and when you come back there will be some cores for you to use up in 10 minutes.
---
It’s good, wastelanders improved a lot. Honestly don’t think the bugs are bad at all in 2020 (at least not on Xbox)
---
If you like 4, want a bigger world with more enemies,
---
More weapons, better crafting, it’s worth checking out.
---
Who in gods name would have two hundred thousand lead?
---
I’ll most likely be buying it on PlayStation
---
If you want I'll invite you to my private server.
---
Im sorry :/ whats the zee backpack look like? The same thing?
---
The bundle that was in the atom store maybe two weeks ago (The bundle that had the WW2 style Pilot's outfit) had an Pip-boy skin called the All-American I think it was, that was a 95% Camouflaged pip-boy paint scheme with a small US Flag over the bottom right and works very well with a Ghillie outfit or armour.
---
Honestly if the second rank even just made it so there was a 5-10% chance you get some rare components back i’d by happy
---
What’s yer platform?
---
Yes. But I’ve only gotten a quad 1* gauss rifle. And I commonly max out all my scrip and use it that day
---
I do the terminal on the top floor of Flatwoods Ag center. It’s close by and usually triggers the event which is very fast to finish as well.
---
Same thing happened to me. I'm quite annoyed. I don't understand why they can't either provide atoms or at the very least reset those challenges for me so I can earn SCORE for them.  u/valseek and u/Ladydevann any thoughts?
---
Same deal, it plays about the same as FO4. For me it’s smoother actually
---
Talk about unrealistic trade expectations. Duping really did screw with the economy of the game if this is people's expectations of high end trading
---
I never had to much of an issue with FO4, beside the writing and the lack of major RPG mechanics
---
You can just go to gnarled shallows and kill 3 anglers
---
They do, I got like two, unfortunately not very good rolls. Remember, it is just big ass RNG on the top of another RNG.
---
If the workshop is claimed, another player may contest the workshop and will go hostile with the owner. You should get a notification when this happens. And yes if you claim a workshop, someone can look at the map and see this and come contest the workshop. It is like an open invitation for PVP.
---
Yeah I did it by myself once and couldn't tell what I needed to be doing. I killed everything that came out with no problems until the end. Died a couple times at the end and then failed it.
---
So, with all these NPCs standing around you'd think some of these assholes could go get the ore while I'm killing everything for them.  Apparently I gotta kill everything AND get the ore?  Lazy fucks! I'd have shot them too if I could have.
---
None of this was clear the first time I played it.  Timed events shouldn't be puzzles to unscramble.  So, yeah I'm not real interested in events that can't be ran solo easily.  Maybe if I see it with a few other people I'll go join it and see what I can do.  None of the other events I've done in the game in 510+ levels across 5 characters gave me that kind of trouble.
---
If you didnt know, lvl2 science expert (pretty sure expert) reduces the cost of crafting energy weapons which reduces radium crafting as well. Not sure if it's intentional, but it works.
---
I'd like to see some new monster types for this, too. Pick some lakes or rivers and give us a giant catfish monster. Take the other cryptids and give us prime versions of those, like the Colossus. Imagine a behemoth sized Grafton Monster. Introduce some new cryptids that are different, Wampus cats haven't been used, make them fast and have them dart about. Just, something new that isn't a basic variant on an existing template.
---
You also need as well as 500 bullion a minimum reputation with the settlers of Friendly for it to appear and be buyable, pretty much instantly available for example if you side with them to raid vault 79.
---
I bought those earlier from Watoga train station today.
---
Tomorrow*
---
Or just delete :)
---
Well it would be love freindly, but if that’s what I want fallout 76 is not the game I’m playing.
---
Don’t be afraid of it.  I jump in even though my weapons suck, grab as much ore as I can/blast as many ghouls as I can.
---
Yeah lol I made a post a few weeks ago about it saying that the scariest part of the WL quest line was wondering if I was going to encounter a bug that would stop me from proceeding and then force me to lose all of my progress. It would be less of an issue if there were checkpoints throughout it so that when you have to quit the server and re-join, it saves whatever enemies you already killed. I lost so much ammo in the vault 😭 I guess the upside was it was an XP grind and I made lvl 100 the same night I finished Wastelanders? 
---
If you have access to a private server either through your own Fallout 1st or a friend’s, that’s your best bet. I found that these quests worked better in my private server. But you shouldn’t need to pay for a private server for a quest to work! 
---
I’m the same way actually. Took a long break but COVID and Wastelanders brought me back. I’m annoyed that we had been waiting patiently for Wastelanders for so long and it has so many quest-breaking bugs.
---
Maybe a hub you can submit photos too outside of game mode. But then why bother
---
Maybe a tv screen could do a slide show of all photos
---
temps are great 65 at most
---
I'd definitely give it a try then
---
I think of Kurt everytime I see those.... bravo!
---
As that one Scrapper NPC says; "Who carries around a desk fan!"
---
Yeah I will, hearing positive things about it now, as well as confirmed long term support I’ll try and pick it up this weekend
---
Donno why you’re being downvoted for speaking the truth. Have an upvote
---
Congrats, you can now instantly turn in Ward's daily quest without doing anything, expect that bug to be fixed, cause it benefits you.
---
I was level 35 and got a two shot Gauss. helped me get through to 46 in no time and still awesome.
---
if you do would i be able to consistantly log into that? thank you in advance thats awesome
---
Dead weight for not sharing a perk card? Lol. You do realise that a player can do more than just share a card right? Like actually help their team mates in combat, revive them, be backup. You’re not seeing the bigger picture here.
---
It’s still going on bud. After the ban people are keeping it in their groups and not letting it go public...for now.
---
I think the lore in 76 is really good. Just take your time with it and don’t rush. The people who say it’s boring likely fast travel everywhere and didn’t pay attention to any of the narrative. I won’t say the “story” is great. But the world is impressive and the environmental storytelling and lore is top notch. Crafting is also greatly improved.
---
Glad to help. Workshops are a very slow way to get resources, with very few niche exceptions (hint: large adhesive farms, Bock/hefe farming). And for these exceptions I'd recommend a private server if you're not ready for PVP.
---
It’s very good and very satisfying. Needs more mods tho
---
It was just odd that it happened several times in a row.
---
BOS events.
---
Line in the sand. Distant thunder. Etc..
---
Every once in a while I'll take thunder mountain for a couple hours and power up the fusion core generator.
---
Not too many people contesting workshops at 5am.
---
RPG mechanics worse than 4 overall &amp; inventory management would be a nightmare if you're a hoarder or collector.
---
Other than that it ok
---
After lev 50 levels really dont matter it's your gear that matters I have stomped guy in the ground that were at least 100+ lev higher than me.  This is also a good reason to make friends
---
Seems like people take themselves way too seriously...
---
Because it is. The fixer is a unique combat rifle with a couple extra perks.
---
Ok
---
Oh jeez. Luckily it’s not toooo bothersome but sometimes on the map I see and and wonder what it is and remind myself it’s just that first quest
---
I know its still going on. But people can kiss the inexpensive top tier stuff goodbye
---
SS Under Armour
---
Thanks mom
---
I have found one about a month ago and that was the last time I actually had to go find it. Every night I just go there complete the nights mission and that’s it. I’ve been maxed on them for couple weeks so it don’t matter to me.
---
It breaks if you kill it too quickly. Been that way since forever.
---
&gt; Yea its fun for the ones camping a killing ghouls hogging the xp. But the runners dont get shit.
---
I don't care if the even fails.  I'm just there for the XP anyway.
---
I think that's pretty common.
---
I stopped at 105 for lore access. Then I made a new guy specifically for NW lol
---
I pretty much exclusively buy from vending machines. If you ain't selling it for caps I ain't buying.
---
That is so right. I can make fusion generator and decontamination shower out of a bunch of planks, but I cant scrap screw out of the weapon.
---
For clarity:
---
Linings are mods for the underarmor, you still have to buy the underarmor first and craft it, then apply a lining to the underarmor.
---
They said they had a fix out, but it wouldn't work for every scenario. The logging they added in the last hotfix should help them come up with a more comprehensive fix
---
^ fucking this post ^
---
Yes please ×1,000,000
---
How about ultracite ammo?
---
It worked, you're the best!
---
You're just a selfish asshole who thinks everyone should play by their rules and if they don't, they're the assholes in your eyes. You really don't seem to get that a player shouldn't have to impose self restrictions on themselves just to make other players happy. It's proof that you only think about your own gameplay just as much or more than someone one shots enemies.
---
You seem like the kind of person who gets angry at homeless people for being homeless instead of being mad at the social injustices behind their homelessness. I'll be bussing my tray while you go spit on a bum.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_End_tables
---
In my 160 hours thus far I've used mine once during Adventure Mode and even then we had a language barrier as he didn't speak English and my German is god awful.
---
Once I used it on NW, but the rest of my team died within 5 minutes so that's was it for that.
---
Victimless crime, if even one :)
---
Thanks, this is helpful, I had no idea that another player could contest it the entire time you have it claimed.
---
I watched like 6 videos claiming it was pretty easy to figure out. Turns out I’m just a fucking troglodyte
---
Yeah the under armor was there since dlc came out but last update they finally added lining and that’s when I purchased it. Because best under armor with 4 strength. Amazing
---
Ah okay. Hope they can find one.
---
Did the same thing. Bought the buttressed limbs before I bought the limb plans. They really need to make it clearer which are parts and which are mods....
---
Any build that involves sneaking and getting high crit multipliers is gonna be a brain-dead easy way to cheese everything with no risk due to stealth being incredibly easy to maintain.
---
Do you have a map for the locations
---
The problem with other builds besides bloodied isn’t really the damage I’d say but the lack of perks that synergies what other effects. Bloodied has a million perks to complement the effect while things like berserkers do not. 
---
Needs to be perks like the Less DR you have the more health you get for ber or every time you heal someone you get a slight damage buff for medics or something
---
You are a monster.
---
Joke.  Totally a perk of being in a group.  Travel guilt free.
---
Smart thinking! I’ll have to do this next time.
---
How do you separate the two with our current system though? Our current anti griefing measures are just mostly anti pvp measures.
---
Chemistry bench, acid. Under the smelting category.
---
Or look from mole miners and deathclaws
---
I bought them from one of the bots at Whitespings last night.
---
Just go down the two hallways into 4 caves filled with uranium ore. Each cave has ~10 ore nodes so about 40, 41 per person. You need 100 for the bar at the bottom to fill I believe, unlocking best potential rewards. Lots of rads though so you need a hazmat, stealth armor or PA to survive. So for bloodied builds, sure, I get it but anybody else should have those items to be able to be a runner.
---
They should make legendary perk that would work as "boosted" scrapper card, which would allow you to get materials you would not normally get. 
---
Legendary cards are for ppl with "higher" lvls, right? So the character would be already "experienced" lore-wise.
---
There is absolutely no point to PVP though.
---
If you want to group PVP I'm sure there are other sites and pages that you can organize a 4 on 4 battle if you'd like.
---
 Right now the odds of your team running into another 4 man team that just happens to want to PVP as well are slim to none. The only thing that will happen with your suggestion is griefing.
---
Yesterday I was on a server (Xbox) that didn’t drop or disconnect me for about 5 -6 hours. Three nukes were launched in about an hour. Got to kill the queen twice in less than 30 minutes.
---
Yes indeedy. Good luck out there
---
I’ve been running bloodied for a while now and I just got the three luckiest rolls last night with 300 scrip. First was bloodied lever action and second was the best gun I own I believe. Bloodied fixer and then third was bloodied Tesla. Bloodied fixer with just the rifle perks at 3 3 and 2 and sneak at 3 I was getting 900 damage a shot at some points. I am going to try and solo a queen tonight
---
Chest and jetpack is a no brainer and will set you back most of your bullion. It goes fast. 
---
Jp alone is 2k iirc.
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/XsuhQdA.gif](https://i.imgur.com/XsuhQdA.gif)
---
Just go to Cranberry Glade and server hop until a tamable creature shows up, it's the best one I've found.
---
So I removed all my luck perk cards, drank the serum again, notification comes up saying I’ve mutated, but still nothing under effects showing I’ve gained the mutation...ridiculous
---
Lmao. How is that any different from how it is now exactly? Pvp hasn't received any attention since the removal of survival. Its not our fault Bethesda can't bring content to the game in a timely manner.
---
I had the same thing happen on dailies and weeklies. First time it happened. This happens after I was on vacation for a week without being able to play. Pretty bummed.
---
You almost certainly had it coming.  Don't piss off Grahm.
---
How’s the crits with bloody on that? I know because of the way crits work generally they aren’t good with bloody. Like my melee build I can hit for like 800 but when I crit it ends up being like 300ish
---
I was level 6 and one of those fuckers attacked me
---
He went on a vacation and shit popped off. Oh and he didnt kill himself.
---
I have a bloodied auto pipe gun I use as a SMG to burn off .38 on low level enemies.
---
It makes me feel a little better that I'm not alone but only a little lol. I don't have Fallout 1st and this does not encourage me to give Bethesda more money so I will not be getting that. Just hoping the third time is a charm! I'm level 57 so it's not like I can breeze through it either.. gone through so much ammo but you're right at least I'm getting XP/legendary loot.
---
I don't know if it's just my mind playing tricks but I swear explosive weapons break stealth. Anyways, it's perfect for endgame especially with a fixer like that. You can usually kill mirelurk queens in about 6 shots or less. Sneak is a bit buggy in events but it's a small downside to being able to shred everything
---
Dude - I sell them for 99c
---
Idk... I crit headshots for 4k dmg on a ghoul with sandman active... 1k on sbq
---
It’s my favorite event right now. Most people don’t know how to do it. You only need one person to keep one scav alive (the one Up the stairs in the little room with the tinker bench is easy). It’s basically impossible for a single person to collect enough ore, so more people need to run.
---
Okay, this is the part confusing me. How did you miss out on higher rewards? Because you turned in too early, or because nobody else was really collecting? If that's the case, that's kind of out of your control I think ... 
---
From the responses here I gather there is a timer I either hadn't noticed or forgot about, and the goal would be to have as close to 100 as possible, as late as possible, without going over (to maximize XP farming) and hit 100 just before timer lapses to maximize rewards. Is that accurate? Maybe I need to read up more on the mechanics.
---
I mean it’s still kinda eh. I think we need a ammo burner for high level play. And I find the pipe gun to be kinda lame. The recluse from D2 is a great example of what I mean
---
I use to run rifleman when I was lower level and had trouble with keeping ammo because it's better damage per shot but commando is better damage per second so if you can afford to feed it it's better at taking tough enemies down
---
If you read anything you’d know it’s not about me not getting stuff it’s about the lower levels my build is fine and complete
---
As I inch closer to it every day I was wondering if it would work on a Fixer. I mean, it's a combat rifle, right? Why am I not surprised to learn that it does not. Thanks for the info!
---
Thanks for the help!
---
Pc only?
---
Guess the honeymoon is over and some treat Teams as some form of exclusive Guild.
---
I use my explosive bolt action pipe rifle for the same thing.
---
Calls me selfish is okay with one tapping the legendaries and refusing to let low levels touch it, good one m8
---
Yeah it would be awesome I’m half expecting them to add them when they add interiors but I have a feeling they will just load you in and not move between floors. Here’s hoping though.
---
By blue do you mean cobalt? If so you should nuke above the bear on the bottom of the map. Look for quantum leaves, bomb berries, and the occasional blue glowing stuff on the trees.
---
On top of that you can only carry around 30,000 caps and so unless you got a 2nd character created most players don't have that amount of caps on hand it sounds like OP is complaining about the economy of the PC version.
---
Yes, but from my experience it's only if you don't want them.
---
https://youtu.be/cpbbuaIA3Ds
---
Thanks, I wondered about that but never looked into the build so I wasn’t sure.
---
So. Much. Glowing. Blood.
---
Had this issue.  usually have to spawn in far from where you died.  Been ok last few days.
---
Looking for someone to take my nuke cards and I know what to collect just having a hard time finding them when they nuke near watoga
---
I thought blocks only lasted for that session.   How do you do it permanently?
---
.308 5.56 and .45
---
There are serious problems with the game, but I still find the game fun. There are small bugs that can be annoying but since you’ve played FO before you’ll see past them. But the serious problems are: weight management( if you don’t have FO 1st it’s gonna be a real problem), the factions in the game serve no purpose other then give you a daily quest, many of the repeatable quests and events become stale, the end game needs work. Playing with friends, the quests leading to end game, the building and customization really make up for the lack of end game content.
---
Covert Operative. I don't share perks that mess with people's builds.
---
Have you check Whitesprings bunker?
---
I don’t get that because on the controls on the perk page it says how to share a perk
---
Yes but they can't earn more than 150 a day.
---
They're probably not supposed to be common for low level players... that's the point.  Those materials are likely considered to be "uncommon" as far as the varieties of scrap go.  If you could get them from scrapping any old weapons and armor they'd be just as common as anything else.  Having to seek out that kind of scrap rather than having it fall on your lap is part of the early game experience.
---
Yeah if you search this subreddit there are tons of people reporting bugs in Wastelanders. Like I said it’s very frustrating that such an important quest line would be so bugged! I understand that completely lol, I feel guilty when I admit that I have a fallout 1st subscription but the sad fact is I may not have completed Wastelanders without it. I plan on cancelling it once I’ve amassed a decent amount of scrap in my scrap box, or play the game less (maybe after the legendary run).
---
Oof level 57 can be hard to be completing Wastelanders at so I get it. I hope the third time works but if it doesn’t, you could work on other things and level up while they hopefully patch it? Or just take another long break haha. Maybe in another year WL will be bug-free ... or close to bug-free.
---
Megasloths have set spawns also.
---
Thats my point, they can barely handle getting out properly functioning well made pve content as it is. Adding more pvp focus into the mix would only hurt the game even more. 
---
Its better to let pvp die off so that the sole focus is pve, since it seems it's difficult enough for them to get that right.
---
Yea this is the first I’ve heard of people getting kicked. I rarely start my own team so I didn’t even know you could kick
---
Um...I consider it a full set I launch all three or go-to a new server if I can't, followed by an encrypted...
---
hmm. are your other mutations working?
---
But if you fuck up you lose out on a key card don't you?
---
Oh okay, so you’re talking 4K with sneak multiplier?
---
Yeah...I’ll shit it down and try again later I guess
---
There are two options:
---
1. The game glitched out and you really lost your atoms due to a bug.
---
2. You bought that item accidentally without knowing it.
---
Both have same solution:
---
Contact the Bethesda support. I know these are different games, but in ESO they were able to refund me when I bought something by accident. They might be able to help you.
---
What qualifies as a thank you?  Heart emote?  Thumbs up emote?  Wild jumping up and down?  Direct Message on PSN or Live?  
---
When I donate stuff to newbs, I Heart emote and usually get one back.  That's enough for me.  If they don't Heart back, maybe they don't even know how to yet?
---
This happened for me on ps4
---
*makes it rain scrip*
---
“Wait. Was that 151?”
---
*takes a scrip back off the stage*
---
The problem is the current system makes it so that even if you have organised groups willing to participate in PvP it's next to impossible to have proper team fights now.
---
Your argument that there's absolutely no reason to PvP is also narrow minded and flat out wrong. The only reason anyone needs is because they find it fun. Even if only a minority of players enjoy PvP that's not an excuse for it to be slowly removed, especially when it's always been completely optional since the start and can be made 100% avoidable.
---
I'd rather they take the existing encounters and make them mechanically interesting before they add more
---
I take the one that lets you breathe underwater and not take rads. Literally just spawn in river and hide there til I die. Go do something else while waiting lol
---
More like when you are at a bar and see a pool table filled with pool balls; thinking god damn look at all the plastic I could scrap.
---
Flashback intensifies
---
The fact that you knew that euphemism tells me otherwise. You’re a bright person! And people probably like you.
---
For some reason, Fusion cells go as quick as I stock them.
---
It's only when I'm online and in the private server but if you see me in it then feel free to join.
---
My IGN is stonemason1973
---
Edit: also do you have discord? It would make communicating easier.
---
When I’m already in DM’s with someone (almost always am, sometimes game chat) and they’re like I need this and that, and I drop it for them, and they take off without anything or any message back that’s usually a sign for me.  I’m literally talking to the person, I don’t like to drop stuff in the wild like that unless we’re alone or at my camp.
---
Or when you see a shitpost and think; look at all that fertiliser I could get.
---
Agree it’s ridiculous it happened to me yesterday twice and another time it didn’t even register that I’d claimed it. It wasn’t until I went back to it I noticed I couldn’t fast travel and my icon had disappeared
---
Yeah fair enough. It does seem it would be more complicated than a standard energy or ballistic round.
---
Unless you nuke a spot yourself you won’t be finding cobalt in large quantities. The 2 popular spots are: Fissure site prime and the whitespring. You can find some at whitespring but only enough to make like, 2 stable cobalt. And you have to be using green thumb for that. But in the cranberry bog you won’t be finding a lot of cobalt.
---
Yes, just found for the normal plasma gun
---
I share Lucky Break. I know no one else runs it and the thing is underrated as hell. I very rarely have to repair my armor ever since I tried it out. I'm sure a lot of people on my teams are like "what the heck is that green armor pipboy animation popup mean?!"
---
I only had 5 showing after reset, which I waited until after to log on, I thought it weird they lowered it. Turns out 4 of them auto completed on me. *sighs*
---
First time it's got me .. so far.
---
We have ways :D   Just a lot of smart people involved.
---
Which platform are you on?
---
I agree I think it would be nice to get a thank you of some sort! I have to say though, there were probably a few instances when I first started when I didn’t actually know how to do the emotes to give a heart or a thumbs up so probably seemed ungrateful but really it was just I didn’t fully know the games controls 😔
---
You can lure mobs to someone's  camp.
---
This is why I’m simply pointing it out.  There’s the Internet side of it and then there’s the gracious side of it.  If we’re going to praise people for giving stuff to the newbies, there’s nothing wrong with saying hey just so you know, a thanks is appreciated.
---
Dont feel bad about it at all, if its there use it....
---
Exactly that. Luckily with this build it’s modeled after a railroad siding, so they’re parallel to the track and fairly symmetrical and don’t look horrible because of it.
---
5mm is selling pretty bad lately
---
A Nukashine blackout event would be funny, if you woke up with someone else’s cosmetics on and you had to socialize and find other events participant who had your cosmetic. Obviously as a temp “had” but I think that would be funny have it confined to that frat row neighborhood where once you drink everyone wakes up in a different house and you have to battle different hoards as you leave the house you wake up in to find the other PCs
---
Wasn't the fix for challenges not rewarding atoms? The score challenge autocomplete bug is still being investigated.
---
EDIT: Yes it was.  [https://bethesda.net/community/topic/420361/atom-rewards-issue-resolved?language%5B0%5D%5B%5D=en](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/420361/atom-rewards-issue-resolved?language%5B0%5D%5B%5D=en)
---
I totally get this part, I had issues too figuring it out.  But when I’m in DM’s with someone and they dart off after I drop 50 of every material, it’s shitty to take it and run.
---
About 30 minutes ago, I joined a public group to do the daily stuff, and a level 14 from the group travelled to me and initiated trade.  I thought "maybe he needs some ammo or something", so I accept to see what he requests.  Nope, starts requesting all my personal use weapons.  /sigh
---
I'm saying that the move camp option is not there at all in the pip boy, no matter where I am. There is no option to select, not even one that is greyed out. Normally it appears just to the left of the Cancel option, but there is nothing there. I made sure that I was not in a restricted space. I even went back to my previous camp site. To be clear- I'm not trying to move the camp gizmo around inside the current camp site. That works fine. I'm trying to move the entire camp to a different area of the map, like from Gilman Lumber Yard to somewhere near the Gorge Junkyard (for example).
---
I forgot to mention I'm on Xbox One. I installed in July, after the June patch was released. I checked and there are no pending updates available.
---
Xbox 1 under my sons account. He doesn’t use his Xbox anymore he does PS and console.
---
Ok:
---
I didnt see it anywhere else. New hybrid junkie bloody casual here.
---
Pay attention if it happens during fast travel [does for me]. I just keep radaway d. And dirty water. KISS.
---
Best o luck!
---
Hahaha that’d be funny
---
If you were on PS I could’ve given you some. But my advice would be to look around whitespring when it gets nuked.
---
Thank you. I’m back with another question though lol. Let’s say someone contests my workshop. Could they just find me on the map and gun me down? And even if I have pacifist mode on? Or do you need to travel to the workshop to have the fight?
---
I don't even know how to make a launch code using the silo code pieces, it's so confusing to me. I rely on Nukacrypt!
---
It does say that if you drop it, but it doesn't teach you the plan. I remember threads popping up about this issue during Fasnacht.
---
Puncturing does more damage. Had heavy but recently upgraded to puncturing. On PC otherwise I could sell you the heavy plan.
---
Cool keep defending liers
---
Honestly I don’t normally find dead servers, however I do find most I join littered with new players. Upside/downside to it being on gamepass I guess.
---
I’m in Australia as well so i feel like if anyone’s going to have dead servers...
---
If you're running Incisor go heavy, for the plans they rarely drop from Project Paradise and only if you keep 2 animals alive, a bit better chance if all 3 survive.
---
What I mean by "no point" is there's no faction wars, there's no castle seizing, ect... there's no reason to do it other than to do it.  PVP players are very small percentage of the fallout 76 playerbase.  It's just not something the majority of the players want in their game. Opening up groups to griefing again just wouldn't be a good idea.
---
The solution is incredibly simple. Remove Pacifist mode as an option from the menu and make it's functionality the default system for which PvP encounters are handled. Then add a new option to the menu (let's call it Survivalist) that enables "classic" PvP. This brings back the slap system and opens you open to PvP when your teammates who also have Survivalist engage with another player, just like before.
---
Now players actually have to go into the menu and choose to enable PvP for themselves (unless they're at a workshop PvP event) which should actually make it harder for new or unknowledgeable players to get caught up in PvP without understanding how or why. This would give the PvP crowd more freedom to PvP with like-minded individuals while actually increasing protections for the PvE exclusive crowd. 
---
It's a win-win for everyone, but I find it very hard for the PvE crowd to show any support. Doesn't seem like PvE players have any interest in improving the game for anyone but themselves.
---
The elevator workshop object in F4 was a gigantic, buggy mess, and looking how it was implemented is enough to send even the most battle-scarred software engineer running for the hills, screaming. Bethesda can't even do ladders, so I wouldn't hold my breath for an elevator.
---
Meanwhile, you can always build a paternoster using a windmill generator.
---
Is this one of those things like the fixer where you have to know the plan before it drops?
---
You have to know the plan first.
---
Xbox here. And the event just takes a few trial runs. I didn’t know what was going on the first couple times lol
---
I run two Berserker's toons (Commando and non-PA heavy). To be honest the Berserker's have been the most fun builds I've done so far.
---
I opted to go the level 1 armor route so I could change out my armor to best fit the situation I'm in. Basically 2 addictions to get -20 DR, then I can wear an Underarmor (generally Raiders) and full level 1 set of light leather or wood. A full set gives 75% damage reduction against whatever the prefix is geared towards.
---
- Zealot's - SBQ, anything that's scorched dominant
---
- Troubleshooter's - Silos, Encryptid, AWOL, anything that's robot heavy
---
- Mutant Slayer's - West Tek
---
- Ghoul Slayer's - Whitespring
---
- Life Saving / Auto Stim - running around general areas
---
- etc, etc
---
A full set of armor weighs about 2.6 lbs, so I can carry many of them with me at the same time. There used to be a 90% damage reduction option when the Radicals Mask was legendary, but that has been nerfed.
---
The build can be rather tanky if wearing the right armor for the situation. There are also some good perks to keep you on your feet, or revive you with a damage boost in case you go down.
---
The biggest pain in putting these builds together was the long grind at the purveyor to get all the armor pieces.
---
Bethesda did decide to change the Ammo Converter based on community feedback - if enough people get on board, maybe we can get this changed as well. It's worth a shot, anyway!
---
You will only be hostile inside of the workshop area. 
---
Also, you will be hostile even with pacifist on.
---
As soon as the event starts, you can get one hit on it that counts for sneak attack damage
---
Hit it with a bloodied 40PA gauntlet, will kill it outright and break the event
---
Just tickle it with a normal bloodied sneak attack when it first opens
---
yeah but that looks scrappy.
---
Damn was hoping I could use the one on the season thing once I get enough score :(
---
I got a real pvp story. Traveled to some guys camp and he had 2 buddies there and as soon as I loaded in this level 60 something started shooting me so I cut him down with my grognak axe. Then he sought revenge and I started smashing his camp up. His buddies then tried to engage in pvp with me and I hit his lvl 200 something friend and killed him. He sought revenge and then blasted me with a legacy laser rifle and killed me and got on his mic and started talking smack about how I like to pick on lower levels and Th at it’s not fun when I’m fighting high level players. Really rustled my jimmies because his little friend attacked me first and sought revenge
---
The rng man. It’s horrible. Took me like 800 modules to craft a mostly uny set. All the other perks are mostly garbage as well with two pieces being only 1 star
---
Not as far as I am aware.  Occasionally she will just spawn insane amounts of adds and it's not a new thing by any means.  
---
I've also been to several queens where like 8 people open lunchboxes in a row (which is a complete waste btw) and nothing about it was different at all in my experience.  You probably just hit one of the random instances where she spawns things non-stop.
---
I saw some big fat tree limbs stacked by the side of the road the other day and I got excited for a second.
---
B/C high levels will come along and buy it to sell for a profit. I was selling over 300 plans for 1-10 caps. A level 245 came along and bought them all.  I was super upset NGL.  Now I sell them for 25-50 depending on what they are
---
I appreciate the positivity. 
---
I remember the first time trying to decipher the code with my buddy, we went silent on the mic for a solid 10 minutes. Finally I heard him say "dude are we dumb?" I had to concur that we are in fact, dumb. lol
---
At this rate I’m fine with one star as long as it’s unyielding also a shame I can’t have deep pocketed mod on the limbs!
---
I'm 4/5 in on a a unyeilding secret sever set. Got right legs to get. Two are perfect rolls others need rerolling after the fullset. Since I've started collecting an unyeilding I have probley rolled over 300 LM and have gained multiply full sets of troubleshooters zealots and bolstering but unyeilding seems like unicorn poop! Good luck with the grind!
---
Bethesda encouraged it by having atom challenges to kill players. It takes no skill. And, if you have turrets, they can force it upon you. 
---
BUT, I haven't experienced this for a while myself.  And to the contrary, I've recently been having people ft to my workshop to defend it.  And, I've done the same.  Defending counts as an event for the legendary challenges.
---
I don't keep workshops.  I claim, and leave.  They need a QOL option to either surrender the workshop at the workbench, or an emote to tell other players in the workshop, that they can have it.
---
If it ever does. They must nuke it when I’m not on because when I’m on the area near watoga is all that ever gets nuked. Also having issues with my allies. Finished Beckett and I just finished Sophia and I tried to add the old man and he wouldn’t give me a quest. So I removed him and added the girl with the guitar same thing. I tried restarting and nothing. Then when I put Sophia back on i get our last bit of dialog asking about her future and us since I romanced her over and over again.
---
Where you playing when the challenges reset? From all the evidence I’ve seen that is what caused the problem.
---
The event teams are amazing when the events aren't garbage, but it seems like most of the time it's hard to get a string of good events.
---
It's the same chance for unyielding as it is for any other prefix. It's just RNG.
---
Yeah I think the event groups are the only ones that occasionally get together, but even then it's not necessarily intentional.
---
Nuka My Bloods In It is okay with it though. 👍
---
I wondered aloud yesterday....why were people  just leaving their biometric ID cards laying around a nuclear silo in the first place?
---
You'd think it would be pretty easy to automate finding weapons that are literally impossible and delete them or ban players.
---
Sounds like communism!
---
That's where I see it most is fast travel and respawning. It's fun to do the diluted radaway/dirty water balancing act.
---
Yeah just check it before you put it in
---
Look here [Fallout 76 Plan &amp; Mod Database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR_El8/edit#gid=2043760311) the Machined tab, at the bottom, list chances of unlocking.  
---
Either .65% or .45%
---
You can only do an ally quest once per day. So it might be on cooldown.
---
Okay, thanks again. It sounds like I could just leave the server if I get a notification that the workshop has been contested.
---
There is a yt for this already.
---
I think you can get mods as rewards for Dropped Connection.
---
I use the teams on a regular basis now.
---
Start in "Build" to get the extra XP boost from more INT, and then when running an event switch over to "Event" just before it ends to get the bonus XP there, and back to "Build" after the event is over. Rinse, repeat.
---
You also get the Team boost for Herd Mentality and Strange in Numbers even if you're by yourself, which is weird, but nice.
---
Wait, you can check keycodes on the keypad before you put in the keycard?
---
I find im never thirsty.
---
Also: consider running junkies build exact the way your bloody is but dont micromanage. Ive recently started letting it proc and boy..... Satisfying.
---
I have a gun that I use just for griefers. Only used it once, because the guy was in my camp bashing me constantly and wouldn't stop no matter how many times I requested he quit it.
---
So, I pulled out Flo. She's my recon-scoped, calibrated automatic laser pistol for faster fire rate and damage, with a beam splitter for long-distance shotgunning, and tuned beta-wave tuner for additional superior fire damage. Why is she called Flo, you ask?
---
I also use the glitch to make your auto fire gun have the same high-capacity as a 500 round gatling gun (laser gun is the only gun to logically make sense for a really biiiig battery, to me anyways). It breaks at about 300 rounds in, so it's good for only the one fight, but goddamn if it doesn't melt through assholes in seconds, even higher level ones, leaving them as ash. The dude harassing me was 67 and I was 41. 
---
So basically she's spewing out a of whole lot of burning pain at a high rate of speed, like a [high-speed lava flow.](https://youtu.be/gnrg3cfDfrY). Just an unrelenting stream of lava that you have no hope of surviving if you're in front of it. I think it's because when you split the beam, the same amount of additional fire damage is applied to every single split beam that manages to land as it would with a single unsplit shot, so it overwhelmingly stacks when you land most of the split-beams. But that is only a guess.
---
There's simple ways to include PvP without opening anyone to griefers.  I don't understand the mentality of "I don't have an interest in it so it shouldn't be in the game". It's 100% optional and can be designed in such a way that it stays that way for PvE players without putting such tight restrictions on players that actually want to PvP. There's no reason why everyone can't get what they want, other than this mentality that "if I don't like it, it doesn't belong".
---
I still disagree with your point about there being no reason, but I'll concede that you aren't wrong about there being few in-game incentives. This would also be an easy solution, but I can also understand why it would be a point of contention to add such content. That's why at the very least I feel that fewer restrictions should be imposed on those that want to PvP for the fun of it, while simultaneously beefing up the protections of PvE players that aren't interested. It's the closest to a "middle ground" I think we could come to without causing a major upset to one side or the other.
---
I think if they replaced .38 with 9mm in-game, they could just bring back the 9mm pistol and SMG from New Vegas. Having a .38 caliber would make a lot more sense in this way, it wouldn't be as powerful as the 10mm or .45 still, and it could allow for us to get more NV guns in game :)
---
Great job though.
---
I'm worried every time I craft and it lags, that I'm going to cause a stack dump.
---
People downvote shit they dont like even if its true. Thanks pal
---
I am only level.....wow. I dont remember...  160?
---
I wear chinese stealth jammies and collect all the ore i can.  Then i run around dinging ghouls.   You cant fuck this up and who cares if you DO?   Its a game. Have fun.  Ask and get the deets, from someone thats there.   You cannot fuck up an event.  If u r low level at rumble, hide in the decon chamber and put holes in anything going by, with glowing pustules!!!  If u go down, someone can revive you and it helps THEM too!!!   I am xbox and always try to help the FNG’s.  Its just a game. Screw anyone that flames you without helping or explaining anything
---
I think it has to do with server age with her adds.
---
I’m not sure how to quantify except to use AWOL as my judge.  If I hop to an awol and get swarmed with robots, I call it a good server and try to hang out there.  If I go and get 6 waves of robots, 1 robot each, I consider the server hosed, quickly finish up my business and find a new server.
---
I’ve seen many servers go to hell after 3 nukes in close succession.
---
Dumb question, but do you have AP when trying this? Pressing VATS button will drain a bit of AP and if you keep spamming it while out of AP, it won't be able to refill enough to allow for VATS
---
I catch myself looking at a drawer and expecting the content screen to pop-up
---
I looks like there is a 30% chance of getting them from the event. A few of them can show up at the Watoga vendors too.
---
Yeah, I avoid a lot of them, and server hop a bit.
---
Pretty much any escort or slow spawn rate, I just ignore... except Feed The People, since its XP food that never expires.
---
Because of Bethesda and their intern developer team.
---
Keep in mind that stores were literally taping copies to console boxes and to other games, just to get rid of them!
---
I wanted the dark matter paint so badly but I’m really bummed I won’t even be able to use it. It’s kind of ridiculous!
---
Oh for sure it was a bug, i was saving up for the bundle and had the atoms before I fast traveled there. I contacted bethesda immediately and havent recieved anything yet. Doubtful too since I never got my last ticket resolved about getting a non-legendary secret serv chest piece from the purveyor from the last mystery pick sale. Heres to hoping though, thanks.
---
Nah, he meant once you decipher it yourself, make sure it's right with Nukacrypt for comparison.
---
Yeah -  I have the plans - I make my own - I just want pretty stars on them....
---
Why get upset, at least they sold, if you want them to be only for low levels then you should go to them and see if they want to buy them from you.
---
no idea but it's still a random drop. I got 2 in 20 and 2 of those were back to back. Just pay the 6-7k for one
---
Hemlock holes has a Grafton monster and two snallygasters .
---
It still works. May need to use walls other than wooden walls.
---
It’s such an easy fix.
---
I go only if there are high levels like myself.otherwise it will be a meatgrinder and loss.
---
For sure! I’m constantly baffled by this.
---
Not true. I got it before I finished the quest.
---
I really need the gas and coolant pumps for my Red Rocket station.
---
That's great news. Thanks!
---
if u ve survived without water everything is possible.
---
Nice thank you I'll let u know if I need any, do u know by any chance are the must have points on each category?
---
I like all those options....I had the same thought for the enclave...drop down a asultron
---
They come to you.just don't let them kill npc's.
---
Atleast the wiki claims you need to have completed "The lying Lowe". [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:\_The\_Fixer](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_The_Fixer)
---
You can find it on trading sub/discord going for as low as 5000caps.
---
Oh, good point I guess. I was just basing it off someone who wanted to do the full process without any help at all.
---
I just crafted them over and over. I think it took me 25 rolls to get a B gauss shotgun. That’s 17 days worth of scrip.
---
Hmmm.  If I say I don't want them any more, does Todd still look deep into my soul to make sure I'm not lying?
---
I watched the videos on how to on youtube and had people tell me how but still wont work for me
---
I was one of the lucky few to roll full unyielding with like 25 modules. As shitty as it is, its purely random.  
---
Getting a junkies gauss minigun took a solid 60 though so gl.
---
I know the feeling, my god chest was about 50 rolls, my legs were about 40-50 rolls each. My arms are really awful rolls, at least they have Uny though. I’m not bothering with any of the weapons
---
That's what we think! Little did we know adding a skin for the C.A.M.P. would break the entire fast-travel and vendor features.
---
I want offical underground build support because of the terrain issues. One level is good enough for me.
---
They really aren’t though. It’s just a bonus, 250 a day can easily be replaced with 30k exp. If they were, there’d be 3 at a time and there would always be the “complete 3 NW challenges”.
---
Saturday 8pm EST.  And try to buy them that weekend - from what I heard it can be buggy if you wait too long in the week.
---
All the events are fun IF you have other players.they should have certain events only playable with 2 or more players.
---
No judgement on subscribing, I've considered for sure. I really do love the game. Third time is a charm though and I just beat Fun and Games! If the next stage is too hard I'll take a break with other quests and come back to it.
---
I mix mine up. I think Strength 15 , Intelligence 8 , Luck 10, Charisma 3+ , agility 6. The rest you can play with
---
In that case, better finish that questline then
---
Yep! :)
---
Xbox as well...but I’d rather be productive than counterproductive. 😂
---
I was totally going to say this, I'm glad somebody did haha
---
I do the same, except I take almost all my rads away. I know I only need one shot to get the loot, so I don’t care how little damage it is.
---
Maybe don’t hide in buildings, enemies don’t spawn there. Go to VTU or Highschool, monogah or monogah power plant. Even the forest is a good spot.
---
The snallies there have been replaced by gulpers for me most of the time now, so that's not a 100% spot anymore.
---
Doesn't hurt even if the wiki is wrong. It is written by players after all.
---
I know it’s not quite the same, but speaking of lifetime challenges, I’d love if they could fix the challenges that are glitched so you can’t complete them. Looking at you “Discover Beckley”...
---
No I have full AP. It’s just a random bug. If I close the game and reopen it then it’ll work fine. Server hopping doesn’t fix it though.
---
This was rhe solution once i stoped using wooden frames it worked perfectly. Thank you so much
---
Wait.  Are you saying you can craft normal gauss rifles and there's a chance the go legendary?  I had no idea.
---
Here you go:
---

---
Wait, you have to actually PLAY the game mode and actually do what this game mode is all about, kill a single player??????? Holy shit, we need to cancel Bethesda this instant.
---
The red barn doors
---
Incorrect.  Random roaming mobs can, indeed, wreck a C.A.M.P.  I know, because my camp gets hit often.  Having said that, you can kite mobs to someone else's camp, if you want.  Also, anything that creates environmental damage, can damage players and their camp. 
---
You can argue this.  It's fact.  And, it's how the game works.  
---
If you want clarification, have somebody send a nuke to your camp.
---
I just did it 20 minutes ago
---
No. I was talking about the gauss shotgun from Foundation. Regular gauss rifles are pure rng.
---
YouTube it, but it is basically putting down walls with doors. They'll allow you to snap another wall with door to it. Once you have it in place you switch both walls to a regular one.
---
If a wall with door cant be placed, place a regular one, then switch it to wall with door, and repeat process.
---
The building system is really finicky..
---
You propably don't remember but atleast wiki claims you need "The lying Lowe" quest finished, which is not the last quest in that questline. So could it have been that you had completed that one? But not finished the entire questline?
---
EDIT: Found it in this mod/plan database that is maintained by dataminers.  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR\_El8/edit#gid=540561335](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR_El8/edit#gid=540561335)
---
No his talking about the gauss shotgun you get from the wastelanders dlc. What platform you on. I have a 3 star anti armor laying around
---
Don't even get me started about the fan and globe on my desk.
---
That’s a good one but the weapon version is better imo
---
Once asked a coworker if they had noticed the new camp that was setup next door to our building.
---
It was just a new building under construction, but it looked exactly like a camp in the game.  My coworker was quite confused.
---
I may be wrong but i dont think theres a physical plan. From my experience all the arktos rewards are learned right away by your character if you actually got it. Like when i got my backpack and bear arm it just said crafting item unlocked up in the corner.
---
I run with power user perk at all times.  Doubles the life of fusion cores. And I don't use Gatling laser as my main weapon for everyday use. My weapon for everyday use against  common enemies is the Gatling gun.  I use Gatling lasers for the queen and that is about it.  I do line in the sand event at least once a day. The event gives you   two fusion cores with 80 percent charge. Lastly, [here is a good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VwIk6WFKiQ)showing a good fusion core farming route.
---
This is my go-to cryptid, too. No use going there if the workshop's taken, though. You can also try going to Grafton itself, usually either Grafton Day or Protest March will start then, so that's a 50:50 chance at a cryptid (and Grafton Day is such an easy event to farm as well: find the GM, one-shot it, event done).
---
Lol you got the luck with the armor but not the gun
---
Don’t even do that. I can one shot it with a Grognak Axe and no sneak. Just shoot it a couple times then smack away.
---
I have proof there’s definitely an inventory hack so you were way off with this one 🙄. All of my power armor and weapons disappeared right off my character back while doing Scorched Earth (AGAIN) the first time I go into a public server after the first time I got my weapons hacked
---
Red rocket pa is the best.imo.with jetpack.
---
Found it on dataminers mod/plan database too.. It has the same info as wiki. So it is propably right :)  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR\_El8/edit#gid=540561335](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR_El8/edit#gid=540561335)
---
You can use a fusion  generator, but I just do the powering up event.  After doing it a few times you get to where you can do it quickly.
---
I don't like using a fusion generator because it gets instantly wrecked when creatures attack the workshop.  Or at least that is what has always happened to me. I have tried everything people have suggested to prevent it but none of it has ever worked. 
---
Fusion generator will only power the fusion core maker. Powering up the plant provides enough power for the maker and several extractors.
---
Sorry to steal your RNG, but I got an Uny Str Junk torso on my very first roll for any type of SS armor.
---
Ok thank you 👍
---
Ha! \*whack\* Gotcha!
---
Today's whack-a-commie score: 1.
---
I checked the wiki and it just says that luck effects looted item condition, nothing about improving item quantity though. 
---
The preserved pie I can't say, my character has high luck and I've gotten that pie twice so maybe.
---
Sometime in August
---
What the exact drop rate?
---
Yes, I have the Stealth armor, thank you.
---
Thumbnail?what do you have raptor claws?
---
On PC Radiation Rumble usually has half the server playing

Yes happened to me twice today. First time I changed server, the next server I was able to join a team (the low level kicked me after 20 minutes for some reason), but couldn't start or join another team. Trying for my third server now (third I was able to join).
---
Wow great, looks like that's it then. I'll do the quests. Appreciate it. 👍
---
Cool, thank you. I wasn't sure about the under-armor.
---
Lit thanks
---
Eventually I hope...
---
I always find them at Toxic Larry's Meat 'n Go
---
I use a furious tesla. I've been meaning to give it some proper investigation as I've not checked damage numbers but I've noticed if it arcs onto additional targets they always die before the first one. It's strange, as far as I know they should be pretty bad as the effect should keep resetting.
---
AyetheCaptain is my gamer tag I'll should be available most of the day tomorrow (I'm in UK) so just drop me a message when you're free
---
Yeah and also if a scorched is shooting me with a shotgun,then i kill them and he only has a toothbrush and a wooden spoon..lmao
---
Bloodied Gs. Its fun, fun, fun and nowhere near the pathetic build that some try to sell it as.
---
I noticed that the damage increased when I sneak attacked, also sometimes when not sneaking but it is definitely bugged for me and my Furious weapons
---
I got two recently
---
That’s quite a bit of effort for just three encryptids lol.
---
You can't also get it to drop if you buy it from a player's vendor.  All the script cares about, is if you've learned the plan.  I paid too much for mine, and I get random rolls from the purveyor.
---
I did this.
---
No, I dont think so.
---
Thanks. I’ve noticed the same thing, secondary targets die quickly. Please share your knowledge once you finish your research.
---
If you find more im pretty sure you can sell them
---
Deep breaths, we’re all just playing to have fun
---
That's too bad, I dislike that development. Too many formerly varied spawns have but one enemy type since Wastelanders. Not that I loved the scorps or low-level ghouls at Kiddie Corner, but the bloatflies were a welcome variety.
---
Using my Furious laser rifle, it worked sometimes I just wanted to burn off all of my fusion cells
---
Yup If I won't buy Sat or Sunday I never can.
---
Maybe next time you will think twice before doing those things in an alternate timeline and then merge with that time line so you have to suffer the consequences
---
Obviously it's beecause the fixer is kinda greenish and the combat rifle isn't.  Because of that greenish-nish it doesn't even need a paint slot!   Nobody would buy a skin or paint for the most popular and sought after rifle in the game, they like the green!
---
You do it through your system. For the PS4 you go to friends - and search for people - insert name - block. 
---
Not sure for x-box and pc though
---
Thank you for the reply. So do I understand correctly that once I buy and use the plan I can not only craft the pieces, but they ***could*** drop from purveyor or events?
---
I think that would ruin the entire season, or purpose of it from bughesda's standpoint. As people could buy the ranks with atoms the first day the purchase feature is enabled, and then farm all the lost atoms back while doing dailies/weeklies. Not that i think it is a bad idea, but i seriously doubt bughesda will ever give atoms free again now that they got what they wanted without an massive public outcry. Meaning the removal of atom rewards.
---
Giving all the players scrips as challenge rewards after they finish season would be reasonable.
---
Because you touch yourself at night.
---
People always kill the ghouls when I do the event. I'm sitting there trying to cripple them and everyone else is just blasting them into oblivion. 
---
We still complete the event so it's not really a big deal, I wouldn't stress too much about cripple vs kill.
---
I've also never seen anyone heal the people, it's not essential at all. If you can do it go for it! But don't skip the event because you can't.
---
I personally recommend charisma 6 because tenderizer and bodyguards are both good lvl 3 cards. Suppressor isn't good because you one hit everything for the most part.
---
I'll give a new player in need stims, food, chems, and  copies of plans for free.. even armour, mutation serums, and tricked out handmades!
---
BUT... im also a realist with my store, and I want to make caps/not have to resupply my vendors every 3 hours.
---
I will sell generic plans way under value, 5 for almost all recipe/  between 15-25 for most weapon or armour plans.  I'm very generous.
---
But yes,  I'm selling my stimpack and other healing/chem recipes at about 250 or 300. And my last fastnacht doughnut plan will be listed for 1000 caps like my coo-coo clock plan. They're hard to find items.
---
There is an economy in game. If it's rare it's going to be worth more. 
---
If I'm not making caps how am I supposed to buy that amazing legendary Bob is selling for 15K?!?
---
Because if they are crippled, they won't respawn, and you can focus your energy on collecting, for a better payout in the end.
---
I got a lab coat.
---
I still haven't dropped a nuke, how about you?
---
I do the same amounts. I do so for three reasons. To get quick caps, to empty my stash weight faster and accessible to low levels.
---
If some high level wants to come along and buy it all out, I don't care. I get caps, my stash lightens up. My vendors are for everyone. First come first serve.
---
I don't sit around in the game to inspect every player who comes to my base.
---
Some people are just asses! 
---
I don't like booting people because it takes XP away from me too. 
---
\-Not saying this about you.-
---
I have noticed some people are joining teams just to grief other team member's camps. It is sad we have to play with bullies constantly now. Bethesda just ignores them.
---
I don’t know about events, I’ve never personally seen one as a reward but yes I have had the Purveyor give me SS armor pieces that I had the plans for.
---
When I did it, everyone was killing them. We got a few ores in and completed it anyway. But from what I understand, if you cripple them, they won't respawn, giving everyone plenty of time for collecting, and best end payout.
---
I need to stop up to Point Pleasant sometimes to serve up omelettes at my cafe now. Thanks for reminding me.
---
I'm out of the way.  If a low level manages to survive the mire in my location, 50 caps for recipes and 76 for plans isn't asking too much.
---
you can't get anything good that way, you need all 3 alive to get the really good rewards like all the Bear Arm plans, Stimpack Diffuser and such, Formula P plan is a 2 animal drop or a rare 1 animal drop. You need all 3 alive basically to make it work.
---
I was lucky once having an amazing team and had all 3 of them alive at Max Rank 3. I had the Deathclaw, Mega Sloth, and Mirelurk King alive. Got the Bear Arm plan and was stocked!
---
Same happened when I tried my first solo not long after launch we sat at the end for over an hour trying to work it out (after 3 hours of dcs just trying to complete the thing )
---
I feel like Eminem wrote a song that sounded like this post...
---
It does, spoiled veggies give a 10% hunger satisfaction.... I've lived off them and lead belly for about a year now
---
I have a character that I swap the guerilla and gunslinger perk cards on.
---
My bloodied gauss pistol is perfect for just about everything. When I’m hunting scorchbeasts, I swap to guerilla and my bloodied ffr 10mm powerful automatic.
---
Well I made probably 50 torsos before I got unyielding. Then I did about 15 legs and got one right and one left. And one of the legs was a single star...so..not what I wanted but better than nothing. It's just the RNG gods screwing with us. Don't forget to put on your Super Duper perk card...it's helped me get a few more items while crafting.
---
wow, i never seen that. I know that glowing piles bug the spawns but never heard of a freeze bug.
---
Yeah, I eat a lot of Mothman Omlettes they are a great source of protein and have so much supply near my house.
---
Yep, that's the one I found. And yes, I totally agree that it should be able to apply paint to. But I didn't want to get my Hope's up unless they had confirmed that it was going to be compatible.
---
Says he's defending low levels but really is just trying to debase anyone who doesn't play the game exactly the way he wants them to. Smooth.
---
I never take that perk off haha that is god tier
---
Got it st grafton steel right? On the raider mission with rara little girl
---
i mean the key is to keep people playing and staying every day. keeping their numbers up and interested for future atom shop items. they're making money with Fallout 1st already and have the deal with Microsoft with Game Pass making money for them an Xbox. This isn't Wall Street where "greed is good".
---
Explosive laser/plasma guns.  I’m pretty sure all of them.
---
What would u recommend on perception?
---
I wouldn't be surprised if the bunker was tiny and they made you pay real money to get a bigger one
---
Congratulations!! I’m so glad. I heard someone’s horror story that it cut out after they killed the sentry bot and they had to do the whole thing over again.
---
The next quest was kind of easy as I remember, but I was a level 90 around then haha. I really like to do side quests so I very rarely do a main quest line one after another ... in fact, I’m not even done the base game’s main quest haha. So no shame in that. Vault raid was slightly challenging, pack a lot of ammo and health items.
---
Yeah it must have something to do with high dps builds and multiple players using them.
---
I have complained so much about bloodied and junkies i don't want to do it here.
---
Just dailies
---
No only Daily Challenges it starts tomorrow after the Daily Challenges reset
---
Hi bud it is the Urban Scout armor mask then I have on the ghillie suit paint on all my armor and on my helmet
---
Maybe my character switched places with her evil twin because it just doesn’t add up.
---
I keep a 3 so I can lockpick when I want. Also allows you to use glow sighted, butchers bounty, and a few other decent odd cards.
---
Beckley and killing the SBQ. ;_;
---
*"This isn't Wall Street where "greed is good"* Not from a players standpoint, but from a company as greedy as them? That's another story. They have been adding more are more monetization elements to the game as the time passes. And more will come i guarantee you.
---
they are like any weapon. no restrictions (sans level pre 50)
---
That being said.  It's really a matter of perk cards that dictate your weapon of choice. Bow builds exist, they are rare though.  I can make all the bows/crossbows. I have a choice 3\* in stash.  I never use them though. I have been thinking about it.
---
Yup same!! Lol we must have a similar play style. I don’t even think I’m anywhere near completing the main quest line either.
---
Pretty sure you intended to say that you CAN get it to drop if you buy from a player and learn the plan.  
---
Don't want OP to have an aneurysm trying to figure this whole thing out lol.
---
You can sell and trade them. 👍
---
New players, being the goof balls they are, will likely enjoy and “play” around this camp.
---
Because I take pride in my vending and value my time more than that. Try telling me money is not important when you run out of ammo while getting your shit pushed in my a hoard of glowing ghouls. Also the in-game economy has its own pricing structure and its pretty reasonable. Me selling things for what they are worth enables me to have a permanent full stock of serums @ 399 ea and enables me to never run out of ammo and expiriment with camp building/crafting/cooking. 
---
That being said every other day I pick 3-4 lucky noobs and drop them batches of super stims and radaway. 
---
Additionally, if you are lazy and really dont try making caps, you will be broke. But if you do the daily 1400, keep travel agent equipped, and sell things people actually want, you will be upset cause you will need to find ways to waste money so you don't lose out on further sales when you hit max.
---
Because it makes sense
---
Possibly had a buff of some kind or another.  Not enough to go out and survive long in just a haz mat suit.
---
Probably just some BS synthetic. Nothing organic I’m sure.
---
they used to be easier to get before legendary run.. Ill tell you that
---
The legacy stuff was broken and most guns fire to many bullets and do to much damage.
---
The Two shot Explosive plasma Gatling is the most common offender with obscene damage for real no reason. 
---
People have pointed out it doesn't work on the queen but this might be a temporary fix due to the legacy weapons.
---
They could probably make the excess days be caps / bullion / scrip and people may be just as happy alternating between the three. Definitely would have to implement this in Season 2, and even then, they're going to have to eliminate all XP farming hacks / exploits before they set that up.
---
Some people definitely went God mode and just farmed like crazy to get to the end.
---
That's not true at all. It's random and you would think out of all the bugs this would be the easiest to fix, their code must be a steaming pile.
---
That's awesome, thank you
---
I only share "Strange in Numbers" and nothing else just because of this. Not everyone has the same build. I really don't think people know this happens?
---
You can still wear armour, just gotta wait until it breaks so you have no damage resistance but keep the legendary effects
---
The long scope does. Increases 1%
---
This, please.
---
I’ve created it a challenge, use as few bullets as possible to launch a nuke (no stealth-boys, stimpacks or glitches). So far I’m down to 15 (.45)
---
Sorry to go off on tangent, but just moved my camp for the first time...Fallout is my time sink!
---
If that's the one event where you have to go through like a concrete tunnel thing where there's just radiation galore I tried once but I'm not equipped enough to go through there without becoming a ghoul myself......One day I will no longer be a level 23 noob
---
Alright calm down no need to write a paragraph
---
Awesome!! 
---
When it says watoga vendors means the station and shopping plaza vendors?
---
not yet.. Im going to give it a shot once legendary perks go live
---
Not in public teams only private
---
They did add two more daily challenges for the rest of the season, here's hoping those don't get bugged too. I've lost over 2500 SCORE to this bug.
---
It's really up to your interpretation on how "hard" they are to obtain but I can tell you that there's a limit on how many you can get now.
---
God, I do miss him! I miss his howl.
---
I blame the Gourmands
---
There are quite a few of atoms you can earn on one-time world challenges, but after that, they are scarce.
---
If you're on PS4 my friends could help :)
---
I got formula p plan from 1 animal and it wasn’t even max level
---
Ghillie nuke
---
Mine too! I’ve moved my CAMP like 3 times I think? And I’ve been playing since launch (but took a long break which is why I’m only level 139). I first built a tiny cabin by a lookout tower and then moved it to the Ash Heap, where I then built it into a 3 story “hotel.” Now I have a bed-breakfast-bar in the forest. Camp building is my end game actually. Future builds I want to do include a frat house, a motel, and a houseboat.
---
Hey mate! Today I logged in and surprisingly my atoms were increased by almost 400. Those were around the numbers missing. So, jokes apart, I really appreciate that you informed it and it got fixed. Thank you!
---
there’s a word for this: the tetris effect
---
Hey, I love it too!
---
I think it’s fun, but I feel like I’m grinding experience more than I really like.
---
Sludge lung and Zeta Holotape
---
Are
---
Glitched for me.
---
How accurate is this price check?
---
I just picked the first legendary in my stash, which has been there for months now, and apparently its worth upwards of 20k caps.
---
I would have no doubt eventually just traded it in for scrip. Lol.
---
I share field medic, I figure everyone can benefit from fast healing
---
That's not bad. I remember keeping mine at 60 but had very good cooling (lapped and using coolabs liquid pro). I'd see that issue pop up testing high temps. It looks like white dots, happened in all games.
---
I run amd nowdays, don't have any issues but still keep it low- target 65 on my current
---
Boot for constant music over your mic.
---
Really anything ultra rare, but it appears to be stabilizing for now with some items imo jumping back up to pre-dupe prices. 
---
Lots of legacy gatlings plasmas, lots of explosive bloodied/junkies. All rare outfits including red asylum dress and tattered field jacket. Cowboy outfits, hunters long coat etc. Plans include croc backpack (think that price is damaged for a while) and treasure hunter/insurgent/gorillas etc non atomic fasnacht masks. 
---
Other than that I haven't noticed any kind of crash or huge failures yet. Lots of traders hoarding but spreadsheet boys gonna spreadsheet.
---
Yes, you do need to collect at least one piece of ore to succeed. Which makes the mission almost impossible to do solo.... you could run in, grab a couple of chunks and spend the rest of your time defending. I don't stick around if there are less than three people attending though.
---
“Get me pictures of Mothman!”
---
Perhaps because at time of your post...about 5p EST on a Wed....  most of the country is still (theoretically) at work?
---
Every week in this house, mate. Wink wink.
---
Will do, thank you for the advice. Ill let you know how it goes after i get through it tonight
---
Most of my plans are cheap but a few are hard to find and help me buy other hard to find plans
---
Value is what you are willing to pay or accept. It varies world to world. There really is no standard. i.e., I've seen Marsupial Serum go for 250-15k. So it's what ever is your tolerance.  There is a pretty huge influx of new players on pc &amp; xbox because of MS Gamepass. That I think has more of an impact, fresh perspective.
---
It applies to the group if shared  regardless of proximity
---
I have not personally, only assisted, but it was a while ago on a different character. I’m currently only level 53 I think but my husband plays with me sometimes and he’s a 200 ish. I just lack the gear on the toon I’ve been playing lately but I am actually planning to use him as a mule for one of my better guns now that I can use it. I was determined to get to 50 without main quests to get beginner rewards at a higher level (and I’m obsessed and play the shit out of every Fallout title to an embarrassing degree).
---
"not long after launch..." 🤣
---
If on PC, add me Loot.Bag, i have several nice bows.. including Junkies, Furious, Executioners, etc.
---
Unless they added it to the model and gave themselves a whole headache of issues no, these are recolors of the original that was available before
---
He’s creepy and then after a while he gets annoying to the point you just wanna find out if there’s a organic counterpart and hunt it down to shoot it in the face
---
Unfortunately there are at least a half-dozen sites that report to be wikis. And I’m not discounting it all being my imagination that my modifiers on loot are better when I’m pushing luck hard.
---
I do know about the pie though. It’s a ridiculous convoluted math problem. [Polygon’s got the details](https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/18/18684042/fallout-4-perfectly-preserved-pie-chance) on Fallout 4. 76 is based on so much of that game, it would be surprising if they changed it.
---
Its fun. Not gonna be as much damage as almost any other weapon type, but on the plus side has access to legacy laser pistols. 
---
I'm doing a non bloodied/junkies builds where I have pistols for every occasion - anti mutant, anti ghoul (which tbh are also "mutated" humans, stupid game) anti scorched, anti robot and anti armor for those bugs, because exterminators is pah!
---
*bruh I said not to spoil it.* jk
---
Meat week is on going anytime Loot.Bag is online.
---
Yeah that is completely possible.
---
I don't. And I have a anti armor fixer 3*
---
That's what happenes when you dont return the infinity stones....
---
Weirdly enough, I've seen a few vendors selling a Jet recipe, so it's in the game *somewhere*, or at least was.
---
No limit of distance for the user of the perk. Team mates only benefit if it is shared.
---
I'm literally right on that one.
---
Just claimed the x-01 paint
---
Mine is just across the rail bridge from Watoga Station. Using a couple missile turrets I don’t normally get smacked too hard.\
---
Lots of sentry bots &amp; mirelurk queens roll through those train tracks. If you set up your defenses properly (or build under the mesh as suggested earlier) you shouldn’t have much of a problem and will enjoy some good drop materials.\
---
Edit:sp
---
I can’t wait until we can get perk loadouts. I’d love to use gunslinger on my main if we didn’t have to monotonously switch the perk cards back and forth. Right now I have a Q E 250 western, AA E 15vats .44 , and a j ffr 10mm
---
I start a public team myself anymore, just to avoid the luffagus. If my friends on, kick to make room. People join that's fine. Been in a couple teams where the team capt has issues.. Like mental issues.
---
Almost Heaven? West Virginia!
---
Sounds like a fun build. What pistols do you use?
---
Just spam collect dirty or toxic water. That's how I usually give myself a little bump
---
These for sure. 
---
Seems everyone has an explosive plasma now.
---
I have a one star vampire gatling that is my go to gun for everything.  I have other vampire and three stars but I still love that one gun.
---
no no, the spawn point usually has a wendingo
---
Yeah I think I checked 2 of the supposed wikis haha. It's hard to get info on this game.
---
If luck just effects critical generation and loot durability then that kinda sucks, I think it should have some other effect as well. Loot quantity would make sense.
---
Then if some irradiated guy come in you public team and 30 minutes later your CAMP get nuked that was me 🤣
---
So let's count some numbers:
---
- Normal Backoack gives you +60 Carry Weight
---
- A Chemist Backpack gives you +60 Carry Weight 
---
- A High Capacity Backpack gives you +120 Carry Weight
---
- Strong Back Lv.3 gives you +30 Carry Weight
---
Your suggesting that we downgrade to a Chemist Back and grab the Strong Back Lv.3 just to lose out on +30 Carry Weight in order to deter the Energy Resistance debuff we get for using the Hight Capacity Backpack? 
---
No thanks I will keep using my High Capacity Backpack along with Traveling Pharmacy Lv.3 and just use the Grounded mutation to more than make up for the Energy Resistance debuff we get for using the Hight Capacity Backpack.
---
You can grab a hazmat suit at the entrance or in the room to the left and breeze through through radiation
---
As a guy who runs with 5 different shotguns I agree, my double barrel needs some love
---
This is the exact reason I use a bloodied pa build. Rads rarely effect me enough while I'm in my X-01 set. If I get around 90% rads I just use a radaway diluted.
---
Good luck man. I gave my brother mine for free and he was a dick. Had to pay 2k caps to get it back. Lmao
---
Life imitating art. Welcome to the **Wastelands...**
---
When the green ship reaches the end, it’s over. I’ve been grinding the dailies and weeklies everyday. I’m a level 49. Right behind the ship. Just a few ahead of me.I’ve missed a bunch of challenges from auto completing and receiving no score.
---
If you have any plans to buy atoms you should consider fallout first.
---
Sold every kind if junk for 1c when i first got into vending, mainly to clear stash. As an explorer / driftor character materials never were a problem for me. Now vending is a big motivator for me, always try to improve my stock, make good offers and make visiting my vendors worth it. 
---
I can give away some junk for 1c each, like oil or springs, but a lot of materials are a much rarer find. For example circuits, crystal, screws, gold and cork are 3 caps. I just can't justify to sell those for 1cap, sorry.
---
I sell most junk for 2caps: adhesive, aluminium, silver, acid. Still looking for a reasonable price for ballistic fibre, i sold it for 20caps, but went down to 12 when i found a reliable source. If my source is dry, my prices for fibre go up, changing on a daily basis.
---
I had a lot of recipes for 1cap, but those ended up as a waste of vendor space. So i gave them to a random low level player. I always have level 20 fixers and lvl 15 hardened hand rifles stocked for a low price, also modded raider and marine underarmor. But that's as generous as it gets nowadays. 
---
Ammo is 1cap each, but i only sell .45, 5.56, 50. cal. My 308 and shotgun shells sit for ages, but sell eventually. 100% fusion core are 45caps. My shop is cheaper than 85% of all vendors i visit, but i am only level 70 and still need lots of caps to refine my own character.
---
If that happened to me that time I definitely would have had trouble stomaching a fourth go lol. Yeah I like to bop around too and get so excited when I find a side quest! That's the beauty of Bethesda games and part of why we put up with all the glitches.
---
I agree. Hit 100 earlier today, still has some daily and a couple of the weekly to finish off and they didn’t vanish from my list so I did them anyway but nothing rewarded. Should definitely be something there even if it’s just 5 caps. A token gesture to say ‘you crazy sob, thanks for playing’.
---
There's been a bug for awhile. They're supposedly fixing in the next patch. I missed at least 3-4 weeks of sales.
---
Does the clock actually work or no? If you look at the pictures in the item preview, the clock hands show different times on each picture.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hjynjl/summer_roadmap_looks_pretty_interesting/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Found it, np!
---
Atom shop stuff mostly. Contemporary bundle gets you prewar looking construction plans. There's a green house, a bungalow, a log cabin, a train, a shack, lots of prewar looking prefab buildings, but from atom shop.
---
You can always build your camp AT a prewar building and integrate the building to your camp.
---
Some Grind, some pay. Like any game, there will always be those ahead of you.  If you did just the daily/weeky's, you should be around the low 50's of the gameboard (from day 1) . I THINK. There was a graphic posted about it, but I didnt' save it.  The green ship is part of the story, nothing happens when you pass it.  You should be right around that ship area, yeah.
---
Really wish I could slap that screaming eagle handmade skin on there...or quite literally anything.  I would be happy just to make it look like a regular combat rifle at this point though I don't want to give them terrible atom shop ideas lol.
---
Sad day in fixerville
---
Yeah I’m thinking I may bite the bullet and do it. I have enough pistol to do it, and it will be powerful enough to deal with most every enemy in the game with the gs perks.. and I will just carry around my J FFR gauss minigun for the harder/boss enemies.
---
Oh the 'Bethesda Support' is my last option , but it's definitely on the table. Just trying to avoid it since its annoying.
---
I will keep on trying the going in and out of the door' fix, but for a much longer time. See if it works for me today. * crosses my fingers * - thanks for the help tho. I do appreciate it.
---
Squad maneuvers is good too as it is a boost to movement speed in groups
---
Are you asking for buildings on the map that you can place the camp down and use or are there plopables?
---
Try looking at Discord Group Recruitment posts on Fallout76Factions subreddit.
---
I do it when someone shares canibal perk. And if I am not the leader I join another team or make mine. So maybe they do it bcz of shared perk. With herd mentality mut i dont want to play without team.
---
They are done because they combine EXP benefits and farm Exp. Especially during the double XP events +  another 100% lunchboxes etc, people took advantage of these and rushed it.
---
And no, the green ship is ZORBO and you are the red rocket. Each day, ZORBO moves by one tile forward. When he reaches the final destination, the season is over.
---
I'm sure nobody know for sure, but if I saved the weekly challenges until it starts would they be doubled?
---
Lmao I spewed my sprite at this one
---
Also the ZAX supercomputer that is the overseer at Vault 51 has a quite unsettling voice and attitude. Only found in Nuclear Winter as far as I know.
---
Thank you I didn’t know where to start with finding others
---
No please, that would be even worse than aqua boy/girl (which prevents bloodied builds to drink Toxic Goo).  
---
Or at least see if there is any bloodied build in your team first...
---
Not there yet, around 62 now, will probably finish way early also at this rate. It's a great idea to keep people motivated to play. I can just imagine the posts about how people who are behind won't be able to get it tho.
---
It should just revert back to atoms like it was before after you're finished with seasons imo.
---
Damn 🙁
---
Thats the spirit! Pistols are fun for 99% of the game, and when you see a biggo, cheat and bring out an OP gun xD
---
My psn is giddy-reed1. I was banned in the last ban wave so made a new account level 101 now. I like to shop and visit camps and troll sometimes. I don’t have a mic but will probably get one soon. Add me if you’d like
---
you can't be keeping everyone alive during prep
---
&gt;but its interesting that you dont want this for the future fallout games i take it you want that solo lone wanderer experience where your the dude that saves everyone or the evil dude that slays everyone.
---
I do think the lone wanderer experience kinda fits the tone of Fallout.  
---
Having said that, I'm not opposed to concept of multiplayer spinoffs (I love single player TES games, but I still enjoy ESO) but in *this* case, I feel like too much was sacrificed on the RPG-side of things in return for a multiplayer, live service that just isn't really fleshed out.
---
And yeah, it'd be great if this game got the kind of attention from it's publisher that ESO does.  I might not want it taking the place of single player Fallout games, but I do think there's space for an online experience.
---
I got same one well kinda i dont have 25% less vats cost but dont rly care about it too much lol
---
I know of a couple. There's a small one on the road near Charleston Fire Department, one near the relay tower by Flatwoods and one just east of Clarksburg Shooting Club.
---
Most of the depreciation in value is not associated with more weapons being introduced into the game, its duper’s trying to get rid of the stock before the ban wave comes. Thus most of these items values will come back to pre dupe levels fairly soon. 
---
For example, BE25 and BE+1agi handmades we’re duped to extreme levels but stil hold roughly the same value as before. Changes to demolition expert did more to hurt these weapons value than duping did.
---
To me, he’s not unsettling from the surface. But when you figure out what he did previously, you look at him as more than just an AI with an attitude.
---
I got both after 6 months of grinding.
---
Settlement building was my main draw from Fallout 4. Greygarden, Sanctuary, Greentop, The Castle &amp; Far Harbor were **so** much fun. Stupid mobs kept getting in the way of my building activities! In FO76, it's funny how your ideas expand as new elements are unlocked. I moved from just outside Morgantown to Savage divide near Cliffwatch. If you are on PS4 it would be cool to visit your hostel. Safe travels RunWithBluntScissors
---
I’ve only done it once, and I agree it’s pretty fun. Though it does need at least a team of 4 players to keep the ghouls at bay, but man it’s an awesome source of XP. I think I leveled up 3 times during that single run! :D
---
I wish they’d add the normal color version to atom shop
---
Damn, thats always a good sell.
---
Right. They’re rare drops man.
---
Dailies.
---
Thank you guys for that information and the hunt is over I can use my key cards.
---
happening randomly occasionally for me too. no idea why, i have full ap when it happens.
---
Sure man
---
I have 2k on an other character interested in selling
---
awesome, I'll be keeping my eyes out for a good comp bow, then. and ye ye, I figured they'd be more rare at the v least, they seem less meta than your typical guns lol. but, I've been interested to try them out, after playing rifleman for so long. so had to know if searching for an instigating comp bow from vendors/the market subreddit would lead anywhere XD
---
Lol yeah me too buddy, me too
---
Not really into discord
---
I think everyone would appreciate another gun addition.
---
I’ve fixed it before. If you find he’s not there, go down and have a conversation with the Dutchess. Then trade with her. Go back upstairs and he’ll be there. It’s worked for me.
---
Yes it does, good way for Bloodied Builds to maintain their health below 19%.
---
Sometimes it takes some mistakes to learn, don't be afraid to fail!
---
-signed, a failure.
---
All clocks are stoped at the same time in the fallout world. The tone the bombs fell. So yes this clock is stuck at this time. The second hand keeps trying to tick forward but it fails.
---
I usually run the power up events before and get the lead and steel from a few other workshops while in a private server. It lets me keep around 50 at all times. I let it drop to 10 or so then do it again.
---
Just do what I do and leave mid claiming, they have to reclaim the workshop and waste caps, it’s the best you can do.
---
Strong Pass.
---
Damn I didn't realize that I just teleported to a high level that was there and damn near died in a few minutes.....lol
---
It seems, on the official trading sub, prices have somewhat stabilized after everyone initially freaked out.
---
Of all the things they charge for bypassing like score rank, I would gladly buy a NW item bundle. I hate BRs
---
I appreciate the offer, but I’m running a full set of unyielding scout armor.
---
Do you have to collect the key fragments before you attempt to launch it or can you just go the site and type in the code from Nukacrypt?
---
Also it provides power for surrounding area workshops, like the food generator.
---
I do as well. I do certain things on private; when I dont' want interruptions or sharing :) That's how I do my lucky hole runs :)
---
Ran across a camp built around the house south of the Nuka plant, the one with a roach on the toilet. They did a really great job! It was creasing and cool at the same time.
---
You can still make a post there. LFG. On the Reddit.
---
Today was the worst. Level 4s at SBQ, people turning off the jukebox at Silent Night so it fails, chasing me around the map trying to open trade windows, some guy in my public group came into my camp and started spam throwing bait bombs. I could go on and on.
---
Back to private servers again :(
---
For some reason, how you hack certain terminals makes the enemies that would spawn in the room to agro to the previous ones. Often times enemies won’t even enter the final room, minus the ones already residing there, some go and some stay. Those are usually what I spend my bullets on
---
Nope. Hoping the grey version is atom or expansion quest stuff down the line
---
If they didn't push people into it that didn't want to be there the people that played it would actually participate. But, if you say so.
---
It doesn't always have the snallygasters as sometimes it has mutants
---
Thanks I'll try that
---
If you are on Xbox, I can spin up the private world and i can help you through the plants and generators to get started.
---
He makes a comment when you first met him how he comes off is "off putting" to humans and "that works just fine for me" as he doesn't think he needs to change his the approach to people in order to get things done.
---
***We're coming for you...***
---
One underappreciated aspect of 1st, scrap box and tent get all the glory, but avoiding sharing is a great thing.
---
Got to that part and I was like “yup, you’re more than off putting bud”
---
"Getting your shit pushed in" 🤣
---
Sorry, for some reason that really made me laugh!
---
Us: Is it a bug or a feature?
---
Bethesda: ....yes.
---
Some people cheated, the double xp &amp; the lunchboxes helped out a lot. I'm up to about level 60 &amp; all I can suggest is kill super mutants &amp; scorchbeasts as much as possible, have a high intelligence character for extra xp(perfect for a heavy gunner build), don't forget to log in this weekend for double daily score &amp; just keep going as its just been confirmed that there will be 9 daily challenges for the rest of the run.
---
Of course I have a typo....  flyboy* set
---
"Fine Art" ... Doesn't even know how to spell NUKES
---
I hate to break it to you but Legendaries are not unique- the entire system was in Fallout 4. 76 is just an upgraded version but the base system with attachment points and all that is all from Fallout 4.  
---
You can see them here:   [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Legendary\_weapon\_effects](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Legendary_weapon_effects)
---
Well each faction is probably guna get one so you can count those in. Mm maybe a mole miner robot. Or a mini sheepsquatch assultron. What id really like is if you could assign your companion to run a vendor. Or maybe a later update could introduce a new companion slot and a bunch of new vendors could be recruited to hang around your camp.
---
So much for thinking this was going to be an intelligent conversation.
---
That was my understanding as well but if you look at the pictures of the donut clock in the atom shop, it clearly shows the hands in different positions/times in the different pictures. Highly misleading.
---
Sent it
---
That's cool, I just hope they dont mind!
---
I had a similar situation.. but wasn't doing any building... and the watchers was a weirdo.
---
The watcher, a level 11,  had a peice of chameleon armor and tried to hide in my CAMP for about an hour, just being annoying.
---
I waved to him and gave a thumbs up each time I came to camp (you know doing quest, dropping off scrap, and legendaries) but he just sat there thinking he was invisible.
---
It got really annoying when I started to refill my vendors and he'd shoot me once, and not move to stay hidden... or shoot my while I was crafting. 
---
I even put on my mic to see what he wanted, but got no reply. Gave him the question emoji, no reply.
---
Like the fact I waved at him didn't register to him that yes I see you.
---
I eventually banned him for the session and locked my house for an hour.  (God forbid the little bush wookie was doing that to my patrons! They would think I had annoying squatter)
---
I knew I could of turned off pacifist, but I take no pleasure in wasting my time to kill someone 176 levels below me.
---
No, clearly stating “double dailies”. Would be weird or a bug even for weeklies to be included. Plus I’m sure those who completed weeklies already would raise all hell for Bethesda.
---
If you are sneaking and Hidden you can't target in VATS. Need the red dot on your compass. If that isn't the issue then, weird.
---
Low levels don't come to my camp, I'm too far out in the bog. I'm plenty generous to them, though, leaving heaps of drugs and plans and healing items and the occasional legendary in random containers throughout the forest for them to find. low level camps get some protective under armor, healing items and any plans i have on me as well. and when i can keep them from running away from me, noobs get bespoke armor and weapons made and modded to their level. I can afford to do this because i charge what my stuff is worth in my vendors.
---
Doesn't it depend on how many chems you're carrying?
---
Thanks I knew there was a food but couldn't remember lol
---
IRL even a baby could take 10 screws out of a toaster, and literally every hone appliance, mechanical device and guns have it in them. FO4 made much more sense, where (forcme at least) adhesives were the biggest need. I can understand lack of adhesives on the quality you'd need it 200 years after shtf but screws 25 years later?
---
Thanks for the info.
---
Gas pumps are so necessary. How can you have a proper filling station without them?
---
One what, house?
---
Now let’s hope they grant atoms to us to make up for auto-completing challenges so we can buy the equivalent tiers
---
Please read our wiki page on this subject
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
Yeah but if it's in your build menu I dunno. You gotta power it, maintain it, empty it etc. I don't think it's cheating and I'm pro Bethesda, anti dupe etc.
---
Duping large quantities of ammo is totally different imo. This is only exploiting a build menu in a CAMP and making it how you normally would, the exception being you don't get an annoying defend the workshop event every hour. 
---
I say go for it.
---
Nah I gave him a thumbs up after they finished and left. Just stopped by to buy some ammo and saw this creation taking place
---
I've seen lots of new people for the last couple of weeks because of game pass. no significant uptick since the ban wave last week though.
---
It happened to me today as well, I logged out and closed game around 10:50. Turned it back on loaded up about 10 minutes after reset. Only showed 5 dailies total, I thought strange they lowered it is usually a lot more. It didn't show 4/9 complete like usual.
---
After fast travel I checked map and sure enough 4 of them already complete. *sigh*
---
Why do you want me to bang my knees OP?
---
Yes please. I need some stuff for an arcade themed camp
---
Oh great I had zero issues till now, and looks like it will happen daily to me now with their "new fix".
---
Oh shit, for whatever reason I thought the HC mod gives only 75 carry weight. Wtf I'm missing out lol
---
XB1 for me.
---
make yourself some high level friends who can be your muscle lol. or get fallout 1st to safely and grief free farm workshops all day long. 14 bucks a month isn't much to pay for that, imo.
---
eta: or get a friend who has 1st, then use their private server to farm
---
I love Modus. His character was really well done and he’s basically an old friend at this point whenever I head down to the bunker.
---
Probably Junkies shotgun.
---
I barely ever sold 5.56 but always fusion cells. :D But I guess it depends on ppl on your server.
---
That does seem to happen on a regular basis.
---
Not to be a grammar nazi, but check your title's wording
---
What console?
---
Actually yes you're right. His death scene wasn't even bloody
---
I had the same problem 2 weeks in a row, but not this week.  here is what i did.
---
1)  submit tickets to Bethesda support
---
2)  an hour before when your dailies reset, log out of the game.  i am on xbox so what i do is load up a couple of other games just to be safe.  sometimes i leave another game running during that time.
---
3)  wait at least 30 minutes until after the reset time to load up the game.  once in the game load up, choose adventure 1st, nothing else, don't check the atom shop.  let the game load completely, textures and all.  then check your challenge lists
---
as soon as i started doing this i haven't had any issues
---
srsly, I've had the 'level up five times' stick at 4/5 for months. I've leveled like 100 times since then.
---

---
I hoard the clipboards at work. It's sad...
---
So only I get the bonus experience if I have it equipped unless I'm sharing it?
---
I just stumbled across one not far south down the road from Lady Janets Soft Serve in the Forrest region. I think it’s a random encounter.
---
ironically, from other vending machines :)
---
That's cool! I really love beautiful/cool well thought out CAMPs. You can tell when someone spent a few hours and knows all the building tricks.
---
I really love themed camps, came across a comic book store called Komicks (I think the owner was a communist, his scrapbot was lol). It had walls full of comic books and board games on display, it was really fun.
---
I also have seen some really cool bars.
---
Agreed fully.
---
u/Ladydevann
---
I think powerplants have lvl 3 terminals... Poseidon have one at the left door, and then when you enter there is second one as well.
---
Functional freezers for storing perishables, like the ice box but zero decay in condition.
---
Flamethrower turret.....
---
Free stuff bin....you know for giving away stuff you dont want but at the same time want to someone (low level) enjoy it...I give away empty power armor suits to newbie with a power core.
---
Ammo cans (maybe loadable)
---
Armor displays
---
Robot farmer for crops
---
New enemies normally spawn for me near each of the quarterly increments and head straight to trying kill my launch team
---
I had one of these and the disappointing part was the furious effect will wear off the second you miss a direct hit, meaning you can't shoot the ground to arc a shot, you have to aim carefully.
---
Perfect thank you!
---
Bullion and scrip as rewards, and atoms. All the limited daily stuff would be great.
---
The one that gives extra exp while in group?
---
Ha! But seriously all I can say is flames are supposed to work but don’t. Bashing with a flamer or striking with a skishkabob with flame jets DOES work. The shishkabob weighs Ghana flamer, uses no fuel and has a much quicker swing.
---
Personally I like to throw on travel agent but it's definitely not the best... 
---
I know there's a perk where you share mutations or something, and another where you get bonus XP when in a group
---
Holy..... I only just hit level 50.....
---
Another poster posted all the locations, thanks!
---
Tried the Watoga Vendors, no luck
---
Depends, if you have the charisma do inspirational. If you only have a 3 charisma do scrapper
---
what
---
Not to mention you wasted Gold Bullion to get that Backpack Chemist Mod
---
Yep. It would be nice to be able to sell cooked items and veg and meat to the foodbuilds.
---
Just you unfortunately, I’m on Xbox as well and haven’t had any issues ever with it.
---
The gauss rifle has one
---
I personally share, "Strange in Numbers". I need that boost :)  but I like when someone shares any Luck, that gives higher crits/dmg. :)
---
People are making it more complicated than it actually is. There's no second timer, people are saying the whole 'turn it in as late as possible' as their own personal preferrence because it means they get more XP from kills or less difficult spawns since once the machine is almost full of ore, much harder enemies spawn.
---
How the actual game works is simple, collect 100 ore while keeping all the scavengers alive. If you collect all 100 ore you get the top tier prize. That's it, no second timer, everything else is just preferrence from other players.
---
And yes, I did mean that if I turn it too late and realize no one else has collected. I read about players liking it when you turn in at the last moment so when I had a good group going I tried that, only to notice that no one else was doing much collecting causing me to dead panic and gather the rest. I don't do that strategy anymore, unless you're playing with friends on a mic, it's best that everyone knows how much ore everyone else has, it's not worth some extra xp and the harder enemies aren't really that much harder. Kind of makes it fun, like an end game boss.
---
I suggest just playing it simple. Collect ore when you can (and when enough players are protecting the scavengers), put it in the machine once you're done, and keep the scavengers alive. No need to get fancy.
---
Yeah it came out great. One of the more natural looking railway stops I've seen
---
wtf are you so salty about
---
Bear arm plan can drop from 2 animals, bear arm mods and diffuser from 3. Nothing of real value from only 1 besides xp and treasury notes.
---
I had this happen to me too. Try having lots of space around it. If space is limited the character animation can’t happen and that error pops up. At least that’s what resolved it for me.
---
I feel a suppressor for the minigun would open up for more sneak heavy builds.
---
Doesn’t the run end September 1st? That an entire month away. I don’t understand the rush. I have been doing the dailies and weeklies without touching that hack fest PUBG clone, and I’m half way through.
---
Question: when you quit the game, it goes to the main menu.  Do you have an option to exit to the dashboard?  I ask, because on Xbox, you have to hit the home button to get back to the dashboard, and the game is still running in the background.  You have to select the game and manually exit the game.  If ps4 is the same way, my thought is that if you leave the game, it still runs in the background, regardless of turning the power off to the console, since it's just in sleep mode anyway.  So, your game is still, technically, running while the reset happens.  Just my thought.
---
It works.
---
Just clip into it you'll be fine
---
Same. He’s like a bit of g-man from HL, with a splash of Legion, yet not as annoying as House was in NV. Plus the enclave uniform is soooo cool, I’m wearing it ever since I got it.
---
Why people sound mutant here
---
Thank you for the hard work. I use your site every week. I will definitely be upping my donation.
---
He’s got weird pauses and timing, makes him like a computer version of G-man
---
I play on PC. PM me for user and we can work something out.
---
I don't think so Tim
---
At this point just fire up the ol creation club format and let modders do it and everyone gets something.
---
I remember once I had a level 5 or 10 Perfect Storm I picked up somewhere. Thought I'd vendor it for super cheap with some free 10mm ammo. It got snapped up by a level 200 and so began my jaded suspicion of other players. Obviously that shit was for a noob, I'm in the forest south of the vault... Come on.
---
Since then I've seen high level players snap up gifts for noobs, pretend to be new on a low level character and laugh about all the free shit they scored, bait out attacks after the queen to kill noobs for junk, and just generally be dicks to people.
---
It's just a game so I try not to take it too seriously, but I wonder about some of these players.
---
Find a way for them to monetize it because that seems to be their biggest motivation right now.
---
Hopefully it works itself out
---
Wtf, of course no duping is better, but people didn’t steal anything, they just duped some VIRTUAL items and very likely not using them to win pvp contests or anything like that. It’s a game, who gives a f if another player gets a bloodied explosive rifle everyone knows its duped they cant really flex with that its just for fun.
---
Suspensions are adequate when you lose xp weekends and all that, but character wipes is just a lazy solution for people that never cheated before that
---
For sure I’ll pm you when I get home from work tonight
---
Inspirational.
---
I use the track lights and lit arrows on mine. I think I got them on a drop somewhere.
---
i find scrapper to be pointless, because everyone has that one. Scrapping is such a part of the game and happens so often. It would be card everyone should always just have on.  
---
Now, once they have Loadouts for perk-cards (pt 4 of season?), people wouldn't need to have it always on, but generally for now... everyone already uses scrapper, so sharing doesn't do much.
---
Dirty water works best for me, the problem is staying hidden enough! Because the moment you're spotted- not dying it hard.
---
But thanks to that the rank 1 sneak perk card in agility makes it super easy to become hidden again.
---
Gotten 3 messages from 3 people
---
Do you have any .50 cal ammo
---
Next one who asks is gonna be told to follow me back to camp where I will lure and lock them in my patented murder room.
---
Where I will laugh as I flip each switch turning on each death machine until they are crispity crunchity dicks
---
Not to mention no more train yard smash from Captainoob 😕
---
Yes.    
---
Play the game and don't worry about focusing on them. I did use up a spare gift card for this Vault-Dweller Beginner pack that came with a total of 1200 Atoms, Piper's outfit, and cap. It was worth it since at some point you can 'buy' levels during this Legendary thing.    
---
Aside from that I've never spent money on any cosmetic item. I've accumulated almost 5000 if not more in caps by playing. I've been very selective in what I get in the shop. Don't fork over real money for in-game items you'll never own. If they are going to reward you (Atoms) then be patient and amass what  you need. Then again, it is your money....
---
Chill, we were all new at some point! Especially all the 247bec86hgt865dg0 players. Craft a bunch of low level gear and ammo, and hand it over to welcome them. And don’t forget radaways and stimpacks.
---
I do the bot stop event purely for the voice acting, I'd love a collectron with similiar voice lines. I hope they expand modus in the future, he has 10 times the character of any of the wastelanders npcs.
---
People forgot this game’s crazy RNG was the real problem to begin with
---
I am a fallout1st member. The stack of atom's is about 1600 monthly, you get a private server and a scrap box that eliminates alot of your stash (storage weight concerns)
---
Its shitty you have to pay for this quality of life, but the atoms included make up for it a little since 100 atoms is about 1 dollar when buying them.
---
Any Fixer skin would sell like hot cakes at this point, but I would really like your idea.
---
"See that fella up there? You'll be seeing lots of those."
---
Currently seems to be a bug that fast travelling can reset you to 30% spawn health. It suckkkkkssssss
---
Thanks man! It actually worked, I always thought I had more than enough space but I guess I didn’t. So I had to move it to the middle of a room in my camp. And waddya know. I can repair my damn armor lol. Again, thanks
---
There's absolutely no reason not to permanently have that buff on
---
Now that makes sense. I'll just keep sucking down rads when I can. Thanks.
---
Never played half life, i don’t have a pc and my cousins have it on theirs, so I’ll play it next time I visit
---
If you really want to skip have a look into photomode in silos haha it's buggy but quick.
---
FYI. If you have crops planted at your CAMP and harvest them, they count as well.
---
It was a bug where adventure mode was awarding NW perk cards. It’s since been patched. Enjoy the free cards!
---
Someone else mentioned but grab a batch of toxic goo from west tek. It really helps to add a ton of rads quick.
---
Well that’s exciting. Lol. Thanks!
---
Laser guns at least should have a mod that makes their beam invisible, so it doesn't break stealth... It would work like a silencer. There already is a slot for such attachments (beam focuser, gyro, splitter). They could add a new one (beam converter or something) that would decrease range but turn it invisible...
---
Blacked out, unscrippable fixer PLUS a new “feature”? That would be a win win lol
---
FYI. Plants and fungi are literally everywhere. There’s no need to travel anywhere special
---
People don't like these posts now but I guarantee we'll start seeing them with hundreds of upvotes in the future once a vocal amount finish the season. 
---
    It was silly for them to give us the tools to grind or buy out the season with nothing as a backup, but considering most of the rewards are bugged it makes sense.
---
I still wish others can "view" your weapon. so you can display those rare to find guns, instead of just telling people you have them.
---
I respect the sentiment but SBQ has been around for 2 years and Imposter has been around for about a year. It’s time for some new bosses. There’s only so much they can change mechanically so some more options on where to send my nuke and which bosses to fight are definitely needed
---
And leave out a silencer for my mirv mini nuke launcher!
---
Correct
---
I would like that, except you can find a dead guy in a vault 51 suit near one of the big boi loot crates, idk if it's a random encounter, but i found him in morgan town, near the farm to on the southwestern outskirts of it
---
It's not that great, I run bloodied and I don't play it.
---
Happened yesterday for me. I changed servers and it was fixed.
---
Sneak rifle or commando is the best for endgame, I used to run power armor with heavies, happy I switched.
---
It would go well with the mg42 and the tommy gun we have. Great idea.
---
But it means we would have to add a 1911a aswell.  Id like a new gun but would settle for a 1911 skin yoj throw on the 10mm.
---
I considered that myself but remembered usually there are 4-6 snallygasters at the trainyard.
---
someone downvoted you, but I found it funny :)
---
Some great ideas, definitely agree. Right now it’s still so similar to FO4 in terms of enemies. Would love to see even more new creatures and cryptids
---
Yo what system you on? I might buy some of those off you if you are on ps4.
---
Okay so I understand that some stories are fake as in the...
---
4 guys showed up and killed me
---
Someone just fatmanned my camp
---
Someone punched my camp to prices
---
Okay we get it sucks but I can probably say that these stories probably are true...
---
However they are probably missing out the part that they tagged the person back starting pvp. At which point yes they can destroy the base. 
---
People need to learn to just ignore people punching/shooting them is they are
---
A.At Camps and B.Not looking/wanting a fight.
---
If scrapper did more than just extra wood and steel (how I miss the FO4 version!) it would be a good choice for a low level player to share. But as it is you gain almost nothing from it late game.
---
I concur. Vault 76 was a control vault in that we didn't for reals die and were let out to re populate the wasteland after a set period (where's our GECK?!)
---
But that doesn't mean that during all those years they didn't do funky stuff to us. I mean, look at how the current lore can be interpreted: some residents were so funked up by Zax that they are only NOW waking up and leaving the vault, a year after reclamation day!
---
Just went 5 minutes ago and killed a few, thanks!
---
Ahem..... 1911? Please?
---
silenced plasma rifle would be so rad.
---
silenced plasma rifle would be so rad
---
The Vault 51 overseer can also be found just south of 76 in the main game
---
MODUS is the best hope for the future of Appalachia.
---
What's funny is I actually have a sneak heavy toon. For some bizarre reason the game considers flamers stealth weapons so they don't break sneak. Nowt as discreet as setting shit on fire lol.
---
ummm, it does though. It never stops being beneficial. My point, is that it is one of those cards that should be perm for everyone.  That's how important scrapping is in the game.
---
Swan was just another Super Mutant Behemoth, was he hard?
---
Really want creepy mannequins and skeletons,   Halloween collectron,  welcome mat functionality returned,  a device that plays that creepy organ music. 
---
Halloween is gonna suck this year for alot of people help us to make a great digital experience for everyone. 
---
Really wish we could wallpaper the powered doors too. 
---
Also a double sided wallpaperable wall that doesn't require 2 foundations right next to each other. Would save so much on our camp budget.
---
Not a random encounter and that is point 1, the logs in the vault say he escaped 2108 when he first appeared there it was canonically 2102
---
that's awesome.  It's nice to have a toon to make bizarre builds with.
---
Yup I'm on ps4, what are you interested in? And what do want you want to trade for them?

I appreciate people sharing scrapper for sure but don't remember that someone is sharing it until I head into the menu to equip it because I was planning to use it.  Any situational cards I wouldn't really recommend sharing because most people are used to slapping them on when needed and then removing them, and sometimes do so without realizing it was already being shared.

Yes. Correct. Thank you.
