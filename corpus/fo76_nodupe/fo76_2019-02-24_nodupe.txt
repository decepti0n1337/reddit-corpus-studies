Because he hasn't got one? Be the change you want to see in the world bro. 
---
---
---
What?
---
It happens sometimes. Those are the best times to try claiming all the workshops
---
Why are there so many people randomly butchering Clockwork Orange quotes on this sub?
---
Lol, id like to imagine you do this IRL.
---

---
I found a players 3 story tower, where it was locked, no windows except for doorways on the top floor which had turrets blocking them. 
---
He was afk up on the top floor. 
---
I was able to place my power armor on top of his nearby water purifier, stand ontop of my pa, and manage to land on the edge in front of the turret.
---
I laid in his bed in front of him waiting for him to come back. Too bad he timed out afk, I was trying to give him some free shit!
---
It doesnt increases XP gain
---
Paddywop918 is my psn account and I'm camped on the green, which is typically safe from nukes just down from whitespring
---
Yes the patched changed it stealth nerf.
---
Calculated my hits. When you hit a ton of mobs at once, each one counts toward your durability loss. 
---
Yes. Power Fist is unarmed. 
---
No prob
---
Thanks man!
---
You should try Ark. Fucking game is a literal timegate in vanilla form.
---
If that game didn't have private servers, i would have burned a copy to a disc, just to physically break it.
---
Hinea said any "private" servers will still be through Bethesda, so I don't expect it to be as freeform as Ark's aftermarket.
---
On the plus side, 76 is 1000x a better base game than Ark.
---
I got them from Grahm 
---
 Oh goodie. There are few things more ridiculous than a man in X0-1 with a tiny knife just murdering all and sundry.
---
 I usually am in my Heavy Combat, but that is just fun.
---
"Metal Picnic Table" is sometimes available from Grahm.
---
How about some Communication with the players who are suspended? Missing fo76. How long are we suspended for...
---
How do you like heavy guns? I found stealth sniper boring after about two weeks. Switched back to melee, and now farming levels so I can get all the heavy gun perk cards so I can give it a try. 
---
No problem :)
---
Melee guy huh
---
ROFL - It's creepy when you put it that way. But ... it seems different in the game. There's almost no humans. Why not provide a resting spot for the very few who wander by.
---
What's your GT?
---
Talons, Twisted muscles, Adrenal reaction. All will buff unarmed.
---
Hey I’m on ps4 about to launch it, you down?
---
Yup, this happens every other night, and I love it. A few days ago, I traded with and befriended another player, he asked me to join him on another server because, "they are about to nuke the prime fissure here", I joined, and after 15 minutes I was alone there, no nuke no nothing. But a Whitesprings with a high legendary drop rate and good drops at Watoga, too. Perfect night!
---
The go-to fusion core locations tend to be power armors found behind locked areas. There's a reliable one I hit up if someone I'm grouped with mentions that they're running low. The other option is to keep and eye out for and scout out claimed power stations. If someone has the fusion core machine producing make a mental note. If while playing you see that it goes from claimed to unowned, (they might be done for the night or got booted from server) fast travel nearby and claim the workshop. It's a pretty lazy way to play, but if you're on at odd hours you'll net quite a bit of fusion cores with nothing sacrificed other than cost of caps to fast travel and claim workshop.

I'm on xbox too. same GT as my reddit profile. look me up
---
*exercising.  'Exorcising' is what you do to demons.
---
Yeah All Rise seems to break super fast for me. My two shot revolver can last me entire sessions sometimes but All Rise gets busted so often I have to make a conscious effort to check it before it breaks. Luckily melee weapons repair for so cheap.
---
LOL me mad on the internet hah. Think it's more so the fact I have to accept this world is full of sheer idiots. 
---
Thanks for the quick response! My psn name is soulmates69 (my girlfriend and I share an account) .  When I get a chance, I will look you up. Do you do mods and things like that too? Like jet pack? And do you have/offer mods on regular armor? Like muffled/shadowed? Sorry for all the questions. Thank you in advance. 
---
I used to be a Xbox player, you shouldn't have been a dick in messages NO MATTER WHAT. Xbox is basically a kindergarten class.
---
I place a craft station on either side of a window so players can glitch in and have a rest and wrk on their gear. Keeps the baddies out but helps out other players. 
---
The drop rate! I forgot to mention that...it was insanely higher than normal for legendaries 
---
My teammate locks his doors cause hoards can open unlocked doors and get inside, and it has worked for him so far! I use a garage door, which for me also stops hoards, but I also don't mind people stopping by and taking a peek inside lol. Plus if you have the marsupial mutation, you can access my balcony door via my water purifiers lol
---
Only time my turret shot at anything, was when i was a low lvl in flatwoods, it killed cats :(
---
I feel sorry that no one reacted to your post you probably put some effort in.
---
Non power armor, as well as ranged weapons both are really underpowered atm. Hope you have success with your build!
---
I'm sorry but Master Chief needs all the ammo he can get. For shame. Cortana is not going to like this.
---
40% faster swing speed, its epic
---
It's okay I'd say it's almost identical to warframe with warframe having more content probably. Anthem has a big world but it's pretty empty.
---
If you like looter shooters and the idea of flying around it's okay fun, but def not the next big thing to me atleast. I've ran across a few glitches and bugs so far but nothing game breaking. Overall its decent fun but if your one of the people who really want a  great product for your 60 dollars anthems not it imo.
---
What ever happened to Swingin' on a Star and Tumbling Tumbleweeds? I haven't heard them in MONTHS.
---
I leave my door unlocked but please people leave my bone chimes alone. They are there for a reason and that reason is not for you to disarm. 
---
Killed her today with about 7 or 8 other people. We all went through pretty much our entire ammo stashes to take her down. It was a bit ridiculous.
---
Considering how badly all guns have been nerfed with the TSE nerf (seriously, I lost like 70 damage on my Two Shot Combat Rifle and am now looking for a new build), buffing the SBQ just seems counterproductive.
---
What weapon were you using?
---
I do know that the team is aware of this issue and it hasn't been dropped, but I'll make a note and try to follow it up on Monday. Thank you for bringing this up mate

---
Idk but that's where I go too
---
What I think they should do is find the top 100 build item mods on Beth.net and/or nexus, pay the mod authors and transfer those items over. Let us download more then 2 damned gigs of extras and go to town. 
---
G2M, Thematic and Practical, Kuro Tab, and CVC Dead Wasteland alone would be great. 
---
Make shift warrior helps a ton. 
---
Lol actually no! But I don't seem to go through nearly as many as I farm.  At level 76, I use a bolt action combat sniper rifle (.308) but I run with 5* of that rifle durability perk and generally sneak though enemies unless I really need to fight, and at that, I only take shots with the stealth damage bonus so I don't even shoot that much. I pretty much ignore bullet sponges like SB unless I really have to, and I do actually take *every* screw I see, so I'm always way ahead on screws (like 200 or so). I also never craft more at a workshop that they give me to craft with and my camp is boring.
---
Actually though, when the fight is easy enough I usually do just suffer through melee with no perks to save on ammo and rifle durability (vampire assaultron blade with 40% swing speed increase so I get some health back too).
---
&gt;Open your mind, not your mouth.
---
Translation: you're telling the truth, and renownedly the truth is hated and can put you in trouble and that is why I deny it, to follow the insane rules of those in power for the sake of comfort at the expense of telling things as they are. Hypocritical fuck. 
---
You just proved my point indisputably, thanks.   
---
Lol never criticise women. Sure sure. Very FAIR, very JUST. 
---
Does you notice it taking effect? maybe it's just a display problem. If it is broken, i'm disappointed, Adrenal reaction and EP?
---
Yeah he came to my base and ducking kinda helped get away but he found me on the second floor 
---
Im also wondering that, im currently at level 223 with close to 700hrs. I wonder if its gonna be a option to prestige everytime you hit level 50
---
Yeah, I've also seen glowing and scorched Mothman, there's a few of them. Scorched is always hostile. 
---
If you have ammo smith and super duper, the prison is objectively the best place to go. You can easily walk away from there with 250 steel and lead a pop. Take every single can chime you can get, pick up all the mutant weapons and then break it all down at the workbenches that are right there. There are like 14 can chimes inside and outside the building. They give like 2 steel and 1 lead each. It's busted. And as far as I know you can serber hop for them.
---
If it's the one with the keypad that door is accessible; I just checked it out today, lol.
---
Give it time.
---
Every single thing you asked for would exist, if they weren't massive drains on hardware and servers for just a visual change. 
---
They could force it as is, sure.
---
Any server that sees multiple nukes in a short span would crash 100% of the time. 
---
Ironically, the catering to consoles is likely why this is how it is, PC only has a build limit because consoles require one.
---
Then there's the consumer angle. You'd take a relatively low requirement game, with insane memory and VRAM requirements, again, just for a visual, dynamic change.
---
No I didn't claim a workshop I don't have the caps for that 💀
---
Wonderful I care about your opinion so much
---
I don't notice the effect!  
---
It seems like i am taking damage / dying faster. This is why i was wonder if someone cna confirm !
---
It’s not the space suit one, i may be mistaken though tbh
---
This would be friggin awesome !! 
---
Clearly you do. Replying kind of cemented that, you didn't need to verbilize it, as well.
---
Nah I didn't have a workshop but I don't think he was in a team he was just running solo when I first encountered him and would think that he would come with more next time
---
Fallout 76 slogan:  Rebuild America.
---
Fallout 76 gameplay:  Nuke West Virginia.
---
Still, I fucking love this game.
---
*sigh* whaaaaaaat platform?
---
I prioritize mods and perks based on PvP or PvE. For PvE I want a gun to last, you know? Like if I'm mowing down hoards at West Tek I want that durability. But if I'm sever hopping for bounties or contesting workshops I want all the hip fire and crit damage I can get. Cause verses players I just don't even fire close to the same amount of ammo. It's a burst or a couple shots to charge a crit then a crit to finish the job. Usually not even half a clip. Then for perks I drop gunsmith and get that demo expert because even if it's not that much it's still something, I want that crit to hurt and I got plenty of repair mats.
---
You need properly geared people. I’ve done queens after patch with leave 200+ folks and we melt her fast af
---
What are poops in this context?
---
PC
---
Hm, I cannot keep both Makeshift Warrior and Gunsmith equipped at the same time, so it's either my guns or my melee weapons that break faster. Sometimes I switch cards (e.g., for modding a gun), forget about it and go on a melee farming run, and suddenly my All Rise breaks. Good thing that I bought a second lvl 50 All Rise from a vendor.
---
Luck of the Draw helps, too, at least somewhat.
---
Looks like someone faked it, the trailer is the most common stock video of old video countdown. Did anyone else see this on Amazon, or its just this guys word?
---
Yeah I get that, I'm okay with my camp being attacked every now and then but it's just when someone takes a personal vendetta against your camp it just makes me annoyed. But I suppose it is the wasteland and we have to expect raiders! 
---
Yup best thing woulda been grow up block em and move on. Still sorry it happend OP just next time move on. 
---
I know. I'm talking about going forward, excluding what was already obviously in the game.
---
I saw the same thing today! It happened right after Phoenix got destroyed.
---
This. Objectively the best ammo farm in the game period.
---
That's just MMO endgame in general.
---
You just described Diablo.
---
You just described WoW and FF14 raid progression.
---
Endgame is the act of preparing for an end that doesn't come.
---
It depends on your internet speed. I have mine on ps4 and it took me around maybe a hour to download with all patches. I have the gig service though.
---
This would be neat but really mess with the area as a starting zone.
---
I was grinding for power armor parts earlier this morning, and this concept shot through my mind. Small world. glad to see it done!
---
It’s a legit question. I can’t melee power attack in my x01 for some reason 
---
have any reduced weight heavy weapons ? 
---
When people make it a point to single out one person then it is definitely a problem.  I just feel like Beth needs to add some more content. Maybe add more ways to defend your camp against players because turrets are a joke
---
I mean, if it did damage for all of those cells, then count me in
---
But turrets cost so much budget lol
---
Would you take a trade in? Like if I bring you some T-50 Power Armor pieces could I potentially get a Power Armor piece of lower or equal value?

I can barely make it through a Whitespring run without it breaking, the club house almost always kills it. I'll try messing with my perks when it breaks again tonight.
---
Go to Fo76Bazaar. They do selling / buying / trading

Lol

Where in defiance are there ultracite plans? I only have the torso and one arm that the queen dropped.

Hemlock hills workshop has three acid nodes
---
In addition to what the OP asks for, I would love to see:  
---
\- Open Passage Walls for interior alcoves and segregating rooms.  Basically just an "upside-down-U" frame so we can partition areas without a narrow doorway and to conceal ugly inside corners (like with brick where there is the gap allowing brick to be shown inside).  
---
\- Staircases like the semi-stackable one but with solid wood floors in lieu of the wire mesh for better use in interior spaces.  
---
\-Compact staircase that doubles back on itself with a mid-rise landing.  Takes a 1x1 space and effectively enters and exits from the same direction.  
---
\- Roof Slope Piece with an interior angle joint.  We already have a piece with an exterior joint.  
---
\- Large Picture Window Walls.  Appalachia is so beautiful.  Let us appreciate it when inside too!   
---
\- Curved Corner Pieces similar to the bits in FO4 Wasteland Workshop DLC.  
---
\- Atom Shop Flooring Compatibility with half and quarter floors.  
---
\- Concrete Wall Set.  Something sturdy that doesn't have tons of obvious texture tiling artifacts.  
---
\- Common props we see across the wasteland:  Yellow Utility Sinks (Bonus if they can give dirty water), Showers, Clothes Washers/Dryers, Medicine Cabinet/Mirrors, Less-scuffed toilets, etc.  
---
\- Doors that fit properly in the door frames without gaps/floating.  
---
\- More build budget :)
---
Yes! My turrets struggle to take out a single tick
---
Thanks! 
---
Comedy answer- single player 76, $60

Yes

Thank you Donna 😀

I only lock my suite, more a RP thing really but have beds for 3 in my camp as well as areas for Music and all the benches. Never lock the purifiers or any extractor I may be running, why bother, what can they steal and if they are going to trash it a lock's not that much help.    
---
&amp;nbsp;   [My current C.A.M.P.](https://imgur.com/gallery/uLzSCxT) just SE of Pleasant Valley Station is an example. Now we just need at least 25% more budget for the nice stuff.

Ok thanks I will try that out
---
Thanks I will try him
---
Where could one find this shop of yours? 
---
it woudln't be hard it would just be that players who exit the vault have the original and players who enter the vault would have a separate instance zone - as such the 2 groups would never even know there was anyone there and as such no one would lose out anything 
---
Please please please Bethesda
---
Worth it 
---
For me it only get slow when I fast travel right outside a nuke zone. Other then that it’s smooth for me. 
---
I would like to see a hazmat under armour that offers just enough rad resistance so that PA isn't 100% necessary for nuke zones. Current hazmat is like 1000 rad resistance, I think about 250 under armour would be good? 
---
That being said, with legendary pieces and perk configurations it does seem pretty balanced overall. It just sucks because I don't much care for power armour.
---
Isn’t taking a nuke silo hard enough?
---
Yup. I just made mine
---
Here's how that worked! I mark full suits with atom shop paint by painting the helmet, then just place them facing out, then jumped down in and got my photo set up. It was a bit of a logistical challenge but worked fairly well. 
---
I added you, I'll be back on after dinner 
---
I'll keep an eye out!
---
Yes, over-repairing armor improves the armor rating. 
---
Open to help, no mic though if that's fine.
---
If so, add me. "Gopnikmeister"
---
No it doesn't. Source: every Alliance DK multiboxer on WoW.
---
I don't know if it's better, but there are three plan spawns out in the open at Camp Venture as well, plus another one that can spawn inside the lvl3-safe there.
---
Taggerdy's terminal will kit you the plans for Utracite. 
---
Thank you!
---
Easiest way in, even players who lock up forget that if you can see a workbench or cooking your in.
---
This happens when u farm an area to long, white-springs most noticeably often gives 0 xp if u take on the robots inside  
---
The other player must have turned pacifist in. Basically he didn’t want fight anymore. 
---
Hmm, might be worth a reinstall then. I do like a nicely presented development roadmap after all.
---
I would like proper balcony rails and porch railings.    
---
&amp;nbsp;  And 25% more budget minimum, my [creation](https://imgur.com/gallery/uLzSCxT) isn't complete.
---
Maybe your the one who vanished, and everyone one on your server was like “where’d he go?”
---
ESO? Those players were jerks, bites are FREE. 
---
I'm not looking on every server, though. I'm just a guy that loves Power Armor, and I can also understand the frustration of trying to find that ONE LAST PIECE. With having done pretty much all there is to do, I just thought I'd open a shop so started collecting armor chassis a few weeks ago. The upshot here is I'm trying to keep prices reasonable for everyone that comes to me, because a few people I play with regularly are always grabbing armor for me, so I can spend time sorting suits together. Being unable to name them, it can be a real pain. 
---
Grahm is the best!
---
Woah seriously? 
---
I just assumed it's scorchbeast nests because, I'm not sure if this happened with everyone else but when you do the last mission for mayor for a day and you're on the roof fighting robots, it kept spawning in a scorchbeasts there
---
Getting bit was super easy...just walk up and ask
---
Yeah, I really hope Bethesda patches this game up to its full potential just like Rainbow 6 Siege, No Man's Sky, Sea of Thieves, etc. have done. I think it's possible, but like you I need to see it to believe it after the way things started, unfortunately.
---
I hope one bad game hasn’t tarnished your opinion of a game studio that has made multiple games loved by the community around the world.
---
I have a PS4, but can only play on one console at a time. Wish I could open it on all platforms!
---
The REAL problem is no cross platform play IMHO
---
 Excellent. These are no-brainer perks as they just slot when you use em. ;)
---
 Another 3 levels figured out. 
---
If you have a rifle build TSE is not destroyed. Wont do the damage you were used to but it isn't terrible. 
---
They are not worth the budget 
---
P.S. Really just give us half of what FO4 had, but definitely the Nuka World Stuff.
---
I see it as the inverse. An easy to hate game banned a cheater, who admitted to cheating, big "gaming" publications pick it up on fucking Reddit, and report the outrage angle as the neutral.
---
I've read three articles about this in 4 days, and each and every one pretends that there's some meta mystery behind it.
---
Imo, they aren't obligated to tell us shit about other people's bans, and no, Blizzard does not do as you say. They will announce core reasons for a banwave, but they never discuss specifics, details, single out users, or otherwise. As for your "genuine players" comment, You can stow the True Scotsman shit.
---
Awesome!

I have a open garage door with powered doors leading to the rest of the house. A switch inside powers the doors separately  for when i'm afk. Workshop garage always open

can you explain what you mean. are you saying you have all the disease cures and healing salves from using pharma farmer to search chem stashes in watoga?
---
I wish more people could FIND my house on the map and come use all the cool things I put inside the garage. In mean... I built the house (private for me) and a garage for the public with all the workbenches inside and even a bed and music stations outside. Just remember to close the garage when you're done! It would be awesome to have more people coming by, but alas, I get maybe 1 visitor a week. I know they were their because they activated the garage door and left it open. 🙄 COME TO MY HOUSE PEOPLE!

I’ll gladly take a loss of caps to earn a wanted level to blow up a persons base that’s placed outside the back doors of the white springs golf club. Most of the time the player that own the base isn’t even there to reap the loot.
---
I would definitely say get the steel walls plan and maybe some of the vault tech furniture in the atom shop.
---
Here's a link to what most of the plans look like in the game. https://m.imgur.com/a/3ZhkLJl
---
It's been awhile since I've been inside of vault 76, but maybe starting a second character to look around inside may help with furniture ideas. 
---
Best of luck!
---
I'm literally bouncing back about 10 to 20 "steps"
---
I can't. There's no available plans for X-01 jetpacks, you have to either server hop the Enclave bunker or buy one 3rd party. 
---
Less disconnecting as well since the purge 
---
Sweet
---
Some people don't be thinkin' that's how PSN be, but it do.
---
Guess I’ve been spoiled. Going down to 1/5 of what the damage used to be isn’t something I really want to get used to, especially for how heavy the 2mm is for me. It’s really the ammo part that is main part. The damage reduce isn’t worth the weight.
---
I'm taking a dinner break! Be back after a bit. I'm located just north of the Overseer's Camp. 
---
at least the rate to learn a mod isnt insanely low like for armor and the ultracite laser gun. i'll make about 10 radiums rifles at a time and get 2-3 mods
---
Not sure it's lag to be honest, if I walk up to a container I can see what's inside, and even loot and item, then I'll rubber band back 10 - 20 steps, walk up again and it's the same loot, no loading wheel.  
---
  
---
That said, seen that lag as well, frustrating.
---
Hey what’s the price for an X-01 jetpack mod or torso? And you can have all my fancy lad snack cakes if there’s a discount. 
---
So get the 2 ammo weight reduction cards... I have almost 20k 5mm rounds and it weighs 0. Literally nothing. 
---
wow thanks
---
Mainly going to do power armor but more than willing to see what other armor or weapon mods I can do, i can build alot of prime receivers as well, just haven't written down which ones yet
---
I am interested in going to these places now
---
Don't play then... This is a core mechanism.

I've been tempted to drop an orbital strike followed by a few nuka grenades, built to face a row of turrets right in the lower double door, and get the upper windows to aggro.

Motion-assist servos for the torso give +2 Strength, increasing your carry weight by 10.

I just finished maxing the following for my sniper build:
---
Rifleman, expert rifleman, master rifleman
---
Tank killer
---
Bloody mess
---
That consecutive hit vats card who's name escapes me. Accuracy and damage go up with each vats shot, regardless if it lands
---
15 AGI, 15 perception. 
---
Using a maxed non-legendary hunting rifle, I can vats 1-shot head shot most things my level and below while sneaking. The secret to vats is, pre-targeting the head of the first enemy. Any subsequent target locks will lock to the head for most of your session, and you can basically aimbot with the above build, plus perception chems. 
---
Further plans are to max covert operative, and craft a ton of damage increasing chems. 
---
Its totally possible to be awesome with rifles. You just have to have the build, and not totally ignore vats like most people! Problem is, melee is viable for literally any build... and if they ever "fix" that, a lot of people will just uninstall the game.
---
Yeah... It was a drama for sure lol
---
I don't have any more jetpacks for X-01 unfortunately. 
---
What's the difference between Knight and Soldier? 
---
Lmao calm down. More info will be released closer to the summer. Take a fucking chill pill.
---
You still after this? I can make the body (not the hat) if you want it.
---
Well that's because those people invested in TSE. Think about if you owned stocks, then the CEO does something to tank those stocks. You'd be upset because you had an invested interest. I was unhappy with it, but it didn't bother me because I didn't have a TSE gun. I'm a bit sad I'll never get to experience that sort of OP play, but I also understand it was unhealthy for the balance of the game. I'm more unhappy that it was ever a thing to begin with rather than it getting nerfed. BSG needs to change explosive over to a primary legendary prefix, give it 50% damage instead of 20, and then give TS back up to 50%. That way they can be on parity with other legendary effects without being an OP combination. 
---
Think about it, before the nerf, explosive was the single biggest damage increase you could have on a weapon by a pretty fucking substantial margin. If you had the demolitions perk it was a 200% increase by itself. And it was a 2nd tier legendary perk? Gtfo with that stupidity Bethesda.
---
I’m almost always at max caps, so have no problem smashing up a guys ENTIRE base every time he turret camps whitesprings.
---
Worst case scenario, I lose a few hundred caps. Best case scenario I get to lawfully grief a guy over and over because they can’t stand to have me hand his ass to him several times &amp; doesn’t know when enough is enough.
---
Dang. Thanks for the swift reply nonetheless. 
---
You're complaints had nothing to do with this
---
You don't have to use a 3rd party program to mule. You literally only have to have fo76 loader renamed fallout76-2 a second time. Running 2 clients is basically built right into the game. It's becoming VERY obvious that you don't know much about this game, first you don't even realize fo76 as multiboxing built right in, secondly TSEAA? That isn't even possible in the game both explosive and anti armor are in the same "minor" effects weapons can have, it is 100% impossible to get both of those on the gun.
---
So you have literally just spouted out things only someone who has very little knowledge of this game would say. The fact you are trying to demonize someone with your wrong understanding of this game is down right disgusting.
---
I'm done with you, you're obviously not educated enough about this game to have worthwhile opinions about these things. Thank you for making it obvious enough that you can be ignored. Have a good one.
---
You had many chances to dump your crap if you were all over. I killed 3 the day before and 2 ran away. ;)
---
Yep sorry
---
Someone walk into his CAMP and there was a swastika or something? Lmao 
---
2mm is energy weight. Can’t afford to respec if I were to keep a tse build.
---
I love how reddit thinks they are the word of god and people should bend a knee unto us
---
Same reason they can also shoot explosive rounds? Guess super mutants are just better Craftsman
---
It's just junk.  I have lost piles and piles of junk.  I'm at 189.
---
If you know where and how to farm what you need it's no big deal.
---
 The main thing I want is things to plant crops in, planters, grow tables and ground plots.  A hydroponic setup would be very cool.  Even a simple foundation piece that is dirt to level out ground to have a nice garden with a fence that half is not floating since there is no freaking flat ground anywhere except the damn gold course.
---
Are the torso parts same kind, as in base type, excluding the obvious mods? 
---
Game doesn't fully threat favourited items as individuals. If you have a weapon, favourited, and you drop it ect, then later pick up the same kind of weapon, it gets the favourite spot.
---
My bad. Thought you said 5mm. So you can respec to a melee build?
---
If this is them trying then this game is doomed.
---
What if he meant paaps?
---
[removed]
---
If you have two sections of floor with a wall below them between the two, sometimes the one that is on the “outside” of the wall can’t be used to hold up the structure. Removing the wall below it allows a stair outside to hold it up. 
---
Also, the 2 square stairs attach to everything around them, so you have to eliminate the walls touching the long sides before you can delete them. 
---
Haha, yeah, my place is always open, I use a garage door with a pressure plate a few feet away so the critters cant get in.
---
K.
---
perfectly preserved cake.

First time I met grant was when I was a level 20ish at the whitespring station when another dude and I was fighting 3 scorched beasts at a time. Then grahm passes by and joins the first. Was a beautiful thing to see me (a guy in a dress and beer hat) a t51b dude with cammo paintjob and a super mutant fighting 3 giant bats.
---
You'll need 100% the clean vault tec bed, metal shelves, kitchen stove, modern tables, metal walls, powered doors, high tech lights
---
It's like real life. You see a dead dude on the street and you can just take his shit. I don't see the problem.
---
Thanks, but I actually want to build with the brick. Also, I feel like he Vault-Tec furniture skins are a little too on-the-nose. The actual furniture it is a skin for is what I’m looking for. 
---
No worries. If I were to go melee I would probably start a new character. Just want to keep that as a last resort. I’ve put in a lot of time on my tse character.
---
Ywah the mods exist but the plans are that much no mod should cost nearly that much
---
Yes it's not worth the time or effort to bother crafting that stuff. Between watgoa and the whitspring bunker I regularly have around 6-7 disease cures and antibiotics.
---
Plus the white springs fountain in the little gazebo that cures diseases. 
---
I will sell you a X-01 Jetpack for 1500 Caps, also have Calibrated Shocks for 1000.
---
Got ya. I had to respec a little after the nerf. Just maxed the rifleman cards and took off demolition. I still kill pretty much anything in 3 shots or less. 
---
That "nuclear reactor" is a face!
---
It can?  I didn't think it could be.  So either I'm dense and this was a joke I missed or I've been wrong?  Either way I'm prepared to be enlightened.
---
Does that include the calibrated shocks and jump pack?
---
PS4 requires a PSN active account for anything that is not free to play.
---
Still need more?
---
Bullshit. My 1 shot one kill sniper build begs to differ. Stop spreading lies. We see through the total BS that is the *mostly* unjustified hate for this game.
---
That or make a character that maxes agi and perception, or do some research.
---
What happened to Grant? 
---
Cripple if you can't 1 or 2 shot them. Enforcer any level will do wonders even on scorchbeast wings. Kill the armor piercing gun mutant guyas on of the first. You can hear his gun clearly. It sounds liek those stronger gutsy one. probably kill hamer guys first also. Be sure to have armor piercing mag or tank killer 2-3 aswell.
---
I would like to join. 
---
youve found all the regions in watoga?
---
This is awesome! I’ll need to check this out one of these days
---
Which is why it's so shitty! I run out there with a horde of ghouls following, all dead in seconds because of stupid rockets shooting at them and dude is gone.... wtf! 
---
Which means people wont have total control like they think
---
Where do you place and point it?
---
My camp is a tent on the mire. Due north of the subpower station near Harper's. So no locked doors. Feel free to take water, use decontamination shower and use the tools and bed I have laying around. Just stay away from my junk extractor 😋
---
Yepper, initially we weren't sure but after we tested it more in depth from Late Dec through Jan we found it definitely does, especially as your base chainsaw damage gets higher and higher.
---
Raider doesn't have jetpacks available at all. I also cannot make calibrated shocks for that, and don't think you'd want them on a low level suit like that anyway. Too cost prohibitive to make. 
---
No, they break at the same speed, just feels like they break 3x as fast cause you have to fire it 3x as much to get the same results.
---
It was a misspell. Corrected it after I saw I done popped.
---
You need to visit the stash more
---
The train yard east of watoga has quite a few plans and recipes in the train cars and buildings.
---
Ha you're the same like me. Took me a while to find them as well since before I only got random atoms and thought they were normal challenges.
---
But yeah, you press your map button, then your Z button. Basically the main menu. There's the "Challenges" section, and there you should see both the "daily" and "weekly" challenges.
---
Have fun with them from now on :D
---
Yeah, there is an EXPLOIT much like duping that allows the misuse of foundations to build your house with them. So your looking to use an EXPLOIT THAT IS NOT THE INTENDED USE FOR FOUNDATIONS USING AND EXPLOITIVE GLITCH?? Huh nice shoe on that other foot.
---
then yes, just regurgitating what i said 
---
My TS auto grenade launcher almost lasts a full clip! Jokes aside it does break very fast and half the time doesn't hit what I'm aiming at lol.
---
Yeah I remember early on seeing mods for the jet pack at a fraction of the price. Seems they upped the price 200% last couple of updates 
---
Yes a few
---
Yep got me today as well playing solo doing my first nuke. all was good except the usual flood of low lvl. Last few min to kill the sbq flys away not to be seen and the the game starts to disconnect from the server. 
---
  👹 not even a chance to to collect the materials for pure violet flux for my excavator cal. Shocks the main reason for even doing a nuke. 
---
   But it is what it is maybe I have better luck next go around. 
---
I've been bitching about it since release but no one at Bethesda seems to care. Even after responding to my ticket in week 1. That, and the various headpieces that make your facial hair disappear best to be fixed asap. 
---
I had a griefer a few weeks back. After reloading in 3 separate times, I messaged him and asked "what the f is your problem?" I was mic banned for 24 hours due to "harassment." The irony...
---
Which will feed directly into the which hunt.
---
Despite the fact that this was said over a month before release, people will complain about it's actual announcement.
---
They'll have more control than they do now, but the extent is unknown.
---
Of course they want total control, in which case, I say: go make your own game.
---
2 things. What platform are you on. I'm PS4, I like base building so I have all plans unlocked, so if it gets to the end and your missing some objects I'll throw them down for you.
---
And 2, if you want a terminal/computer, but it looks pretty ugly with its base. You could put it on the end of a carpet and see if you can move it into/molding into the desk.
---
Stairs that will snap to one side  of a 2x2 ! Please...
---
Me too Backpack friend.
---
+karma
---
What gun are you going with? Cause as of right now I’m thinking of a lever action and the endangerol syringer so I can take down the DR some.
---
No, there is an important distinction to be made here when you put the jokes aside.
---
Dungeons full of monster or bosses with a billion health each that sometimes take hours to complete with a dozen players
---
Welcome to the wasteland.
---
No no no the jet pack mod still is cheap but the plans are hyper expensive 
---
Never fell into the green pits, do you die instantly or just very rapidly? Can you jump out before dying with marsupial? Does armor slow death? 
---
I use a mixture. AAE lever, AAE handmade, explosive hunting rifle, AA hunting rifle, really makes no difference. Same result with all
---
I’m on Xbox. Also, could you link to a video to show how to merge the terminal with a desk?
---
Happened to me twice today.
---
That's odd. I got on yesterday and didn't have any issues...
---
Found 1. 
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh1QwVAfWAM
---
It wouldn't be possible for them to have a system that checks photos for modified textures.  
---
...  
---
So I actually support this idea. Going see so many penises on walls or just giant tower walls made of racist memes in the distance. Would be fun to see sometimes.
---
Latency is OP.
---
I was circling to the back of a Yao, 180 degrees...fucking server hiccup, screen stuttered, face to face with the bear, as the hiccup had brought me full circle, 360 degrees right into a haymaker.
---
Two more rushed me while stunned and it was over.
---
The specific nude mod I'm talking about is Enhanced Vanilla Bodies 76 on Nexus btw, it includes both female and male. Just in case you're interested.
---
Can you make calibrated shocks for the ultra site armor? 
---
You already posted this 30 minutes ago. I dont like spammers
---
shocks? pc?
---
Are people starting to buy crappy legendaries now just speculating?
---
I don't know why they thought of rocks when they thought of DC ranged attacks.
---
Excuse me, it seems like it would be really good at leaping about forty feet or more suddenly, as opposed to trying to pick up rocks and throw them at me with those Nightmare on Elm Street Press on nails.
---
I’m in need of PA Limb, torso an legs plans to build the actual suit of PA. Mainly t51 t60 and t45. I wanna be able to build the suit fro. Scratch myself 
---
I always like the idea of adding player choice but this would need a bit of reworking (especially considering how sourly pvp has been received by some). 
---
What I really like of having different end game objectives or content depending on where you'd like to fall. Worshipers of Atom stealing nukes for upgraded mutations, BoS dismantling nukes getting advanced technology to get upgrades to energy weapons and PA, Raiders/VD launching nukes to try and control/defeat the monstrosities in the wastes.
---
Obviously the amount of work/design that would go into these makes them impossible to see in game but it is neat to think about alternative ways to advance your character uniquely.
---
 Sure you could work really hard to get there, but it is in no way as big an issue as duping is, if it even is an issue.
---
..... click, click, click...   mashes button on "ignore"....    .grin.
---
Part of me thinks that before they made them easily available, beth used some ol fashioned market research by seeing what people were buying and selling these hard to find plans for in the player market, then used those prices accordingly
---
two thumbs up!!
---
Bruh put it in your stash there are boxes everywhere
---
Today I needed to fix my all rise that broke in a fight in the middle of nowhere. And the next camp I found had a lock on door. However one of the workbenches was next to the window. So I stood there aiming at it and it gave me the option to craft. As soon as I hit it, I got me moved into the house :)) locked inside. Gladly I got the all rise all right.  Then fast travelled to nearest location and carried on my adventure. 
---
So you need plans? You need cranberry bog treasure maps and RNGesus to smile on you. 
---
 The robots are a low levels best friend in Whitesprings.  Be sure to check the map before fast traveling there to make sure no high level players are there helps as well.
---
 I kill the Mothman quite often and the Flatwoods Monster is almost a pest in the great divide. ;)
---
 I count Scorchbeasts myself. None today or yesterday but 3 the day before. I had 3 at once for a while but 2 chickened out and ran. ;)
---
How about a new full wall unit for each material type that includes an enclosed set of stairs with a built-in banaster? All the two story buildings in the game have normal stairs. Can we have them too? A spiral staircase would be handy as well.
---
Hmm why would you complete the quests so low level.
---
&gt;Also I heard that you actually need friends to complete the final quests, they can’t be done solo.
---
Technically they can be played solo too. But by low level, probably not. It's a bit hard to judge as many things are levelled.
---
Don't believe so. Calibrated I have excavator, t45 51 60. Jetpacks for t45 51 60. Stealthboy for t45 60 and a targeting HUD for t45. Plus a number of other mods like motion assist, I'll write down and post in the next day or 2
---
That is literally one of the main things they said the game is about well before anyone played the game.
---
So yes, it’s unreasonable to be upset 
---
That is exactly how its tracked as per Bethesds themselves.   Your premise is based on a 1 for 1 move not cases where u pick it up with the same account by accident ect.  Your intelligence is flawed.
---
This is a really cool idea and would give basically everyone an incentive to pursue silos for their own reason, good call! I could definitely see silo raids turning into a sort of King of the Hill gamemode like this.
---
PC?
---
Love the it’s a Vanilla exploit that is light and fluffy it should be a non-issue response. It’s a damn exploit all the same. Needs to be ban eligible and patched.
---
The monogoh one works if you move the default pylon or create your own connecctions
---
Nein
---
Saw legendary Grahm lay down the law in Watoga the other day. If I was still the mayor I might have had to intervene, was a bloodbath... of steel.
---
TBH mobs are down just a few shot more only. If you are semi auto rifle probably feel the same since everything down with 1-2 shot anyway. If you are auto rifle, you won’t feel it either since the fire rate is quite fast. 
---
If you are not fighting the queen most mobs down by a few shots even with a normally built weapon. It’s not that bad. Just more ammo and durability. 
---
Its my tv it's like five years old
---
  They are, but they are far from unusable in PVE.
---
My assumption is that they could make a mistake not they did, that's a reasonable assumption.  I never said hes innocent, I said their Is a chance based on the evidence he is possibly innocent.  That's a reasonable thought process.
---
Your claiming they have no chance of making a mistake again....that's a bias based on incorrect data.
---
T posing ghouls are still out there ran into one today on 1.0.6 patch.
---
I love the entrpenureship but if your not willing to wander the wasteland you've picked the wrong game 
---
If it inflates the amount it would inflate it for both accounts. not just 1 
---
It was even before the game launched. The clan flag they put out at a swastika on it, and the various other player icons in the discord had Nazi imagery.
---
'Innocents' post here instead of bethesda community since there's a chance Bethesda can co through your account and just expose your inventory if you did that there. 
---
I second this. 
---
idk only if you worship Papa Pete and treat his word as holy text. think for yourself man.
---
I could have swore she was voiced by Pennsatucky from OITNB.
---
Ha, true. I just wanted to help! Almost to level 140 and I needed something new to do.
---
So they fixed one and broke another lol. Thanks bathesda! I guess
---
Perhaps triggered by search lights?
---
One account drops it...picks it back up....drops it.....then other account picks it up.  Now account a has collected twice the numbers of account b.
---
The numbers do not have to be the same, tracking picked up items is the method Bethesda has openly said they are using.
---
By your logic if he was duping both accounts would also have the same numbers.
---
Vampire's with that 40% faster swing speed sounds pretty good\~
---
I had fun with Grahm and learned following him can get real [interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUauV9uyVbg&amp;t=20s) (5:11 in the video), first bit is clearing Grafton Steel with him.
---
Haha sweet 
---
 I will soldier on. I'm getting sick of that fucking smiley asshole who won't let me have my Jet Pack. ;)
---
 I could go play my alt. She has a Jet Pack on a level 40 tors and that ain't getting upgraded soon.
---
Maybe some dubstep 
---
They did something they never have done before, and that was to take the FO series out to a front like this
---
They’re not dumb, they know people would be dissatisfied, they know the hate they would get and they know these vocal people out here would continue to shit on top of shit on them, yet they still kept it up, and they didn’t give up
---
They like the game they made as much as the people that have fun with it, and they do want the game to be good
---
On ps4 if you got the mats 200caps I'll build a jetpack for t45 51 60
---
So I fast traveled into flatwoods the other day and unmistakably heard air raid sirens. I was convinced someone had launched an atom bomb but nothing ever came of it. It was incredibly surreal though. I’m super new to the game still so if anyone knows why the air raid sirens would sound I’d be all ears. 
---
Supposedly it fixes it until you quit the game. When you log back in it’s broken again
---
I think about this all the time
---
I hear ya brother, level 114 always looking for stuff to do.  Don't getme wrong i love the idea im just giving those unwilling to find stuff themselve a hard time 😁.
---
I have found that the concrete ramps have always been problematic.   They won't snap when they should far to many times.   I try them somewhere else and suddenly they will snap on terrain that is identical to my first attempt to get them to work.    Failing all else I use the wooden stairs.   I can usually get one set or the other to work.
---
Perhaps the dog helmet is them foreshadowing what is to come? The Return of Dogmeat with Laser Beams on His Head!
---
Just build a non-torrent camp there with crafting stations...   blocks their ability to camp that spot and you get access to scrapping and a stash...
---
I also recently started playing again and it's been much more stable! 
---
Fallout *76% incomplete*
---
We kewl. Ty 
---
It's funny when people are hot mic'ing. Except when you're trying to take down the SBQ. I get it, you like to rock out, set your mic to push to talk please.
---
Pretty sure they have a camp plan for sirens and it’s like the military bomber warning ones 
---
NEVAR!!! 
---
I fully expect you to glitch your way through my open shutters like a normal fallout player would, by interacting with the strategically placed instruments to end up inside my home playing a piano or steel guitar. Getting out, you're on your own, but at least I made you a way in! 
---
Let other players be the bots. They can only move like bots,  and wield bot weapon only. In this way, it won't take too much to make adjustment to the system, and won't effect current lore.
---
You you think being entitled is expecting something to work as intended? Something not being gamebreaking is your perspective so dont pretend like its objective. Players builds are centered around this mutation and its screws their entire build because it doesnt function. Whats the point of a glass cannon, if its only glass?
---
With the upcoming vault raids it would make silos more valuable and keep them top of players minds. 
---
I do like the idea of a pvp mode for silos maybe standard on survival server silos and a game mode for something fun on regular servers?
---
Honestly I have a blast thinking about the possibilities (however impossible) this game has.
---
I did but i didn't get any proper responses
---
Guh, that stench longers for hours upon hours.
---
Happens with my gauss rifle too, can confirm that pulling out certain weapons makes you seem to stick out as if standing and firing a shot.
---
I've also noticed when I'm perma[CAUTION]ed that it acts like the [HIDDEN] notifier.  I speculate that the graphics for [CAUTION] are incorrectly displaying over [HIDDEN] but may be wrong.
---
Nice C.A.M.P
---
What’s your gamertag?
---
Raid usually means that access to the content is locked behind a specific number of people, most likely 8-12. Many raids I've done went so far as to lock the path if you don't have the number of players they want you to have. Meaning, no matter how good your character is, you won't even get to see the content unless you group up with the minimum. Raids are usually instanced, meaning if I entered the vault, and you entered the same vault, unless we were grouped up the game would load two separate versions of the same vault.
---
One way they might do this is just to have it open world like the Queen. If they do this then everyone that enters the vault would be able to participate in the 'raid' and my concerns would be mostly pointless. But why use the word 'raid' if they aren't meaning to lock it all up?
---
If it added to the amount every time you dropped it and picked it up it would still add it to the first account who dropped it and picked it back up and dropped it again the first account his main account would then also have inflated ammo ammount and would have more than the second account..He was only found to have 140k on his main account that he said he used to make and do all that stuff with and used pass to the mule he also said he sometimes dropped the ammo and picked up before passing to the mule account. So he would of had a lot more than just 140k on that account of just untracite especially when the mull had nearly 300k of just untracite and the rest of the ammo too. 
---
Oh shower me with your opinions, me loves it
---
Well seeing how I just bought the game because I have been a fan of fall out since fo3, I didn’t read any disclaimer about low lifes being able to steal your hard earned loot for no reason other than being a total dick. 
---
I’ve been playing the game on and off since launch and it’s crashed a total of two times on me.
---
Fallout 4 by comparison crashes 50% of the time I use any crafting station or otherwise just randomly crashes ever session. Or Apex Legends which is praised for being very stable crashes every two or three games for me! Black Ops 4 runs like a dream on my pc but literally none of my friends will play it because it runs like garbage on theirs!
---
Honestly every fucking PC game I have crashes once in a while or is otherwise inconsistent, it’s just a part of the experience at this rate. 
---
I mean for sure you can say my experience of fallout 76 isn’t the same as yours, so it not crashing for me means nothing if it crashes for you.
---
But then again I know for a fact that other people don’t have the same experience with Apex Legends as me, but I’m not gonna stop playing it altogether and bitch and moan on its reddit because when it doesn’t crash it’s a hoot! 
---
So maybe just try troubleshooting or something idk. 
---
My point is moot I’m just tired of defending this game because my experience has been super positive so far and I’m constantly having a blast and rarely crashing. 
---
Where's your house?
---
Gave it a good listen and I just now realized she’s talking about a piano player. Love it even more now.
---
Lol think for myself? That’s such an over used come back. Ironic isn’t it? 
---
Any X01 targeting HUDs?
---
You clearly didn’t read anything before buying it and now your being a brat.
---
I mean have you gone back and looked at my complaints?
---
Amazing. I've got a Craftsman Radial Arm saw from the eighties too. It's kinda hard to find the batteries for its cutting edge liquid crystal display.
---
Less trapped than you might think. If the windows are ground level look through and place your PA outside then enter it.
---
Yeah, I've been told it's pretty worthless.  It was fun to play with for me, though!  Worked every shot, not a single one wasted.  Just broke too fast and takes forever to reload.  Basically, a toy, not worth anything to most people.  Gonna just sell it to the legendary vendor when we get that update.
---
Ok so you agree that the bugs in this game are not acceptable? Honestly i’d prefer if they took the game down for months to fix all the remaining bugs or at least the majority, and implement a test client.
---
Were you the level 10-20 or so guy who kept hitting ‘Seek Revenge’? If so, it’s possible that was me! I never jumped to a different server though. Dang. I always hope I can find a post talking about me. 
---
To be fair if they cant get the normal game running properly, what are the odds they'd manage VR.
---
They aren’t specifically elaborate with the wording. Can the vendor only scrap? Can we self scrap? Is the vendors stash only related to legendaries? Stay tuned for the next episode of dragon ball z.
---
A true giver. 
---
Can you add me, so I can buy from you when I need more? I'd love to have that to fall back on.  I got the ones I needed, but depending on how I respec I might have to clear my current set.
---
IGN: Same as here; PC user as well.
---
The wise mothman that gives the buff is unkillable, at least the one at the light house. Wasn't aware he could spawn anywhere else? If you shoot him at the top of the light house he teleports to the ground where he is immortal.
---
I'm only going to have music playing over mic if I'm just faffing about, I'd never subject people to my nonsense somewhere serious. 
---
Thanks that sucks, the serum isn’t exactly as cheap as nuke cola
---
the scorch virus is gone cause in fo4 there are no scorchbeasts or scorched 
---
Again this bug not being game-breaking is your perspective. Anyone with a glasscannon build just lost a huge percentage of their damage.
---
Yea I’m trying to remind myself that I can get more junk but I guess I’m just weird because I’ve never taken anyone’s loot after they died near me, ever. Honestly it’s the ballistic fiber that really gets me I guess
---
Melee… 
---
Looks good, OP! Been wondering if it was possible to build underground
---
Honestly what SQEX did with FF14 was nothing short of a miracle. I would argue that the number of fans mad at them for FF14 at original release far surpassed those mad at bethesda for FO76 but honestly FF14 was pretty bad. 
---
I played from the start there was no endgame whatsoever because the devs thought their fatigue system would keep people from reaching max level quickly but of course that did not work. It had it's good points but the game in general at release was a chore to play. I could go on but yeah FF14 is still the "Come back King" in terms of failed releases.
---
Do side quests once you get to lv 70 are 80 you should be good
---
I didn’t really because I was in between the two bases a fissure site! After I did move my camp tho to unload my weapons I got...that’s what I get for being a cheapskate with my caps!
---
Pshhh, my *main* is level 15
---
Hunting rifle and combat shotgun
---
Mount Blair 
---
Lol no. It sucks cuz I run a bloodied build and I rely on adrenal a lot. More so than anything else 
---
Now I know why so many chassis have disappeared! I'll have to drop by and trade you some mods for your duplicate plans. 
---
Fallout 4 vr was a disaster I don't think they will implement be for any future games. 
---
It's either fallout 3 remaster or its ESO or something related I'm guessing 
---
I have both of those psn is same as username 200 caps each
---
 My Fusion Power has a 0 lock on its door. Its only prudent and I have scorched nearby.
---
 The rest is wide open with a separate Crafting building with everything you might need. Take my Purified, I don't care and my house is open too. try out my Four Poster. ;)
---
Yeah i want the skull raider gas mask
---
They only listed the ultracite that doesnt mean he didnt have any other ammo.  They didnt add his steel or other items.
---
For all you know he moved it numerous times on his mule, you have no way of knowing and with how they are tracking it neither do they.
---
You fail to understand the reasoning,  assuming only the worst because that to u makes sense, but something you cant understand most be impossible.  Your the same type of person that believed the rest of the sheep that the world was flat.....cause it much be.
---
Underneath actually in the case of foundation stacking.
---
It doesn't seem like something that needs to be emergency patched . It's not game breaking . Sure it's clearly annoying and taking away from your enjoyment of the game, but just give em a few. If it's not fixed in the next patch, Id say your grievance would have more gravity . 
---
Lmao I guess that’s my problem... I practice the ‘do on to others...’ way of life and apparently I’m the only one!
---
I'm almost certain they do no damage to the owner, but yeah. Silly.  
---
A pro-scorched faction kinda sounds too similar to the Children of Atom.  I think the OP’s meaning more of a “never again” movement or people wanting to prevent WWIII at any cost (after the fact, granted)
---
 Oh it happens. I try to stay light and dump my stuff constantly. My Heavy Combat with Dense on the Chest and Strengthened on the Limbs does not carry much.
---
 It is immune to explosives though, so our screaming sweetheart does nothing to me at all till she lands. Then she dies. ;) Gotta stay light.
---
No fucking way, this can't be a real thing. You can't power attack in power armor?!
---
If he did have other ammo they would of listed it. Especially listing all the ammo he had on his second account. Also with what you stated his main would have shown more inflated numbers with all the ammo considering he dropped it picked it up dropped it again and picked it up and then passed it to his mule. Considering all this is supposed to list the ammo that has passed through his accounts in 1 month. His main would have more than what his second account has since it inflates the amounts. 
---
Says it can’t find reddpyramid
---
What's the picture from with the star mapped out?
---
I have a vampire combat knife for low levels.  I am not sure if it benefits from one handed though.
---
I might be able to I am lv 103
---
It's not debatable,  Bethesda is the ones who stated that is how they are tracking the counts.
---
You simply say he's guilty,  I'm saying he could be guilty but due to the tracking could be innocent.
---
No point trying to argue the logic if your unable to comprehend it.
---
 The Vampire thing does not seem to do much really. 
---
 I have a Nocturnal, +40% Speed one and repaired to 200% it does about 130 damage. Its not for sale.
---
If you "drop" it from inventory. Instead of deploying it.
---
another bug is turrets simply disappearing and not refunding their budget &gt;:/
---
I Would LOVE ESO VR, but that engine is different and the assests, so I have been told, cannot easily be converted into VR.
---
Dabney Homestead has 3 copper, not one. That's why some suckers (me) deal with the lvl 65 regenerating gulpers over there.
---
Later iterations of the BoS in-game were pretty totalitarian for sure, which is sad since “older” versions (especially in Fallout Tactics) were VERY inclusive.
---
Hell, the original BoS was formed by soldiers revolting against an immoral, win-at-any-costs leadership - nearly the exact opposite of current interpretations, except for the tech-hording.
---
Look, its simple, if you put your base in a place to get 'ezpz loot and xp' for no reason other than you put your house there, and it looses me kills in my grand spot, im going to destroy it, deal with your choices.
---
That is not the right way to look at it.  
---
The team is SO focused on the VR version they have not had time to look at it.  
---
Not to imply they would get it working well after VR launched.  
---
Sadly MANY bethesda games are still broken or lacking patches of week 1 issues years later.  
---
So not to imply this is defandable or good. But it totally makes sense and is proven Bethesda may NEVER care enough to fix many issues.
---
people who put bases there are griefers, griefing farmers by auto stealing their kills
---
Tiny bunkers.
---
Is there any list/resource that gives a description of the thing the plan does, i.e. like the power armor modifications?
---
It isn't a fucking matter of perspective. The only time they made an exception to immediately rush a hotfix was when they fucked up badly enough that the stability of the live build was compromised due to overwrites from an outdated build. Thats not shit you put off for a week or two. Breaking a single mutation is something that can wait. 
---
It's all from the DLC roadmap
---
My poops are often clustered together... I feel your pain
---
This is awesome! I might check it out...
---
 I will kill him anywhere I see him. My present has developed a serious dislike for the moth guy. He should not have harassed him when he was new and weak. ;)
---
 Used a Sword last time.
---
Really? I've been torn between Vampire, Furious &amp; Anti-Armor. Heard Vampire's was really good..
---
Or vault 76ers beat them into retreating into the ground.
---
Fast forward to them coming out of the ground in "FO5: Scorchbeasts" dlc
---
Hmm - you must have the deluxe model! No display on mine. :\^(
---
There was a recall on the guard (suffers from kickbacks). Until a couple years ago, they would send you a whole new guard system, table top, etc. I missed it - by the time I called, they said that if I sent in the motor from the unit to prove that I decommissioned it, they'd sent me $100 gift certificate. I turned them down.
---
If that saw's gonna kill me, so be it!
---
All part of his plan lol
---
Yeah had this happen last night for a while. Normally it only happens inside whitesprings shopping arcade, but it was happening absolutely everywhere.
---
Now let me tell you I don't get motion sick, even with VR games. but this rubber banding in FO76 makes me wanna puke, the motion of it is too sudden and unpredictable. 
---
IGN Marked1 - lvl 77 add me
---
Big Thanks to Gopnikmeister! Got me thru it! Thank you!
---
Good use of the caps lock there, Highlander. But as I said, he built his based using foundation which means you can't actually damage it at all
---
and always use berry mentats
---
I have a Cultist Vampire and I dunno, it really does not seem to do much at all. I have not tested it enough to really know but using it a bit, it seems to not return much at all.
---
Guns still need a look over in terms of buffing and making it so guns don't break afters a minute of use.
---
I think it comes down to your style for the basic versions of these.  I was partial to the death claw sound and look.  However you’ll eventually find legendary versions, hopefully, of each or some other unarmed weapons and that ultimately will force your hand.  I found a 3 star knuckles and though a bit weaker in damage has things that make it more powerful than my claw and fist.  Oh and go for all the unarmed perks and eventually you’ll one hit most things.
---
They can feel free to
---
But again exposing inventories dont really tell anything 
---
 He dies pretty quick now. ;)
---
All glory to our benevolent ruler the Mothman!
---
There was a bug in our lunches 
---
Oh dude, dont block rare vendor spawns either, thats some bad manners. Its like blocking a hallway by grouping up with idle chitchat
---
I dumpster dive a lot. I love it. I find outfits a lot, rare ones like wrapped caps and asylum outfits. That stuff trades well. Then I've gotten no assassin sentinel but I have found, life saving, chameleon, and auto-stim sentinel pieces with AP refresh. Some players legit don't even know there is an inspect button so if it doesn't have the primary they want it goes to a vendor or on the ground without a second thought.
---
What system? I'll by calibrated shocks! Just need one more! I'm on PS4
---
I don't believe so. Scorchbeasts were always like that for me
---
Xbox
---
It is actually, debatable as we and everyone else is debating it. just trying to force your flawed logic as the end all be all won't work. If he was banned just for the shear amount of ammo to pass through his accounts in just 1 month his main account would have shown more ammo than his second account because on his main he dropped it, picked it up again and then dropped it and picked it up again which inflated the numbers. 
---
His main account would have inflated numbers because he had dropped it and picked it up numerous times before just passing it to the mule account. Which means he would have a huge amount of not only ultracite but regular ammo as well because in total the ammo gone through his account was 645.654k. That would be roughly 505.645 on just his mule account that passed through in a month yet he supposedly kept dropping and picking up ammo before passing it to that mule account. If it happened like you said it did How did he end up with 140k of just ultracite just passing through his main account?
---
last week he thought he was putting popcorn in for 2 1/2 minutes, ended up being 23 minutes and he walked away and forgot it. caused a small fire in the microwave. 
---
What platform? Xbox seems alright, just started playing again since the end of patch 4. 
---
Hard froze once today, so thats a little better than usual, better than fo 4 for me, id crash all the time I there.
---
The microwave is in his ass.
---
Near the turrets pointed where they aim?
---
Appalachia had a plague virus outbreak a few years after the war, but the survivors of vault 76 managed to stopped the plague due to constantly nuking the plague areas. Thanks to that the wasteland is rid of scorched, but Appalachia is stuck in a perpetual nuclear winter that is so savage for anyone to venture in the region, or anything to thrive outside this region.
---
This is my head cannon anyways
---
I feel like that logic only applies to ridiculous turret farms, not proper bases.
---
Where do I find him?
---
Then they would be a show referencing a game that referenced the original show itself - it’s be a Homer (Homega?)-level recursion of self-referencing 0.o
---
[Fallout 2 and I think Tactics had several Twilight Zone references in it.]
---
Pretty please!
---
In your heart......barring that, just northwest of Huntersville
---
I won't be playing until this is fixed.
---
This got me 2/3 there, finished up with more miners east of Whitesprings station.
---
Or they forgot to disable some content after CTRL+C/CTRL+V coding from the other fallout games
---
What is this playlist called?
---
Also if they have not fixed anything since last year throwing a grenade while holding them irradiates the user.
---
Also I got a legendary head, the radiation side effect doesn't work with it (I asume every legendary head works like this) and you can shoot it as much as you like with no radiation.
---
Is the charging working as intended though? Sometimes I saw no difference in damage between a fully charged shot and a barely charged one.
---
They are due to make an announcement.?
---
I hope it will be a fallout 3 remaster but they've said several times that it isn't something they are planning to do...
---
(I hope they change their mind at some point though)
---
Sneak/Snipe checking in, been playing since beta with this character and sneak is definitely broken.
---
Thanks bro, an on the real I I’ve wanted to make a PA shop just don’t have the time, and I almost changed my gt to turdferguson. 🤩😎 great minds think alike. Side question if you got the time what does Rng stand for, I mean I kinda know what it is but can’t figure the acronym for RNG
---
Agreed! I would "Prefer" It be a F3 Remaster.  
---
But I suspect it's FO76VR
---
After I got rid of empath I could just eat the attacks so idk
---
I do.  Share your pristine version pls o:
---
Allowing us to pick a icon and then change the icon text flair (like in r/Fallout) would solve this issue pretty quickly.
---
I don't see how hard it is to server hop. I have no idea where these rare vendor spawns are. I've never encountered one, never heard anybody spread any awareness about them. Just lots of circle jerking as people brag about destroying bases like it's justified.
---
Innocent mistakes shouldn't be punished in such a time consuming manner. It's stuff like that that gives this game a bad rep. Or any online game, actually.
---
Todd Howard also said that about dropping nukes.  Not trying to poop on your parade, just wary of how much some games will promise compared to what they can actually implement (Fable, anyone?)
---
Not how pacifist works
---
It does when the 'innocents' were holding massive amount of mats, consumables etc
---
Is this a titanic easter egg?  We really need a compilation slideshow of various easter egg scenes/setups they put in.
---
Let me grab a photo
---
I was in power armor and died instantly. 
---
I shudder at the thought of trying to fight a scohrchbeast in VR...
---
You need to get rid of adrenal reaction. In that process you might lose some other ones, but drink the adrenal reaction serum last to be safe. This worked for me.
---
Am I likely to get griefed by SBs? If so, I'm in
---
Canned meat stew from mama dolce's or cranberry cobblers helps you feel like you're getting a bit more out of the grind (+5% xp for so many minutes).
---
For a little while I was having EVERY legendary explode on me.  Surprised the f*** out of me when I finished of two or three swarms of mobs to have a dead mole rat nearly killed me!
---
Ah. I done fucked up. Alright. I'll mess around with it tomorrow. Cheers for the info
---
My stealth isn't bugged at all...
---
This is the most plausible explanation especially considering no one talks about West Virginia in the other games although it is a literal paradise when you compare it to the rest of America.
---
Yay, another member of the dinky knife fan club\~! 😋
---
Whitespring blitz. The less popular West Tek. And Watogo. I made the same "mistake". I chose perk/points to make the overall game easier, especially with regards to foos/water and general well being. I'm Level 92 now and I'm almost finished my respec
---
Why don't you put a bed under it, and make it look like it's supposed to be there? As far as unique camp arrangements go... You can have a wacky sitcom life with a ghoul roommate.
---
(Also, I love the look on your character's face.)
---
Where were you when I couldn’t find a right leg for any of my armor. 
---
Love this idea, do you install mods as a service, could be a cool idea. :)
---
Oh wait that's who Graham is? I've seen him consistently when I was level 15, but never anymore
---
Sorry, I’m not able to get on tonight... but I will add you next time I’m on and maybe we can run one another time together. Thanks!
---
This is happening to me on Xbox
---
No problem
---
&gt;Crop/rotate
---
Yep, fellow photographer. I want my photos in frames at my camp too, and I want photo mode to be not clunky. Catching subjects/players in motion in this game is really really hard, because the camera movement and adjustment is just so damned slow!
---
Like what if triggers zoomed or something? X or R1 is the shutter release (snaps the picture). Other buttons could select frames/effects/exposure. I get that its a game and can't be like my IRL camera... but just less clunky would be nice.
---
Give us the option to post to social directly from the game too! (Or a way to offload photos easily) You want good PR right? Photo mode could be an essentially free way to get it!!!
---
Yeah his name is  texascajun1987. Great shop I got an outfit from him the other day!
---
So in other words, you think you own a spot in an online game which people all paid $40-$100+ for. Interesting concept my dude. People can put their shit wherever they want to. That’s what the game mechanic is for. You just decide to get butthurt because “muh grind spot” People don’t need a reason to put anything anywhere. If they like the spot, they likenthw spot. They aren’t “your kills” either.  Jesus the entitlement with some people is unreal. You aren’t the most important person on the planet. Sorry you weren’t told that growing up.
---
I'd love to do that. It's kinda dependent on Flux availability
---
rank 5 demo expert and one well placed nuka grenade.
---
then shotgun the limping survivors
---
Watoga station vendor. I can mod yours if you are on xbox
---
Ok cool, np!
---
No not entirely but...  Well I have one turret overlooking a small spawn area, it has no trouble hitting enemies, but I've another turret above me on a cliff that cannot seem to ever see those enemies, it sees the enemies on the road that periodically spawn but doesn't ever shoot at them until they've begun damaging my stuff... Those enemies are about the same elevation so I feel like distance more than elevation matters (or at least factors into things).
---
But overall I think they react to [DANGER] only, so unless enemies trigger them, they don't seem to work.
---
Only in name
---
quests with a few branching options, some empty locations will have stuff added and tied in,  automation companions.
---
And thank you for being on here and communicating even on the weekend. I (and most of the rest of the sub, I assume) appreciate the communication.
---
You got some highlights on plans you do have?
---
Yeah, I'm kind of in the same boat.  I must really be down in a hole because I think I've only had ever one completely spontaneous visitor.
---
Hahaha I do love supporting some roleplayers. I need a new suit to put the Mothman paint on  (don't wanna spoil one of my other 8 suits). However i'm a bit different than others in that I like my suits to be mismatched. Would you be able to craft/assemble a custom suit for me? By the time you reply i'll probably have thought out what I want in my head. 
---
I'll have to rethink some of my builds. I've had certain areas normally available for all to use. I normally leave the Weapons Station &amp; Stash Box outside, you can scrap and mod a weapon, even test fire (being outside). Plus I normally have cooking and leave one of the Water Purifiers unlocked too. So, I do try to help out. :)
---
Look at and activate them?  Do they not prompt you to activate them when you put your reticule on them?
---
Did he curse you out in messages? If so, it was probably him
---
I just smash the door down anymore I mean why not I’m just going to end up wanted anyways and it’s way faster...
---
Easiest would be to melee Super Mutants at West Tek, they drop em fairly often!
---
1 shot them with an instigating lever action its lv 45 .
---
Ok bet, thanks
---
NOOO HUMAN PUNY
---
MUTTIE STRONG
---
STRONGER
---
**STRONGEST SUPER MUTANT**
---
Said their turrets.
---
Do the quest again on an alternate character and trade across, or buy it from someone
---
Yes the prompt is there but when activated they don’t emit light 
---
All of this, though I want new wall/floor textures more. :3
---
I'll join in on any Appalacian folk music they want to record their own version of. I'm no Opera singer, but, if the key is okay, I'm not bad.
---
 Whatever the gun/weapon would hit that target for, is doubled if its at full health.
---
 I use a Lever Action in my Crusade against Scorchbeasts and the Instigating Star allows me to one shot pretty well all the trash. Very helpful indeed. ;)
---
I know it's probably a stupid question, just wanted to clarify if it makes a difference where the spotlight itself is, or if it's just the light emitted that matters. So, thanks!
---
i guess my poops in this case would be my radaway and my glowing ones beating stick
---
You can also find the BoS Recon Rifle schematics at the terminal to the right just outside Fort Defiance. Comes with a recon scope, suppressor and same damage as the hardened receiver.
---
PC, but the thought's appreciated.
---
I'll have to head back to Watoga then...so many bots...sigh...
---
Where do you find Flatwoods monster? I tried Flatwoods and Abbie’s bunker (according to internet). And this one I saw today was my first encounter completely random in Toxic Valley.
---
I don't know what chem you took mate, but o want two doses of it plz.
---
It's by design that they'll let enemies run point blank up to them before they react *if* they react?
---
I honestly think they're just buggy, like most of this game was at launch.  Hopefully they'll fix them so they're actually decent like in Fo4.
---
All the unarmed perks? There are more than iron fist? 
---
doubt it. but would love it. maybe in a few years with better GPUs. 4 can barely run as it is. 
---
Where do you find that?
---
love it to bits tweaked and modded  I can't see beth bothering for a few years tho.  Their VR teams have a full plate as is.
---
I have a vampiric ripper so that's REALLY fun
---
Is it... is it because you're a murderer who makes chimes out of bones? 
---
WhiteSpring is still the premium place to level up if you can handle yourself, just keep hitting nuke zones .. WestTek if you have loads of stimpacks as super mutants can drain them..
---
Hey, I've got some spares I'd like to sell or maybe do a partial trade for parts that match what I've got. InertialCashew is my GT. 
---
I guess I'll stick to warframe then. I don't even play it much anymore but once in a while I get on to try out the new stuff or make some broken riven combination to one-shot everything
---
Bethesda should count its prayers that players like you persist onward.
---
server hop until you find it nuked. make sure your well rested and have some xp food. i got 8 levels one run from whitesprings before.
---
Just go to the fountain in whitesprings right by the tennis court  by the gild club to clear your diseases for free
---
Damn I was unaware of that armor! Nice. The real bad thing is I run deep pockets on my marine armor so I can horde off as much junk as possible lol. Well, not anymore at least! The 10th time is the charm I guess
---
It's a sulfur foubtian. Complete game changer.
---
Is this fr or are you just messing with this
---
 I kinda quit fast travel. I'll certainly do it for a good reason, but generally I walk. So, I walk to The Whitespring from deep in the Mire everyday. I run into him in the ridges between Berkley Springs and Big Fred's BBQ.I have killed him 3 times in the last 10 days or so.
---
 He's probably scoping out Missile Silo Alpha. ;)
---
Nah my door is locked so enemies don't waltz right in and chew up the furniture.
---
However if you jump from the nearby low cliff onto my second story (don't even need marsupial mutation) you'll have access to my interior.  It rewards explorers.  But my junk extractor is permalocked, if you need supplies just ask, I like sharing...
---
  I fail to see how it effects anyone negatively, where as duping clearly does.  Banning seems a bit ridiculous and patching this seems way down on the list of shit that needs fixed first.
---
Says the Base Foundation Exploiter who is benefiting from it.
---
Lmfao  I don’t want sympathy and no ones throwing a tantrum (I feel gay just typing that) I am only making the clear statement that there is no need to be a dick...PERIOD. If someone is not my enemy... why would I want to steal from them!? 
---
We don't have that button.
---
We have lightly pushing stick.
---
Take a few ranks of Martial Artist and try again. 😋
---
I mainly use a 3\* Instigating Combat Knife, but I have a 2\* Vampire's Combat Knife (both serrated) that comes in very handy when my HP is beaten down.  Super Mutants are especially good for this, as well as landed Scorchbeasts, because you gain HP faster than they can deplete it.  It complements my Vanguard setup pretty well.
---
Same.  My hunger and thirst meter drain is ridiculous even unmutated and fully healthy.  I want to play the game, not micromanage my irradiated Sim.  :/
---
Not quite the same, but there is the shrouded mod for the wooden armor bits
---
What about paints? Can we buy sets or pieces  with paints or no?
---
Lol! Sure if you say so 
---
On what console? If xbox, I'm willing to help you get started!
---
Just sent you a friend request. This is pretty amazing!
---
Well, if it starts to crash servers, then we'll see them delete all blocks above one high and leave only the bottom rows and then... they'll ban the builders. Something tells me this is not going to become a huge problem. I guess while they are at it, they'll go after all builders that place fire rings down and then plant or place water purifiers inside buildings too. Such evil little builders in this game. LOL
---
Does anyone else see a resemblance between the lines on that map and some depictions of the Elder Sign from the Cthulu Mythos?
---
Its been that way sense day one 
---
It's probably to hear the mothman as it creeps onto his patio.
---
If I go into either Whitespring or the bunker back entrance, on average I can get half way down the hall with the shops or all the way down the stairs, then it snaps me back to the entrance. 
---
I’ve made a game out of it to see how far I can get. I’ve gotten all the way to the armory vendor before getting snapped back once, and all the way to the shop with all the crafting stations once, but it’s usually not *that* bad. 
---
But those are the only two places I experience it. 
---
It’s not a habit. You like an objectively bad game. 
---
You also are comically defensive about it. I think that says a lot. 
---
Only fix I've seen is to drop and pick back up your fusion cells to make it work as intended, and apparently you'll need to do that again if you put it away in your stash.
---
So in a fallout community that came together to stop dupers that all made a whole "thing" out of fucking with dupers and stealing their stuff to the point that it's one of the sole reasons we're not seeing content updates in the game as much 
---
You're telling me banning everyone who has ever had a shitload of stuff really the way to go? And again if you can buy and trade things who's to say EVERYONE knows to stay away from people selling buttloads of crap because they are dupers 
---
I'm just saying yes everyone isnt innocent but obviously Bethesda screwed the pooch and instead of fixing this they said fuck it made it worse and swept it under the rug with the roadmap announcement 
---
 Nope, don;t even know how to do it, just not concerned by it.  I have a simple base made with metal walls I don;t even bother to lock.  I don;t see a reason, never had my base messed with.   You sound like a salty duper who got banned.
---
Yeah, I have a furious ripper that just melts enemies. So much fun.
---
Solution? Dont use an assaultron head. its shit anyway. Youre better off with a Tesla Rifle
---
Green Thumb
---
Want this ya
---
Random Number Generation 
---
Nope. ONLY t51b Nuka Cola and T60 BoS 
---
I got a dead dude that lives near the rock next to my camp. Never goes away. My camp has vegetation growing through it, even though there's a solid concrete foundation. No matter how much stuff I drop on it, it clips through everything. Pretty obnoxious.
---
Where did you get the actual toilet plans?!
---
Wendigo, still haven't dealt with it. Level 87 and tops scared to go even near it. I see it and I server hop. No exceptions
---
The game is awesome... We've been locked away in these vaults until a time recommended to go out an explore. The worlds population had no way of all surviving and sadly... some died. We are finding the tales they've left behind and I think the audio tapes are a great way to tell the story. I've followed some of the journeys to see where they've gone and it has been an interesting journey so far. I've also ran into others that have come from the vault and we've teamed up and traded stories and helped each other out as we explore together. We also protect each other from the wilds and troubles that pop up. See you around, I'll give you a wave. These Scorched and Mutants never wave. 
---
I’ll play gt Mbiigstuff, be on in about 15
---
Destroyed a level 25 there while I am a 160. No guilt in doing it. I find mind if they are far away from the back but not close 
---
The spotlights are a "2nd set of eyes" for the turrets and possibly see a bit further than the turrets.  I use 3 turrets, sort of in a triangle pointing in to scan the inside, my extractor and purifier.  My spotlights scan outwards.  A deathclaw wanders around inside and they all target if he agros, but I don't have to go outside my camp to kill anything unless its a "sniper" mob with a shotgun shooting from 10 miles away.
---
Find a friend, share/put on Inspirational Perk (+15% xp when in teams), eat cranberry cobbler, become well rested, then murder Whitesprings ghouls, Watoga robots, or if you're looking to get resources out of it too, go take 3+ workshops and continually defend them from enemies, just be wary of what server you do it on as some people go out of their way to pvp workshop owners cause they're sick in the head and can't comprehend the concept of vault dwellers working cooperatively.
---
yeah , I dont lock anything in my base but turrets are way too costly when making a cool base and trying to stay in budget .
---
dangit, I left out a word.
---
I shot a mothman and it disappeared.
---
Turns out it fell off the cliff right behind it and died.
---
*It can fly*...

They formally acknowledged my other post which i made 22 days ago.

" Thank you! Yes, we have the assaultron head in our list. I don't have a date for the fix for you but I know it is being worked on as well. "
---
Which is why im asking again because if it was already on their list and being worked on.... well.. where is it? I've got like 4 different variant's i've been dying to play with. Anti-Armor Explosive, Quad Vats, Bloodied and so on. 
---
Okay thank you for letting me know!
---
Great story! I love it when griefers get wrecked, their reactions are always the funniest.
---
Ha thanks man, I'm trying to get through all the requests 
---
It won't involve Valentine. The Invesitgators Cabin terminal actually tells you the name of the investigator involved and that he works for the BATDFL.
---
Mine's not bad. Then again, being a Melee build I run two with me most of the time and I also swap in some guns as well. So I got my All Rise after hitting lvl 50 to get the max I could and I run one of the Gronx Battle Axes (Instigating) and both or hot keyed to switch around. So I spread the use out over multiple sessions. I do my best to never let it break and when I have time and its past halfway used I try an repair them both. So I never feel like its an issue or that I'm going out with only one weapon.
---
You can pacify them too, which can thin the swarm temporarily 
---
You want air raid sirens??

---
Here ya go~
---
That's the one
---
Fallout 4
---
Huh. I have 3, and 3 Incisor. Muties die very quickly. 
---
 Scorchbeasts I used to kill with the Blade of Bastet but now I have this 3 star Shiskebab that's much more flashy. 
---
 You have a point?
---
Probably looking for armor!
---
I picked up bunch of stuff from time to time as I myself used to hunt dupers as well. Difference is, I dumped those items and they didn't
---
I can probably kit what you need!
---
What do u play on?
---
Yes. I'm lvl 105 and never did any pvp. 
---
Gotten a little further, I definitely agree in terms of the storytelling. Found a few tapes that have hit me pretty good. Maria's last words were so sad and hard to hear. Feeling like I'm finding my place now. See you out there, fellow wanderer.
---
I think you gotta use imgur? I never do it to be honest. I'm just curious cause I basically run up to people in their base to sell them shit pretty regularly so I'm familiar with a lot of the more popular spots.
---
Yes that is true but its still broken while used in stealth. Which is what i planned on using the weapon for since you can charge it. I do use the weapon quiet a bit but the bugs surrounding these weapons is so annoying. At least for me there are instances where my ammo goes back into the left column. I don't know what triggers it but im always going back to my stash to get another 200 ammo since i forget it does that. 
---
I just hoped that this weapon would have been fixed already. At least 1 of the 2 bugs over 3 weeks. 
---
 I have the 3 Fireproof too, but its magic. "Come on, got any more missiles?" ;)
---
Don't need to be afraid of higher lvl players. Nothing in the game makes those of us in the 60+ range auto attack low level players. Everyone is pretty nice and simply waves. We've just played a lot more and we like to help out. I'm often giving things away when I meet people, like water and stims too.
---
There's a robotic wing in the enclave bunker and a bunch of robot repair stations that are unable to be used but remain interactive.
---
If I were a betting man I'd say we're getting small robo friends at some point. Gotta do something with all that stuff from the FO4 DLC.
---
turn on pacifist
---
It's a trade-off.  Vampire, on average, will require more stabs to kill something than Instigating, Anti-Armor, Furious, etc.  But you're getting HP in exchange for those extra stabs, so it's a situational thing.
---
I got the notice about the same time you did, and hadnt actually gotten anything. I sent in a followup reply which is still unanswered, but I got the atoms a week after that anyways. 
---
In true 76 fashion, even the good things they do aremore or less coated in shit lol
---
I mean... Even before the roadmap coming out, I liked 76. I actually like it a lot. I was just afraid that they were going to abandon the game. Now that it seems pretty obvious that they aren't going to abandon it, I am very excited. Your opinion that they haven't earned it is fair, but my opinion is that they never lost my trust... They just got me a bit worried when they took so long to come out with a roadmap.
---
 Oh maybe that's it. They die too quick. ;)
---
&gt;Lol. Stop.
---
I had a instigating Tesla but got rid of it once I hit the next level requirement for it. As a rifle build, the Tesla rifle is the only weapon I have good for huge crowds other than grenades and I really like it personally
---
If charging the weapon just stacks the damage per charge, my quad is gonna charge 20 times and hit for 2000. All though i wouldn't mind a "broken salvaged assaltron head" that does what your talking about. Do 25000 damage in 1 shot for all your ammo. Would be neat. 
---
Ironic. They are downvoting you right now
---
“What the fuck dude quite being a fuck ass hole”  
---
“Stop ‘Seek Revenge’ then haha”  
---
“You are a fucking a dick”
---
1. Turn on Pacifist mode on reaching Level 5 (it's a Gameplay setting).
---
2. Don't take Workshops, because they allow other players to instigate PvP with you.
---
Then yes, it probably was him
---
DuPeRs were just a scapegoat all along for shitty servers. 
---
I still get daily crashes and DCs
---
If all these comments are for real maybe it’s best I didn’t loot it. I spent about 10-20 minutes chipping away at it’s health and getting instakilled by the thing (nuke zone glowing one). If I got a fuckin crippling cane I’d have lost my shit. LOL
---
Do you have any stealth-boy mods?
---
Only for each assaltron head you have on hand. Like you gotta drop your ammo then pick up like 100 and load it. For each one. I have 4 so its a tedious process.  
---
After that they work fine except for not working in stealth to good (same stealth bug as guass rifles). 
---
Probably 
---
Just today I ran into:
---
Bullets clipping though enemies.
---
Vats missing at 95% consistently and hitting at less then 10% 3 out of 5 times...
---
Social list 'fails to sync' making it impossible to invite to team or join a friend on the same server.
---
Two griefers who took 3 of my 5 workshops then harassed my friend at his home (cause I blocked them from session and they couldn't find me).
---
Using that blocked from session mechanic to steal back a workshop without them being able to find me, only to be found after 5 minutes of them searching, then they 1 shot me at 400 damage resistance with a tse shotgun.
---
Mothman that fell off a cliff right behind it after I shot it, didn't get xp for it cause it died despite being able to hide.
---
My camp turrets barely work.  My workshop turrets are the same.
---
And to sum it all up, my workshops wouldn't even tell me when another Player was contesting them so I'd walk into pvp expecting pve.
---
Do not recommend buying yet unless it's under $20.
---
What I do, lock all doors, then put up concrete barriers all around. Nobody's gotten into the building yet without lockpicking / trying to destroy the barriers. Can usually get there and reset before they can do anything about it.
---
Hadn't heard this one.  That's crazy.  
---
Turrets also fail to work more than half the time. I need the lock to keep ghouls and super mutants out too.
---
PS: My base isn't that cool, and my bed's no more comfortable than the one at your own base.
---
I don't understand why they seem to think it's a bad idea to play solo,  everyone else so far seems to be doing great and has given me wonderful advice and I'm not feeling quite as lost as I was! 
---
Although I am a she not a he, lol 
---
I get on a couple of times a week, mostly on the weekends. Gt is frznwolf
---
That is a good point. You are forced to load those weapons. Could be the same. A dangerous game to play thats for sure. 
---
Actually got that in reverse. Red is stalking and yellow is vengeful. 
---
Yellow is the only one I've ever killed twice because it fought to the death. The stalkers always teleport away before I can finish them off XD. 
---
But he can't be killed...
---
 You still can get griefed tho bc weapons still can do crazy dmg with stacked up bobbleheads... was nearly killed the other day, even tho I didn’t fight back 
---
I think I've just been unlucky and they've already been looted from most places! 
---
I really loved FO3, but a base game price of $60 for a remake of it seems a bit high, unless they did put a lot of work into fixes and/ or adding new content. The story said 3 versions, so if the base is $60, that would -likely- mean a $80 and $100 version? For a remake? Unless they do put a lot of effort into it, that seems a bit steep to me.
---
Darn but I mean those are still pretty cool. Expected a request of a T60 set with BoS or I guess depending on caps. I'm willing to pay probs up to 2k caps
---
Contesting workshops isn’t griefing. But I do agree that defending it is justified, and the way OP dealt with it is entertaining. 
---
This was the first time shooting a legendary that was given to me. Just wanted to see what it did. Apparently it uses all your ammo at once. 
---
Oh cool, not sure I've stumbled across mama dolces yet, what is close by so I could have a look? 
---
Thanks!
---
I think the point is that they shouldn't need a spotlight to find enemies right next to them.
---
I believe there is a broken assaultron head you can pick up that does the radiation damage thing you speak of. My legendarya don't give me rads though.
---
The charge damage works for me. Not in stealth though, does 0 damage in stealth since im technically "1 shotting" the enemy and it bugs out. 
---
I'll do some testing right now, see what i can find then come back to this post and let you know. 
---
I don't have parasites, and it feels like I have to eat and drink more. I run the perks that help in this regard, but I wonder if the got nerfed or bugged.
---
if you do the quest "Mayor for a day" the robots stop attacking you
---
Most likely a port of 3 with 4/ a “special” edition of 3.
---
Always been too scared to claim a workshop after a bad experience, however I got lucky with a quiet server earlier and managed to build a steady amount to do me.
---
Cool, will do next time I'm on :) thank you
---
I was wondering what that space station was about. Found it early on and got the spacesuit from there. Wore it my entire gameplay (except for when the story called for it)
---
I simply don't understand why we can't just respec points at will.  This would encourage people to try different specs.  It would soften the blow when they nerf your favorite perk/weapon/whatever.  Find an interesting weapon that you want to build a spec around?  Give it a try!  Have some fun!  Worried people are going to respec in the field too often and abuse it?  Make it so you can only repec in you camp, but really who cares if you can respec freely.  If someone wants to repec every 5 mins have at it buddy.  If it somehow becomes a problem then put some sort of restriction on it.  
---
Yeah, that's me. It bugged out, adding to the pile of other issues both introduced in the same patch and pre-existing (some of which have been fixed now).. but I just decided to take a break, wait for them to fix it and maybe come back to the game down the track.
---
Sure will be interesting to see what comes from this. I just wonder if anything we place in a camp is locked to keep from being picked up by people visiting. I'm really looking forward to placing items to sell as a feature just the same.
---
After preordering Fo76, will never preorder a Bethesda game again.  Why spend $60 when you can wait 2 weeks and get it for $30...  I seriously want monetary compensation for that dirty move they made...
---
 I have been slightly griefed once in about 150 levels across 3 chars. I wrecked his CAMP after he killed me, not unfairly I did fight back, but was in farming mode. I came back with a martial setup but he was gone, but after a while I noticed he was not far away in one place. in the woods. His CAMP.  So I snuck over and tossed Plasma 'nades in his cheap ass door. I backed away hoping he would come out and fight but he fast traveled away. ;(
---
 I did exactly 100 caps bounty and went to find my nemesis. ;)
---
I have never had an assaultron head use all my ammo, and I periodically pick them up and use them for shits n giggles. I am on PC, so maybe somehow it's a console bug? Or legendary bug? None of mine are ever legendary. 
---
I picked up a million pounds worth of stuff all together caught over 15 dupers
---
Welp I'll be adding windows tonight. 
---
And that's the rub... it's no longer a Two Shot really and more a One and a Quarter shot. The base damage should not have been nerfed. If it does 100 dmg, then a two shot should have done 100+100 an they could have simply nerfed the explosive part. That's my opinion.
---
The thing is, it still is bugged. If they were to compensate us now, it would be pointless until it is properly fixed.
---
While I am aware that it is a visual only bug if you reapply, it still has further damage reduction and over damage boosting features to it. Such as scaling the damage boost with the hunger meter.
---
You decided to take your chances keep those duped items? Or did you just dump them?
---
I dumped them 
---
You should put a chair where he normally falls in the hope of catching him.
---
I heard so much I have multiple characters
---
So you banned?
---
Have not seen this happen, then again I just like that I can go down there an walk around and haven't really attacked the robots. I tend to think of it as Whitesprings South. :)
---
I *looove* when this happens.  I **haaate** people.
---
I appreciate your help, but nothing is working for me haha. I've tried everything minus a clean install. I'm just going to wait and see if they fix it on their end. 
---
I was at an SBQ fight last night around 4am pst. Everyone was crowded around some barricaded brotherhood site right outside the nuke area and the SBQ was just hovering above everyone in the same spot letting us all get free shots on her (think she got stuck in the tree). Don't know if this was the same SBQ fight though. 
---
It was only my 2nd SBQ fight, but you kinda have to just sit there and wait for the spinning arrow to finish loading in loot for her in particular. The first time I did the fight I felt cheated also, but after letting it load for like 2 or 5 minutes my loot popped up on her. Same thing happened last night but I waited a couple minutes for it to load and got my loot again. 
---
$60 for a remake is steep, I agree, but it'd be more justified for an actual remake of the game rather than the likely scenario of just a remaster on newer consoles. I didn't consider the other two versions though, unless the extras were good $80-100 is really steep for a remake (and seeing how underwhelming the extras for the FO76 collectors versions were I wouldn't count on the extras justifying the price).
---
I think it's just because I have ran into a few not so nice high level players, I've mostly just avoided people! I'm not really much of an online player for that reason but hopefully I can change that
---
It's really nice that I've been given so much advice and that everyone commenting seems like genuinely nice players so that is encouraging! 
---
So thanks :)
---
How is tattered dress a "hard mode" outfit? It is, just from an objective min/max sense, the *best* outfit in the game.
---
I had to unplug my kinect for this very reason, no one wants to hear my 7 year old commentate on the game. 
---
Yeah whenever I'm lurking in that area I try to stick to the robots
---
If you’re on PC and can settle for having a T-51b torso, I can craft that for you. Shocks for T-51b and T-60, too. 
---
You think Armor needs further buffing? Really?
---
The only reason I wear PA anymore is carry weight, but now they are adding backpacks for non-PA use only there is even less use for PA. Already there are several perks that work only without PA. Stealth is gimped in PA, and you can't make many of the meta builds (i.e. bolstering/unyeilding) work with PA.
---
Radiation resistance is always raised in this conversation; 
---
The scorched queen is commonly killed outside of the nuke zone, zero rads. That's all that needs to be said about the argument that end game forces PA.
---
Their is a more indepth case that dismantles that argument. I have an armor chest piece (trapper) with 87 rad resistance. Its very possible to get to about 200 rad resistance with just armor. When you add drugs and perks, you can skip through a nuke zone in regular armor as easily as anyone in PA. Rad Sponge and Sun Kissed perks when shared with groups can alone make radiation a total non issue.
---
Regular armor does not offer a niche, it offers the strongest flexibility in build design, and in most cases is far superior to PA simply by virtue of mods and legendary traits which enable you to make any kind of build from a explosion immune tank with resistance that exceeds PA to an invisible sniper that does ludicrous damage with every attack and can't be seen by enemies, ever. And yes, you can even make a build to waltz around in nukezones if you wan't.
---
If they buff regular armor any further they will need to add legendary PA pieces because once backpacks are added to enhance carry weight in armor, PA could become little more than novelty skins with a fuel cost. 
---
I fucking hate mole rats, annoying little bastards. I eat every one I kill just to send a message. Also, Gunship all day! 
---
I just love my downvotes lmfao like it was such a neutral statement and people hate regardless 
---
Explain...
---
That's my point. We should be compensated every time they make a change that would require us to remove and reapply it. That just makes sense to me anyhow, because of how much of a burden doing that is if you have even a modest number of mutations. But waiting months and months without even a semi-functional adrenal is also not acceptable.
---
&gt; a dead dude that lives
---
I know what you mean but that phrasing is hilarious.
---
On groups of enemies its pointless since the explosive will do even a little radius damage if theyre close, negative the full health double damage to any nearby. Only useful if youre shooting enemies away from each other
---
they removed stacking 2 patches ago...
---
If you put a piece of furniture there would it keep him from spawning? Consider it a decorating challenge.
---
The munitions factory has been crazy this week. I've had to defend it every time I've held it.
---
I'm used to facing duos now, the hardest part is killing them both before they can travel back. I faced my first 3-person tactical team this morning. They were coordinated, and had 1 sniper, 1 melee'r, and 1 shotgunner. We traded kills for probably 30-40 minutes, before I got my factory back.
---
Might have been the most fun I've had at a workshop, period.
---
Yeah. He's always home, but he keeps to himself.
---
Welp, shit. I'll give it a shot anyway, it's downloading right now.
---
My pvp story is I killed someone who was shooting me and his friend started to blow up my base he was level 170 or something like that but I killed him 5 times for a lot of caps 
---
Still canon :P
---
 I was not advising them to avoid High level players because they are a threat, but because they make the MOBs higher level.
---
yup. Learned that the hard way.
---
This happened to my friends.  They had to sit in her room and listen to her talk and then click on her multiple times.  She talked and talked.  Then finally progressed the mission.  It took a few minutes.  
---
Snallygastors aren't rare.. so congrats on the rest..
---
with the shotgun mod, it seems to benefit from the shotgun perks as well, so my charging tesla Rifle is actually brokenly OP right now lol
---
true, I was going to wait for a fix, but once I noticed a few days passed, I kind of felt it wouldn't be coming until months. 
---
FYI, they ninja nerfed it, and once it is completely fixed, the nerf will show a gradual damage reduction that results into a -15% damage.
---
Someone on the comments on the link I provided put down a chart for the change.
---
Oops my bad I got a lil confused 
---
I try not to be hard on lower level players trying to take my workshops. I usually just stimpack them and give them a frowny face.
---
 I expect they may not know the mechanics yet, but if they're in a team or 50+? I don't give them a chance to fight back, they have to expect what's coming (mainly, my AA Dragon, and a vats crit I've been saving).
---
Nah level 89, gamer tag same as my reddit name
---
Nice concept. I personally prefer something more.. Orbital Strike proof. :) 
---
It's real, I was on it earlier.  
---
I was gonna post a link, but they took the listing down.
---
Hope they fix it soon, just found a Two Shot head.
---
Actually, this is not a bad idea.
---
The short version is: No, it's not possible to avoid PvP in this game.
---
The long version is: I've played a couple hundred hours now and only encountered unwanted PvP a couple of times.
---
For the following explanations, solo and grouped are the same thing. I'll use "team" to cover them both (so if you're solo, you're a team of one).
---
The PvP generally works with a system called Slap Damage. If two teams encounter each other, and one of them shoots the other, it does a small amount of damage (slap damage), and if the other team shoots back, both those teams are then able to do full damage to each other. It's kind of like a dueling system - those two teams will still only do slap damage to other nearby teams, unless those teams shoot back as well (and so on).
---
The game gives you an option for Pacifist mode (which should be renamed, because I shoot everything PvE in sight lol). Pacifist mode means you can not damage other teams. That's an important point to note. It does not mean that you won't be PvP enabled, as there are numerous ways in the game to become PvP enabled even while Pacifist mode is enabled.
---
If your team attempts to take a workshop will flag you for PvP with everyone else - they will not do slap damage if they attack you.
---
If your team attacks someone elses camp, it will flag you for PvP if you destroy anything in their camp. I haven't explored the limits of this new system, but a friend of mine has a theory that this may be easy to do with a stray shot still, if the item that you shoot has been damaged enough by previous attacks from others.
---
If your team joins the Hunter/Hunted radio station.
---
As I mentioned before, it's important to note that Pacifist mode prevents you from doing damage to other teams.. so if you do end up flagged for PvP, you can't actually  do damage to the enemies.. so you'll have to go into options and turn it off if you want to be able to attack.
---
So, having covered all of that: My first week in the game, I had two people just walk up and start shooting me and my camp - I did not respond and eventually they got bored and went away. I've played a bit of co-op with a mate and one time he accidentally shot someones camp while shooting at some mole rats that spawned on us between us and the camp - we didn't even realise the camp was even there until we walked through the scrub afterwards. It gave my friend a bounty, and sure enough someone started chasing us around the map trying to claim it, eventually destroying my friends camp completely just out of spite. Other than that, I've never had any PvP/griefing issues, but it's fair to say, it could happen.
---
My advice is, don't let it stop you from playing: the game is great if you like just roaming around exploring and clearing out locations, and there's a reasonably interesting story and sidequests to go through as well. Keep Pacifist mode on, avoid workshops and random pickup groups (but don't be afraid to join groups, just make sure they aren't going to PvP etc) and you should be fine most of the time.
---
You have a nice amount of loot. I should have saved my caps.
---
Confirmed that it ISNT him
---
So I can get any armor including ultracite and X-01 for 75 caps a piece!? And fusion cores for 24 caps!? :D
---
hmmm it appears to be just visual cause my weapon definitely wasn't doing the damage number it said it was
---
Something like this one ( ;-))? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Enough_at_Last?wprov=sfla1
---
Yupp
---
I remember in development there was talk of neo nazis but they didn't make it to the game proper... are you referencing that?
---
The bottom line is if you want it truely fixed post what it is publicly. Thats the bottom line. 
---
u/lonevaultwanderer acknowledged it to me after I PM’d them a couple months ago. Said they were working on it. I had sent a video of it still suffering from the enemy health regen bug, which it totally still does have happen.
---
I’ll link my video evidence if anyone wants to see 
---
Wow. So basically, you could farm masses of low level mobs for repeated stacks? 
---
Eep?
---
 "I will not do this. I will not do this. I will **not** do this. I will....."
---
not sure what you are talking about, but I can team wipe a group of high level power armor users any day with a lever action rifle and no PA.
---
As for pve, sneak and 1 shot anything and everything. 
---
Ohhhh shhhiet
---
I sing when I play. I sometimes also have my mic on. I had one guy shout at me to stop singing. Jerk. I would love love love a karaoke mod. It could even be lore-friendly by being on the inside of PA helms. 
---
I'm in need of Violet Flux as well.  My psn is Nitrojin.  I'll trade for some junk legendaries I have.
---
I hope they add a mole miner suit costume at some point.
---
I will be using it for just this purpose.
---
I had to remove 7 mutations and buy them back from Modus :( 
---
I haven't reapplied Adrenal yet
---
I have a bloodied one with a charging barrel.  I love seeing a big cluster of enemies :-D
---
How much is just the plans for the T-60 B.O.S paint, if I can even only buy the paint plans and not armor
---
Thank you! I’ve been offline for a little while now. I’m going to log back in and be persistent. 
---
Full auto? Where'd you get that?
---
Have you heard him mention all the different types of meat?
---
Mine is bloodied as well. I left that out 😎. 
---
Craft that shit dude
---
No. I'm going to go look for him next time I'm on. Thanks for this. I have another excuse to seek him out.
---
Ive been trying to stack up my 5.56 lol, usually i get a pretty decent qmount from super mutants and scorched, but uve qlways been spending all my gundpowder on crafting them lol
---
Play Fallout 4
---
I scrapped so many tesla rifles in my 600+ hours of playing that I guess I discovered it that way. I just started using it 2 days ago. It's a lot of fun!
---
Gladiator, Iron Fist, Martial Artist, Incisor, Makeshift Warrior, Adrenaline, (Ninja, Sneak)...all these help maximize an unarmed build.
---
Gotta love those Copy Paste troll comments
---
After a long mathematical sentence from another redittor, he added up that it would sum upto 70%.
---
Neither are Grafton monsters. :)
---
One S of charleston station, and that neverending quest by the Grafton mayor.
---
Full suit for 300? My mans
---
Yup I have all these, just wanted to make sure. 
---
The Brotherhood as Bethesda shows them isn't the actual Brotherhood.  The ones we see in 3 are against the real brotherhood because they're out helping people, and the Brotherhood before then just stayed underground and avoided the world unless they were collecting and preserving technology.  No help, no harm, just trying to be invisible - unless you had something they needed or you wanted something they had.   The "Outcast Brotherhood" in 3 or NV (i forget) were "outcast" because they refused to be this new Bethesda brotherhood, they wanted to go back to the old ways.
---
Fallout 3's friendly outgoing Brotherhood was lore-foretold in Fallout Tactics, where a group was exiled for wanting to help others.  They were sent from California to the East, in airships.  Some crashed or made it to the east coast, the game follows the group that landed in Chicago.  They embraced helping everybody so much they had Brotherhood members that were ghouls and supermutants.  
---
In 4, Maxon takes over by getting people to back him by saying he's going back to the old ways, but he doesn't.  He gets them to stop helping people, but they're still outgoing (more than ever, with loudspeakers announcing their existence!) and has twisted the Brotherhood into a genocidal killer organization that no longer preserves and collects technology, but fears and destroys it instead.  His is the least "Brotherhood" of any Brotherhood incarnation.
---
76's Brotherhood is supposedly created from locals listening to the California OG brotherhood's radio transmissions as they're created.  The Fallout 1 Brotherhood isn't even fully formed yet and hasn't left their bunker.
---
Same lol 
---
Wait, charging barrel you say?
---
or vice versa, commonwealth in 76

That sucks, Super Duper isn’t working for me any more either after the latest patch. All I get is ONE extra no matter how much I craft. Just crafted a bunch of stable flux after a nuke. I had 211 raw fluorescent flux, in the past 30% means I should probably get 28 stable flux. Nope only 22 total even when I have Super Duper 3 equipped. 
---
I thought so. Maybe try to actually dump them next time?
---
I don't have any, but I have learned them and can do the paint for you. They're pretty hard to farm, relies on a very lucky drop
---
That's a low level suit, mind you
---
I'd like to see the video. That way its in this "up to date" thread about the issue. 
---
I'm also in dire need of Violet Flux, however if you have Ultracite 5.56 ammo I'll take that as an alternative.  I have some junk Legendaries to trade, as well as some other things.  PSN is Nitrojin
---
I guess the banned players are his menagerie.
---
What do you think would be the best for a non-melee build? I'm an smg medic, but I just want a good combat knife.
---
I *think* I still have T60 level 50, I know I have a level 40 full set. I can easily add the paint. 
---
That makes sense, whatsa higher level look like? 
---
I don't. I am definitely looking to buy plans for them, though. 
---
 What do you think would be the best for a non-melee build? I'm an smg medic, but I just want a good combat knife for killing low level enemies mostly.
---
Yup, there's a charging barrel and a charging shotgun barrel.  Both work similar to the gauss.  I've ramped my charging barrel up to around 1k damage.  
---
Absolutely screw that quest.
---
20 colonel gutsys, 15 scorched, and a scorchbeast later, I just noped right out of finishing that quest, and honestly I don't mind robots aggroing me.
---
Now that's a starting price. I have a few X-01 parts that are level 40 that I just want to get rid of for that. 
---
I use a quad auto Tesla. It's also one of my favorites even if it's only a one star.
---
All you need to do is use Google and find a number of posts from CMs commenting about bans in public either to the user directly or about the bans in general. Blizzard does and has commented about major bans, especially ones about banwaves. Just look at when Swifty got banned from WoW. Look at when Rextroy was banned. Rextroy IS an instance of Blizzard publicly discussing a specific user ban. You're just talking out of your ass.
---
Bethesda DOES owe the public some kind of conversation about their recent bans, especially to the users that are legitimate and got banned. It's destroying the image of the game. I mean, they don't have to do shit, but by taking no action it just cements that Bethesda doesn't give a fuck about its userbase and less people will want to play their game.
---
Yeah I did some more research after. Interesting stuff, not sure why they've used a stock video as a teaser. Hope it'll be a fallout 3 remaster, but the chances are incredibly unlikely
---
isn't that exactly what the next questline is about?
---
I don't go above 500 caps for full suits, but mods can get pricey if I have to go buying flux. 
---
Are you on right now? A friend of mine on Xbox at Twbeavers added you and is looking for service
---
Time-warp? It's the only way I can see the story progressing. IF it's our continued story at all.
---
I'll be on tomorrow if you want help GT: BLUBLZRedeux
---
My maaaaaaannnssssssss

---
Like adaptive camo, not so much active. Could default to grey indoors or something.
---
Maybe the bonus could be Targeting based? Players have a harder time targeting you in vats, or maybe npc enemies could have reduced accuracy on you or something like that.
---
Did he mention if that was percentage based damage mitigation perks. 
---
I Imagine the benefits are asymptotic rather than linear i.e. the closer and closer you approach the hard cap the less and less benefit you get from each additional piece. 
---
I had to wait till I was much higher LVL and use Power Armor, when I never do because I'm a sneak sniper. Which obviously is a horrible match for that quest
---
 Yeah every time I go there lately. I yell at them but I'm just another old man. ;)
---
Dang. One day I will meet him. 
---
this game has so much potential for building. I can't stand playing Sims at all but LOVE building. Conan exiles has triangle pieces to build with that one up so many possibilities.  their building is superior but I don't love playing Conan (no real content) and I don't even like playing Sims...but fallout. bestill my heart.  I am so looking forward to more build options and more budget!!!!!!
---
300 to 400 
---
Yep I'm talking to him
---
People have glitched underground with cooking stoves and build bases where they can see the whole map from the bottom.
---
Umm.. no?
---
The total of 115% gets boiled down to 70%, however dodgy can close that gap to a 100%
---
Not that i like people building there, but that responder vendor bot can spawn other places not just there
---
Sweet. I'll have to check out your business later this week as I'm trying to complete a T-51B. But if they go for 100 a piece I'll have to save up
---
Fast travel back to Vault 76 and just explore in a spiraling circle out from it.  Have fun and stumble into cool places. 
---
I have the same issue. Launched a nuke for the first time solo because no one would accept my team invite despite sending messages prior. Launched the nuke and not a single player came after I wiped out everything. Pretty unsatisfying. Just ran around hoping more would spawn. Wasn't worth the cost on that run. Won't do it solo again. 
---
Hah!  That's funny to think about.  However in-game lore says the robots went hostile cause of a disgruntled robco programmer.
---
Seriously though, I don't think they're scorchbeast nests, if you pay enough attention you'll notice scorchbeasts leave their mark on the environment, there's even a destroyed house in the cranberry bog that legit looks like a scorchbeast turned it into a personal toilet (giant chunk of the house is missing with a big guano pile at the bottom of the wreckage).  They're more destructive than they are constructive and those watoga heads are definitely littered with what looks like raider spiky poles, and trash somehow compacted all together into a shell of junk.  Now the hell is any sane rational player supposed to take away from that?  The city is hostile since the day before the nukes dropped.  BoS, Responders, Raiders ALL avoided Watoga like the scorched plague.
---
Who made those structures?  How?
---
There’s a strange whipping noise that I’ve encountered in several areas: in the Mire, in Charleston DMV —two places that come to mind. Anyone know what causes it? I asked a team mate if he knew what the sound was and he said he didn’t hear it. Strange and eerie. It puts me on guard. 
---
Exactly. He has many spawn points and charleston station is one of them
---
Where's the pantry? Gotta store them MRE's somehow.
---
I have a full T60 with only a leg being lvl 40. Can I sell you it for 0 caps, you add the paint and sell it back to me for however much you see fit??
---
BLUBLZRedeux I'll be on Sunday if you still need help
---
Cost more then that to buy from the rare vendor. 
---
Are they really two separate things?  The wikis seem to have this consistently wrong if they are, because they only list Semi-Auto, Standard, and Charging Barrel as the possible types (with Standard Sights / Reflex Sights as the only other modifcations).
---
650?
---
Definitely acknowledged and certainly true, but anecdotal evidence from players seems to suggest this is the most common spawn location by far. That being said, it's anecdotal, but that's all we have to go on at the moment due to a lack of official stats. At any rate, I can see your point. 
---
What are other spawn points for him? Is the charleston pond just the most common one or the easiest to server hop on or what?
---
I have a two shot head and it works ok as long as you do the ammo work around.
---
I also have an explosive lvl 35 that is decent too.
---
Nice thing about legendary versions is they don’t irradiate you for some reason 
---
Sure are.  I had the charging shotgun barrel previously, but I wasn't thrilled with it as I'm running a bloodied sniper.  Found a mod just called Tesla Charging Barrel for like..50 caps on the Watoga Vendor.  It dramatically improved the range and damage.  
---
all the wieght perks on strength, so she will never have to face the agony of being overencumbered.
---
If you’re on PS4 I can sell them to ya cheap. 
---
It is amazing combined with Marsupial. I never wanna come down....
---
But you'll want Power User equipped to reduce Core usage as those puppies'll eat those Fusion Cores up.
---
Really, Instigating is good fun.  I'm mostly melee, but I would say that when it comes to low-level enemies, I'm actually more likely to use the Tesla Rifle these days because it can dispatch several low-level enemies at once, and I don't have to get my hands dirty.  The drawback of melee, especially in 76, is that it's rather time-inefficient to go up to each enemy, stab them, and move on to the next.  4 had the ability to hit several enemies when they were grouped together.
---
https://youtu.be/9-AFywI188A
---
Sure thing. Clear as day. Check the health bars. It makes no sense 
---
You gotta do some google searching for that. But as far as I'm aware, people server hop around charleston because it's the easiest place to get him to spawn
---
It's not the fucking solution, it's impatient idiots making more work for themselves and then bitching about it. The fucking solution is to wait until they actually fucking fix it. 
---
"I dumped them"
---
it boggles my mind after this all...that's an "end game goal" is to...nuke stuff.
---
it's so silly.
---
Use super duper level 3 and ammo Smith level 2. Collect gunpowder lead and steal. You'll never run out again. After crafting, just switch those cards back to combat ones. Huge quality of life fail on Bethesda for the perk card set up, but worth it. 
---
Ill do it for 1500 i paid 1000
---
Yeah I guess there's no going around that. How is it broken in stealth though? Does it deal damage and they recover it, or does it just hit them without doing anything at all?
---
Bet
---
You didn't HAVE to do anything. You chose to not wait for them to actually fix it and even stupider you chose to pay full price instead of just paying 200 caps a serum from someone. 
---
The enemy level on the map are generally based on the geographic location.  Therefore if you stumble around in the lower areas you will pick up side quests in those areas and take a crack at events in the area. The more specialized your build becomes the less difficult/significant the gap between your character and higher level enemies. Also, generally you will pick up better weapons and armor which go a long way though the have a base level requirement, particularly power armor in PVE. 
---
When I started off as a sniper character once I was able to get a handful of perks for rifle damage, sneak, sneak damage/vats, along with a solid silenced sniper rifle the game became significantly easier. If you’re a melee character you’ll reach that point much sooner. 
---
I just dumped 50. Kept wonder why I couldn't manage my stash weight and then it hit me. Those suckers were sucking up alot of weight and I don't have a use for them at the moment. So I dumped them 
---
How far is far enough? If I’m up the hill past the hay bales, is that too close?
---
Yes.. for duping
---
I only have 1700 caps I’ll give you some ammo just not 5.56
---
Add me BLUBLZRedeux. I'm level 82 but still have alot to learn
---
Thanks for all the help, do you if the additional reduction is exclusive to dodgy or is it applicable to lone wandered and blocker as well?
---
Judging by your post history, you are an exploiter so.... probably you didn't
---
There was enough room for jack!!!
---
This place and Whitesprings Club House are the only two places I destroy bases. 
---
You seriously expected a hotfix to fix a single fucking mutation? The ONLY time they have ever hotfix ed the game was after they compromised the live build by merging it with an outdated build. If this is getting fixed its getting fixed in the next patch and no sooner. 
---
Wait, it's working again :-)
---
It costs like 950 from the vendor and of course any1 selling will want profit because the vendor is random and the item doesn't always appear in the inventory, so if you're finding for 1.5k then you'd be very lucky. Expect to be paying 2-2.5k
---
I had read Molotov's can help with bringing up mobs stuck underground.    I gave it a go.   I can say it works every once in a while.     Whether this is due to the Molotov or just coincidence I do not know.
---
From what I've personally seen, you'd be good up in that area. Seems like it's only settlements that overhang and/or place purifiers in the pond itself. I can't guarantee that 100%, but I've seen a lot of these pond settlements and I think that's how it works. 
---
The question is does the person have hard bargain on?
---
yes and planters I mean we saw them in the preview of the game I'd love to have them in standard game
---
Try the middle terminals
---
Accept invites to teams as often as you can. Higher levels will share perk cards with you and most will not even mess with you unless you need help. I have alot of stuff that benefits me when playing with a team. 
---
Ah crap there goes my theory. Guess I should get around to doing those enclave events more often.
---
You weren't required to do shit. It's a bug. It will be fixed when they fucking fix it. It hasn't even been a mother fucking week and you're bitching that you're going to be waiting months. You're a fucking drama queen. 
---
nice
---
Sure
---
wow not sure why your autism is kicking in, but point of fact, mutations working are an important part of the end game, even having to remove and reapply them once is too many times, but we all know it won't just be once that this happens, and it wasn't players that came up with that solution, it was a bethesda rep. 
---
Do you have the outfit? I’m trying to get it for my friend since whenever he tries to buy it someone else buys it cause his menu glitches out and kicks him out of the trading screen or it’s just not in the inventory 
---
yup I've seen it. I would rather see it buffed and bloodied weapons nerfed myself.  Anyone who wants it can get adrenal, and the full negative isn't even that bad. Oh well.
---
lol yeah
---
I've bought it with LVL 3 hard bargain, it's at like 900-950. I'm just telling what's the standard market price. Doesn't matter if you think they could've gotten it cheaper, or you want it cheaper. I've sold them on the marketplace, I see them sold on the marketplace. I always see them going for 2-2.5k and I've sold a couple for 2.5k
---
It's a bug .since December. And is refundable
---
Lol i knew i wasn't trippin 😂! Apparently yes, no matter where the placement is it moves randomly.
---
Is your GT your reddit account order?? Mines ununoctium118
---
Do you have any on you and if so how much for it?
---
I don't have an extra. That shouldn't happen, the inventory is different for different people, the vendor doesn't work like other vendors. If they someone sees the hunters coat, it doesn't mean you'll see it or that they took it from yours. However the inventory changes if you re-log, so you and your friend can take turns of relogging into the same server off of each other to keep rerolling the inventory
---
You guys got any excavator mods?
---
Ok
---
Alright cool, thank you. And it’s a damn shame...it looks so nice, but I don’t like workbenches just in the middle of my garage 
---
They have a microphone stand to go with the various instruments.
---
Might be a good game prop for this idea.
---
Yea this has been going for a while lmao just go to a different terminal 
---
Craft your ammo.   With Ammosmith maxxed you will get 36 rounds each craft, add in Super Duper for more.
---
Go to the Lucky Hole Mine for your lead.   Collect the ore while wearing Excavator power armor so you can get more ore.   You should come out with 200+ ore.   Smelt the ore while using Super Duper.   My last run 220 ore worked out to about 750 lead scrap.   Yes this requires acid, more on that below.
---
Steel you just collect weapons and scrap them down.   Use the Scrapper perk if you have it.
---
Gunpowder is acid and cloth.    The cloth is pretty easy to collect but the acid can be a pain to scavenge.   You should probably set up on an acid resource node or take a workshop with it.   Make the gunpowder with the cloth and acid while using Super Duper and you should end up with tons.   You make quite a bit from the average craft attempt.
---
so its the jetpack from gta 5 all over again :P
---
You should get 1 straight away if you offer 2k, but if you want to try 1.5k you might get it after a while but you'll just have to wait and try a couple times
---
Wow that was very specific, thanks man! 
---
You're welcome
---
Does the atom shop load fine without mods amd without Fallout76Custom.ini? 
---
Do you craft the parts? I didn't know there were PA piece plans out there.
---
I believe someone posted recently that building here does NOT affect the spawn - he will spawn on the other side of the road.
---
Now I want Man of Constant Sorrow in game. This dream will never be realized. 
---
If you close the game and go back in it fixes it.
---
Although I like the idea of a community driven hub, the free travel to my camp makes it better to place to have a good ways away.
---
Lol no dear, I really had to because otherwise my build was screwed and Adrenal is what I was using to boost damage no op weapons here. Ironically once Adrenal finally fell off after the other 6 and I reapplied the others and went farming lo and behold the rng gods blessed me with a top level Bloodied Lever Action. So in the end it worked out however I am very leery of reapplying until it's fixed.
---
Headed there now. You on xbox? Let's go full auto Tesla on everything!
---
Bethesda has a player trading hub in its future roadmap 
---
As a temporary solution for you patience less twits. It's a fucking bug. It will be fixed when they fucking fix it. Reapplying the mutation isn't even a real fix because the effect is still not properly registering in the fucking effects screen.
---
You fuckers can't even go one patch without the mutation and you're crying like little bitches about how big bad evil Bethesda is going to take months to patch it and crying about future bugs that haven't even happened yet. Grow the fuck up drama queen. 
---
PC or I totally would 
---
Some MODUS got banned for duping.
---
I imagine either a giant glowing area of nuclear craters or...
---
Nope, just a giant glowing area of nuclear craters.
---
Still has some issues and bugs, but I enjoy it.  I play solo and is still fun, but yeah definitely more fun playing with friends.
---
I may be on PC soon. Stand by.
---
I'm drunk look up
---

---
this is what i mean. i'm clearly wearing power armor, but its also showing that im wearing armor wise. sometimes it shows this, sometimes it doesnt. sometimes i get the pocket effect added to my total weight even. its really screwy.
---
Weightless wood armor plus camaleon
---
Right now I farm them; I'm looking to get the plans, they are rare drops from Cranberry Bog treasure maps. I can craft T60 right leg and T45 right arm only. 
---
Yeah and the operative underarmour clips thru outfits too. Annoying 
---
not sure if this is true, but I never came across such a thing and all I do is pvp.
---
Although, I upvoted just incase it is, I think it would be a shame if this exploit become a thing.
---
Praise be the Mothman! 
---
Same thing happened to me everyone was using anything they could think of and after 2 minutes she stopped taking damage 
---
True, but I think both are getting the similar change. 
---
That Sensor Array sure is
---
yup, that is why I did the roulette and slapped on those serums.
---
On another note, serum crafters best update. They be dancing in caps lol
---
It is applicable to all of them.
---
Make possible to shoot down a missile at the launch silo as it is coming out of the ground....
---
The hub is Whitesprings, always people running around. I do a lot of deals there. Always at least 3 houses somewhere on the green too
---
Well, TIL it's been three months and they still haven't fixed this.
---
Okay I'll give it a try ! 
---
Hm.. That makes sense.
---
How did you get damage that high? I have a two shot tesla and my damage is pretty low
---
Yeh for sure I play solo 110hrs love it worth every second so far 
---
As i see this as a good idea, but without a proper in game restriction, it would just harbor loads of griefers.
---
Which would eventually push away the concept. I see this happen with many players that actually run vendor shops, and once they gather around more than 5 players. One has to be a dick and begin blowing up the vendor's camp.  
---
Yes, they get murdered afterwards, but the vendor leaves the server and we all have to move to go along with our business lol.
---
Artillery helps as well with killing them if they spawn underground from my experience.
---
I have to imagine that as the Brotherhood traveled east to the Capitol Wasteland, they must have sent a detachment into the area to determine the fate of the "Lost Chapter of Appalachia".  What they found...well, there's a reason the entry for Vault 76 remains classified in 2277...
---
But yeah, no Scorched, nuked-out wasteland, the remnants of Ultracite tech kept under lock and key.  (If any survive.  Gatling Plasmas don't appear in the BoS arsenal on the East Coast for a reason, I imagine...)
---
In my experience the glitches in most cases aren’t bad ( today my game crashed a few times) when it comes to exploring after you do Flatswoods exploring is a bit of fun personally I’d go down to Charleston that general area kept me busy for at least three or four hours or just pick a road and stay on that and you’ll be surprised where you may end up. When it comes to going solo it’s definitely doable they only things I’ve done in a group was launching my first nuke but besides that solo is definitely possible. The last thing I’m going to say is don’t play it like other games sort of follow your curiosity because it in the end may surprise you what happens 
---
Happened to me on pc twice. I just decline and then return to the main menu and try again.
---
Yeah she seems bugged right now
---
Bloodied, Adrenal reaction, perks, and being nearly dead ;)
---
I play solo and most of the people are very friendly, what i do is give a player a machete, pipe pistol and some ammo and aid. Also what platform do you play on?
---
It's the quick fix for the Modus dupe exploit
---
Hmm.. that's interesting. I'll have to check it out next time I'm on. If that's the case, I'll just nix this post. Thanks for the heads up.
---
Man that's amazing. I tried hording PA when I first started 76 to the point I had 17 full suits before I was level 15. Dubbed myself the Powa Arma Farma and was ready to trade and sell to other players when the dupe wave hit. Needless to say I fell away from that dream a long time ago. Maybe now that player vending is going to be a thing, I'll be able to get back into that idea. Would be handy to cuz I'm PS4 and I'm seeing a lot of need for it in the comments. Will make a post for you guys when I've collected some suits to sell or trade. PSN account King_Karnage117
---
Nobody MADE you preorder. That was done by your own free will. 
---
That's just a stock response at this point especially judging by fast you came with it honestly you looked at my post history saw selling and bulk and used them as your base trigger words 
---
But if you actually read the post they were low and high level weapons with a few 1 stars 
---
Where did you see this? I saw that they will add "player vending", which sounds to me like it's just a vending machine you build in your camp that people can buy stuff from when they come across your camp.
---
Modus dupe?
---
I thought I saw it on Bethesda.net, I might be wrong tho
---
Up until update 5 you could have a friend buy the same item at the same time using different terminals. You had to time it right. I really hope it wasn't that easy but yeah you could do it
---
Define Game.
---
Damn this game broke asf lol 
---
Alternatively, there is a good amount of Iron Ore Veins around HornWright Test Site 3 where you can get around 100+ Iron Ore with excavator power armor. So you'll need more acid for this but probably more easier to do this than scrapping down weapons. Capture Hemlock Holes workshop for acid.
---
If you want to SELL power armor mods to other players, it's worth it only if you really make a job out of it.
---
**If you just want a few mods go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar.  Players there will put mods on your armor for caps all day every day.**
---
Like I sell calibrated shock for 1,000 caps per leg (if you provide mats) and jetpacks for 1,000 caps (if you provide mats).  So if all you're looking for is a jetpack and calibrated shocks on a set of armor, you walk out the door with 3,000 caps total cost.  Or you could go buy both plans for 10,000 to 13,000 caps total cost.
---
X-01 mods are only available as mods at the Enclave Vendor.  There are no X-01 plans in-game.  They upped the spawn rate so hop the vendor for a while.  If you get tired of hopping, again go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar and just buy the mods off other players for caps.
---
That quest is one of my favorites. I just wish it wasn't a daily so I could actually complete it. Every time I get started on it something happens and I have to log out.
---
Grafton is doable at your level. I think your quest is help the mayor of Grafton. Challenging, but doable. 
---
Yeah, that's what happens when you give a relatively new team of developers the code to an aging (maybe not outdated but def aging) engine and then tell them to make it do something it never did before. I hear the Skyrim Together mod is having similar issues lol
---
I did it solo and it was very time consuming. Definitely suggest doing it your first time with help
---
Big Bill Hell’s Power Armor Dealership
---
BLUBLZRedeux. I'll be on Sunday afternoon. Never done it with help before. Always solo and it's daunting. 
---
Yea Bethesda isn’t necessarily used to making multiplayer games from this lol still love the fallout games tho buying fallout 4 tomorrow they should really update the engine it could fix so many problems but it’s probably not that easy if they haven’t done it 😛
---
There are three layers of clothing: underarmor, armor, and outfits. They can all be worn together: one underarmor, which can be upgraded; 5 pieces of armor, which are leveled, can be upgraded, and can be legendary; and an outfit, which is purely cosmetic and just covers everything else up. 
---
*Except* the tattered dress. It is the only outfit, to my knowledge, that has any kind of bonus. Even if it's only +1 perception, that's 1 more than any other outfit. So whatever upgraded underarmor and legendary armor you wear, putting the tattered dress on top will make you, mathematically, 1 perception higher than if you wore any other outfit.
---
Side note, there's also a few costumes that take up all thtee layers, like hazmat suits or the Garb of Mysteries, but since these don't let you wear anything else with them, they tend to be bad except for very specific circumstances or builds, so they don't really have any bearing here.
---
Good to know lol , unfortunately I can't build or repair until I get them killed 
---
Yep. In roughly 275 hours of gameplay, I've only had a few instances where someone tried to push PvP on me. Most players will either ignore you or be friendly and helpful.
---
Overall it's definitely a very nice group of people to play with.
---
in one of the previous updates they made plans static at all vendors, jacking up the prices in the process. if you’re on xbox i can get you one for cheaper :)
---
No thanks.
---
In EVERY survival game that allowed this..........people used every way they could to block off entrances / loot / POIs  and basically make cities unplayable.
---
Thanks I am my gamer tag is invalidchain900
---
Hit me up and I'll help. I get bored and no one wants to team up. GT BLUBLZRedeux
---
Wearing the tattered dress unequips all your armor and under armor items. How is this the best outfit from a min max perspective if all my unyielding gear comes off when I put this dress on?
---
Gotcha, well that's if you're defending a workshop lol. Orbital strikes have been hit and miss for me when it comes to clearing a workshop in the case that something like that happens.
---
So vendor slots with restricted zones is a no go?  What games have done this?  I’m curious?
---
There will always be people who hate. No matter what the reason, or season, they’ll never be happy or satisfied.
---
I’m gonna just start blocking them
---
A mutant killer legendary or an anti armor works best, but when I was level 40ish I was rocking a hardened perforating suppressed combat shotgun and it was pretty good for mutants. I had as many VATS crit and sneak perks as I could get at the time and sneaking and hitting them and retreating and hitting them again worked.
---
Try over at r/Market76 you might have better luck there
---
Just farm them for free 
---
Persistence worked! I loaded in, listened to Rose’s holotape, activated the jukebox, and then spoke with her. Thank you again. 
---
Thatsthe route. Grafton has a vendor north of the train station that has PA plans that I like to buy then sell to gain back some caps. 
---
Red, green and yellow. I've killed all three. I ran into the red one in the wild twice. Green I only ran into once. Yellow seems to be the most common for me as I've managed to kill him 3-4 times. Red and green we're tough because I was probably underleveled at the time. Over 100 now and never had a problem face tanking him as a sniper.
---
That's what I noticed too. Regularly many people show up to take her down, but not this time 
---
I basically only played the start but this reignited my hope so when is it coming and is the game now stable enough that I should start leveling?
---
I’m not tall enough yet to do pvp but I like reading these. Please keep them coming
---
I haven’t experienced a single griefer on PS4 and I’m lvl 66. 
---
Thank you thank you 
---
Bethesda doesn't seem to think anything through.
---
Whitesprings is probably going to be the hub.
---
Why is that a problem?  Now you've got TWENTY FOUR people per server all trying to find land to build in that one area.
---
People are going to get pissed because they have to server hop 15 times before their base spot will be available in a specific server.
---
No problem!  You'll put your place far away from that!  Nobody will visit it, everyone will go to Whitesprings.
---
That's not even mentioning the MASSIVE amount of griefing that's going to go down with vending machines in camps.  Just walk camp to camp and destroy every single vending machine.  They'll laugh when you claim their piddly 200 cap bounty, only now nobody on the server has operational vending machines.
---
**They should have just made the vending machines indestructible terminals all in one area that's a no build zone.**  No problems with players having to fight for land and no griefing.  You could shop ALL the terminals in that server in ONE convenient spot!  Then if you'd like, hop to another server and shop ALL of the terminals there too.  Fast, easy, fun, grief free shopping!
---
How so dumb
---
I play solo and am still enjoying it. Even if my friends did play, I usually play late and have to leave at any moment (young kids), so teaming up wouldn’t be good. My MMO days are behind me until my kids can join in. 
---
3 month old post with a damn good explanation on how to do this. I'm just getting to this part of the game and was stumped but this helped. Headed to the silo. 
---
It's like those guys know there's danger above lmao ! 
---
I've been playing solo and been having a decent enough time.  However, Fallout 76 respawns enemies very quickly.  You won't have much to tide you over besides shooting, looting, building and exploration.  If you didn't like FO:4 I would stay away from this game.
---
Between the Hortnwright and Garrahan mining companies, you say? I think I know what that treasure might be...some fucking paints for the excavator armor for once :(
---
Just had that happen at whatever workshop has 3 gold deposits.
---
Had the WHOLE server to myself and thought I'd claim a few.
---
Nope, that one had enemies in a wall, under the ground, who knows where.
---
What would help solve it?  If they'd STOP trying to be tricky on where they put the enemies so you have to hunt for them.  Put them all right next to the bench.  If you've killed everything within 50 feet of the bench and it still won't let you claim?  You easily know to move on to the next server or just stop trying.
---
Instead we run around like like idiots trying to find enemies that aren't killable or don't exist.
---
Dude thank you so much for going the extra step and doing this work! I will update my post as soon as I can with this linked and my info updated.  Thank you so much! 
---
Go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar tradiing reddits.
---
Sell some stuff.
---
Buy some ammo.
---
It's easy :)
---
So. Much. Butthurt.
---
i might not be able to get on today though, tomorrow for sure. how does 800 sound ? 
---
Bruh you haven't seen my 3 star legendary railway spike tho
---
Damn
---
Same happened in the last queen I did
---
I’m on PC often + am in PT too! IGN is same as here add me when you’re around 
---
Happy to have helped!
---
They “fixed” her loot. Not. 
---
Jump on the circular window out of power armor. Then click the prompt to sit in the chair and you'll clip through the window. Getting in there is old.
---
Yeah, the two and three star legendaries give out an astounding amount of trash loot. Not saying I've never gotten anything nice, but you mostly won't get anything nice from them. The odds are never in your favor.
---
Yes, this! It's not the players it's the mobs they spawn. 
---
Haunted workbench, idk, sounds kinda cool ;)
---
still selling serums?
---
The prime is worth it on (some) Zealot's prefixed weapons or so I've been told. 
---
I feel like there is a pun there with trouble, shooting, wood and your arm but I'm really drawing a blank here...
---
Oh thanks sorry for posting 
---
I know right. Not enough legendary rolling pins
---
Why not also toss in the 2 melee mutations? The weapon accuracy thing isn't that bad even in vats since perception is so high
---
Stay stealth/invisible the entire time someone is clearing a silo.  Wait til they've unlocked the ability to target and launch a nuke.  Kill them so they respawn outside the silo.  Put the nuke where you want.  With no slap damage mechanics it's entirely possible.  
---
I don't mess with PvP, in games that have PvE I vastly prefer it.  But I could see the above happening in 100% PvP servers.
---
wait what? What vendor bot? I've never heard of this.
---
I'll play. BLUBLZREDEUX
---
Dam that's aweful , sorry to hear that . There's so many workshop bugs it's hard just to avoid workshops altogether   
---
Deals damage and they recover it. Its not a legendary. Happens to everything. Its like the guass rifle bug. 
---
The only consistent way I've been able to kill them is plague bearer. The aoe damage from plague flies a good job of killing them if you can get close enough. 
---
I’m in for field medic trophy I sent u a friend request, psn same as Reddit .. have to wait till tomorrow night though
---
No it doesn't. The **Garb of Mysteries** (the one you get from doing the quests) unequips your armor. It weighs 1 pound, has +1 perception, some bonuses to stealth, and has DR and ER which can be increased by re-crafting at higher levels. The **tattered dress** (which you can find on various corpses around the game, and looks just like the Garb, except with no ruffles) is an outfit. It weighs 0.1, has +1 perception, and can be worn over armor like any other outfit in the game.
---
There isnt. It's just funny that the Scorch Beast Queen gave me that.
---
I see junk components EVERYWHERE i go. Watching a movie - office scene - "omg, look at all that springs and screws!"
---
Happens to me all the time and I have to shut down the app and restart it
---
Try to always play with a team. There are many benefits. You don't necessarily have to actually play with them but you can use each other to fast travel around the map when your bored. Wish more people would accept team invites. 
---
lol says the guy that has to repost his screeching multiple times.
---
Ahh thanks. Sorry I was referring to garb of mysteries in my original comment. Sorry for the mix up but good to know about the tattered dress!
---
Oh?... Ooooooh *wink* *wink* *nudge* *nudge* say no more, say no more
---
You are allowed to build in Charleston 
---
Delete your fallout76custom.ini file in the game folder in the documents folder. If you don't update the archives list in the custom ini file every game update with the new list pulled from the fallout76.ini it will not load the new texture files they put in the list with the update. If you're not using mods at all you can just delete the custom ini file and the game will go on without it.
---
Using the repair function in the launcher won't fix this BTW.
---

And lots of fuel and grenades from doing level up exploits
---
You can see where in my camp post
---
I have a two shot Tesla and not sure what to do with it. How should I mod it? Commando build currently.
---
I don't have friends on here either but I've met quite a few that have helped me out tremendously. I first started ignoring team invites but no longer. I will always accept an invite these days not to actually play with them but to just share perks and fast travel for free. Sometimes they want help so it gives me something to do
---
I've done three this evening without issue, so, hopefully, it's a one-off bug, and your next fight will go better.
---
Yeah, I remembered after I posted, I did the post more for a laugh, but I put calibrated shocks on everything. 100 pounds of carry weight when I am overweight is awesome. I mainly use the plus 2 strength torso mod. I may look you up when my alts get to 15 though. I hate having to do the friend server jump thing and pray that the friend I use didn't get dcd while I was swapping toons. It has happened too often for me already. 
---
So far I've learned the auto and charging semi-auto mods. There are also shotgun and lobbing grenade/mine mods. The Reflex sight s the only sight I know of.
---
The auto fire mod does not gain from riflemen or at the least not a single master rifleman lvl 1 perk card I used that did increase damage for the semi-auto(standard mod) and charging semi-auto mods. I do not have a Auto weapon dmg perk card to test but  I suspect the Shotty mod not to be effected either and both are instead increased by the Auto and Shotty perklines. I'm interested in doing some tests with the lobbing mod when I eventually learn it.
---
Base dmg no perks max lvl Auto 63, Standard 78, Charging 108. Auto and Standard have 15 rounds the charging is 8 rounds. 
---
I've also noticed that some of the wolves are starting to look a lot more like "dogmeat" and less like actual wolves.
---
Haven't had one code not working yet with that site

Seems to be a random thing. Able to damage/kill one, but not the next one.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ab0zc0/psa_how_to_hunt_the_rare_charleston_vendor/) is a post from last month on how to hunt the rare vendor. It's essentially just a vendor-bot random event that appears around the Charleston area. It sells rare clothing that's coveted by a lot of players. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a6iq3j/travelling_protectron_sell_list_for_anyone_whose/) is a list of the clothing he sells (although he only sells 2 random pieces during any one appearance, albeit unique to each player - aka they are individually instanced to players).
---
hallelujah. I'll try and stop in tomorrow and browse the stock
---
If you want enemy drops for low cost the Charleston capitol building is great when it's full of super mutants or scorched. When it's full of ghouls don't bother.
---
Sorry was commenting on PS4, the xbox 1 and PC have gone down also (38.00 for both on amazon right now)  And the keys through 3rd party services go even lower I believe on PC.

BLUBLZRedeux level 82. I'll always accept team invites just to share perks. Will only interact if you need it
---
yes i have a tamed yaogui myslef what of it?
---
I'll make you some if you have the mats 
---
Well, that’s why you pay people caps to protect your camp when you’re Vendoring. 
---
Not trying to make you feel insignificant, but people have been asking for this since launch. Anything they are announcing at this point has probably been on the works for a while now.
---
That being said, anyone making suggestions and giving constructive criticism is helping the game in the long run, so keep it up!
---
I only lock mine when I'm beating off. I'll leave it open just for you next time
---
Grahm obviously has senses that non super mutant traders lack.
---
Try to understand what an undertaking that is for someone with even five mutations (a relatively small number). Radaway and pray, with the potential to have to buy back several mutations. That's not an acceptable burden to place on players every time you change the way a mutation works. Please come up with a solution or workaround. Here are some options to field to the developers:
---
a. Cheap serums that remove a single mutation of our choice.
---
b. Code that scans for old non-working mutations and automatically removes them.
---
I'd like to point out it's 2 very diffrent pictures where 1 contains a big field of wiev and the other a small one. I´d asume if you lower tree and grass distance in the ini file u'll get better fps you can also reduce shadows a tad. But yes when it comes to optimizing range of load is off the charts on fallout76. 
---
If I may ask what program u runing to get that display in left cornor though :)?
---
I did not know that, seems I've a quest to do while I'm there then.
---
Scorchbeast Queen is broken right now, the health points were messed up in patch 6. Before patch 6 the prime receivers made a difference but lately I’m not so sure anymore. 
---
And I def prefer the Handmade over an auto combat rifle, pretty sure the rate of fire is pretty different maybe? Combat rifle isn’t really meant to be an auto gun anyway in my opinion 
---
Dude!! I've lost almost 20% of my budget to turrets I can't get back. Have moved camp and tried everything else I could think of. Now I worry about using them AT ALL because when one blows up, that's it. I have no more budget to make more, and I can't repair them. Their just... gone. Except for my budget of course. It still wants to say I have 8 turrets when I have 4
---
Solid suggestion.
---
It would be difficult if you don't understand the game. Watch some YouTube vids so you understand the perk cards. 
---
This is childish. 
---
I have found a few traders just north of New Gad, east of the workshop Lakeside cabins, in the dried up lake bed. It’s very visible on the map, and centrally located.
---
Also a good idea would be to have a designated workshop for trading. I always go to defend events and it would drum up business without having to message the whole server.
---
Thoughts on this??
---
yeah it's obviuosly connected to the field of view but still the game doesn't utilize my pc power.
---
Display is the combination of MSI afterburner and riva statistics,
---
“ I no murder you, if you no murder me. “ favorite quote from him 
---
Diffrence is combat has twice the magazine but like 15% less base dmg. 
---
I miss the Pipboy radio mod that I had in FO4, where you could make your own playlist. I could blast Super Mutants while blasting Metallica's "Enter Sandman." So cool. 
---
That seems excessive. 
---
Honestly I'm completely on board if this is intentional. It seems a good way to tone down these absolutely ridiculous weapons.
---
I listen to spotify if you have an xbox
---
I had moderate success fast travelling away far enough that the game unloads the cell then walking back (as long as there is no one else in area).
---
Often upon my return I will find them above ground wacking away at whatever structures I have built.
---
Last night was my first queen fight since the patch and 9 of us could barely scratch her. We had heavies pumping thousands upon thousands of rounds into her while two melee characters super sledged her and her health didn't budge.
---
All in all, we managed to take off about 15% of her health and most of that happened in the first five minutes. Pretty disappointing.
---
This literally happens to me every time I go to fight it one time we had 7 friends in the server 3 were over lvl 100 the rest were well over lvl 60 and we all had more than enough firepower to drop her twice but she just would regain health and stop taking damage. Sadly I still have yet to get the achievement to slay her.

Arktos Pharma - remember there's recipes for creature attractants on the first floor that don't do anything, and machinery to drop ingredients in. I bet this gets filled in.

No need to apologize for being excited! I was super stoked when I first thought I figured out how to get in there! I posted to reddit and a few other spots and was treated pretty rudely. If my comment came off as rude I meant it as anything but! Have fun exploring! Happy Hunting!
---
"Aaah, I hope you bleed GOOD!" I didn't know Grahm was that bloodthirsty, but he does say "Murder is just ok" after all. Looks like he'll have to add "super meat" to his meat song.
---
please seek help. you shouldn't make threats like this.

he still wins, cause you’re here posting about it

There is wisdom to be had there.

The artillery box duping was patched within hours of it exploding - pun intended - after going public.

---
Isn't this how pretty much all games go? Especially game released around BF / Christmas? I decided a long time ago I would never pay $60 for a game again, unless the pre-order bonuses are ridiculous. 
---
It's always nice to get a deal, but I'd also like to support one of, if not the best game developer in existence. Doesn't bother me at all paying more than others. There's only like 5 franchises across 3 big names I would say that about.
---
You obviously aren't mature enough to have access to the internet or adults. 
---
I can honestly say I didn't know what to expect because I knew some major structural changes would have to happen in order to implement coop. So I was pleasantly surprised.
---
Actually a little disappointed in that they tried to do too much - I think the game would be more stable if they had actually scaled things back a little. The fact that my client is guaranteed to crash at least once during every Whitespring nuke event is pretty infuriating.
---
Also disappointed in the 400 lb stash limit to start - that made the game literally unplayable, that was a bad choice. My best friend never plays now because she never could get into the game because whenever she get on she literally spent the entire time managing her inventory and it wasn't fun. Another bad choice was to put the beta so close to release that when it became clear the 400 lb stash limit was too low there wasn't enough time to fix it.
---
So what disappoints me about this game is the bad decisions in the beginning that lead to me not being able to share it with my friends. I'm a hardcore fallout fan and will put up with a lot just to get to experience the fallout world. My friends... not so much. And that was kind of the whole point - to be able to play a scaled back version of fallout with my friends.
---
Well, what with the roadmap maybe I'll be able to talk her into getting back into fallout.
---
cameleon?

That was my thought too, looks fake, even for a teaser, but still...

Yup, np! Was originally going to put it all into a comment, but posted here for visibility. The original map markers probably aren't exact, and the Flatwoods/Poseidon line thing makes sense. Feel free to use these for new developments!
---
These aren't Institute muties, they still have their junk!
---
(I was looking for grahm quotes, sorry for the necro)
---
Could be another fallout mini game like fallout shelter. Apparently they had a lot of success with that. 
---
Wastelad (the holotape game in 76) was pretty fun, I beat it in about 45 minutes.
---
Maybe they’ll do some longer version of a top-down text based fallout game.
---
I wouldn’t mind some form of idle game where your character roams the wasteland and finds items, levels up, discovers companions, explores buildings, passes skill challenges, etc. kinda like fallout shelter without having to mange the vault itself.
---
If they do release FO3 remastered, I’ll definitely buy it. It’s still one of my favorite games of all time. There was so much ‘newness’ in that game. Quirky characters and quests. There was no junk to scrap and the gunplay was mediocre. But the story was unparalleled at the time in my opinion.
---

You already suggested the best solution: Bethesda changing the spawn mechanics until they can figure out how to consistently prevent NPCs from spawning inside the collision of objects.
---
Until then is all 'hacky' workarounds that will have varying degrees of success.

L45 Handmade does base 45 dmg, L50 Combat Rifle does 40.  But w/Hardened Receiver both do 54 dmg, so no difference that I can see

Could you do it for me for a fee?

The base rate of fire is exactly the same, though.
---
my bad
---
Thanks for the info
---
i'm on pc sorry m8
---
Same thing happened to me, very frustrating wasting all my sweet ammo :( But isn’t consistent problem as fought next scorchbeast queen and that fight was one.
---
That, and the adrenal reaction bug has severely limited my dps. I also use a gatling gun and they further nerfed the dps with the removal of martial artist effecting the crank speed.
---
Used to be able to take out regular scorchbeasts in a ridiculously fast time. Now I dont even bother, waste of ammo.

If I want to use a 1* vampiric Tesla to tag mobs in group settings which modifications would you suggest?

Lucky. I wish he would fly away when I find him.
---
Did you try actually firing it? The handmade rifle is basically combat rifle damage with assault rifle handling. Might not make much difference in VATS though. I wouldn't know.
---
Once you're doing silos and queens regularly, you won't be finding enough ammo of any type, and 5.56 is more efficient than .45 for crafting. I would still keep a .45 gun for burning through the free stuff though.
---
The Anti-armor legendary effect is a 50% DR reduction, which works out as +29% more real damage, or similar to a 22-23% higher damage value.
---
Do you know what the trigger point/action for that spawn is? I'm definitely intrigued. I knew some people suggested it could spawn north of the train station, but I didn't know about the Morgantown Airport spawn. I'll certainly try that out.
---
Get a pc lol should work there

Guess i can shove the last two hours i spent launching a nuke alone right up my ass.

Last time I left it unlocked, some guy with a ritual mask and a chameleon armor piece snuck in and stalked me for half an hour.

Sounds like the group I fought with last night. I dumped about 7k+ .50cal with maximum heavy weapons damage loadout and her health bar was barely moving at all. Everyone there looked like they were trying their hardest (which honestly is a rare sight to see, usually its a tag and let the high levels fight her). If it was the same fight then I salute your efforts.   
---
Sincerely,  
---
The level 170 who stormed off mumbling "f\*\*\* this game" over their mic, after using a .50 cal to check the SBQ's rectal temperature.
---
I'm always interested in either base level or max level PA from raider or t series. So for instance, T45 level 25 or 45 but not level 35
---
I'd say you charge one price for service and parts provided by you an a different if they provide you all the parts. So it's like a labor charge. Lot would depend on cost of plans, say plans are 300, but you charge 100 to build it and more if you provide all the parts.

ESO's first expansion content updates was Morrowind, with an updated version of the original map. Zenimax online studios releases a big content updates once a year with spaced smaller DLC. Fallout 76 planned to follow the same model, so it's possible (viz. wishful thinking makes me wanting to argue) that it's a map expansion for 76 set in the capital wasteland, based off the Fallout 3 map.
---
Different editions could become similar to what's done when ESO releases expansions.
---
http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Morrowind
---
Insofar as 76 is going to get a mulligan, this would be the way to go about it. Raven Rock is mentioned with the ZAX AI, who will eventually become president Eden, asking MODUS if he finds data on former US Presidents "interesting", whilst some of the ghouls targeted by the free states head East &amp; may be those found in FO3.
---
If I'm right - I cannot stress how much this is a mix of wishful thinking / manifest destiny - &amp; BGS fix the infinite loot loading glitch, it will make all the money

I think we won’t see them for a while but I wouldn’t put all my money on them never being introduced. It is definitely a design choice at the moment to fuel the story and until they figure out how to properly implement them in this type of gameplay setting. The whole premise of the game is to reclaim the wasteland from the force that eradicated the human inhabitants and to rebuild society. It would be a little hard to do that without a population to fill it.
---
Yes. Just play.  In 80 hours I've been disturbed by griefers for 10 minutes, once.  You biggest problem will be high-level players wandering into your area and driving up the enemies level, but that's also extremely rare.  I virtually never see other players outside the common areas like Whitesprings.  Rarely, I'll see another player on the same quest and well silently short term coop sweeping a dungeon.  Kinda fun actually.
---
One time my friend and I were launching a nuke, get to the launch sequence, put the key card, the code, and everything, and then it says his code was incorrect. It was the middle of the week, so the codes were already discovered and stuff. We did another in a few days later, and we used all of our ammo, I'm just now coming back from that overuse of ammo. 
---
Well the minigun is shit, no two ways about it. Like most guns right now, Heavy Guns benefit a lot from armor pen, so be prepared to be in PA a lot and using the Stabilized perk rank 3. That said, the .50 cal is not bad (I only have a standard one, been trying to find an armor pen legendary one), and the Gatling *was* good until they made it so the Martial Artist perk no longer increases fire speed.
---
All in all, though, my vanilla .50 cal does noticable damage to almost everything if I'm in PA and I only use 2 lvl one Heavy Gunner cards. 
---
Again never have I used any glitches I actively pursue people who glitch
---
Nukes created the scorched, what makes you think nukes are going to stop them, some holotapes left by dead people? pfft
---
I am not an expert obviously, but can you elaborate? I don't understand, I mean how my cpu can cut perfomance while not being used by the game for more than 60%?
---
And why the same CPU and RAM lets me play 100+ fps in games like Metro Exodus, Far Cry 5 and Witcher 3?
---
Yeah i had done this a while back, but thx anyway.
---
He hasn't played in that long, but still comes here to bitch about it and mislead newbies.  Some people need to play some Dead Money.
---
Nope, I removed the .b2a files, custom and regular .ini files, ran the file validation tool, and still nothing. The only things I see are the mothman power armor skin and the emotes section.
---
Noticed that but i think its just visual
---
It may show 60% but trust me you are getting 100% out of the cpu for the game. The game is using your old cpu the best it can. No game uses 100% cpu usage at least with intel i7s
---
Happened to me and my boyfriend at Thunder Mountain too. Strange 
---
I've been missing water textures since Day 1. Patch 6 made things worse.
---
The game now doesn't show about 1/3 of the items in the Atom Store (all blank windows), as well as player Icons are completely missing, from the party window, map and workshops.
---

Iris Dement deserves to be heard in FO.
---
At this point though, I've muted radio and just use tailored spotify playlists that kind of fit whatever I'm doing. Just open it up in the background and use my phone as a remote if i need to change things up.
---
What is this, Samurai Jack?
---
Yeah sometimes when I log on and go to my pipboy too fast before the world completes loading in, the pipboy screen will be complete black and I won’t be able to exit it. Sometimes I can’t even fast travel so I just close the app and start over 
---
This is a known issue. It sucks that it’s ongoing, but the only fix is to just not open your Pip-Boy immediately... my suggestion is to try pulling your weapon first, once you successfully unholster it you should be good to use the Pip-Boy
---
Nice design, looks really good. Also, what outfit is that you’re wearing?
---
The Tesla gun only has 4 mods available based on what another poster pulled out of the game files: Reflex Sight, Automatic Barrel, Charging Barrel, and Charging Shotgun Barrel. You can learn the first 3 of those mods from scrapping but not Charging Shotgun. The Charging Shotgun plan should be available for purchase at one of the vendors, and I've seen the mod available as well. I'm curious about the other mods you mentioned, but I have never heard of them before or seen them at vendors.
---
I can confirm that Charging Shotgun is still affected by Rifleman perks, which I love because I can run it alongside a Handmade. I've got a Quad Explosive Tesla Shotgun that wrecks things pretty well, even though explosive overrides the arcing effect. Somehow it has an ammo capacity of 53, which is weird since normal Charging Shotgun has an ammo capacity of 8. I'm sad that this version of the gun can't drop any more.
---
I’ll catch you soon, missing a t-51 chest piece for my power armour. RoaringAnemone6
---
Does Grahm have a legitimate route he follows as a circuit around the whole map?  Would be great to know his travel route, I miss that big green friendly guy with his loot cow.
---
Kinda the point, no point having death if theres no loss, at least it's only a chance someone will steal your stuff
---
I mostly loot bags that are from where people have stayed in a nuke zone and died. They either needed the achievement and should have prepared or should’ve gotten out of the nuked zone before the nuke went off. There’s a countdown for a reason. But yeah I never loot someone’s bag that died from enemies 
---
How can someone be this triggered over a common turn of phrase.
---
Rip.
---
Ehhh idk then tbh
---
Don't wanna sound like I am argueing, but i'd rly be interested in some indepth reading about how this is possible. like it's cpu load statisctics malfunctioning or smth I don't even know about? Can you point me in the right direction?
---
Never been able to move a house and place it. Been playing since beta. I just destroy the old one and start fresh :D
---
I don’t leave the front door on my real house unlocked, why should I do any different for my game house?  What I do in my house is none of your business Mr. Nosey Mcoutofideas.  No really, I’ve stumbled on some places I just really wanted to tour as well but I’m not gonna break in just to have a peak, curiosity ain’t gonna be what killed this vault dweller.
---
I want specific ones.  I don't want ones that screw up what I'm going for with my build.  I already tried the 'just get all of them lol' with Class Freak III and it was *not* worth it.  :/
---
Hey what’s the AMC building 
---
Scandroid for me!  But yes.  Mole rats are fucking broken, and so. goddamned. obnoxious.
---
Where is this prison you speak of?
---
I cleared out my inactive friends list from the beta recently and wouldnt mind giving some team play a shot. Casual, on at random times, but always down to help. Add Dreadstock
---
I can if you on ps4
---
The penitentiary that's close to Grafton 
---
Sorry xb1 
---
Thanks though
---
I wouldn't pay that much for it bud. The cost itself is around 1k on the venderbot.
---
I'll take it wowmuchtough
---
I will give it a good home.
---
Ah thanks for telling me. I've just emnever been able to find it. I'll keep looking.
---
Death-dropped loot persists for a long time, at least an hour.  If you can get back to that server and find where you died, assuming someone else hadn't taken your stuff, it will still be there waiting for you, possibly eternally.
---
Pre-nerf boss and glowing one exp certainly helped a lot of people reach higher levels like 200+ pretty early on with not *that much* play time. I think if I went harder early on I would be closer to level 300. 
---
It has decent spawn rates as a random encounter up by Janet's ice cream place at the top of the forest region. You just have to go down the road near a metal trailer and server hop till he shows up.
---
Thanks bud 😊
---
Same here several times, not eating any more ammo on these.
---
Np appreciate the tip!
---
Are you on Xbox? 
---
I plug in my headset and it makes the TV sound work. Lol. No idea why this would be, so I leave the headphones plugged in
---
200+ hours solo only and I really enjoy it, I say if you can get it for around $30 go for it. Their roadmap looks promising.
---
I've posted about this weekly since they messed it up. This should have been hotfixed immediately. It is far too much of a core game mechanic to remain bugged for more than a day let alone a month. Really should be a priority.
---
Hell I like you. You can come over to my house and...
---
I stopped playing because of broken stealth, been waiting a month for them to fix it so either one of my two characters becomes viable again, as it is, they are pointless.
---
No.  PC.
---
Explore all of the Forest.
---
After that, explore all of the Toxic Valley to the north.
---
After that make way to the Ash Heap.
---
This absolutely should have been hotfixed immediately. The whole Caution thing is one of the games core mechanics. You may as well have broken the ability to fire weapons, or walk. How on earth has a whole month gone by and this hasn't been prioritised??
---
Maybe just not have the need to scoff down half your body weight in dead deathclaw everyday would be nice
---
Damn, we could have a retrowave party
---
Events and daily missions
---
Based on the wording, I'm expecting a system similar to Elder Scrolls  Online's champion points. Or perhaps like the DLC mutation system from The Witcher 3.     
---
It's coming out in the same patch as the vaults that are described as raids, so I would expect the Legendary Player system to provide some marginal or slightly game changing PvE buffs.  
---
I don't think it will be "prestiging" like in Call of Duty where you reset your character to level 1.
---
Man i had some kid on ps4 try, sendin me all sorts of messages cause i got swarmed and well him and his buddy were afk... Lots of loot for easy killed players no need to get wanted.
---
Wont go into the punk that snuck into my place then laid mines inside, sure didnt give him a wanted level.
---
But my daisy cutter got the revenge i was looking for. 
---
I saw that today as well
---
It’s reward from events 
---
Nope, not a graphical error, and Caution is not behaving the same as Hidden. If it did then sneak attack bonuses would work as would the healing factor mutation and regenerating armour pieces.
---
PS4 too just to make sure they know it is every platform
---
Don't try and buy from the market reddits, they sell it for 10k minimum lol crazy things going on overthere at the moment. Hopefully it returns to normal like it was a few weeks back.
---
What kind of events and daily missions? And where?
---
How many caps to get you to move shop to PC :(
---
Then don't post on here. People have been complaining about this for weeks, then a couple of people post about how it isn't affecting them and then it gets ignored and not fixed.
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
Or just make the spoiling process be 3x slower without the need of 3 perk points. The survival aspect feels tacked on. Its worst that previous Fallout games.
---
The event "One of Us" only way you can get it
---
Responder events and the messenger event you can google it and it’ll come up with a list for all rare event outfits 
---
There seems to be a few, but there’s one called  Free States Radio I think
---
I confirmed today that strange in numbers is breaking my damage. 1000 point difference in dmg once i unequip the perk. (While in a group, solo my damage is fine with the perk)
---
I purged my mutations and reapplied new ones today. Then all my damage was all over the place. Unequipping strange in numbers was the only way to keep my damage from getting bugged while in a group. 
---
I can help you. This guy does a full video of the rare outfits you can get from events and daily quests 
---
[Rifle Gaming ](https://youtu.be/1av-wwg2_dc) 
---
Hopefully that worked. Never did a link of reddit before 
---
I would love that, i already have his outfit now i need the hat and patrol west virginia and protect those who need the protection!
---
I agree, I think it will be more about adding small buffs to your character with the points you accrue beyond level 50 rather than just resetting the benchmark.
---
Oh sorry didn't realize this was the moan only zone
---
Not in a paper bag
---
Gpu load should always be 100% cpu load dorsnt runbat 100% in gaming. The only time it gets close is when u run a benchmark like prime 95. Gaming cant do that... Your cpu is hilding you back for gaming and getting smooth 80fps. Also the bethesda engine is apart of that as well. The engine this game runs on is based from 2003 technology back when morrowind came out. 
---
The combination of the game engine and your old cpu hurt your smooth 80fps. You could have the best cpu in the world but because of the engine fallout 76 runs on you wont get incredible consistent 100 fps.
---
You can get 60fps smooth though, but u seem to want more than that. I mean what the hell do you want BUD?
---
I dig
---
Not from a Jedi.
---
This happened to me a lot sometime try n leave the server and join on someone in the server that might fix it or try hopping in n out of the armor I think it should fix it...
---
Platform?
---
PS4 
---
I agree that Vending machine shouldn’t be part of the CAMP. But I don’t like Top of the world. Whitesprings is more popular. Flatwoods is popular for beginners. Let place vending machine everywhere including buildings and structures. To prevent door blocking they should have no collision like holograms. And there should be an option for vending machines to be displayed on the map with short description and item types similar the workshop.
---
Quick follow-up... would you be able to narrow down the spawn point location? I've been testing it out whenever I encountered a pond settlement during the past hour and a half, but I haven't even managed to spawn enemy mobs across the road. I'll keep looking into it though.
---
Aren't they?
---
After all these years, it's finally coming back.
---
I thought I loaded drinking simulator it's like every few minutes.  I had some gum handy and that ended it pretty quick.. Like for the rest of the session. 
---
Shame u forgot where I got the gum
---
Theres a nod to dracula underwater in the middle of lake east of thunder mountain. 
---
A sunken storage container with an open coffin and no body. 
---
It goes for 2k max on the 76 market 
---
Brilliant! This.
---
I tested everything and every time serendipity activates it seems I lose my explosive resistance or part of it anyway. Cars can kill me, scorchbeast screams still couldn’t though. It’s very weird and hard for me to pinpoint what’s going on exactly.
---
Don’t worry, according to Bethesda the servers are running 300 percent better. I feel your pain. Had one where I launched and froze fast traveling to Watoga. By the time I got back in, the queen was dead. 
---
Check the Fallout 76 wikis. For the power armor mods, most are the same as the Fallout 4 version so the Fallout 4 wikis work for those too. Just Google the name of the plan or mod. For CAMP plans there's a nice image (liked here on Reddit) that shows for each plan what objects it unlocks.
---
I like to understand things, you know? :) 
---
So let's simplify things a lil so I can understabd what you are trying to say:
---
A game uses GPU and CPU as a renderer and a calculator. Game engine handles them tasks. So 1st it gives CPU calculations to do (this is where  game engine matter, since it can give very compact and easy to do tasks or stupid and hard) and when CPU is done the GPU using some of those calculations renders the game, right?
---
So what I can't wrap my head around is how a faster CPU would help if even mine old and slow CPU is not getting enough tasks to be loaded 90% +?
---
Marsupial + Bird Bones + Jet Pack is too much fun. It also enables a maneuver for when you're using an explosive weapon and your enemy gets too close, you can jump/jet up and backwards to quickly get some distance from it so you don't blow yourself up.
---
For me it happened because I had two hunting rifles in my favorites. One always takes over. 
---
Anybody noticed scorchbeasts not landing since the update? As a melee build wtf am I supposed to do? 
---
Any time I'm in a blast zone I'm using 10+ radaways and plenty of rad x too 
---
Please refer to this spreadsheet created by ix1805.

---
Please note that **ANY** Mire event can award the traveling leather coat. Anyone who says that an event apparel piece is tied to a specific event is misinformed.
---
Are you sure it's a bug and intentional? This is a survival game, carry plenty of good and juices
---
I get attacked by them all. Protection government robots, gutsies, assaultrons and even eyebots lol. 
---
New bugs to melee (introduced post patch 6) have been confirmed. 
---
They have been reported to be associated with:
---
- Adrenal Reaction (may be "fixable" by removing mutation and reapplying a new serum ceafted AFTER patch 6)
---
-Class freak rank 3
---
- Strange in Numbers
---
You’ll get into 4 if you like soloing 76. I say that as someone playing 76 and liking it fine.
---
Good lol
---
Thanks for the link, I’ve been trying to grind out some of them, glad to see some confirmation. 
---
No problem! 
---
I believe the point Northwest of the Munitions Factory lands on Carhenge. If so, then there could be a link to the Supermutants from West Tek. 
---
As for the opposite point from West Tek, I don't recall anything too suspicious in that area of the Forest. There's a ruined farm house, some camping tents, but nothing that could be obviously connected.
---
I'll start making some expeditions into all the areas marked on the map. Thanks for the map enhancements!
---
This made me laugh too hard, In a totally good way. I mean this games kinda fucked but some of the stuff people complain about does drive me mad. Like complain about the actual broken shit that long term ruins the game, not having to reapply mutations that you can get a dime a dozen with ease. If people complain about the lack of content, the fact that weapons needed a huge rebalance after bug abuse, and just the poor quality of the early months of this game are one thing, but these little bugs are moot, if this was the worst bug we had seen in this game I’d be pretty pleased, but’s it’s far from the worst of the worst lol. 
---
I'm into this idea.
---
Bethesda changed the Fallout76.exe so the ChatMod no longer works.  Dev is working on it but no ETA. 
---
Not to be that guy lol but the outfit in the atom shop is the western duster and Preston wore the colonial duster. Just a little different but close enough.
---
It's been this way for the last patch. 4 fights, 0 dead queens.  A crap ton of spawns.  
---
I shouldn't be blowing through this much ammo. 
---
A more modern cpu will help with achieving better minimum fps and such. For example games like overwatch, having a more modern cpu will make the lowest fps be like 100 but your older cpu will cause the lower fps to hit 65 for example. They may have similar load but a more modern cpu will help with lower 1% minimum fps, average fps, and high fps when compared to older ones. Regardless of what afterburner is telling you about the load percentage. 
---
Because Bethesda doesn't want us to have nice and cheap things. 
---
My rifleman build's handmade rifle and lever gun both weigh between 20-25lbs (or whatever unit of weight 76 uses).  His carry weight is like 175.  My power armor character has 355.  18 is no big deal.  LOL.
---
300 caps? Damn that's a good price. I've seen combat armour and couch plans selling for higher at an NPC Vendor. You're truly a generous soul.
---
I’ll take a ghillie suit even just for cosmetic purposes now that you mention it, but it would definitely be cool if it helped us out
---
No PA or any other armor, not even the prototype Hazmatsuit has a 100% radiation resistance.
---
The X-01 has the highest rad res of all PAs, yes but you will still get rads in a nuke zone.
---
It's not a bug, it's a feature. 
---
This is the honest truth, its marked as a sulphur water fountain and cures disease
---
Same happened to me tonight.
---
Hilde: "A Scorchbeast! I saw a Scorchbeast!"
---
Sven: "What? What is it now, mother?"
---
Hilde: "It was as big as the mountain, and black as night. It flew right over the barrow."
---
Sven: "Scorchbeasts, now, is it? Please, mother. If you keep on like this everyone in town will think you're crazy. And I've got better things to do than listen to more of your fantasies."
---
Hilde: "You'll see! It was a Scorchbeast! It'll kill us all and then you'll believe me!"
---
Chinese stealth suit yo. Lore is already there. And the assets!
---
I reached level 80 last night, and got two of the lockpicking cards from the card pack, so I got the 3rd one as well.
---
Not too far from Morgantown and the train yard and VTU. it's a pretty low level, early game area, which was the reason I suggested it for you
---
No clue, try deleting the blueprint and starting again 
---
Yes, one feels like the "grind" aspect has been amped up. I guess the Fallout developers want to find a way to make us suffer for enjoying the previous games too much.
---
But all the ballistic fiber tho
---
This is actually pretty cool not gonna lie 
---
I use an Automatic barrel and have Mutant +10% dmg and +10% while aiming, it's a great weapon for most cases.
---
I mean, it's not like they can take anything in 76, unlike being able to take the literal whole car.
---
after my hp drops a bit i had my bloodied mr handy electrified damage to 300 ballis./70 energy.  its the shit with lucky draw
---
My base has a locked generator room and a locked terminal/decon shower room. Everything else is wide open, even my water generators. Come use my base, take my food and drinks if you need them. Start your own glue farm. I have a Brahmin making fertilizer too. 
---
Had the same happen the last time i was there, spent 20 minutes in whitespring and had to heal rads from like 30% health to ful maybe 3 times. Also no diseases. 
---
Your getting more rads than you used to, in the same place with the same gear, wouldn't say thats a feature.
---
Because the handmade is the most powerful rifle in the game in terms of DPS compared to all other rifles. Maybe that's why. 
---
I think it depends on which has better legendary stats. I used my PF over DC because it had instigating and 40% attack speed vs my DC which had 40% faster swing and 30% dmg to ghouls
---
Her body is huge and stays around for like 5-10 mins after she dies why do you need a meat pile she’s a instant loot upon death
---
If I could repair my Instigating/+40% Attack speed Grognak Axe to 200% durability, I'd be more than happy. 
---
You get it from quests and dailies in the Mire. IE, Irrational Fear, Heart of the Swamp, It’s a Trap, Queen of the Hunt, and a few more. 
---
I would aim for Anti-Armor/40% swing speed
---
food spoils?
---
Jesus fucking Christ that photo is epic.  
---
I’ll stop by tomorrow 
---
+karma 
---
What's your refund policy?
---
I currently use approach 3 stealth boys with rank 3 on secret agent. Pending future information on which items will be dropped, it’s very viable.
---
I have unyielding sentinel and sentinel assassin and hardly use either. Rather I run around in unyielding weight weight reduction for the convince. If you’re character is spec’ed correctly with perks and armor you can quite a few shots from range based weapons even with a bloodied build. Additionally shooting mechanics aren’t great so when the stealthboy negates vats it’s very hard to hit an invisible target using speed demon at full speed sprinting at full speed that’s if you see it coming. 
---
I suppose the advantage of a ranged stealth build is that you could much more easily get the drop on melee players when the stupid slap damage restriction is removed from pvp. Although, given current pvp wars in which people constantly spawn seeking revenge it more or less plays out as if they weren’t restrictions and the points above still stand. 
---
If ranged attacks ever get to the point where they can on shot a properly spec’ed melee build I presume the simple counter is wearing assassin cavalier and spec’ing your character to more or less run indefinitely. You get the benefit of extra health and the constantly use of the cavalier effect. 
---
My two cents for what its worthless based on much pvp experience albeit the first round with restrictions. Hope that helps. I just think that many people even higher levels are in the dark about how to make prop build for pvp.
---
Congratulations!  Looks great.  
---
If we fail the job we dont get paid
---
I got the hat to go with it.
---
Looks good to me.
---
I ould care more if i could name my power armor chasis instead of going through them every time to find the right one. (for contex i have 4 extra power armor sets so i can still stay protected while in combat, if one breaks i swich to another one)
---
Pop a Rad-X.
---
So before White springs became a big deal and was just another spot on the map. I encountered a camouflage Deathclaw that was just chilling out. After it freaked me out, I just laughed and took a picture. Still haven't seen one since that day.
---
Thank you!!
---
Me too! I’ve found all the hats for them so I was hoping there would be matching outfits and here it is! 
---
I had this problem and never got a solution from Bethesda other than to scrap the blueprint and try again. I ended up rebuilding from scratch. Ultimately, I wound up with something I liked way more. I hope you have the same experience.
---
do you have any pc  mods installed?
---
:( envy
---
My place is right next to Charleston Station. I always leave my door open so players can use my crafting tables, bed, and piano. Also leave my purifier unlocked so people can help themselves to water. If you ever see a big red barn type structure with a porch and a Pip Boy statue on the roof, feel free to have a rest and use my stuff.
---
just the perk loadout manager, but that has also not worked since the patch, I think I need to update it.
---
I thought we had a sticky with all current issues but it seems to be gone.
---
The ADS (Aim Down Sights) is also still broken, most noticably for bolt-action weapons. Never really worked properly. 
---
After a shot you get stuck in ADS while you cycle another round, this leaves you moving slower and if you have a scope you keep looking through that. Then after you cycle the shot it goes into ADS again before it goes out.
---
Works fine in FO4 so it shouldnt be to tough to fix, this has been an issue now since the Beta.
---
I think most perks that don't affect combat...should just me passives. this is one.
---
I heard people having problems with atom shop items did something like renaming their mods (not completely sure on the details) and then it was all good
---
Something I have no use for.
---
That’s exactly what I do
---
But then enemies will get inside and break my shit, and that whole mechanic is annoying enough as it is.
---
If we had a bigger budget I could write a little sign that says "Survivors use back door" and you could make an easy jump from a guard post onto the balcony, but I can only make like two letters.
---
As stated multiple times in this thread “as low as 300 caps” is a suit of level 15 raider armor. 
---
You must send u/Spez a request via PM
---
I have several in stock. 
---
well if you on pc on the right side of the screen it will have a checkbox that says show my falir on this subreddit then you choose one
---
shotguns add explosive damage per pellet and there's multiple pellets per shot.  The end result is shotguns gain more than other weapons from the explosive modifier.  
---
The most recent nerf to explosive modifier and demo expert reduced this all by a gigantic amount.  It used to be vastly more powerful, but now as you realized you can counter with fireproof + armor mods.  It's still one of the better weapon combos in the game.
---
Don’t stop looking! You’ll find it (if you really want it) I thought I would never find it and it just happened 
---
Actually love this idea
---
Huh... I’m not sure how to do that. I’m not terribly good at mods haha.
---
YES PLEASE! Ima make a museum with my pictures! 
---
Me neither
---
I would love an old school ice box. or something similar but bored mechanic macgyvered out of junk of course.
---
If you’re nuking for calibrated shocks materials, the scorchbeast queen’s area is definitely not the place to Nuke. 
---
No need to get feisty, my man. If you want it to be obvious, maybe put it in the post?
---
Even still, that's a really good deal, so your reply serves no real purpose, anyway.
---
this comment made me laugh thank you
---
Ha I didn’t mean to come off as a dick there, so sorry if that’s the way it seemed. The wording of the ad was definitely meant to be a riff on old school used car advertising techniques.
---
I noticed this almost immediately on my last silo run, which makes me think that this is both always the case (not the result of farming) and a recent nerf (since the last time I did a silo a few weeks ago).
---
Wonder if the bug is related to certain perks? I’m very low level, have no stealth related perks, and things are still working ok for me. 
---
Bugthesda
---
Well it's certainly a very effective sales pitch, so nice work
---
I’ve been using a bolt action hunting rifle from about level 2 to 12 and have never seen this. Weird. 
---
Yeah happened to me the other day for the first time... just restart the game and make sure you move around a bit first- worked for me after that
---
Theres always a risk when you preorder a game.
---
Also nobody made you preorder it. 
---
It used to be VASTLY more powerful?? Jesus! I mean i've heard rumors of this TSE stuff and all but i've got my hands on some explosive rifles and they're basically add a bit of AoE in exchange of close quarters self damage (without protection investment). But shotguns in particular feel like it's a death sneeze in the general direction. Thanks for the clarification tho!
---
Cool story, brah. 
---
;)
---
My Atomic shop also looks like this [https://i.imgur.com/QYEAU0M.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/QYEAU0M.jpg)
---
So maybe the problem is on my end?
---
or 76% complete
---
It's almost as if the game is designed so that people have to make choices and specialization instead of being able to do everything at once, isn't it?
---
Ah. A threat.
---
Devilishly delightful.
---
You will love it if they are the 2 components you like most. However be aware that different areas of the map are very different levels so you might dislike the first 30/40 lvls because youre restricted... currently lvl 29 but the events, exploring and doing quests with random lower lvls on the map never gets boring, or at least not for me anyway and im always playing on my own except when i invite random people from the map to try help them for a bit
---
I wouldn't complain if this was implemented, but do we need it?
---
I am always getting meat and cooking stations are everywhere it's not like there is a short supply of food or water.  
---
Maybe it's just me ,but I don't see myself going back to my camp just to get food.  Every time I'm back I have a crapload more just to cook.
---
You sleep in the bathroom.
---
No Wall!
---
My TSE handmade is my favorite gun. Heres why:
---
It looks awesome, it weighs less than an assault rifle, does very good damage. Even a standard handmade is pretty strong.
---
Also the handmade rifle is really hard to find so you have to buy the plan and craft/scrap it to get mods.
---
Anti Armor is pretty strong. You can combine it with tankkiller (36%) and Stinging magazine (7%) to get a 93% armor penetration. The problem with AA is that its no big difference on high damage per shot weapons.
---
Imo Prime receivers arent worth it. 
---
I don’t think he has an exact route but [this ] post shows where people have seen him wandering 
---
Awesome, thanks. 
---
I really didn’t expect the response I got. Most of my experiences today were pretty positive, with 2 attacks and a couple people asking to buy my guns when I told them a couple times “I’m selling power armor, not my .50 Cal”.
---
I guess one thing I didn’t think of is that when the wait for 76 was on, and people were saying “I’m going to sell *item x* so often and we don’t see much of it actually happening, (and with all the hate the game has gotten on subs and in new media), is that somebody actually posting that there’s a spot to come to where people can come to do some trading, they’re gonna show up there. Friend requests rolled in all day, messages, party invites, people hanging around the camp... it was great to see instant success at something I’d been planning for a month, and people just stopping by in game beforehand, who saw my prices on the wall of my shop, just seemed to scoff so I didn’t expect many people would be interested. 
---
Now I’m just starting to worry about supply for tomorrow!
---
Clearly I don’t know how to link https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9vxi2c/grahms_route_now_with_20_more_pixels_and_half_the/?st=JSIO7Q8K&amp;sh=0169fed5
---
I would be interested but my account doesn't look so good. Are those caps per mission or until i don't need your services anymore? Also are those prices per bodyguard/raider? 
---
Thanks MajisTek. I think I'm going to go with Anti-Armor and possibly that 40% attack speed if I can find anyone selling one.
---
np 
---
Aaahhh I'm PC!!! 
---
Awesome idea! You guys are going to be killing it when player vending comes in! 
---
brotherhood nice see you chose wisely
---
Exploding effect adds +20 % to the guns base damage and Demolition expert adds something like 60% more to that explosive damage only. So you get only 20 x 1.6 = 32% more damage to the base weapon damage with explosive and demolition expert. In conclusion demolition expert adds 32-20 = 12% to your total weapon damage.
---
In no means does it multiple your damage.
---
In no means does it multiple your weapon damage
---
The corner of that garage building closest to the station. Funny enough every time I have found him (5/5) there has been a pond base with purifiers. Though this vendor is frustratingly rare so just keep at it or try other locations(?) out.
---
Wait until you learn about Enforcer.
---
Spoilers: Go find a Mirelurk Queen. Use any shotgun. Fire at her outside of range to do any actual damage. Laugh as she literally folds in half. Try reproducing the same thing with Tormentor and One Gun Army. Get sad.
---
You seem like the kind of guy I'd trust my legitimately earned caps with. When I'm ambulatory again, I might peruse your wares. If nothing else, I can pick up some cheap raider power armour and sell it for double the price later ;)
---
I'm kidding, of course...
---
Still, my best power armour is a Raider suit with a T-45 helmet and legs. I think your store may be useful!
---
Plus, it's great to see somebody out there doing this kind of thing. It really gives me hope for this game's future :)
---
Witnessed this tonight. I usually do add control so the rest of the players can focus on the queen (you're welcome), so it took me a while to notice that her health had stopped dropping. I blast away at her to confirm, and yup, health bar isn't moving. Peaced out immediately. The rest of the people stayed in the area until the event timed out. Kinda lame.
---
unequipping and reequipping perk cards fixed this for my friend today... definitely feels like a bug bc afterward they were back to one shotting the super low level creatures 
---
They can spawn legendaries, but only at the random probability of a normal encounter, so pretty low, I’ve seen one, 2 star. 
---
You are very correct however, at least the last wave should have a legendary, it’s seems pretty simple and would make holding and maintaining a workshop much more worth it.  I wouldn’t put it on the “retake” missions in order to keep people maintaining their workshops. 
---
it doesn't load sometimes and have to wait for 10 mins
---
Rad sponge shared with team plus ghoulish. Your welcome. 
---
I did it at lvl 18 recently on an alt. You don’t need to do any damage - just wait out the timer. Hide behind the pillar or turn right and right again out of the elevator and glitch in to the outside elevator wall and pop some stimpacks.
---
Those are per mission we ARE NOT RAIDERS you get 4 per mission only queen you get more then 4 people I can give you all the details msg me djd532
---
I dont know what these idiots who patches this game have messed up but i have big issues after patch. Suddenly when i check my mole miner gauntlet it shows 200 something dmg, its around 400 before ar mutation and stuff. Tried switching weapon , unequipping . Then i log out and in and dmg is back to normal
---
How can I do that? 
---
Might want to test that. 
---
The carnivore mutatuon is awesome. You csn get a bunch of ionized meat from bloated glowing ones if you nuke whitesprings. They drop often from ones you didnt even kill. You dont have to cook them, they dont go bad, And it only takes two to completely restore your food bar. 
---
There's Grahm! I love that big ol' lug and his love affair with meat. And MooMoo. ♡
---
So, you haven't seen the Queen despawn in under 30 seconds, I've seen it multiple times. It just sucks.
---
Nope not once
---
Something is...
---
...
---
Up.
---
Oh so you had one in the documents and the install directory.
---
The advice there is to delete the one in the Documents and leave the one in the game directory but I'd actually suggest it the other way.
---
These are the only files I edit:
---
    B:\Users\crazyjackal\Documents\My Games\Fallout 76\Fallout76.ini
---
    B:\Users\crazyjackal\Documents\My Games\Fallout 76\Fallout76Prefs.ini
---
    B:\Users\crazyjackal\Documents\My Games\Fallout 76\Fallout76Custom.ini
---
And there is a Fallout76.ini in my game installation directory but I don't touch it. That is the base version that the game copies into your documents. Same as the Low.ini, Medium.ini, High.ini, Ultra.ini those are the base defaults for Fallout76Prefs.ini that also get copied into your documents.
---
I think "acceptable" is a very misleading word in this context. At the very least, it should mean that you refuse to play until it's fixed. If it just means "I wish they would fix it soon", then yeah, I agree, obviously, but then I wouldn't use that word. 
---
And, while I encounter bugs on a regular basis (yesterday, Green Thumb didn't proc until I restarted the game), I'm enjoying it enough in its current state that I certainly wouldn't want to be down for months, although I could maybe live with a few days if it made a difference—which it wouldn't, because it doesn't take days to reboot the server. 
---
I do wholeheartedly agree that we could use a test server and maybe even test clients, and I'd like to hear the reasons why we don't. 
---
I've been wanting something like the that for months. Pain in the ass when you're waiting for the Queen's loot to load and then the body disappears. Then having to search for the Queen's pile among the other piles.
---
Been playing solo since launch day with the occasional team play with my buddies from a discord group (difficult to sync because of the timezone difference).
---
My advice is to to melee with at least 12 points in Strenght (Martial Artist, Incisor, Blocker, Iron Fist or Slugger).
---
I'm working on an alt right now with a strange sneak /grognak build; just crossed level 35 last night and most of the time I fall back to melee (also the fact that stealth is bugged does not help).
---
With the above setup, I easily managed to clear the Golf club with all high level ghouls when I was level 30 using a non-legendary 3 bladed mole miner gauntlet and no mutations.
---
For power cores, it's rather easy to just buy or get the plans for the fusion core generator and take over a power plant workshop. Build the generator, power up the fusion core thingie and you'll get 7 cores per hour. On my main I got like 60 cores during a play session 1 month ago and running with batteries included and power user at max level I didn't look back since. I still have 50+ atm and also gave some away to my buddies.
---
To avoid high level messing with your workshop, just take it over when there isn't too much traffic on the servers.
---
Also get lone wanderer, you need at least 4 Charisma to max it out.
---
Hope my reply helps. All the best!
---
You should check your event log in Windows. Look for the red events. 
---
I had this happen at one point, but not with fallout 76 because it wasn't out yet. Ended up being a fault in my power supply and replacing it fixed it. Good luck!
---
Tried to bring her down yesterday with aprox. 15 people and we got her down to like 80% health in almost 25 minutes.
---
Something clearly doesn't work properly here.
---
If they add that hat, I'ma redo my character's looks to look like Preston and run around Appalachia, popping in on unsuspecting players to let them know that *another settlement needs our help...*
---
And that you can jump into to survive if your CAMP is getting nuked.
---
I jeep my door locked, at my last location someone killed my tamed mirelurk king, now I keep my doors closed because this world has wronged me.  That being said I check my map frequently, and when someone is at my Camp and hasn't acted in a hostile manner I'll let them in, hell I'll even unlock the crafting room which has my generator in it for them to do any crafting/scrapping.  Instruments are up on the balcony, we'll have a jam session.  I just don't like people in my house without me there unless they're my team mates.
---
Depends on the situation but Packrat is mostly better because you always pick up more junk.
---
Two different perks, depends what you want to do?
---
Discovered Vault 63 tonight with some friends to put a marker on the map. Loading screen to get into the area where the vault door is. They've made the entrance a decent place to discover.
---
Ended up dumping mine too.
---
Get Bethesda to add a wild wasteland perk that lets you do it.
---
I caused damage to myself with an explosive legendary and it said caution because of me!!! I know this why? Because when I died from the same weapon it asked if I wanted to seek revenge against myself..... Said caution and wouldn't let me fast travel until I died from jumping off my roof until death
---
Clean brick interior walls would be nice.  Especially the half-variety.  The worst part about the half brick wall is that the wall pattern doesn't match other walls if you're to stack others on top of it, or if the half is on top of normal full-sized wall variants.  Not only is the dirty pattern symmetry-breaking, but half brick variants don't have that weird decorative lining at the very top of each wall, so that's another way it breaks the aesthetics.
---
Also, there should be double-sided interior variants of the brick walls.  The brick walls look nice as an exterior option, but if you use them from the inside, you have to deal with brick walls on the inside, which certainly does make for some interesting aesthetics in certain circumstances, but I'd rather than be a personal choice than mandatory.  Walls should come in double-sided interior versions so it makes interior decoration easier, and brick-free.
---
May 7th, Backpack we can customize for more utility. Might this be the very thing to allow some mobile versatility? 
---
I agree it would be nice if they did more damage given how much of the CAMP limit they use.
---
This happens when I cause damage to myself (either through mutation or explosive weapons...)
---
Works fine for me.
---
The Brotherhood of Steel seems to hold those ideals
---
Still have yet to encounter one.
---
Takes 7 minutes with 3 lvls of hacker and 3 lvls of lockpick..... Getting the keycard, now that is ridiculously hard
---
If you where close enough to do this with a conventional weapon it would kill you 
---
That was all you, you are a hero.
---
Comment from a
---
Worthless redditor.
---
The quest wepons not so great so no need to stress about it. Best way to level up is probably white spring but haven't played in a while so it could've change
---
I dunno.  The anti-armor effect is pretty excellent as I was testing it with 9 ranks of heavy gunner, three stars of Stabilized and only one star of Lock and Load perks (will get the other two as I continue to level).  Each harpoon (haven't found the flechette mod yet) takes a significant chunk out of a flying lvl 65 scorchbeast's health.  Quad capacity is great, but with the faster reload legendary minor and even one star of of Lock and Load, it's not bad at all for reloading.
---
The one problem I found with the harpoon gun is that reloads are often interrupted with incoming damage.  (how does a lvl 65 scorched interrupt me in power armor when they're swinging a switchblade at me?) I still expect it to be a good option for an SBQ when she largely refuses to land and I'm on top of the bunker at V9 not dealing with the majority of trash mobs with a stealthboy torso mod.
---
I add locks to my door for that exact reason. You think you can just walk into my cool house without paying me? You're insane, nothing this cool is free.
---
No, players sell them for less
---
Dude, it literally takes ten minutes to exit the Vault. It doesn’t save the first time until you exit. 
---
The loading screen was showing you the first picture you took using photomode, not your active level. Speaking of which, Level 7? Before leaving the Vault? Nope. Calling shenanigans on that. You can gain a level, not several. 
---
The bugs you listed do happen sometimes but all on a fresh character straight out of the Vault? Doubtful.
---
Conclusion, seems like you have been keeping up with the game pretty well, and you hit all the high notes to join the I-never-played-it-but-still-hate-it crowd. Kudos!
---
I have a Berzerker Vicious pipe bolt action rifle, which is legendary. But I do tend to like my non-legendary tactical rifle, which has a hardened receiver. It has more dmg than the pipe. And maybe it's because I had the rifle first.. The rifle with its mods is much heavier, around 12 lbs. I'm looking forward to a legendary rifle.  
---
Oh maybe it’s the pipe revolver rifle I’m thinking of then. 
---
The Pirate Hat goes really well with the Western Duster.
---
Higher levels you will stop using packrat
---
This is a great idea. I usually don't want to tempt fate by alt-tabbing out of the game so controlling Spotify with the phone makes perfect sense 
---
I build a new camp every week... Each better than the last:) trust me it's fun to tailor make a homestead that blends with the environmen *In a fallout way*
---
Aside from destroying stuff, visitors can't steal much, can they?  I think they can steal purified water from the purifiers and so forth.  And maybe vegetables.  Who cares though, that stuff is everywhere!
---
I have a sign up above the front door that welcomes everyone to use my place.  I got a lot more visitors when I was camped out in Flatwoods than where I am along the river now, but the Flatwoods location was too awkward.  Still I miss it because it provided a good service, having easy access to a vendor and giving visitors easy access to their stash and so forth.
---
Ok, thought it would've been in a bag. Guess not.
---
My phone's connected to my computer via bluetooth.  I have Google Play Music, and there's a few stations available just for Fallout.
---
What I miss is a D.J.  I know it's not a popular opinion, but what's Fallout without Three Dog yammering in your ear?
---
Mine is lock just for a reason, if I want anybody come and go as they want it be unlock but is nt so maybe the msg is nt clear...
---
You are a good guy

I want railings or quarter-walls. The current half walls would ruin my balcony.

Atomic winter?
---
Had this happen to me about a week ago for the first time, but when i went to Harper's Ferry again the other day there was no problem.
---
I play usually after work, am around lvl 50 atm. GT : Lokilorddusty
---
I didn't say that i gained the rest of the levels inside the vault. There are no enemies inside the vault, although an invisible person was walking inside and i could hear his footsteps and when he bumped into objects near me.
---
The image that appears during the loading screens is of a character that is non existent, because the game made me redo it 2 times due to the fact that i exited the game before exiting the vault. And i actually quit the game before exiting the vault 3 times just to see if it's a "feature". And indeed it is, it never saves before exiting the vault.
---
Dying from invisible creatures happened just a bit further down the road from the vault..
---
I'm not going to argue with you weather you believe anything i say.
---
 That was my experience with a 3-4 months released game that is supposed to have at least some basic bugs fixed if the development team(or teams) is as big as it is. You can white night it all you want. The game has serious bug issues especially comparing it to other game releases, including releases from it's own franchise. 
---
Yes they should. This gives caps a sink and some value to caps. Is it worth? Idk, for me its more like prestige thing rather than actually needing one. As with everything, you can find them, but you need to do server hopping.
---
Yeah that's why i found odd a maxed demo expert was giving the explosive shotgun over 5x the damage in testing
---
Seen this bug come and go mid fight. Last time I fought the queen we did her 3 straight times. First fight was maybe 15 minutes, was times she wasn't taking any damage, then she would. Next fight she landed immediately and was dead before the timer hit 28:15. third fight we barely scratched her the first 6-7 minutes, she landed and was dead in under a minute. weirdest shit i've seen. Virtually the same people all 3 fights, except my level 75ish buddy disconnected the last fight. 
---
I think this time it just worked too good.
---
Have all the upvotes. 
---
Thank you! I'm ashamed I didn't know this mod existed. Any other mods you'd recommend that are safe to use?  i.e won't get banned for. 
---
I use the ultrawide mod (for the UI). Are people safely using the Perk Load out Manager mod? 
---
It just works fine for me as well.
---
Yeah, Bethesda mentioned in the roadmap blurb that being able to place stash objects as decor was coming soon. Now we're just wishing about what we want.
---
Haha, I was instinctively reading that with a protectron voice. Good job!
---
Thank you good sir 
---
Can confirm that several iterations of this idea have been shared with the team previously, but (as always) the team will be made aware of this new thread too.
---
I know this might sound like a broken record, but we do take these quality of life suggestions seriously. Thank you for taking the time to share this, Kohlastro.
---
Somehow I got a BoS “skin” for the combat armor helmet 
---
Its probably still a while off, plenty of time to go get more!
---
You know, I was thinking the BioShock music would be right at home here 👍
---
You need to empty your custom ini file and then paste the contents of your ini file in to it. Then add your mods to the archive section like you did when you first installed them.
---
Ring of fire! 
---
Similar thing happened to me. But I eventually was able to mod it to bos once i got the plans for them and learned it that way. Think it is a bug or sonething
---
Yes, her loop is really funny but way too short. She should be live broadcasting!
---
Defacing the university statues
---
Yes u can, if someone attacks you, you can just server hop or ignore him. Players who doesn't want to PVP have heavy protections and tools to avoid it. Only idi#t would get harassed by PVP in this game.
---
...and players aren't that hostile. I played over 200 hours and not once I got ever attacked by player. No one has attacked my camp or tried to take over my workshops. I'd wish they would.
---
Damn mate you're getting stiffed, it's $66 AU for a canadian key but only $16 AU for an Aus key.  VPN 'might' work, I'm not expert on that.
---
With the current patch, it's near pointless. Something has changed with the whole encounter, not just Adrenal Reaction bug nerfing the heavy hitters.
---
No
---
So did you learn the plans from scrapping?
---
I lock my bedroom door but the only thing in there is a bed and a few posters. The rest of my camp (which is sort of like a bar/longhouse, with an external 'shed' for crafting tables) is completely fair game and doesn't have locks.
---
If you're talking about the power core generator not getting power;
---
Looking at the generator from the front, there are 4 connectors, one on the fusion core generator, two in the middle, and the one on the power box. The third one from the left is bugged. Take the 4th connector and wire it to the second (from the left, just to be clear).
---
Also, if you're having trouble placing the nuclear extractor, you have to remove the red tanks from the hole first. 
---
Ahhh just found it. It was to be able to mod the helmet! Thanks. 
---
No thru the plans
---
Or, make a serum first completely remove the old mutation effect and then grant the new one.
---
Did you buy them before the last patch?
---
Yea a loooong time ago lol
---
Haha yeah they seem to be removed from vendor lists now. I don't know how to get them and don't think anyone else does either. 
---
Agreed. The selection process would be very important. Not just what's royalty free. Gotta get some Edith Piaf in there
---
Like you they can keep mine, ive started a paypal dispute as i can no longer access the software.  Funny thing is, its now less than half the price I paid....
---
Weird I guess you have a different fo76 version than the rest of us have ..
---
Or you're just very very late to the "this game sucks so I'm gonna lie about bugs" Circle jerk 
---
Fine for me. Just a troll
---
Bethesda walks through the door *record scratches to a halt*
---
Why do I feel like if they do this we will all end up looking like Fortnight bushes? 
---
Fond memories of Three Dog! Maybe Rose could do some reactive DJing as someone else suggested.
---
I almost agree. Asked me this morning I would have. I did one where at one point we had her down to 3/4 health and suddenly her health bar and name turned white as if she was friendly and reset the whole thing. Damnedest thing I ever seen. But a couple times tonight we did it. Took longer and I agree it's different. Something is really off.  But still do able. So I thought I'd toss  this together. 
---
Yeah, removing them from the vendors was terrible. I got the chest piece and legs, but still need the arms and can't find the plans anywhere.
---
Your eye and brain cannot register more than about 60fps - so if your game is SUSTAINING 60fps then you don’t need any more. A ‘better’ cpu might make your FPS less likely to dip below 60fps in certain situations but what you have is quite sufficient. 
---
Hmm this doesn't sound right. What platform are you on? And to anyone else experiencing this - what platforms are you on too?
---
But my bed is my bed
---
Good call actually! I'll update :)
---
As someone who hasn’t fought the Queen yet, this was useful and hopefully your well put together advice will stop me being such a noob when I do decide to go do it 😊
---
P.C user here. THIS is what is going to keep this game alive! I salute you and all the wastelanders out their doing the grind to keep humanity going post apocalypse.  
---
I misunderstood your comment then about levels.
---
Checkpoints in most games rarely happen more than every 10 minutes, and normally don’t begin until after the tutorial in case you miss something.
---
Invisible creatures can happen, usually when loading into the server. It’s a issue that happens with a lot of open world games that rely on a network because the server is always slightly behind the game client. Rarely does it happen outside of that unless they clip the environment, which happens a lot in open world games due to unforeseen variables in the physics.
---
I’m not white knighting anything. This game should have been delayed at least three months maybe more, everyone knows that. Which is why this 10,000th “This game is full of bugs” post isn’t helping anyone.
---
The game runs better now than ever though so I really doubt all that happened to you in the first few hours unless your PC is a potato.
---
You said it all with your opening. You never wanted to even give the game a chance. 
---
I honestly think you just cobbled together all the major bugs you could find into a story to be one of those cool internet haters. 
---
Most popular franchises that release an online game struggle at launch for a number of reasons but they bounce back through frequent patching and 76 has a patch every two weeks since launch. 
---
Glad I could help. 😀 Good luck out there. 👍
---
One thing I think is strange... Boiled water has no expiration date... yet add a flower to it to make tea and that water will suddenly spoil after so long. 
---
Hey, thanks for your reply :) No need to feel sorry, just parking it in case its useful for anyone :)
---
I agree that the hidden resistances of PA make it super attractive, but I've been in it for the last 170 levels on this toon and I want a change. With regard to ranged, they can be as OP as hell with a sneaky VATS crit build, but I am not a fan of that style. I've been pretty happy with rifle since I started, so I'll stick with it :)
---
I don't PvP at all though.....might be something I'll explore!
---
5 is pointless. Why would you take 5 pieces of Weightless to gain same effect as 4 pieces of assassin + 1 piece of Chameleon. 4 pieces of assassin is more useful and 4 pieces of Weightless.
---
&gt; Approach 5 is **proactive**. Rather than going invisible in the subset of times you’re crouched (and let’s face it, even a player that sneaks all the time fast travels, crafts and does a heap of other things standing up, for QoL reasons) 
---
Why would you do crafting and other things in Survival server? Just switch server and do that in regular server.
---
Canibal perk works great in this game because there is no Karma repercussions for eating a corpse.  Other Fallout games you lost karma or was viewed negatively by in game NPC's... but in this game you can munch on corpses all you want with no negative consequences... (Except perhaps radiation... but keep Radaway handy). 
---
Pretty much BoS combat armor and the Blackbird paintjob are the only things I want in this game. And I don't have either!
---
What platform? Would mind taking a hit out myself or buddies for decent pvp action. We don’t have a faction affiliation, just ragtag group of scrappy outlaws 
---
It seems like there is too much Nuka-cola in the game... I am sitting on a lot of bottles I don't drink, ntm there are other beverages in the game too... Only reason I horde the Nuka's is because they produce a bottle cap... yet if you drink a beer or other bottles beverage you don't get a bottle cap... 
---
Rule number one. Always bring a melee weapon. Lol! 
---
What do you mean
---
Xbox, PS4 or PC. I’m on Xbox 
---
I mean we’ve got iceboxes in the game, all it would take would be decommissioning them as stash boxes and making them fridges. Easy peasy.
---
Best idea ever since the teddy bear stand
---
Hey, what's your Platform?
---
In a game where you are limited to 26 players per server and server hop constantly...yea I can imagine it, pointless.
---
Oh sorry man were on ps4
---
Dense mod and fireproof counter the exploding shotguns pretty hard
---
So that’s why I have so much rotten meat
---
Damn. Cool concept and team though. 
---
Someone left my dunny door open last time I was on! I mean ok you had to GO, but please shut the godammed door when your done.What are you like 12 or something ?
---
Can't be viewed negatively if there's no other humans
---
*big THONKs*
---
Ok cool thanks :) Where do you get the best weapons from then? Just crafting or are they dropped from high level enemies?
---
I’ve hung onto my first “good” weapon tse handmade for sentimental reason though I rarely if ever so it anymore. 
---
Yes thank you! I’m going to drop him a message and a friend request so I can go shopping again!
---
I found a camp in the swamp next to Harper's Ferry and they didn't even have a door on it, just a set of stairs topped with a 3 X 3 box room with their crafting stuff in, they had to remove a wall to let me in.
---
The quarry near watoga and sometimes that farm just behind watoga when she decides she wants to play 
---
You fucking nailed it 👍
---
The prison has x6 tin can chimes inside, really good for farming steal and lead
---
In watoga, there is a round small lake near the power plant station, there is always a queen that comes out of the water 
---
Are you far away enough from towns, houses etc? 
---
Happens to me all the fucking time
---
Directly north of the clarksburg shooting club there's a lake which has a chance of spawning a queen or a snallygaster 
---
I lock the doors in hopes that someone picks them and becomes wanted.  Then I can kill them. 
---
There’s also one at the Bootlegger’s Shack in Cranberry Bog 
---
yes but when I press mouse 3 to open the workshop it isn't letting me.
---
if you see a work bench through the windo, you can "use"  and you will find yourself inside without lock picking :-) 
---
Does it open your workshop menu when you walk up to your camp and press enter to interact with it, if not reset your controls to default, there's issues with key and mouse button assignment.
---
Tried holding mouse 3? Go to your C.A.M.P. device and hit the action button. Log out/log in
---
Can you make a screenshot ? Do you have the option 'place camp' when you open your pipboy ?
---
25. 
---
It's broken right now unfortunately. 
---
I've changed the button to Z and made sure I was away from any place and that worked thank you.
---
Okay thank you 👍
---
You mean every 5 minutes in DOOM? 
---
Weekly challenge is broken, so you probably won't be able to hit it anyway.
---
Also one near Abbie's bunker, if you standing on the road, it's to the right.
---
Oh really, that sucks hopefully it will come back soon as I have a bloodied build and because of it I’ve had a large damage increase.
---
I’m guessing we’re going to be able to reach parts of the map we couldn’t before, like with the Scout thing “Ever Upwards” in May, it says “Journey to the deepest parts of the forest” and I’m guessing that’s the area west over the river that’s currently out of bounds. Just a theory but they’re saying journey to the deepest parts of the forest like it’s somewhere we haven’t been before
---
Believe me I agree. I have the same build.  Just have to be patient I guess. A lot of good things are coming down the pipeline. 
---
Yeah your right that new dlc is coming soon so I’m looking forward to that.
---
Upvoting for "Scorchbeast rape sticks"
---
Hello,im on PC lvl 14 and i need to leveling if anyone can help,game name StiviSVK and europe time. Thanks for all.
---
Exactly what I was thinking! 
---
That would be amazing. Doubt it would happen though sadly. 
---
Really a SPECIAL should decide. Since Endurance is useless make it so the higher the Endurance the longer you can go without food or water. Agility should decide lockpicking and Intelligence, Science. Then remove those perks.
---
I always put the code for my camp on back of the door, but leave a little opening somewhere so they can feel smart about getting in :)
---
If you buy more Atom Store stuff they might have more money to license more music.
---
I spent it fainting and passing out on the bathroom floor 
---
I'll take it lol thanks. 👍
---
The weekly challenge is bugged, I killed 3 scorchbeast and a behemoth trying to get it to work but nothing :(
---
I end up bringing 5 different guns and 2 melees I have the luck of everything breaking or running out of ammo plus lots of different explosives 
---
Cool concept! Is it 4 people or 3 people so players can team up with your crew still? Or like 4 chaperones? 1000 caps and hour seems really high but I'm sure yo guys are worth it
---
Unyielding wood armor, chameleon wood armor, or weightless wood armor fit this. We have this.
---
Yes, I ran across Queens alot here. East of toxic dried lake bed and south of black bear lodge. North, North East of the shooting club. I used to put my camp here to farm the mirelurks Queens, before demolitions nerf. 
---
To add, for the love of God set yourself to pacifist mode before you go down there otherwise you're going to have a bad time
---
There’s a weapon called “All Rise” which is a sledgehammer you get for completing Mayor for a day in Watoga, it’s a great melee weapon and weighs 90% less and that might we worth waiting for and getting at level 50, I’m level 166 but it’s still my go to melee weapon and I’m glad I didn’t do the quest till after level 50, I can’t think of any others though
---
Tea spoils does it not? Plus those flowers spoil before you turn them into tea anyway so it makes sense 
---
Yes! Shit. Forgot this one. Was thinking of it going in but forgot to type it out. 
---
Strong back.
---
Hear that bethesda?
---
*Cross-play*
---
Hoard that. 
---
Didn't someone say something about it scaling with hunger or was that sarcasm or a mistake?
---
This needs to be a thing before the legendary vendor hits
---
Tbh I’m not sure but it’s now gone completely when I logged in.
---
What you recommend to nuke ? 
---
  What area's are best for each flux is something I am not familiar with in the game. 
---
If only ;( 
---
What is the point of those bears? You pick it up and you don't get to look at it again ever. There is no way to display in game anything you pick up... 
---
Thanks !
---
I did not get credit for the mirelurk queen kill, it is currently broken
---
People were begging for TSE to get nerfed then after patch they complained nonstop about ammo crafting and weapon condition. Damage and maintenance are correlated.
---
&gt;Thanks !
---
Well, you'll be unbannned someday. But i doubt it'll be before Wild Appalachia
---
Xbox.... Had this happen, as well
---
My house is always open.
---
Recoil is better on the handmade, so it makes non-VATS (ADS/hip fire) use better. The high capacity mag for the handmade is 85 rounds, whereas the combat rifle has 30. I'm not sure about anything else though. I think the combat rifle has less AP cost in VATS, but I'm not sure.
---
At the cost of losing that cap per bottle, I make all my frag grenades into nuka grenades.
---
For the past couple of weeks, every time I log out or even just change servers, most of my items in the favourites wheel are removed... have to add them in again.. anyone else have this problem? 
---
Maybe it's some kind of interaction with strange in numbers along with some mutation. Mutations and strange in numbers seem to be broken in some new way every patch.
---
Yup just noticed my favorited sniper rifle wasn’t in my favorites even though I know I hit it 
---
Plant crops you want at 100% condition at your CAMP. Scrap the crops you just planted. They'll be stored in stash and will not spoil until you take them from stash
---
That's because only the Nuka caps are currency.
---
Cant be strange in numbers, I dont have it. I play mostly solo but have a friend that gets on occasionally. Havent bought any group related cards because im rarely grouped.
---
I didnt think about equipping my cards again, Will try that next time. We just didnt group tonight and she followed me around the map by the social menu.
---
The loading screen showing your old level 1 character is not a bug. You took a photo when you created that character. The loading screen simply cycles through all saved photos. If you don't want to see that character again, delete that photo.
---
But what if they ask you to protect them from themselves? Say role playing with multiple personalities and one is trying to kill them?
---
I've read you have to take it off and put it on again?
---
And then the second time it'll disappear but the \*effect\* is still there.
---
I am unfortunately abroad and can't play and am reading this reddit for my fo76 fix so I can only tell you what I've read.
---
I don’t think that u do. But I don’t know
---
That must be a bug of somekind then
---
Someone's been playing monster hunter world XD
---
Yeah you're probably right i couldn't really focus on holotaped and papers.
---
I would be happy for a time frame. They have suspended accounts and basically said some day. I would of accepted a 10 month suspension as long as there was a time frame 
---
Nice idea. I'd like to have a working bathtub as well! Or a washing machine for the condition of apparel! Would love that!
---
I managed to kill the Mothman in the beta! Still shocks me how but it made for a super cool stream! 
---
https://youtu.be/mBWLZh2xCvo
---
if you're in the event all players turn yellow and are considered part of the same team. You cannot do damage to other players when this happens and will not engage in PvP. Afterwards is a whole other story though
---
I have done it and my friend has too. If you get rid of it and re apply it it will fix it. When you log out and back in again the text in the effects tab will be gone like it is now but your damage will be correct. 
---
I feel like sniper was so OP in the previous games that they've deliberately nerfed it.
---
"I sometimes stand still but also do move" - so you're not looking for weightless to combine with the chameleon mutation, I guess is what you're saying. Otherwise a decent option for a sniper build. I have a full set and it's fun to play around with.
---
Reduced ammo and weapon weight, of course. Vanguard I suppose.
---
I don't know, I have a melee/heavy build right now.
---
NV had Sarsaparilla caps.
---
This is a great write up! Totally agree with #1. As a hazmat user/no PA-build, it’s helpful when Queenie comes outside the blast, because I can keep my armor on, and thus I’m stronger and more helpful to the rest of you!
---
To add to the list: CRYOLATORS. These things will keep Queenie frozen on the ground. Cannot recommend enough.
---
they patched that
---
I haven't played in a while honestly, but I will hop on in a bit and grab a screenshot. 
---
It's supposed to be addressed in the next patch. We'll be able to display anything we can pick up in our camps.
---
Oh, me too. 
---
The fridge is a good idea. They don't even need to add space on the server. Make it use stash space.
---
I hear ya bud I sometimes too wish it were more like gta onlines passive move instead of this pacifist mode stuff
---
Lol to the people calling pvp unbalanced stealth boys are the only truly broken ass thing right now.
---
Good for you. 
---
My alt stealth rifleman has both plans handmade and lever action, as well. She’s built for speed and agility, 
---
So yeah it’s a big deal for me..
---
Take over the munitions factory and make your own. Careful though because people always want it after you've done the work to set it up. I always run out too thats my most reliable gun I own. TSE hardened handmade with piercing mag and suppressor. Also if someone takes it from you just jump servers.
---
Even if it did we would have a wheel of armour too its just broken
---
Right? I don’t really like pvp and I’m not out looking to mess with people so I wish pacifist mode would be where I can’t hurt anyone and others can’t hurt me 
---
It also had companions. I'd rather get my damned dog back.
---
Thank you 😀 always wanted to test that out but the ammo is scarce. 
---
We need Dogmeat!!! who do we talk about getting him in the next patch/update?
---
Do you play PC? There is a deadzone on console and it ridiculously messes with your aim when a full camo'd predator is FLYING at you weaving through the air with terrible physics. The deadzone is really fucked up and should have options to change
---
Anything but flying through the air in full fucking force completely invisible. Even with ways to counter it, it's not fun.
---
I would like to get the jetpack put on my Trusty suit of BOS t60
---
PC StiviSVK,lvl 14, gmt+1
---
Why can't I eat other vault dwellers? This is a serious bug!
---
Stealthboys are the only broken thing. lol
---
So it never restocks now?
---
There is an Attack Dog that I see frequently during SBQ fights - I always see the Scorched version, but I assume this is the regular version someone was lucky enough to find?
---
There is one dog that is a random event I believe, watching his master’s grave? Or looking for it? Something like that. I’ve read about him on here. Could be that, too.
---
Either way, not sure if new, just very rare. :)
---
Screenshot of the email. I don't believe you. 
---
My house is always opened because it's not even a house. It's just the most important things I need for surviving, but I like the idea of just wandering around without any proper home.
---
So we don't get the daily stimpaks now?
---
Everyone familiar with the Destiny approach to things? If you are lower level than the monster you are fighting, a percent of your damage gets peed in the wind. Bethesda adopted this approach in FO4. Until you are level 95, as far as DPS is concerned, you are a net liability for the SBQ fight, just fyi. But there's still stuff you can do to help, so don't be discouraged:
---
Low level and not contributing much? Have a decent shotgun? Get the enforcer perk to cripple the queen and give the higher level melee builds more time to DPS when she lands (you get two chances to do it - cripple her once until she regenerates her health - she'll take off again, then next time she lands hit her again). The endangerol syringe works on the scorchbeast queen! Use it! It only lasts two minutes and the encounter lasts 25 so keep your eye on the clock and keep her dosed. Also the cryolator works.
---
Let me be the tenth person to say ADRENALINE ADRENALINE ADRENALINE. Max out your adrenaline, kill lots of ads, then shoot at the queen.
---
I'm not 100% convinced of this. Yea it shows ya on a team but I've seen people get in fights while in this state. I have also seen the lil white directional alert when someone doesn't have it on down here.  Better to be safe than sorry tho. It's not very clear on event and parties. Like we don't share perk cards with all down here. 
---
Yes they also added a radrat pup lvl 1  tamable. I had it for a day.
---
Very good addition thanks! 👍
---
Until you reach level 50 or start getting legendary weapons don’t bother repairing weapons or armor just find new most likely will be better any ways save your resources for upgrading/ mods. Take workshops for the defense will give you aid items and exp. and caps. 
---
Because invisible while standing and invisible while crouched are not the same. 
---
Example: 
---
If you go with chameleon, you’ll 
---
Run/sprint 20% of the time 
---
Crouch 60% of the time 
---
Stand 20% of the time 
---
(I’m being generous here, you’ll probably stand more). 
---
Total amount of time you’re invisible - 60%. 
---
If you go with weightless, you’ll
---
Stand 80% of the time. 
---
80% &gt; 60%.
---
When did this get patched? Didn't see it in the patch notes
---
Yea. As I mentioned above. Did 3 encounters today the first one it did the queen turn friendly white bar thing and reset all but the time. But other two we managed to drop her. It is screwey tho for sure.
---
To those saying “head canon”, head canon no more! If you actually climb up to one of those junk piles in particular, there is one that has (in addition to the usual guano) a mess of various remains (brahmin, etc) that is called: Scorchbeast Nest. And it does indeed give you a few SB related items.
---
They knowingly put the stimpacks in just to take them out later. Makes total sense. 
---
I think your playing another Fo76, the youtuber's edition... 
---
no  from what it looks like from the datamined files it doesnt respawn anymore 
---
It was an unannounced change in the latest patch i.e. Stealth nerf
---
Not the name plate I mean the white directional on edges of hud when you take a hit from other players. Like normal it's Red but if a player is trying to initiate pvp with ya the white ones show up. Or maybe u ment the players fighting?
---
I should probably respec all my mutations. I swear half of my deaths have been from unstable isotope
---
Why this isn't a problem at all...
---
Dense mod
---
Padded mods
---
Fire proof
---
Shame
---
Get urself some stims go find a lvl 1 mob let it take u down get revived repeat, you can pop the achivo pretty quick
---
One thing to consider: in PvP you won’t just drop junk. You’ll drop aid too. 
---
Get knocked out once and bye bye stealth boys and invisibility. 
---
I think they’ll still become a good idea - they’re the only way to get invisibility while moving that doesn’t require to be hit first. 
---
But I’d use them as a secondary reactive method, on top of a primary proactive one. 
---
Will do! Thanks!! About to go skiing for the week but will be playing once I’m back. 
---
Yeah I guess it just mean the mayors office is yet another place that's pointless to go back to. Can lump it in with everywhere else now
---
That's some bullshit, it was the only reason to actually go near there
---
Awesome - appreciate it!
---
Just friend everybody, message optional, 99% of the people are super chill.
---
Blackbird is available to everyone via Atoms
---
I really like my unyielding armor. At low health all my stats are double digits. 
---
Vanguard is good stuff, too. 
---
I'm working on a set of bolstering for myself, hopefully it makes me a little tanker. Gonna be hard to give up that 15 points of strength, though. 
---
I like this. 
---
Could be similar to the way Charisma lets you share perks. Lock picking/hacking ‘levels up’ with every 3 special points you out into agility/intelligence. Every 3 points in Endurance slows the drain of food/water by the equivalent of 1 rank of the appropriate perk. 
---
This could apply to quite a few of the ‘standard’ perks. I’ve not really felt the benefit of SPECIAL this time around. I choose my points solely for Perk Card builds, never for the passive effect of the SPECIAL. I’m not sure it should feel that way. 
---
Still, I’m holding out for non-mod perk decks. That’d make my camp/adventure transition a little smoother and it’d be a semi-solution to hacking and pick locking not being passive. 
---
Not anymore it's not. 
---
Your strategy is sound, but your words are too explicit!
---
What level are you
---
Players on your team have their name displayed above them in yellow. This also happens when they're in an event with you, like Scorched Earth or Uranium Fever. These players, with yellow name plates, cannot initiate PvP and you cannot deal damage to them even if you're playing with pacifist off. Players not in your team have a white name plate and you can initiate PvP with them. Sometimes when players join the event (they click the event hexagon, pay the caps, and fast travel), they don't actually join the event and appear as white name plates. They can initiate PvP with you. After the event is over, everyone with yellow nameplates revert to white and you can initiate PvP with them.
---
You can play however you want if it makes you feel better, but I actually go to the queen fights to engage in PvP afterwards. The only way to get into PvP during the SBQ fight is if the server bugs out and someone doesn't automatically enter the event when they travel to the area. I have to wait until after the queen dies to do PvP
---
ok thanks.   
---
 that's weird that in xbox you have Send Message and Add Friend separate  
---
but in ps4, you gotta click Add Friend to Send Message.  
---
i dont have a problem adding people as friends but was wondering why its not avail on ps4 the way it is on xbox
---
Also - for the most part, melee use cavalier because they have to run to their target. Gun builds use sentinel. 
---
My main runs uny/sent and I can sprint for about 1 minute straight with marathoner and custom fit on my legs. 
---
If I strip unyielding back and replace it with weightless (or assassin), that’s an 18 AGI point hit that’ll degrade how long I can sprint by over half.
---
Not head canon, but in fact the actual answer. :)
---
Did not know repearing was that ressource consuming. 
---
This is my main food supply. 
---
I just wish it didn’t have to be. I know so many tasty ways to prepare the local flora and fauna, but I have to make myself deliberately weaker to ensure I make it back to camp before my gathered ingredients turn into fertiliser. 
---
I’d like a fridge/pantry type item for my foods and ingredients. I don’t particularly mind not being able to grow cranberries or silt beans, but I’d like to be able to gather a stash of them and freeze/can/jar them for future culinary adventures. 
---
Still don't have the chest mod. Been doing NOW quests and events for literal weeks. I feel ya. Had no idea you could mod the helmet. Now I have another mod to grind for. 
---
Just explore and have fun. General rule of thumb - enemies get tougher as you go south, and especially east, from the starting point. As the story missions bring you out there, if you hit some harder enemies, backtrack and explore some of the stuff left on the other side of the map. You get some boosts from the story missions - like, good items to craft - but nothing so incredible that you need to rush through it. 
---
One small thing that is really helpful early - Any observation or scouting tower, you can climb to the top of it, and it'll present an option to "survey the area." (The towers kind of look like lighthouses on your map.) That will put a bunch of map tabs on your map, undiscovered, but at least you'll have them. You can also do this with the maps hanging on the wall at Morgantown and the train stations, although you have to get REALLY close to the individual thumbtacks on the map for the option to be offered. 
---
I'm pretty sure you are able to send a message without having to add someone on ps4
---
It can totally make the difference between winning and failing the event. 👍🏻
---
To get the quest and plansat ghram I think 25 in the min level.
---
I have been saving up combat armor helmets so have 5 with the BoS paint. 
---
Can give you one if you're on PC?
---
Endangerol does not work on the queen or really anything. It's broken
---
It my bobbleheads, and the variety is nice. Some for the PA, we should be able to have a proper stand
---
People have tried this and said it doesn’t always work out - so beware, especially if you have to get rid of other mutations to do so. 
---
I’m personally waiting it out. 😕
---
Or lemmie take all that useless table salt and preserve the meat?
---
Are you on Xbox perchance?
---
I’m in the market for some Cola. 
---
It doesn't matter if level 155 or 200. Ur not getting stronger beyond certain point. 
---
🙊 This is unfortunate. Apologies.  And prob why I got chat banned on Xbox. 🤔 Buuut it ended as of about 30 min ago! 👍
---
Try posting at r/FO76roleplay ! :)
---
Or keep them as a stash box, but add a power conduit and if you connect it, it slows down food decay. 
---
There, it gets the desired result, but there is also a mechanic to it other than just building the ice box. 
---
While they're at it, I'd like the Nuka Cola machine to do some nice things to any stored beverages. 
---
If removing bulk items from autoscrapping is too much work, how about making it so that we are reimbursed the raw plastic instead?  If for example, I unbulk 30 bulk steels by accident, it should give me 900 steel scrap plus the 60 plastic it took me to bulk them in the first place.  Plastic is recycleable in the 2019's, it should surely be recyclable in the 2090's or whatever year we're in.
---
The point is higher levels have been playing long enough to have an actual build. Most 50-80s are still using random gear and weapons that are good enough to play the game but not good enough to fight the queen. So technically, level does matter. 
---
Properly geared is the key point here. Levels was mentioned because most 150+ folks ARE properly geared. 
---
I don't pick up random bags because you never know if the items are duped. I always take a lil peak though. 
---
Same here. The only food I store is the longlife prewar stuff. I am literally never short on food.
---
Drinks I get short on more often, but all I need to do is spend a couple minutes to get some. I also use zero slower spoiling perks or extra percentage to hunger/thirst
---
The other mutants probably want to eat Chally :(
---
I think you can take radshield and diluted rad x
---

---
The Perfect Storm from the quest you get in the water park up north is worth waiting for, as well. It's a really easy quest chain with no impact on the main story. 
---
This quest comes from a nanny bot who is looking for her missing child. If you wait, it will yield a level 50 submachine gun that does burning damage over time. 
---
Hope this helps
---
Was having the same problem, thanks for this comment!
---
I just sold two of them: one for for 3k and the other for 4k
---
I mean, I’d settle for an Atom Shop poster of him saying “in Memoriam” or something 😂
---
Drop site is better than the BoS base - she lands more frequently when people are around the drop site, or the building to the west with the Glassed Cavern elevator exit.
---
Also, yes, for the love of Mothman, stay the fuck out of the way of us heavy gunners. If you aren't doing serious damage to her, you're preventing me from doing so. I had a fight the other day where no matter where I stood or faced, this one fairly low level doof in an Excavator suit consistently ended up in front of me. I debated turning Pacifist off.
---
I have too much junk in my trunk already
---
The fights have gotten tougher, but they're not unmanageable. And thanks to the number of scorched everything that spawned, I came home with 38 hardened masses and 40 glowing masses from a single battle.
---
equip awareness so you can see her DR and take screenshots before and after you shoot her. It does nothing
---
no they patched the radshield now it's only rad-x diluted u can use to not supress mutation
---
No they tarnished their own reputation by releasing games in the same series that are years even decades apart with the exact same bugs the previous games had at launch. The same bug that’s were either already fixed by them or for free by modders multiple times. 
---
It’s kind of just pulled back the curtain to show how lazy bethesda has really been with ES and Fallout. Just pure lazy development no other ways about it. 
---
I hope it makes a high level forest area. I mean I would love to have a high level area with the forest looks. Mostly as There and the mire are the only places I think look good for camping in. 
---
For 3 or 4 people, that doesn't seem horrible. I get paid 1750 caps (PC) to launch nukes for people, and I do that solo.
---
Never touch another dudes junk, in game or out. 
---
Also if you join a team randomly (I do this so if my client crashes I can get back on), please please please ask your teammate, especially if he/she is obviously running a melee build and needs high rads to maintain spells that proc only at low health, before you share radsponge.
---
I literally never lock my door.
---
I WANT people to come in and check out my kickass camp.
---
Plus I have all the things. So it’s fully functional 😁
---
Great advice. We failed the event last night by like, two minutes. 
---
Can't understate teamwork enough. For the majority of players, this is going to make the difference. If everyone is gunning for the queen like they're trying to solo her it will end badly every damn time.
---
Traveling pharmacy.
---
But what if it was a girl, they don’t have junks right at least not in the front
---
Hmm too bad.
---
I just take their junk after checking if they didn't carry large amounts of duped items.
---
Bummer
---
Bethesda Ticket? bethesda doesnt run this sub
---
It really is tough to tell these days, hidden junk matters. 
---
I only take someone’s loot if it’s in a nuked zone and they clearly died from staying in it and not leaving before the bomb drops. 
---
I did not know about rad-x diluted huh
---
Works with chairs/ sofas as well.
---
I agree with the drop site being best. Has the fence around it and it set up right melee filing gaps in fence with Gunners on the roof. Low peeps on ground behind melee lobbng nades. It's a thing of beauty really. Until a mirelirk queen spawns and acids the lowlies. Then chaos erupts.
---
Did you contact bethesda? If it was a one time event then you may have a case, but idk
---
I've never seen the X01 jet pack mod this expensive. I've bought it several times - every time I see it. I haven't seen it in a while though, have prices gone up?
---
well dammit
---
PS4. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Want to play a Sniper?
---
Bring a Melee weapon! 🙄
---
Talking about balance 
---
Absolutely take their junk. Laugh in their face like a raider when they ask for it back. This isn't kindergarten.
---
But yeah junk is useless eventually, in the sense that you can always run out and farm what you need, so no need to hoard it. That stash space is best used for other cool stuff. I feel like Bethesda is deliberately punishing us for being hoarders, probably to try to keep the server from being overloaded.
---
Well, I am trying to be patient as I have no real desire to spend them on anything but, I feel like regardless, they owe them to me and haven’t made good. It’s that overwhelming theme to everything attached to this game that they really need to work on. Perception is everything. 
---
are you mutated? adrenaline reaction got updated and needs to be removed and reapplied to be fixed... I think that my bloodied gauss may have been off before I fixed AD
---
I will have a look, and take it if it is any good.  You never know if they will even come back.  If they are a newer player and I see them again, I'll hand it over, or if they are nice about it, I'll hand it over.  If they are a higher level character or a jerk, sorry but it's now mine.
---
I had a full bolstering set and was not impressed. Maybe I haven't figured out how to use it properly. Unyielding is better.
---
Around 2 o'clock GMT
---
If I see a junk bag, I always take a look. But I only loot if there are no players nearby. I could never loot a warm Vault 76 dweller corpse. Never know what sort of diseases they be carrying
---
I read that as "1700 hours to find one". Seems about right. 
---
I'm wondering if this was what they were trying to do in bumping up the adds. Give us more of these items. 🤔
---
You mean like the ones people encounter all the time?
---
Fair enough! 
---
Go capture sunshine meadows industrial farm and you’ll be bound to see him along the road between there and flatwoods, I saw him there 4 times in the one session yesterday while I was hoarding sugar bombs, was actually wondering if he had increased spawns for the challenge.
---
Return 50 bottles for a regular weapon/armour/clothing.  
---
200 for a legendary level 1.  
---
400 for legendary level 2.  
---
600 for legendary level 3.  
---
1000 for a 4 star legendary
---
I ain't sayin' shit.
---
I play on Xbone too and this problem happens a lot.  I'd say 90% when this happens she won't take damage for the rest of the fight and the event times out.  The other 10% she's stuck at that point for about 10 minutes then she regens and then we are able to damage her and take her down.  The biggest bitch I have about the fight is the spinner of death while trying to loot once she is dead...
---
Knew there was a good reason to hold onto these! Thanks very much. 
---
I wear a combination of pink and rainbow coloured metal armour. From a lore perspective, I'm pretty convinced that the mutants of the wasteland have zero colour perception.
---
Same!
---
Did not dupe items, have not accepted unreasonable stacks of items, probably have a weapon or 2 from trading that is duped by someone back in the line of events, but that is just a guess since i have traded for gear.
---
Not banned. 
---
Regarding the 900 hour guy with all that ultracite ammo and god knows what else that is rare that he has or had in godlike quantities. I think even the polished picture presented stinks
---
I have contacted Bethesda. It's now a week and they haven't even looked at it. Also Bethesda browse this sub regularly 
---
People tend to find upwards of 10 in the desk in that wing. Maybe you just got unlucky ? Always open any safes you see.  
---
Seen it on PC a few times.  
---
About half a dozen times when 7 or more players are present.  
---
Pretty much the exact same story, she takes damage down to about 80%-75% health, then takes absolutely no damage anymore.
---
Istopped locking my doors. For that very reason 😂😂
---
Try that again. I believe in used rad-x diluted the other night and it to suppressed my mutation.  Shorter duration then rad-x but still suppressed them.
---
Yeah I'm melee build so I run around killing all the scorched and critters that get summoned until the Queen lands, that is a full time job by itself.
---
I wish it was more like diablo 2 where you could play in public games or password protect a session for you and your friends.
---
I think I read it somewhere in the official Bethesda Fallout 76 forum, it has something to do with the weapons that have the same name, for example : you favorited a legendary hunting rifle, and then you loot a regular hunting rifle. The game is confused which hunting rifle is favorited. And then when you scrap/sell the regular hunting rifle, it will be removed from your favorite wheel.
---
Favoriting of items / junk to block or put a confirmation dialogue up: "You cannot scrap a favorite item."
---
Do your workbenches actually work?
---
Whenever I have workbenches across from each other like that, it glitches and doesn't show any menus.
---
GMT pc :(
---
 What did anyone gain when they disabled it? Not a damn thing from the user view other than some nebulous security fix maybe (that was SO BAD it's been there since the game launched so then that's a problem too then).  Bethesda should add their own manager, but Zenimax clearly rushed this game out before it was ready.
---
If only you were on PC, i need some henchmen to walk around and look tough
---
I like the handmade cause it's got basically no recoil. ROCK freaking solid.
---
Just consider anti armor to be badass, whatever the numbers say.
---
I think prime recievers are worth it, but only on your biggest baddest gun and only for queen fights. Save it for that jaw dropping weapon that you will eventually find.
---
Yep, can confirm. Had a regular lever action and a legendary on the wheel. Game regularly removed one from favorites. Had to put one in the stash.
---
That would be great too
---
Thank you very much, I never considered melee until I stumbled across a death tambo and a mutant slayers guitar which I thought we pretty cool
---
 but for some reason I can't use them in my power armour.
---
This is very helpful and thanks for taking the time to reply :)
---
Is that like, 1000% confirmed? It would not shock me if it turned out there is a bug that let's you loot player bases. ;)
---
Can I rename my Anti-Armor Grognak's axe to Glorified Rape Stick?
---
right outside mac’s farm 
---
I have a locked door, but, 99% of the time, that door is open. I have never had a mob find their way up my stairs in my current CAMP. I only lock it when doing trades ... not that anyone ever finds their way to my slightly-hidden CAMP anyhow. (Acid vent NE of Top of the World, near the picnic pavilion. Near the dog icon on the map.)
---
How? On my ps4 I see: fast travel, invite to team, add friend, mute and block for session
---
Yeah it’s pretty bad unless it’s legendary don’t repair lol
---
Sorts of like real life!
---
Very few people wander in that area.
---
I think Bethesda needs to either confirm there's a problem or explain in detail how stealth works in this game. 
---
I regularly walk through crowds of enemies with no chameleon or stealth boy and don't leave hidden. Im wearing ultralight marine armor (not power armor) and I have all my sneak perks on. I use a regular BoS combat rifle.
---
It would help if people would share their armor type and mods, as armor weight has a big effect on stealth. If I even get inside my power armor, I'm in danger. Devs and community mods have no way of knowing if someone is complaining about stealth not working while in power armor and firing missiles.
---
I'm just not sure that stealth is meant to work the way people want it to work.
---
Wtf?? Why is place so toxic? Ok i didn’t know that with the bobbleheads jeeesus!!!! -7 downvotes? No I play regularly and the game is clearly more stable now and everything, but why I got nearly killed nonetheless the other day? It IS still possible... f*ck that Place Srsl. My comment didn’t imply anything from your typical „tHiS gAmE iS sO sHiTty“ attitude. What’s wrong with you guys? Get a freaking life! 
---
What you gonna do with all that junk? All that junk inside your trunk?
---
I've played for 260 hours and I've been attacked by another player once.  I logged out and back in and continued playing.  I also had someone destroy my camp once.  That's pretty much the extent of pvp I've had to deal with.
---
Kinda adds to the explorer mystery of the game and doesn’t do any actual harm. 
---
Bad luck
---
I knew about staying in the area. But i totally forgot the towers existed!
---
Good tip thanks!
---
Dropping from legendary enimes bit random what u get
---
My CAMP is currently a resource production facility so i leave it open for all of my fellow wastelanders as a friendly gesture.
---
There's lead production, scrap production, adhesive gardens, and fertilizer.
---
I get attacked enough as is.
---
Testing all of the code period would be a step in the right direction.
---
Both of them require you to stand still. If you are already standing still, it is not hard to crouch. So basically you are going to sacrifice, what 32% of damage reduction for being able to stand up and be invisible...that's one bad deal. 
---
I don't know if the SBC queen isnt taking any damage or if our weapons have been nerfed too hard but I (and all players around me) havent been able to kill it once before the end of the event since the last patch (1.0.6.0).
---
Sometimes the SBQ also stays quite high, almost out of range,  blasting us , for around 10mn...
---
 Quite frustrating I would say.
---
You try leaving an unsealed container of tea on your counter next to an unsealed container of water &amp; see which goes off fastest :') 
---
A beta client option with a test server would be best, I'd play there exclusively.
---
lol same with my two shot minigun, it broke after I used it to kill 4x super mutants lv 68. That weapon now just sitting in my stash; I'm only using it to waste the excessive amount of ammo.
---
Saw you posted before about no region ping. 
---
Sounds like you're still having connection issues.  
---
However if you were in a team you could have reconnected to the server you were on. 
---
god yes
---
No. Listen, where tf is this a troll comment? Ok, i didn’t remember that with the stacking, I read the patch notes back then, I simply wanted to say that you still can get griefed, where TF is this a troll comment? -7 downvoted? Is this place serious? You have to get everything right and misinformation aren’t allowed? Ok, i was WRONG with that.... but You guys are toxic. This game clearly made some progression and Iam happy that it doesn’t crash that often anymore. BUT I still got nearly killed with a freaking god built the other day! (2 hits and I was down with half my health) Where is the troll comment? And yeah, bring it on... downvote army for the win. It’s so pathetic. 
---
Exploration is my favorite part.  I'm level 49 and I haven't spent hardly any time on the main quest.  I just love wandering around and finding things.  And Bethesda put tons of neat little things in the game to find.
---
They should have it regardless. People play solo all the time with multiple workshops, all of that time is wasted if you get kicked. 
---
Or a spiked rad-toad tongue!😍
---
Since it's elastic
---
the longer you hold down attack-button the further it extends but with lower dmg.
---
I love you I love this post I completely agree with you but dude. This just ain’t gonna happen. Literally I hope they fix, I dunno, being able to normally invite ppl into parties without 37 bugs happening first? Gah 
---
Explicit? Fallout? What?
---
Since the last patch, you can see who is the owner of that CAMP by hovering to the CAMP objects like turrets, block him, exit to main menu, log back in and never have to see that person anymore.
---
Chameleon armor is very useful, vanguards is nice, any reduced weights are a huge QOL boost. 
---
Combat armor is the most well rounded armor out there
---
A lot of PVPer like cavilers/ sentinels assassin pieces. But it’s a pain to get and honestly not worth the effort in my opinion. 
---
If you lock your doors I pick the lock and then smash all of your shit.  If I'm going to be wanted im going to make it worth it. 
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3345fb&amp;d=l71lt2a72a41aj2ar2ao0au2i44c72s50ss2si0se2sj0sg2sf2p52ej2l12lu2&amp;w=&amp;n=Stealth/%20Melee here or  u can also go for a glass cannon bloodied meele build probably the strongest DMG wise unless bloodied gets nerfed
---
Haha. The powerhouse is a strip club in Newcastle. Hehe. Heh
---
Glad I could help.
---
Death tambo is considered unarmed (similar to mole miner gauntlet, deathclaw gauntlet, knuckles) and all of them cannot be used whilst wearing power armor. These are affected by the Iron Fist perk + talon mutation (and, possibly, by twisted muscles, but I'm not 100% sure).
---
The guitar is 1-handed melee and should work with power armor.
---
Once you to melee everything seems easier. 
---
Agree, if we can join the same instance if we're part of a team after crashing, why can't we do that after crashing solo? It's arbitrary and stupid. Also this this happens to me EVERY FRICKING TIME. Since most of the time I'm playing is early in the morning before everyone else wakes up, being on a team is usually not an option. So why am I being penalized?
---
Just my personal opinion but get starched genes perk maxed out as soon as you able to did this on my alt character so you can get some good mutations the serums are pretty cheap people sell them on here alot.
---
It wouldn't matter if they are duped if there isn't 10,000 of anything just sitting there 
---
Since you're using adrenal reaction, you should +3 INT to get NERD RAGE.
---
aol
---
Glad freak feels pointless,  the negative effects my mutations give really aren't that awful. 
---
I can't remove 2 points from perception.  
---
And that's your reason for grim reapers sprint? 
---
Upvoted for offering help, thanks. 
---
I’m on ps4 and I’m seeing high level players left and right lol 
---
It'll ride up with wear
---
This is the sub with 900 hours guy.
---
As far as I can tell from this whole dumpster fire, Bethesda's database mechanism was only entering records for what was in a player's inventory and not what was coming out of it or from/to where.  So when they did their DB query  a lot of us got flagged for doing exactly what you're talking about. I didnt destroy mine (and now i know it wouldn't have helped) I kept what I found and split it 3 ways with my friends.   
---
I seriously doubt their going to lift the ban. That would require the use of brain cells that arent fighting each other.
---
To me the whole idea of placing the blame for marketing-related decisions onto actual product or the product-team shows how precise is the perception of the people giving such comments. Being publicly dumb is legal tho, so I can't deny those people their rights.
---
This isn't California, you keep the glass and metal for crafting.
---
Fuuuck
---
Ran into the same issue yesterday on PS4 
---
Great writeup! Strategy aside, my favorite thing about the v9 placement - I cannot state how badass it looks with a fucking army of people in power armor on the roof with heavy guns taking the Queen down.
---
Ultralight has worked since the beginning. 
---
I thought this was the only way to go!
---
Yeah its annoying, I have a legendary combat shotgun and picked up a regular one in a junk run... only to have the regular one replace the one on my hot bar.... and only reason I realized is because my dps had gone way down (though I had the wrong perk cards on). There really is no good reason why a weapon I have favorited can be replaced by one I just picked up... hope they fix this in a future update.
---
Are we not still in beta?
---
Im only considering it. Adrenal reaction is always useful. I may be misunderstanding nerd rage,  but I believe it only works when below 20% health as opposed to a sliding scale. 
---
Mine shows only negative affects in pipboy but is actually working.
---
Tell that to my Carnivore mutation
---
I'd also like to know if it's broken. I play Stealth and each update seems to change the mechanic in some way and I have to adapt. While it does feel ridiculous being 5ft in front of a grounded SB popping .308s in his face, I do find it frustrating when my Escape Artist isn't triggering correctly and I get swarmed by heat seeking Mutants. I'd just like to know how it's supposed to work, at least
---
maybe someone shot her with the Karma Syringer instead of the Endangerol Syringer
---
Grim reaper Is used for the the ap so u can do more mini blitz attacks and do more crits since u have vats. Remove class freak either put two points into perception or get a crit perk like critical savy or better crit
---
Yeah I agree, the changes and lack of direction on mechanics make it hard to know if we're doing it right. I've started to run and break line of sight before trying to resneak and in most cases I get back into caution and can wait to re-enter hidden after a short while, or fast travel out. There are some cases where I can't shake them but that's not different then my other MMO experiences.
---
Stealth works fine for me until i change my weapon. Almost immediately after changing i get spotted even form very far away. Stealth is not completely broken, but it sure needs some love.
---
My normal boylts stay red but only attack if I initiate it. Weird. 
---
Because we're all sneak builds
---
A solid 3 or 4 runs/server hops hitting Lucky Hole Mine, Grafton steel mill, Grafton Prison, and Whitesprings should get you all the materials you need to make a ton of ammo. Literally sitting on over 10k rounds of 5mm and .50. 
---
Wait... critters don’t activate pressure plates? Or does this make it so that you can only get in by deliberately sprinting at the door? Would be handy to let people in without inviting in nasties.
---
Yeah thats what i was saying. Only track what goes in not what comes out and god forbid you track where it came from.
---
What weapons are you switching from/to?
---
I'm on Asian server. So probably or entire Asia sneak build or we have a problem with server.
---
I found some guys camp east of Grafton. It was literally 3 work stations in the middle of the road. Definitely scrapped some junk and made some ammo though lol. 
---
I never lock my door.
---
Mostly from melee (DCG) to ranged (Handmade or Hunting rifle). But even the other way around.
---
Lol an entire server of people sneaking
---
workshop defense give you nearly all the camp plans.
---
powering up the power plants gives you all the generator plans.
---
Which weapon and gear?
---
same here this is how it works now, you dont see it but it is there. 
---
Wouldn't this fall under Brotherhood of Steel?  Their whole goal is keeping dangerous technology away from people.  Even during the faction quest line their leader was adamant about not using the nukes against the scorched.  So it would be to me that you'd be roleplaying BoS.
---
This post won't help your case bud lol 
---
Loool. Hope so
---
Actual toilet? This is the broken toilet, and pretty common. You can scrap them when in workshop build mode in Charleston landfill, I think that's how I got my plans, not sure, it's been a while.
---
We got bored and are having a break brb
---
 Mostly from melee (DCG) to ranged (Handmade or Hunting rifle). But even the other way around. I've got two part of chameleon armour, fully ranked sneak perk plus escape artist.
---
I'm cool with this but since it is the apocalypse I suggest that every X amount of hours it needs to be fixed with scrap.
---
I’m not saying it’s hard. 
---
I’m saying it’s something you have to actively do, and subsequently not do each time.
---
For the other one you just have to not move. You don’t have to perform an explicit action. 
---
I believe she is scaling for a full 24 people now. Which means maximum add's and maximum hp for the queen (1,220,000 : 55,540k each person). 
---
I've failed her twice after the patch and managed to kill her once with only 5 minutes left. I used to have her on farm and was killing her under 5 minutes before the patch. I honestly prefer this though. The fight lasts long and there just so many "adds" now its crazy. I leveled up in 1 Queen fight and im like lvl205. I was impressed. 
---
I hope fixing her doesn't change anything. She's honestly a much more tactical fight now. You need people using anti-armor. You need people using cryolaters and adrenal syringe's too. 
---
I pretty sure it said somewhere that me multiboxed which does require a third party program in order to control two characters at once. 
---
&gt; That isn't even possible in the game both explosive and anti armor are in the same "minor" effects weapons can have, it is 100% impossible to get both of those on the gun.
---
Oh cheers I suppose, I didn’t know this. I was wondering why they were mutually exclusive. I just figured I had bad luck. 
---
&gt; Thank you. Have a good one.
---
No thank you, it was a pleasure and I learnt something new too. 🙏 
---
I know, I smell the downvotes already... 
---
Unfortunately not
---
Lol. Great. Party and I'm not invited... babysitter for low levels? Thank you. 🤣😂🤣😂
---
did the same, just wiped them all and re applied. Turns out twisted muscles wasn't working either because I died while getting it so things are much better now. Im almost glad Bethesda screwed up. 
---
Funny you should mention that......No we aren't 
---
I just want my bulk items from being auto scrapped when you "scrap all junk" So much wasted plastic till I figured this out. 
---
Whoah. So I can see why someone would want to keep you out. 
---
Voice of Set can be upgraded later, using Voice of Set as a component. This may apply to other quest reward weapons as well, not sure.
---
An Idea, how about a machine that makes the unspoilable pink food paste like the one in Fallout 4? It wouldn’t spoil like the canned dogfood.
---
Oh I see can you still stealth scorchbeasts? I find they see me a mile away crouched wearing no armor with rank 3 sneak and escape artist
---
I can be right underneath them and the don't see me. Well, most of the time :-)
---
Let me stir the pot a bit more. 
---
You lose, what, 32% on 4 assassin effects? 
---
Well I see your 32% avoidance and raise you up to five weightless pieces with **powered** on the third effect. And a **dodgy** perk on, which gives you virtually same 30% avoidance, only if works against PvE as well. 
---
Because you know what you’re doing when you’re standing still? Recharging your AP. Really, really fast. 
---
DID YOU JUST ASSUME THEIR GENDER!?!?! /s
---
Heh, ok sorry, it's just we see some serious idiotic haters on here bitching about stupid shit in a game they quit months ago.  
---
 
---
Don't worry about imaginary internet points.  
---
My door is locked so i can close it if i need to go AFK for a bit and not get mauled by some random whatever. BUT otherwise it is always open. I even have TWO beds inside, in case a couple of visitors need to rest.   
---
The only thing i lock is my water. I'm thirsty, okay? 
---
you can actually get tons of blast ferns from under groups of trees at fissure site prime, thats where i got my violet for my calibrated shocks. 
---
I was thinking about why isn't this the case. Then I though well everyone must litter. And then I though well yes everyone does litter there are cans and bottles and shit everywhere. But I agree this stuff should be junked into your inventory. I upvote for a greener Appalachia.
---
Queen include an nuke silo run? If not what’s the adder? That is my last quest... I have a card... just need the code.
---
Bulk your junk. Keep a good sniper rifle until you get a good legendary whatever. Dont be stuck to a certain build, flexibility is king. Get a super sledge until you get a good legendary whatever. Always build multiple water purifiers so you can sell the excess. Do the adhesive garden (tatos mutfruit and corn in equal numbers) and razorgrain soup is a good food and water source. For base i recommend having 2 to 4 foundation with a staircase to a larger upper level, enclose the top and have a couple ,3 max, turrets covering the area on the foundations. Good luck 👍
---
It feels like the enemies are much stronger in general. Been using way more stims lately.  I used to be able to take a whole group of glowing ones solo but now it seems like everyone is having trouble killing them. 
---
I know this is a late reply, but Cunningham at Whitesprings (the armor vendor) has a chance to sell them.
---
Unless there's no one around or they travel away, don't take it. Watching them die then swooping in? Yeah you are an arsehole.
---
It's probably already said here, but I'm not going through trying to read everything. The damage bug is still there! After some time playing I can't hurt anything and have to re-login just to fix it. They fixed this in December! They need to fix it again!
---
Ultra-light makes sneaking easier because armor weight directly affects your sneak ability. It's stated in the in-game help menu; I had no idea until I submitted a ticket asking for more info on sneaking.
---
If you combine Weightless legendary armor with Ultra-light, you're almost undetectable. With Marine armor, these two combined make the armor weigh literally zero. I tried the same with Weightless hvy Combat Armor, but the armor still had between 0.25 and 1 pound, if I recall right.
---
I can sneak around 5 scorched in broad daylight and remain in "caution", and kill them all without breaking into "danger".
---
Absolutely love this.  I'm interested in SBQ services.  What time zone are you available in?  I'm Eastern, and play around 7pm on days when I work.
---
Yeah, it was my Third Nuke, fourth run and my PS4 crashed just after I got to White Springs.  
---
I would have ben more upset except that the next world that I joined also had launched a Nuke and I got to pick up where I left off.  I also ended up getting a Furious Pump Shotgun, a two shot non-explosive 44 pistol, a Vampire lever-action, and a 3\* robot chest armour piece.  One of the best hauls that I've ever had.  I saw/killed 4x 3\* and 2x 2\* Glowing ones.  Typically I'm lucky if I see 1 or 2.
---
However, the other night I was on a server that was near empty and I started a run to claim all of the workshops.  I had 8x claimed when it dumped me.  That hurt because I was just getting on a roll.  It would be horrible if you only had 1 or 2 to go...
---
The one thing that I found out from the experience is that you need a lot of aluminum (\~500x), steel (\~500x) and gears (\~250x) if you plan on putting up turrets at each location to defend it while you're off taking another one.  Take the workshops with scrap heaps first, that way you can stock up along the way.
---
I dont think they are smart enough to stand on the pressure plate, wait for the door to open, then run through it. They have destroyed the plate
---
All I know for sure is I havent had any get upstairs.
---
I do worry, a bit... bc it can get in the negatives and some people don’t wanna trade on here anymore. I know, I see the idiotic haters on here, but sometimes it’s better to wait a bit and see if, in this case my comment, is a „typical hater comment“. I get it, you could read it that way, but It was late for me, already half asleep and i just did an opsie with the bobbleheads part. But apart from that it’s true. It is still possible to get griefed and that’s still a big bummer for me. 
---
Go to write a message on the PS4 menu, but search for the username instead.
---
Yeah. Tbh I'm not even playing that often anymore, but I was pissed when I got the notice and not the actual atoms... 
---
There's...something wrong with it, but it's hard to pin down what exactly. I think part of it is just a display bug, because I've sat in front of enemies with perma-caution on and they are not searching for me at all. Today I had danger up with no enemies in sight and had to relog to clear it. Other times gaining a real caution and then losing it seems to fix it.
---
The last three big patches have all introduced annoying bugs for me. First was the one where taking any radiation insta-killed me, then this stealth strangeness and now the adrenal reaction one. I can work around them but it's frustrating and I've definitely been playing less as a result.
---
The roadmap was exciting but core systems still need a lot of work. Imagine killing the boss in a vault raid and the corpse disappears or it drops a drill.
---
But it doesn't work correctly. It doesn't activate when low hp, it only activates when hitting an enemy 
---
Ah well that makes sense now! Thanks again 
---
Sometimes you just have to change position.  I can't count the number of times I've run into a similar issue and just moving back or to the side and spamming the placement button finally gets it to go.
---
Damn wtf maybe I just suck then 
---
I was also reminded about armor weight when reviewing old fallout 4 tips on sneaking. I'm also wearing marine ultralight but I don't have weightless. Did they share anything interesting in your email exchange or did they just refer you to the help menu?
---
the issue isnt that she isnt taking damage, after P6 hit, she is tougher to kill. The majority of the playerbase cannot do enough damage to kill her, making her a pretty useless target to nuke these days.
---
She needs to be properly rebalanced on the defensive part so the majority of the playerbase can kill her. Most queens these days end up flying away since people cant do enough damage to her, something min/max players have no issue with. 
---
Before this patch hit, i could tear 1/3rd of her HP off before she reached the V9 dropsite by using a few buffs like bobbleheads and crit food, after P6 hit i can barely scratch 1/10th off her HP off after multiple magazines. Something was changed and went by unnoticed and unannounced again.
---
The only time that I've run into that is if you are well overweight (i.e 900+).  Then you slow to a crawl.  If you're nowhere near that and you are still crawling, then yeah, it sounds like either a bug or perhaps the way a disease is interacting with your mutations (if you have any).
---
Ok. May I ask where this fountain of youth is? I checked last night and couldn't find it(mind you I have electrically charged, and so mb e guy was trying to pvp with me, and I went off on a robot, this making my search a lot harder)
---
&gt;before i could stand (crouch) right in front of enemies and the didn't see me.
---
Lol I'm not sure this is how it was supposed to work. Maybe it isn't bugged. Maybe it got nerfed?
---
You can pick up low-stress 140ish raw violet flux by nuking Harpers Ferry, being sure to hit the waterline of the stream and the larger body of water there. (South/southeastish of HF.) Lots of ferns, but also, a number of pods on those red vines.
---
You can pick up low-stress 140ish raw violet flux by nuking around the General - its garden is a start, but there's also just a ton of ferns in the area.
---
If you need glowing/hardened masses, HF seems like the better of the two.
---
Just get blocker and barbarian and go ham dawg
---
Where is it?
---
Oh ok thanks
---
Invest in Ammosmith early. You're going to need it.
---
You do realize they are coming out with vending machines right?  The whole reason I want this is so players are encouraged to become part of the games immersion.  Think diamond city but with players vending machines and custom setups for booths.
---
You have to actively do that anyway. One does not simply stand still and not crouch. Even without Chameleon, you crouch to make yourself harder to detect for player eyes. If you are going to sacrifice 32% dmg reduction for not having to remember crouch to go invisible, you are f#cking dumb and you are already in disadvantage.  
---
But dogmeat won't exist for like another 200 years.
---
Don’t lie, Dogmeat is immortal and eternal 😤
---
They just referred me to the menu. It did help though!

In the friend page there's a search bar. Type the name of the guy and get in his profile to send a message,without befriending.

If you already have the roof in place, remove that, place the wall and put the roof back last.

Go to my profile. Underneath the hand drawn function is a spreadsheet I made on Google. 
---
How did you get so close to it?
---
I suspect that endgame engagements are really poorly balanced against stealth characters. SBQ fights taken place in a wide open field with little cover and force the user to wear power armor (unless you're brave enough to wear your hazmat suit). Regular SB fights are challenging too because, well, they fly and use echolocation. I imagine it would be very hard to hide from that and success would mostly be a factor of not being heard (armor weight). One poster here said with armor weight of 0 he can stealth around scorch beasts.
---
How about something like Drinking Buddy so we can get more Ice Cold Nuka/Beer refreshments? 
---
He made my life in Fallout 4 so much fun with the jokes. 
---
Not for me I can see my weapon dmg scale with my hp. Ive read all the posts and havent come across this bug either. Not saying it isn't happening to you, maybe try adding and removing some perks? 
---
Might be worth a go. Thanks man. I'll try after work 
---
Ah yeah that's a good workaround I didn't consider. Thanks for the suggestion.
---
That's a lot of work, fair play.
---
I used to lock water when I was “younger” but now I keep it out there for anyone who needs. I have plenty. 
---
Exploiting,banned
---
Lucky hole mine has a bunch of raw crystal , and a lot of lead , wear your excavator armor and you'll have plenty of cryo cells 
---
Assassin and Weightless are both Prefixes, means whatever picks you take on Weightless into Minor and Major perk slot can be also taken on Assassin.
---
Thank you! Really. Ill be updating it and adding onto it as well as creating more as it becomes apparent. I hope to cover most of the statistics I can. And create my own elsewhere. 
---
Sounds like a nomad's camp. My alt has one of these. I move it around the map as I explore.
---
Did you finish rose quests? She gives you a set and most people forget about it
---
Mine kept getting fucked up by Super Mutants or Scorched. Hence, locked. However, I do include some crafting areas and a sleeping bag outside the house for passerbys to use
---
Yes but iscrapped that as soon as i got it
---
you can't prove those are human...... that human skull could be from anything.....
---
And people wonder why there are folks complaining about banning.  Sloppy coding = mistakes.  Using an old engine under the hood doesn’t help the cause.
---
The trains stations/depots are a good place to go idle for a few minutes.  Maybe if you sat down in the waiting area it could let you idle and not get attacked for a few.  I usually just step aside somewhere and I die, then respawn is pretty close.
---
Beer bottles.
---
I play an alcoholic demolition expert and I can't express how frustrating it is that I can't use empty beer I just chugged as Molotov crafting materials.
---
Happening now? What your PSN?
---
If they have a any beds or crafting tables near a window activate that to teleport inside.
---
if you make a ramp into your base you can have the end require a jump that a player can easily do but not a scorch 
---
other options
---
use a switch on a powered door once again players can do it scorch can't path around it 
---
personally I like the floor pressure switches next to a metal garage door that way I can walk up step over it door opens I walk inside the door closes 
---
I'm in the same boat, but I did learn you can make bulk items and just scrap them to complete the scrap(maybe also just get) x amount of these pieces of scrap. I.e. I needed to scrap 50 fertilizer for the weekly challenge but just crafting it with spoiled food didnt count, it had to be scrapped. So I just bulked it all and than scrapped the 50. Was a bit of a waste of plasticbut I need those atoms for the upcoming four horsemen power armors
---
More often than not, the damage starts to tick down because if players realize she isn't dying fast enough, they stop using their weapons/save ammo
---
well technically if they shoot you they did stop the other guy from killing you
---
Omg same happened to me and my gf. Put in a ticket Wednesday, still havent heard anything. 
---
Yeah I tried with 0 and still get spotted. Maybe because of my team mates or the weapon equipped?
---
Careful, People are gonna come and start calling you a liar and 100% for sure cheater. Bethesda can do no wrong remember? /s
---
Yea man I hope it works for you, its really ridiculous they haven't fixed it yet. 
---
But it's cool if I continue to lock the door of my uninspired, mediocre house, right?
---
That's usually what I do but when it cost me say 20 caps to fast travel to the stations and another 20 to come back just so I can answer the phone it's kinda annoying
---
Don't worry about it too much.  There are people here who just love to be like that.  There was someone last week down voting almost every post regardless of subject.  Anonymity and boredom.  
---
The first bed was too soft. The second bed was too hard. But the third and smallest bed was just right.
---
I had the same issue and had to remove a wall directly below the trouble spot, put in the wall, then replace the lower wall. 
---
Lamps! THAT'S what my shrine is missing!
---
Nah, we need another Johnny Guitar track if we’re going the FONV route
---
I have checked my status, no disease, 4 mutations: plague walker, scaly skin, speed demon, talon. weight: 258/195.. My last mutation is scaly skin, maybe it causes AP bug since it has -50AP feature.
---
can you still eat canned dog food?
---
As long as they dont make the grind like it is at Camden Park. 450 tokens for the Mr Fuzzy costume and mask is way to much when your only getting 9 (I think) per day
---
HYPE
---
Yes that’s fine. No one wants to see that mess. 
---
When I'm at my camp I lock the door when I'm away from camp I try and leave the door open. Gotta show of my mosaic floor tiles to somebody
---
I fast traveled to my CAMP and he was already there, flying in front of the statue and having a stare off with it.
---
250 caps every 15 mins? did the economy suddenly boom in this game since I last played or something?
---
He's there Like
---
"Thät Me"  
---
That's a great picture. You got my upvote.
---
Just slap on Enforcer and a shotgun and bam. Ez Pz. 
---
I recommend the Nuka-Cola perk tho. Stimpacks require an animation while not in power armor. Cola's do not. 
---
Blocker perk is also really really good. 
---
Hopefully there will be a ‘looking for group’ option for those of us who don’t have 100 friends playing the game. Cross server preferably to allow speedier match making.
---
Is that at the old asylum that is now fort defiance?
---
Lol that second link is a post from me
---
It’s odd, I’ve noticed the one that spawns in Spruce Knob Lakes has been missing for a few weeks. 😳
---
Yeah, but if you don't lock it I won't smash your stuff 
---
this!
---
She apparently moved to the Freak Show.  Can't say I've ever had to deal with two Mirelurk Queens before yesterday. 😂
---
Worst is after 10 minutes of everyone firing everything at her, seeing her health bar refill to the top again leaving it impossible. 
---
Me and my one other freind are a good team for most things i think a group option would be nice but leave us who are happy with what we got alone 
---
Given the game and the engine etc. I doubt that's gonna happen. At the very least they have shown to be able to do matchmaking via the in-game radio since we have Hunter/Hunted.
---
They could make a new radio station that you turn on and it will automatically party you up with a group to do the raid or something.
---
Just trying to keep it simple knowing the engine limitations.
---
This is not ark
---
😂
---
Had to deal with two Mirelurk Queens and a gang of three wendigos the other day during SBQ fight. That was an experience. 😳
---
It's a combination of them raising the satiation requirements either through a bug or purposefully. I personally think it's a bug because it wasn't mentioned. You have to eat a whole lot more than you did before to stay full. With parasites you will consume all your food and you'll still be starving. Hope they fix it.
---
Yeah, that’s what I meant. LFG should be purely optional, forcing people to team up with strangers won’t go down well, but for those of us who play 99% solo, a LFG would be handy.
---
Turd Ferguson makes me laugh every time I watch it or in this case used as a username lol damn wish I would of thought about it first. "It's a funny name"
---
True true tbh hate playing with randoms ill be in a call woth my pal so we cant talk to them or vice versa and sometimes when a random wants your attention they thing running infront of your bullets is a hell of a good idea especially at nuke zones
---
yeah but that's the thing. Raids aren't supposed to be doable unless you're in a group. It would piss off a lot of solo players, but in literally every other game a raid is purely a group activity. You are rewarded for teamwork.
---
If the raids are doable in a solo or two man group then it wont be a very good end game activity.
---
Quarry X3 and the Cranberry Glades in the Cranberry Bog tend to be fairly reliable locations for the Mirelurk Queen.
---
She will sometimes appear at the Toxic Dried Lakebed in the Toxic Valley and at the Freak Show in the Savage Divide.
---
On Xbox.  My teammates and I haven't been able to kill her or complete the event since patch 6 went live
---
This would be great.  I use the good doggy perk and lug around 15 cans of dog food so I don’t have to deal with spoilage.  Would be nice to try something different.
---
Thanks
---
Agreed. We already have photo mode, so adding a camera that would allow us to take pictures is just dumb. But, this camera could allow us to keep said photos in our camp. 
---
LOL
---
That is an incredibly generous offer. I have FO76 on PS4 and PC. I play primarily on PC. I have found the Tesla mod a couple of times. I just logged off, but I think I may know how to craft it for T-60. 
---
Thanks for the information, I will give it a try and compare. 
---
Really DMG is AFTER resistance?
---
That and a whip and you’ve got wasteland Indiana Jones
---
Thank you I have found raw there but not enough material to make it pure violet flux to craft with. Guees need to ws for a while gathering the other rss. 
---
If I had to guess, it'd say its build in griefer protection. Say someone is AFK at a vendor, or a workbench, or blocking a door with a camera pose that you can't jump over and locking you out from completing a quest or event, this would be a way to 'light a fire under their ass' so to speak. 
---
Not that this is a dick measuring contest (it totally is), but I downed the queen a few weeks ago and clocked in at 1:26
---
So I too have noticed a lot less higher level players these days. I wonder several things....1) Are they giving up? (I'm on my second playthrough myself, got bored around level 80+), 2) Is Bethesda secretly grouping players on servers by level? (I've noticed with my level 20+ character, plenty of folks at my level or a bit over), 3) Sometimes I felt the game worked terribly on my higher level player...nuke zones we're almost unplayable. So maybe people are just starting over.
---
So all that said to not provide an actual answer...there are just ponderings I've come up with.
---
I will say, I'm having a lot more fun with my lower level character these days than my first character.
---
If the game scaled difficulty based on number of players in your party, that would be the best way to do it. Let’s solo guys still enjoy the same content of what duos / trios / entire squads can play. Suits everyone’s individual play style.
---
My setup has mostly been three pieces of Vanguard, a Chameleon, and an Auto-Stim.  I just felt, for my somewhat reckless play style, Vanguard worked best for me.  Auto-Stim is good for emergencies because, as melee, sometimes you'll be in the middle of a swing and the game won't let you inject a Stimpack yourself.  And Chameleon is good for either sneaking up on enemies or trying to avoid unwanted attention, especially from Scorchbeasts.
---
What weapon/s do you like using the most? Automatic or semi rifles? SMGs? Shotguns? Heavies/energy heavies? 
---
The last Time I fought the queen maybe two weeks ago. We had 10 or 11 people fighting mostly melee and some heavy weapons during her entire duration we took only about a 1/4 of her health. There was no one below level 40 all were using power armor I don’t know what we were doing wrong. After that me and my friend just gave up fighting her it’s not even worth the trouble and use of ammo. 
---
So that set you got from Rose had a full set of Ultracite armor on it. So if you scrapped it without taking the pieces off it you've lost the whole set.
---
I did the same thing. You can now go to fort defiance and learn the recipe
---
Yeah, I also like it when the fight goes on for a bit.  When people complain that they can't down here in a couple minutes - you're not supposed to.  She's the final boss.  The possibility of failure *should* be a thing.
---
Yeah, maybe if the rewards weren't as huge as if a full group did it.
---
Honestly the bet person at Bethesda rn 
---
welcome to an online game, you think there is a pause or protection button in COD when the phone rings?
---
i was the one who directly replied to that first comment and i didnt even downvote it, my response may of came off as snippy (sorry about that) but you had an honest thought and you were not going out of your way to mislead, mistakes happen, no need for downvote spam.
---
that said there are some people who hide in the shadows who downvote litterally everything on the sub
---
I didnt know it was ultracite. I thought it was basic shitty raider armor so i scrapped it all. Shit. 
---
Nah, just make it you cant build so close to the golf club
---
This.    Sometimes for some unknown reason she stops taking damage.  
---
I can specifically remember this happening last Thursday night. Again on Saturday 
---
Grab yourself a gamma gun and take as many ghouls out of the front of the golf spring entrance, then do not take them immediately right or left but rather lead them through the little pool area and out to the side of the offending base (rarely do inconsiderate cocksuckers have turrets on the sides) then simple stand in or near the base and spam the ghouls with the gamma gun until they have destroyed the base. You will refill the health of the horde and avoid a wanted status 👍
---
This would be perfect for me since I try to make scorchbeast stew all the time since it’s a huge health pool and if you have carnivore it’s the best recipe for health.
---
It is a geological survey pin. They exist in the real world. I consider it just another example of the detail in the Fallout 76 world. They don't serve a purpose now in game but maybe for future content, maybe.
---
I would say only don't get uniques until level 50, because you won't be able to get them again, but legendaries in general are random, so it doesn't matter when you get them
---
exactly how i felt. Enjoyed the game up until now, just got bored after the story. This sounds pretty nice 
---
That’s a trash suggestion. When you’re a high level, with speed demon and marsupial, you’re incredibly hard to keep track of. Add in full camo to it, it’s almost impossible. 
---
It’s a trash mechanic to be allowed full camo, with complete movement, and still be allowed to attack. 
---
Allowing this to continue will just push every player that plays PvP to go invisible. You’ll have full speed invisible jumping beans fighting each other, where no one can get a single kill.
---
Just make it so if you attack you’re revealed.
---
Good work.
---
Trying to figure out how much I should be selling my 5.56 ammo for 🤔 
---
Thanks for quick answer! 
---
How do you remove yourself from the map? 
---
Go to my profile. If that's too hard cx 5.56 cost 0.922 caps go make. So as long as you get 1:1 or more it's profit baby! That's assuming you have rank 2 ammosmith and the supplies to make them lol
---
as a start may we at least get the armored hazmat. give non PA builds a safer thing to run around nukes with
---
I added you in Fallout: name: Augurkenkoning
---
Yes, this is how it works.  The Order of Mysteries questline is different, because you can upgrade those items at a workbench, but that's not true of the others.  If you're planning to be melee, the All Rise from Mayor for a Day in Watoga is the one you'll want to wait until Lv. 50 to do.
---
The others are kind of middling, to be honest, because Heavy Weapons are somewhat over-represented.  The Mire quests reward you with the Pyrolizer (flamethrower) and the Daisycutter (a lightweight Fat Man launcher).  One of the later main quests gives you the Bunker Buster which tips the scales at a staggering 40 lbs. (thanks for that, Bethesda).  So, if you don't think you'll care about Heavy Weapons, it's not much of a problem.
---
There are many Legendaries that outclass these anyway.  The All Rise just happens to be especially good at what it does.
---
I’ve been running into this more and more often. I managed to fill up a server with pvpers just to have it ruined by 2 guys doing the glitch.
---
Got a working setup (Y)
---
by sneaking
---
We'll be able to drop items and see them like in fallout 4? I could put pillows on my beds again?!
---
He's Enclave, im sure he can be trusted.  
---
Where did you find this?
---
Also here's a real world example: https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1757/6701/products/photo_onlinestore_magnet_benchmark_nr_1000396_502a68c7-3de9-41f1-a061-5df72f233cf4_1024x1024.jpg?
---
It was, not sure what that guy is on about. Rose gives you raider. You get the Ultracite from the BoS storyline.
---
Screw that. Some people aren't just building turret platforms and are building there for the scenery. If that interrupts your farming, then that's your problem.
---
I understand being disgruntled by griefers with camps designed solely to steal kills, but if they make the whole area a no-build-zone, I'll be very disappointed in the community.
---
Yeah, I had a battle the other day that started with going after a Scorchbeast, then there were Super Mutants, and then the *Mothman* shows up on top of it.  I love it when these things happen and wish they did more often.
---
Find a corner + crouch + pull up map screen = Hope for the best
---
I read that you can simply crouch low and it’ll remove you. Does this apply when I want to walk while crouched?
---
Non-auto handmade rifle for middle-close combat. And Gauss for long distance.
---
Add human NPC’s and I’ll come back. Or settlers in your CAMP. Till then the game still feels empty. 
---
That would also work, I'd be down if they only did that
---
I'm actually 130lvl. So yeah, i have ammosmith :-)
---
What are the chances
---
Just remove and reapply like everyone else.
---
Then don't build turrets if you build there your being a xp stealing dick 
---
Atta boy ♥️ 
---
Appreciate your work!
---
Oh I don't mind getting a wanted status to mess up a camp that's behind the golf club, I'll keep doing it until they leave. Being wanted doesn't bother me, I just think we shouldn't be able to build behind the golf club or any of the other areas that spawn a shit ton of ghouls
---
Thank you! Save the spreadsheet lol it's easy to cross reference. 
---
Nah if I see a camp behind the golf club, it's kill on sight. Don't like it? Don't build there.
---
I have found two, I will update Imgur with pictures  on the other mark and location. Can’t remember both location.
---
I love the idea and I'm not knocking it. Inevitably, someone asks for this very thing every month. Let's hope it makes it into the New Features for [Wild Appalachia in the Spring](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019).
---
Just need to make the area round the clubhouse etc a no build zone. Leave the actual golf course open for building.
---
Calling bullshit. Stay banned
---
I have a feeling that self righteous griefers will destroy bases even if there are no turrets, and then try to justify it.
---
I got the adrenal reaction last night. It doesn't seem to do anything. Anyone know how to check that it's working? 
---
Yeah I think I’m an idiot because I cannot figure it out lol.
---
What’s the most valuable bullet beyond ultracite?
---
They could just fix their game like everyone else in the AAA game industry.
---
I think she/he was being satirical.
---
It depends on servers. Before you go into the silo, make sure you have smooth interaction with bot vendors. No obvious lag. No enemies regain HP instantly. No event near Fissure Prime.
---
crouching = sneaking, when u move while 'crouching' u are sneaking and u are not on the map while sneaking
---
In other words, you're no better than any other griefer.
---
Hey man, at least you have the mojo to admit it. I can respect that, if nothing else.
---
Thank you pie ♥️
---
Interesting! I kind of want to scour the game looking for these now. Was it just a marker on the terrain or was it an item you could take?
---
sorry to go on about it but just for the record what I did was get rid of all my mutations completely then took the adrenal and used only that for a while until I was sure it was working. This way if you need to try again you dont have to chance wiping anything else. 
---
I only grief if there's a camp behind the golf club, so nah I'm not "as bad" but go off I guess lol
---
Well that just makes it sound like I can't trust him.
---
We need double side walls because when I'm building i HATE having one side brick and the other not.
---
Down for this ^ this works
---
I've experienced similar things on PC. Keep in mind that the SBQ does have a sliding difficulty scale. I'm not 100% sure if it's based on the number of unique people in the area or if it's the number of unique people that do damage to it, but the more people the harder the SBQ gets. 
---
I've personally had fights where I was the only one attacked the SBQ and I'd get it down to half health, it would regen, and I'd get it down to 1/4 health then everyone jumps in to attack and my damage is significantly reduced. I'd go from being able to see each shot making damage on her health to needing 100 rounds or so to see the same amount of health drop at that instance. 
---
If it's based off the number of people who get hits in, it would be great if people would wait until it's down to that 1/4th level before getting their one hit in if they aren't built to fight the SBQ so that those of us that are have a slightly easier time get her almost complete. It really sucks having to go through 2000+ rounds and two Gatling Guns because people show up, plink it and then go and hide.  
---
Lol I haven't gotten that far yet. But if you send me the recipes i don't have I'll be glad to run the numbers. Follow this link

A griefer with standards is still a griefer, my dudebro

There's a lot that should have been from day 1. Maybe they should've had a beta period or something. lol

I hate People farming, is this farmvile? No. 
---
So I put my turrets there to sabotage your farming, is it ilegal? No. 
---
You accidentally triggered an exploit in their game and are now scared of being banned.
---
It's sad when you can't play a game you bought without fear of losing access to it.
---
I doubt they'll hit you though, one time accident is different from duping til the servers crash.
---
Yeah, like the guy below me said, its a geological survey benchmark. They're used for cartography purposes, so when we map out areas on a large scale, we have benchmarks that are stationary.

BOS heavy combat is stat wise I believe

Damn that’s nice. I was reading the actual handwritten one lol.
---
Ok thats good to know. Im really stuck on whether I like this game or not. I loved ot at launch (with exception to all the bugs) but now its extrenely dry. The road map has boosted my hopes but its sad to see such a great franchise become so dull and empty.
---
All we need now is a mod that will act as an in game API for this website
---
Add human NPC’s and I’ll come back. Or settlers at the CAMP. It still feels so empty and lifeless. 
---
Should have a risk of turning you into a ghoul like Billy Peabody too.
---
I noticed this in Fallout 4 too. I needed 1 glass to finish my skyscraper or whatever it was, so I drank a Nuka-Cola and apparently ate the bottle. I had to go find a bottle miles away, come back and finish my greenhouse of doom.
---
Saw him at my camp, blasted the hell out of him with bullets - then tried a gamma grenade and the bastard disappeared in a cloud of his sinful smoke and the grenade blasted me instead

I use the PSN messenger to reach out to people, that way I don’t risk being attacked in game.  Just click send new message and put the players name in the select person area.

How does it not work?

Good post topic!!  My first SBQ I was around lvl 50 and my job in the battle was to pick off critters (like scorched) trying to damage the higher level players that could actually put a dent in the flying beast.  Unless you have some badass weapons that can actually do something the best way to make yourself useful is to help the greater good.

Also, don’t be the toolbox that seeks to take loot without helping or try to grief others (intentionally or not).  It’s totally annoying and ruins the experience. 
---
And before anyone tells me I’m wrong I’ve been there and done that so save it.  It’s a team effort so everyone needs to do their part because everyone benefits from the kill. 
---
Now that I’m lvl 120 I can actually help the higher level players damage the queen but make sure you do your job!!  No freeloaders or griefers allowed.

Human nature, people are apathetic and detached from sympathizing with anything or anyone not right in front of their face or tugging their heart strings.  We used to be naturally empathic animals, now we're more monsters than anything destroying each other's lives for our own selfish reasons.
---
I look forward to having a talk with God when I die.  Someone needs to yell at that fool for creating this mess and trying to shove the responsibility of bettering it onto others.
---
It doesn’t?
---
i thought it was censoring "shit" lol
---
As in when do new items come
---
Yeah, I mean I know I was wrong and I corrected it. Too late, bc the downvote army was already there. I mean look at my other response „I can smell the downvotes already“... ok it’s kinda funny that this got downvoted. But yeah it’s true, in this threads are many people who just want to downvote, no matter what. 
---
Which Enclave vendor has this Field Scribe Outfit?
---
7pm EST seems to be when the sales change/end/lose a day
---
Or you kill 'em with a plasma thrower and his goo pile has no loot.
---
Like wtf...
---
So you could have just typed something?
---
Gotcha... 
---
I need to try it again. Tried for the first time last night and an assaultron killed me. I couldn’t find the terminals to turn the turrets on the robots but I was rather lost a few times. Maybe after a few more tries I’ll get the hang of it. What’s your weapon of choice?
---
Melee with mutations! Get her an electrified mr handy buzz blade! 
---
Nice idea!!
---
Ok thanks
---
Think it’s random they just add them. Could be wrong
---
That's super helpful!
---
I need more storage for all the extra food, water and Fusion Cores I consume since patch 5. The faster we use them, the more we need, and the more storage gets used.
---
Works with everything, if we needed less items to do the same job, we would be using less storage space. The balance IMO is not great right now, but not sure if this is the intended balance for consumption?
---
LOL this is amazing! I keep throwing money at the screen but nothing is happening! HALP!
---
Sure do. My favourite part is the “I fucked up” column haha
---
579 fusion cells, straight trade. 
---
Just go in the club and close the double door that are downstairs. I’v found that quite a few players won’t go reopen them or they leave the server.

---
Try the fallout bazaar or the fo76market place
---
Jesus. How many times is that going to come up cx
---
I agree wholeheartedly. This is the best workaround for me as a high lvl player. The mechanic that makes me lose 300+ caps when i get killed in pvp makes it something i would prefer to avoid. I see no real reason why i and other high lvls should be punished for playing the fucking game to get a high lvl!!
---
Cool thanks for the heads up man. 
---
/fo76bazaar
---
OR, they could make more interesting farming zones in Appalachia with more valuable loot drops, so it isn't even worth building there. 
---
Win/win. 
---
R/market76
---
That just means someone in the same server already has a camp
---
At that location
---
I kinda like it when it happens, free camp move 😎
---
Yes! Then it means I can get rid of them from my character build. 
---
I know.
---
It used to just say your camp couldn't be placed and you'd need to log off and join new server.
---
Now it gives the option to stay or leave. Kind of cutting out a few steps
---
I suspect they will be like the nuke silos. 
---
Lots of mobs - a few little tasks to accomplish- then one high level, bullet sponge boss. Who probably mutates after a certain amount of damage is receieved. 
---

---
Honestly if you were on Xbox I might consider paying for a good group of 8 to do SBQ. I am not proud to say I have actually failed that fight twice because even with a Nuke there just wasn't enough high level players around willing to come help complete the fight.
---
Yes, and if they don't insert matchmaking to raids, then how about clans and(or) text chat(server or clan).
---
You can jump through windows if they're large enough. 
---
Locked doors stop nothing!
---
Great camp ideas. Mostly thinking about utility when building a camp so this is great advice! 
---
&gt; May as well have named them scorched beast rape sticks.  
---
Thanks, that's *another* mental image I didn't need. 
---
Its sad, honestly. After this post I don’t really feel like commenting on something anymore... 
---
Will try 👍
---
Awesome, couldn't find the exact sub name lol. Thanks
---
Yep ;-)
---
No dude, no.  I tested this in the cranberry bog with 3 scorchbeast over the ranger lookout tower.  I was far south of that tower, trying to get to it and I see these 3 scorched beasts out there and decided to wait perfectly still hoping maybe one or two will fly off.
---
No joke, 5 minutes of standing still watching them fly around, far away, one lvl 80, a lvl 50, never glimpsed the third one's level.
---
Then what happens but I'm suddenly [DANGER]er by the lvl 80 who was the second farthest away and not even looking for me.  I'm invisible, didn't switch my weapons, didn't move, my stealth mechanic seemingly just switched off for an instant and thats all it took to see a nurse in green with a big ass suppressed gauss rifle running for dear life from 3 screeching monsters into a city of killer robots.
---
Stealth is bugged, when its working all of its mechanics seem to function right down to weight and movement affecting chance of being seen, however switching guns and apparently waiting and doing nothing long enough will get you spotted instantly.  That isn't right.
---
When I equip my gauss rifle while sneaking under the top of the world tower and a mole miner inside the ski resort sees me from over 100 meters away when I do, that's not right.
---
When I'm standing perfectly still chameleoned without switching weapons and a scorchbeast 500 meters away spots me, that's not right.  Echolocation or not that's not a viable excuse for broken stealth mechanics.
---
They are broken, just not constantly, just cause you read [CAUTION] permanently just means the [HIDDEN] graphic is being overwritten by the caution graphic, you're not legitimately cautioned until those brackets are halfway inward looking like they'll switch to danger, they'll enter a real caution then danger and usually properly displays as [HIDDEN] again afterwards with fast traveling and combat sometimes making the perma[CAUTION] reappear.
---
It was a marker stuck on top of a mountain. I couldn’t pick it up.  I will try to find the location again. If I do I will update here. (Sorry for bad english, I’m from Sweden)
---
If that's the case then the raids will keep people entertained for about 2 days.
---
They need to make them a different, worthwhile endgame experience.
---
There was a post about it, but it was probably just a bug. Presumably fixed now.
---
You need to be below about 30% for it to really effective. I have a bloodied/Unyeilding build. When I'm below 20% health the damage on my bloodied level action is over 500. 
---
You are absolutely wrong and it’s a bad take. First off, these aren’t “camps” they are usually a platform with 8-10 turrets only.  Their only purpose is to steal XPs from others trying to legitimately level up.  That’s lame.  Not much different than low level dupers.   To that extent I say build at your own risk.  If I see you set up shop behind the GC I will not only will I lead all the critters to wreck your “camp” but I’ll finish the job if they don’t.  That ain’t griefing that’s basic justice. 
---
Berserker weapons with the right mutations and cards liek barbarian and maybe evasive will do wonders really.

---
**ADDITIONALS**: Get the Bird Bones, Marsupial, Scaly Skin and Carnivore mutations. Under Endurance, swap out Fireproof for level 2 Dromedary or Lead Belly for regular questing. Fireproof is there to help protect against scorchbeast sonic blasts and mole miners.
---
**ARMOR**:  Equip your armor with Deep Pocketed if you can. If not, go for Ultra-Light as regular pocketed isn't as beneficial when you look at additional carry weight vs increased weight of armor. For tankiness, go Brotherhood fo Steel heavy combat armor with a Dense mod on the chest and Deep Pocketed on the limbs. For all aspect I -*personally*\- prefer Trapper for the additional radiation resistance.
---
**WEIGHT MANAGEMENT:** Don't pick up every chem you run across. With the carnivore serum you won't need to worry about carrying food on you as just about any critter provides a (now) disease free meal, so toting around canned dog food and other pre-cooked meals isn't needed. But do keep some grilled radstag if you can.
---
**WEAPONS**: Prioritize Armor Piercing mods.
---
**Legendaries**: Assuming you're not a PvP buff, prioritize Vanguard in your armor, and get two pieces of Acrobat (falling damage reduced by 50%). For weapons, Anti-armor since you're running semi-auto weapons, though if you can find an Instigating Gauss that would be good getting the party started.
---
Oh i totally agree. I just have little faith in raids in general. 
---
A lot of online games promise truly rewarding replayable end game content, and it usually comes up short (F76 also did this).  
---
Fingers crossed this is different!
---
My base has everything you need open to the public on the ground floor. All benches. Music. Beds. Even a bedroom. The upper living area is mine. Stay out. Haha. I even keep my water purifiers open to the public. 
---
Can definitely confirm switch from melee (deathclaw gauntlet) to ranged (sniper rifle) breaks stealth, even with chameleon gear, muffled, shadowed, escape artist, max stealth I am immediately spotted even from beyond rifle vats range. Also rifle becomes visible even when I am not.
---
Yes, they changed the scaling in the recent patch. If you're not running significantly lower health at all times, there's really no reason to take the mutation in my opinion. On the other hand, with Class Freak, you only lose like 13HP, so it might be okay for emergency situations you described.
---
I've explicitly stated that I'm not talking about turret farms, but keep defending your griefing, buddy. There's nothing I can do to stop you other than whine over the internet lmao.
---
Huh?
---
I usually just marsupial jump on top of something, and crouch in or around something with cover.
---
The paint does it remove the bos mod?
---
It isn't that hard to find a secluded area and just crouch. I've gone AFK for 15-20 minutes between dumpsters, in towers, in corners, all sorts of places, come back with nothing happening.
---
That would be funny lol... but I think reddit isn’t capable of doing this, sadly. 
---
How was it when you nuked it? We're you there for to pick the flora? Or were you primarily hunting legendary mobs?
---
So I saw the SB at the end and ran past it, saw an elevator which I quickly took. It brought me OUTSIDE and I had to go back to the entrance and run it again! More spawning but not as bad. Anyway finished only because a 100 level player happened to be there and nailed the SB. But tough mission, especially if you get killed you have to start from beginning. Thanks!
---
Well I am at 28 so I guess I have a way to go. 
---
Gotcha? What should that mean? Oh, now i get it! Could barely understand it. You should have typed „got you“ instead! ;) 
---
Ive had a few instances recently where I died and other players left my loot bag alone... when I returned I was extrememly grateful/relieved because I had bulked items for sale, as well as was carrying around flux I had just crafted and didnt have room to stash.
---
I am a melee built so it’s harder to down then for attacks. Need to sharpen my sniper skills. 
---
lmfao. 
---
I have realized that. 
---
Nope, stays BoS, it's just camo coloured.
---
&gt;their ability to use logical reasoning is basically nonexistent.
---
You mean like the people who get banned and then convince themselves that they never did anything to warrant the ban?
---
Probably because now the whole game is a grind and there are almost no rewards for it?
---
Totally hilarious 
---
I mean if you don’t like killing things that you killed the day before in the same location in fo4, your not going to like this.... this whole game is basically exploring and farming.... You might get lucky and not have enemies if the location was just run through but it’s my understanding that enemies typically respawn as soon as someone new join the server.
---
Personally I enjoy the game as both a solo player and team player.... might be worth giving it a shot at the price point though.
---
Cool 
---
Tip #1 set your mic/Headset to area, so when you invite folks to team, you can explain you’re not a griefer.
---
When survival mode gets rolled into production, I don’t think this will be as important.
---
Dried toxic lakebed and Macs farm have one 
---
Damn! Exact same spot, started building my camp there yesterday. Saw mothman 2x and flatwoods monster once
---
Here! https://imgur.com/gallery/GOOWBpj
---
Are... we supposed to kill the moth man? I don’t mind being watched. Feels like I have a friend!
---
My goal was to tackle the campaign first, which provides power armor, recipes, legendaries, etc as rewards. Once I was done with that I could “relax” and just explore, do events, etc. but I should probably pace better to ramp up. 
---
I could see this working!  The thought of her sawing limbs off of enemies and then chowing down is disturbing yet hilarious.
---
A level 45/50 anti armor .44 or western revolver absolutely tears through big stuff like scoechbeasts. My melee character users one and wrecks stuff, even with no pistol perks. Somerset special, one of the first quest rewards you get, is an AA .44. It'd be a great gun, if only most people didn't get it at level 5.
---
A novel idea
---
That type of post is one major reason why misinformation is spreading so quickly. That's probably why people jumped on you. A lot are tired of seeing posts from people blaming things that don't exist any longer or spreading false or old information. "I got one-shotted in pacifist mode," "bobblehead stacker killed me without mutually engaging in PvP," blah blah. They're all posts from people who simply were the victim of someone better than themselves whining on Reddit.
---
Frankly, if you said something wrong and got downvoted, I'm not sure why you didn't simply learn the new, correct information and leave it at that. Isn't that exactly what downvoting is for? Did you expect to come in here and have everyone sympathize with you?
---
I'm not trying to sound like a dick, but you were wrong and part of the large group of people spreading false info - even if not on purpose. I'm not sure the reason for this post.
---
Currently, this only applies to the Mistress of Mysteries quest items: voice of set, blade of bastet, and garb of mystery.

I have actually had creatures spawn INSIDE the doorless, windowless 2x1 I store my generator in. So now the empty space is filled with concrete barricades.

Xbox one here. She’s a bit tempermental at best

There was a weekly challenge not so long ago to take pictures of yourself at 3 of these. Was quite fun.

Only in fallout will these things happen.

Why does it have "CHEAT" stamped on it?
---
You’re right I think 
---
Triggered might be a strong word. I don't think anyone really gives a fuck.  It's just amusingly worded, and I personally had fun bantering about it.  Maybe it's a common turn of phrase wherever you folks come from.  No one tells people they're glad bad shit happened to them,  where I come from. 
---
Shoot, I would even take the ability to can some food.
---
Let me make some Glowing Fungus Soup Cans! 
---
excellent explanation! and a perfect reason for me to never bother with this quest. 
---
Yep. I think I just got it. Think I’ll hold off!
---
Yes 
---
Having all of them plus the Class Freak perk means a TON of gain with very little drawback. Does require 5 luck though, cause you'll want maxed out Class Freak and Starched Genes at all times 
---
Look how long it took them to fix the dupe bugs and it was a really sloppy job the first few attempts.  Then several months later, still continue to work on the dupe aftermath.  If they nip the issue early would have avoided this fiasco months later.  
---
Just release the immortality exploit, let people get banned, and they will fix it.  Thats their MO.
---
Nope. Not the case with this. Wasn’t in the way of anything. He was running around with 2 of his friends and decided to hit me for no reason. I turned around and he ran back then came up and hit me again. 
---
It might be a roof or wall around it. Try to remove some surrounding pieces. In some cases if it snaps but when trying to apply it will say something about intersecting or floating. If you hold rotate and mas apply it will just take in some scenarios. Remember one time I could not get the last wall to place. So I build a 1x1 room on the gam and fitted the wall there as a door. Removed room changed door to wall.
---
I think when she’s on the ground I’d have a chance, but how do you get her to land? Or do you just wait?
---
Sorry I read that I *was* glitch my bad. 
---
Love it.
---
Thanks for replies, that’s what it is then, I mostly use lever actions and have 5 or 6 I use along with a few other weapons... they all but one get removed every time I start a new game... add it to the list Bethesda...
---
Restart the client. 
---
The social is often bugged. That’s the only way to fix it. 
---
If you cure it an reapply it will start working again. It's been buffed by the way. You need to be at lower HP then before to proc it, but when it does my damage goes through the roof... Like over 500 on my lever action, over 200 on my .50 Cal . 
---
What is your problem? I did mention that I was wrong with the bobblehead statement. What else should I do? But it is true that I still got seriously damage while being in pacifist mode. Where on earth has this something to do with whining? „... victim of someone who was better then themselve“ dude, I don’t WANT to neither be better nor worse then someone else, because I don’t want to pvp mostly. When I want that, I take the responsibility. And it is possible to do so, had some fun with pvp, lost around 150 caps in total, everything was fine and both did the thumbs up afterwards. I don’t get your point... 
---
And this worked for you? Because it won’t work for me
---
Thanks for the kind words you truly are u/aGraciousGod
---
If I hadn't seen screenshots, I'd think the Flatwoods monster was bullshit. I've spent a ton of time wandering the forest gathering building materials etc and never once spotted it. 
---
I was just speculating on the 'why should I continue to get hurt' part. As far as them continuing to harass you, that's just jackasses being jackasses.
---
Yeah I need a healing perk! Just got a, raider leg I think, which is supposed to slowly regenerate health, but it seems so slow I don’t think it does much. I miss the F4 perk of regeneration healing while walking in sunlight. 
---
It definitely did, or else I've been hallucinating for the last 200 hours
---
Upvote for the clickbait parody.
---
I have been stealth crit sniper for months. I wear all ultralight, 2 of which increase stealth ability. While I don't have trouble as *extreme* as some posts I've come across, patch 5 definitely did cause some stealth difficulties. Spotting me from a higher or lower position, for example, burrowing enemies automatically detecting, etc. I'm sure there are others I'm simply leaving out. There are definitely some things they need to address.
---
“Oh someone went to my grind spot. Bethesda block them from being allowed because only high levels who want to grind are allowed there” God damn I love this community but you people who do nothing but sit at white springs are fucking cancer. All you do is bitch about turrets “stealing your kills” like this isn’t a $60-$100+ game that everyone also had to pay for. You don’t own a spot. Go somewhere else. It’s a huge fucking map. I’m so tired of seeing post in this subreddit about people bitching “their” grind spot is now “ruined” because someone placed a camp. Switch serves if it’s such a big deal to you. It takes 2 minutes at the most. In case you don’t know how, you quit the game you’re in, and then you simply enter a new one. 
---
Go to the data selection on pip boy and select the ones ones want active
---
Same thing happened to me before. I think when I logged back in the next time, it was back.
---
 The Sloths are mainly in the Mire. I see em' all the time, but they are not my enemies, I leave em' alone.
---
Wow you are such an ass lmao
---
If it's not possible with money, than do it with a lot of it - Bulgarian saying
---
Oh sry... thought you meant screen not pipboy..
---
Yeah sorry I made a post earlier and it got removed because i only had “pvp” in the title so I had to rewrite what I put but this time I didn’t explain what happened to me. I get what you’re saying though after re reading it 
---
I hate that there is no check pointing. One slip up at the end of a long mission and you’re dumped outside to restart from the beginning. Sucks so much of the game’s fun. 
---
Its not in the data menu, thats the problem
---
So in other words, you’re a dick who’s acting like a victim? Interesting. Let me guess you’ll give me the “bUt MuH gRinD sPoT” argument. 
---
I had two within literally three minutes yesterday, just a shame i seem to crash every 5 so i cant really play

Not sure about that one....

Listen up, Devs.

This is the kind of ish you need to continue developing around.  
---
Nobody is playing fallout with the idea of PvP. We want co-op. We want RP. We want to find a stranger in the world that has a funny accent and makes irrational decisions on the reg provided there's an audience, because it'll get them a laugh or 3.  
---
Let this guy hi-jack a radio tower, use the frequency for his will, but have NPC's contest it from him. He can then broadcast whatever he wants, as long as the players are tuned in.  
---
I want THREEDOGG-like characters to have the option. I would contest that site to own the tower and become a personality in the game, taking pay for promotion of people's shops!  
---
We want RP "voice actors" and anons having fun without infringing on other players.  
---
u/TheRealTurdFergusonn you're leading the way to a more enjoyable future.  
---
The enemies I want to fight are a lot rarer then say the mole rats I do not. Wish they would take mole rats off the list for workshop defense events 
---
Those things are relentless and way too fast. Rather fight waves that just one of those things. 
---
I sincerely hope that raids are not gated behind group requirement. Mmorpg like rading always ends up with the same problems.
---
A lot of players simply skip the content, after some time vets expect all other players to know the place by hearth, even with groups the place gets boring after doing it a dozen times and it will eventually die out because of lack of intereset and the hopelessness of finding enough players.
---
Is fo76 more a mmorpg or an online RPG? My gut feelings tends toward the latter.
---
I know it is a matter of taste but imo one strong point of fo76 is the freedom of solo play with public events.
---
I get what you want to achieve but I would hate to see the game gets transformed into a mmorpg lite.
---
Do you get off on being a bitch and attacking people for stuff they wish were in the game or what? Damn hop off my dick dude lmfao. You're so butt hurt
---
I already tryed that, didnt do anything. Thanks anyways
---
Other then turrets eating up way to much budget for there usefulness I havent see much. I know lights take up a good bit as well.
---
Unless a way can be made to balance all the factions, this will never be a thing.  You cannot have faction warfare if 75% of the people join Raiders/BOS and the other factions split the remaining 25% of the players. 
---
You are treating the symptoms not the cause. Building in Whitesprings is fine. Being able to respawn 100 ghouls in a single building just by connecting back and forth is not.
---
You aren’t being punished for playing the game. You’re being punished for being entitled and thinking you own an entire area and the mobs that spawn there. You’re being punished for destroying players camps which they spent time finding recorces to build because they’re stealing “your” xp and kills. You don’t own the spot and you’re being punished for thinking you do. You deserve the wanted level and you deserve to lose the caps. Simple as that. Just because you’re a high level doesn’t mean you get to dictate who goes where and who builds what. You have absolutly no right. Everybody paid for the game, everyone can play the game how it’s meant to be played. Not the way you high levels dictate that they play.

According to this very accurate looking list, you are correct. It's only the 5th or 8th thing I've been proven wrong about here this week.
---
Link to how you did this? I can float a stairwell but haven't seen this, really digging it!
---
👋🏽 
---
Sorry, I subscribe to the vampire rules: you have to be invited in. I've also had enough bad experiences with people intentionally damaging my camp for no good reason. Wish it weren't that way. 
---
Or are you trying to implement guilds or clans in FO76?
---
Or higher levels could just stop acting entitled by thinking they own an entire area of the map and the mobs who spawn there. I feel like that’s a much simpler solution. There’s a whole map, go somewhere else.
---
What about the T.O.W.N.S. idea that some guy made a while back? We could make our own cities!
---
Indeed BoS Heavy Combat is the bomb. I was lucky enough to get it all together before both the BoS mod and Dense mod disappeared.
---
 So Its Dense on the chest and Strengthened on the Limbs and explosions do no damage at all. my stats are about 285b 320e 3r. Lack of Rad Resistance is its only weakness. 
---
That is awesome. Might visit later
---
I've taken her down plenty in the past, and I have to say my biggest annoyance about the whole thing is the fact that using VATS in power armor rapidly drains fusion cores. I can do far more damage to her on my VATS builds by using those VATS criticals, but I don't use it much because I want to have my power armor on for this fight, and VATS drains cores like nobody's business.
---
In the same boat. Scraped about 30 now without getting anything and still no supressor. There was one scrap where it said I learned something, but it was blank. I hope it’s not glitched on this character.
---
I’ve started running past or taking alternative routes. I used to fight every enemy, but sometimes it’s not worth armor damage, stimpacks and ammo on waves outside if you’re just trying to enter a building to forward a quest. 
---
Nooooo
---
This is awesome hahaha good stuff 
---
Hate those things. 
---
I'm west of Watoga just under the mine and by the monorail elevator! It's a BEAUTIFUL spot and I build a sick house and NOBODY'S seen it! 😭
---
One of the few reasons I will destroy a base. There is no reason to build right out side the golf club other then to use turrets to kill the ghouls and I dont see why people do it. Just go in a fight them. You get the loot and exp that way . 
---
Nice I have the blue one, my goal is to get all of them.
---
Yea it’s just weird to see this for me because where I’m from it’s like everyday talking type of thing. Naturally it’s not like it’s applicable in extreme circumstances but for the day to day “bad stuff” it’s super normal. No one wants to have to deal with the “bad thing” being them or affecting them personally when if other people experienced it then well relief comes because you just saved money or you’re not as messed up as you thought or you don’t have to actually fix what’s wrong type of thing.
---
If they give us the robot workbench theyd better balance it better, sentry bots in fo4 with 2 miniguns and (with one of 2 heads) having a 20% chance per hit to instakill were kinda busted
---
If you run friendly fire you can heal team mates by hitting them
---
I leave my house open. One large purifier so you can grab a drink. There's corn for soup and a stream nearby. You can use everything you like. Except my bedroom. My kid don't go in my bedroom. That's shit stays locked  
---
Since
---
There is a better way to regain health. It's a mutation called "Healing Factor"
---
Why can't you remove 2 from P? Night Eyes, I believe, is two wasted points
---
You are right thank you
---
I unlocked all gunsmith perks after..now I have all of them..I think u might need at least 4 out of 5
---
I've seen lower levels build bases there, as whitesprings is the unofficial community hub, and it is good for lower levels to farm xp. It also adds a free fast travel spot in the centre of the map. 
---
It isn't just an issue with higher level players. 
---
I think I have 5 more quests before the end of the main campaign and I am level 28. It’s been challenging but not impossible, now it’s getting really tough solo however. 
---
Here you go bud https://youtu.be/c3izZXhohX0 just a random video I came across. 
---
The building that’s beside the vertibird in Watoga (I thought it said amc)
---
They had one of these at PAX West, it was soo awesome!
---
There is a gazebo between whitesprings and the tennis courts - slightly to the right as you head across. The fountain is on the outside edge on the gazebo, not in the centre
---
So that is what the damned tokens are for.
---
Yeah, it's new, but it's also kind of glitchy. I've spent upwards of 10 minutes repeatedly logging into and out of the same worlds before getting a usable one.
---
Sometimes it will see that there is a camp in World A, so it logs you out and into World B. Oh no, there is a camp in World B, better log out and try putting you into World A.
---
AFAIK there's no mechanic to put you into a genuinely new server; only a different one from the world you are currently in. So you can end up cycling for a bit if you build in a popular place.
---
The reason I quit WoW was the reasons you described above.  I refuse to have a game become a second job.  FO76 is a Multiplayer online RPG (due to player per server limits).  If the raids become group manadtory (more than 4 people), that will kill any interest I have in doing them.
---
I'm pretty sure it's the highest damage 1H melee in the game fully modded, is it not? 
---
Nom nom nom
---
Is it a perk card? I have not heard of it. Does it come at certain level? 
---
 So if I buy the Statue will he show up? I hate him and hunt his ass and will kill him any time I get a chance, so having him show up would be good. ;)
---
Op literally admitted to doing that in this thread. Any time he sees a camp he says he destroys it. These people are just entitled assholes
---
I would take full advantage of that. I was a radio DJ in high school, a used car salesman in my early 20s and I'm a voice actor in Fallout 4 mods. I'm literally the EXACT person you're describing. 
---
I've actually never had the caution bug. I'm not disputing that others have, it just hasn't been my experience. I've only got 120 hours or so. I've also seen a number of people bringing up gauss rifles and switching weapons and it makes me wonder if there's a problem with individual weapon types, not the underlying sneak and detection mechanic.
---
Im curious about the "waiting and doing nothing" comment. Maybe by doing nothing and standing still we slowly build detection. I know monsters detect your approximate location when you dip out of hidden from weapon fire, but you can move to confuse them. Except scorched at fissures, which makes sense to me because they're hive mind and close to a SB. 
---
I would honestly be ok with some mobs being sneak proof. Lots of MMOs have enemies you can't sneak past. It seems like some people are having a hard time sneaking for various reasons, but I'm not one of them.
---
Man, I should have known when that happened how I was gonna feel about the rest of the movie, but I powered through it anyway....
---
Not that I know of but I’m new to melee
---
Niice
---
VATS shots with an explosive shotgun on her wings forces her to land. COnsistency varies, to be honest, but it's reasonably reliable. Apparently there are other ways to force her to land, but I haven't looked them up. Am sure YouTube could help here.
---
Ok,im online every day from 23:00,jave you discord or something? I cant speak to mic.
---
Killed it four times last week. Twice in the hills east of that Civil War fort. Still haven't seen the Mothman though. 
---
 Runs really well on my ancient i5 750. I do have GTX 1070 though.
---
Other then that I dont know of anyway to make it better other then running all the perks related to one handed melee. 
---
Awesome! Thanks.
---
I need this. I keep accidentally scrapping my teddy bears 😞
---
Wait seriously? That's the dumbest thing, I didn't even know about that :(
---
Good to know, thanks, been a while.
---
I may have, but here's what happened to me:
---
Yesterday, after acquiring AR mutation, I became God-like in that I could take an insane amount of damage.  I knew it was a bug somehow, but didnt want it to end, so I stayed on the same server and took on anything and everything.  Well, all of a sudden, it stopped. :(
---
Fun haha.
---
Is there something wrong with adrenal reaction? I haven't seen any posts about it.
---
To each their own,  I guess. The concept of being consoled by people which have gone through similar circumstances,  is common enough.  I just wouldn't tell them I'm personally happy that it happened to them.  
---
Anyways the mild amusement of this topic is starting to wear off and I think I'd prefer to drop it before anyone else tells me to ' go do heroin'.  Haha . 
---
Aounds loke,you have a shit PC combined with a shit playstyle. 
---
You guys are always a great help to me glad I can return the favor. 
---
So is a cooler 
---
What about the Marine armor? 
---

---
Here's my suggestion. I removed White Knight. I only use that when repairing. Coupled with Fix It Good, you won't have armor problems ever.
---
Added fireproof for scorchbeasts, vehicle explosions, and missile launching enemies. Mostly SBs though.
---
I removed your Night Eyes. I know you said you can't remove 2P, but I think you should consider it. That leaves enough for max lockpick swap.
---
Nerd rage for the adrenaline build. I know you're only considering it, but if you like it, then you'll *need* this perk.
---
Added adrenaline with remaining points. That damage boost is massive and lasts a good amount of time before dropping off for easy stacking.
---
I believe that Heavy combat armor with the BOS mod has better stats over all. However the BOS mod plans are hard to get. 
---
I'm pretty sure it is, I was using it for a really long time with my AA build. Combat Knife for sneaking, Shishkebab for when shit hit the fan. I only recently switched to a Machete for aesthetics (to me the machete and combat knife are kind of like a pair), the Shishkebab damage was maybe 4 higher than the Machete. Find yourself an AA w/ 40% faster swing speed and use the Incisor perk (along with the Gladiator cards) and it's not too bad.
---
Haha that’s cool man. It’s not so much like that but more so like phew man both of our issues are out of our control and didn’t cost as much type of thing. For the extreme things misery loves company.
---
Crunch crunch crunch*
---
Same here!
---
\&gt; With enemies being tougher and having better loot on higher difficulties. 
---
Maybe we could keep this at a minimum?  How about cosmetics and achievements and cool consumables, but don't gate good gear behind the requirement to have seal team six shouting commands and memorizing dumbass tactics to win overtweaked boss fights... PLEASE.
---
Just let people have fun.  I agree that it should require a group, but not due to difficulty, just because that's more fun.
---
Extremely hot take
---
*oof* what a well thought out response. Again, says the griefer. Suck my dick and swallow my nut because nobody gives a fuck if it’s your xp farm. Go somewhere else
---
Have yet to try VATS in 76. Guess I need to figure out the PS4 button to activate it...
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheat_Mountain
---
I'm moving on to another game until this is fixed. Maybe I'll return. Every patch breaks something more on my build that doesn't get fixed. I can take a hint. 
---
Gt is magicxbum, level 14 lol played at launch, quit and just now getting back into it
---
I've seen the Flatwoods monster twice, both times in the Mire.
---
I agree as well. Unlike Forward Station Delta (the southernmost point), you won't be falling into holes constantly. There will still be plenty of Violet Flux to farm.
---
As a non-PA player, please keep the nuke zone as far to the SW as possible. There can be a lot of area to run around in if you do. Thank you in advance!
---
Yeah, honestly a barely encountered those plans, or never found any legendary BOS armor.  
---
So all the colored uniforms have a chance to spawn in place of the dirty/weathered ones?
---
afaik this bug has existed since the beta ¯\\\_(ツ)_\/¯ 
---
😂😂😂 wtf are you talking about? Exactly what in that long dhiaretic reply is supposed to pertain to what i was saying?
---
I just don’t see the difference between someone setting up turrets for xp vs someone camping the same spot for hours to also getting xp. It’s kind of a double edged sword, don’t you think? 
---
Is holding the munitions factory even worth it? It's so slow.
---
This is the first I've ever seen this problem not being mod related. Were you running mods previously and simply uninstalled/disabled them when doing your clean install?
---
With the mirelurk king (watch out) and mirelurk
---
I've seen him twice and the last time was in the woods by this cliff.  He actually attacked me the second time. 
---
The hottest, i think someone has issues outside this game 😂😂
---
I max agility build with high AP with ap bonuses to my armor so I tend to sprint alot, comes in handy in run n gun type situations!! Also good for PVPin players in PA!

Are you PC? I'll come visit your house, my pink friend.
---
Man, I have issues. I read 'Good mutilation guide'. 
---
I hear ya. It’s been damn near a week and they haven’t said a word about it. As if bloodied builds aren’t challenging enough running around with low health, now we got involuntarily nerfed. 
---
Nice I’ll look into it. Thanks
---
It should also take a unit of purified water to rinse the cans out clean. It only makes sense.
---
but you can always drink it like purified water
---
No, it’s worse
---
Nope. Clean fresh game
---
Lmao ur raging out bro
---
Yes I love playing it and my girlfriend and I love playing it together too
---
Yes! At first I found the “White” version (which is still a little dirty but better than the dirty and weathered versions) and I found the matching hat to go with it. Then I found several other hats that said “brown” “pink” “blue” so forth. And I can confirm because I have the brown, green, blue, and now pink Asylum Worker Uniform. I still need the red, forrest, and yellow. But this post was more of an “it exists” type of posts 
---
The map was empty except for me. I was primarily farming for flux stabilizing materials, and it was ok for that. Got 4-5 each of the glowing mass, hardened mass, and high-radiation fluids. Not too many raw flux because I nuked too far south and missed the community garden, but I got the main part of the airport and did Collision Course while it was nuked. Feed the People also kicked off while I was there, but Back on the Beat did not. I didn't stay the whole time, though. It was a solo launch; I was practicing going through the silo quickly with lockpicking,  hacking, and robot expert turned on. Much easier than just destroying everything!
---
Dude, just let it go. As I and basically everyone else here has pointed out, this isn't helping your cause. Why do you feel the need to get in the last word? Why is it important that people see it from your point of view? Take your downvotes and simply move on. Or keep adding to the pool with your screeching, I guess.
---
Where is the spot?
---
Epic response reddit troll. Quit taking your anger out on OP lol
---
They use to sometimes be sold at grafton but not anymore.  From what I have read you can find them sometimes at random plan spawn locations.  And I dont think any would drop as a legendary but if you have the plans or know someone who does you can mod a legendary piece of combat armor to be BOS
---
I was trading with Grahm on the road when we were suddenly accosted by a super mutant ambush. I was thinking, "Yeah! Alright! Team up time?" I look back to see Grahm with his hands up, shuddering. 🙁
---
unless you're used to dealing with little content from background experience, wait a bit until the roadmap updates start happening, but if you're used it you should be good
---
I've been testing it and based on my experience, after a fresh relog, if you let yourself get hungry, it triggers a bug/feature where adrenal stacks way more damage. This effect stays even if I refeed myself out of the red and continues until I relog. Effects display in pipboy continues to show nothing.
---
Otherwise damage buff matches the compressed/nerfed table where you get a 10% buff at around 50% health up to 65% buff at 10% health.

---
The game is already immensely easy and "casual". They decide to add raids to the game. So they should do an actual fucking raid. Have you never played a game with raids before.
---
Same on PS4, sometimes impossible to kill. But switch severs with the same group of players and she goes down much. Pisses me off when I waste 2000 rounds for nothing. 
---
You may be correct lol. He just went off on this post 
---
He decided to hit you for a reason. To make you mad. It worked.
---
Yes sir EVERY FLIPPING time  I log out or server change very annoying. 
---
If someone sets up a camp there with turrets situated such that they farm the mobs, making the area nearly unplayable for everyone else (turret missile spam brings the area to a crawl), that is bad. 
---
However, setting up a base in the same area, open, with all crafting amenities open, free food and water, with no turrets, or turrets set far back as to not aggro the mobs, so that a user can use the base as a free central free fast travel. And they then go into the clubhouse to kill mobs themselves with their own weapon, is totally fine imo. 
---
I always do this. If I go to a Whitespring blast it's normally to farm flux rather than xp but it's the principle so if I see a tower I close the doors.
---
I found that that having those perks really helps. You can turn off the targeting restrictions on turrets to help thin the herd first which helps with time.
---
/program files 86/bethesda.net launcher/games/fallout76

Not really mad. Just confused. It’s happened more than once so he’s definitely not the first 
---
 Glad surely wasn't the 'perfect'. Word. English is an amusing language and it barely makes sense to people who have it as there first language.  It's fo76 reddit , so I'm not surprised some people are butt hurt about my rather innocuous initial comment.  
---
Anyways have a gooder you crazy wastelanders ;)
---
they can't say they're adding **raids** as end game content and them make them easy as fuck.
---
I'm sorry, but to complain about high level group activities requiring groups is how it works in every game with raids. This is supposed to be **end game** content. 
---
If it's not hard and rewarding, and requires preparation, then it has failed.
---
Nice! I have only been looking for a few days, and have found a white uniform and all the hats. I really want the red one.
---
Add Happysunflow3r 
---
I’m a troll for having a different opinion? Interesting. Very interesting. It makes me think of a certain marxist ideology. 
---
Have a good time now!
---
That's where it was originally I believe, but then they moved it under the users My Games folder. At least for me. I had this same problem, and fixed it when I found the new location.
---
Wait, adrenal reaction is bugged? I haven't heard anything about it.
---
Me too! Looks different from the rest. 
---
Instructions unclear, defenestrated PC.
---
I got attacked by a glowing Mothman when someone nuked Whitesprings the day before yesterday.
---
All of the weight reduction perks are underrated..none are really a bad choice 
---
Not really lol. Just don’t understand why some people are so self entitled. I’m not the one complaining about turrets “stealing my xp” in an online video game either. That would be you people.
---
No you are troll for cursing people out because you cant articulate your point without anger and for getting political after you made an ass of yourself lol. If you want the truth.
---
Obviously I have. And it sucks if you don't come with a premade group who has memorized every stage of an encounter and have to put up with some basement dweller trying to boss everyone around as the 'raid leader'. I want no part of it, and good gear shouldn't require such BS.
---
Let's say your base carry weight is 160, and with all your gear, aid, and and you are at 120. That leaves you 40 pounds to pick up junk or anything else. With 4 points of strong back, you can make that 80. With 3 points if pack rat, you only have the 40 pounds, but you can actually carry 160 pounds worth of junk.
---
So if junk collecting is your goal pack rat let's you carry more for fewer perk points. You can throw that extra point in traveling pharmacy it story frame (or strong back), and get even more utility.
---
Ok thanks 
---
raiding on wow isn't a second job. You're thinking of current tier mythic raiding. Which barely anyone except the best players do.
---
That's literally why I said it should have a difficulty. on WoW, raiding on normal or heroic or through LFR isn't that hard at all. But it's **end game** content. You're supposed to work for it.
---
That's so cute!! How do you get in it? 
---
See this screenshot:

---
The pressure plates work better, since you cant unsynchronize them since they reset
---
If you log out it does reset yes.
---
What I recommend you doing is make sure you have computer rank 3 hacking and turn all the turrets against the robots. This makes it a lot easier to deal with. You also need a spec/weapon that allows you to 1-2 shot them. So you might need to work on your spec or work on farming to get better weapons. 
---
Oh, good to know! my camp must be in a bad location because it never happens to me :)
---
I think your words were "suck my dick and swallow my nut." If im not mistaken
---
not sure if you have noticed, but that comment is 2 months old.
---
by now im not even playing this mess anymore
---
Okay but op said he destroys any camp he sees at whitesprings. No matter if it’s just turrets or an actual camp. Yet it seems *I’m* the bad guy for calling him a dick. Seems legit but okay lol. I’ll just be moving on I guess. Nothing to see here but a bunch of self entitled D-bags. 
---
(Aside from you, of course.)
---
Are you all there in the head?
---
He (and sometimes she) falls in slightly different places in the same general space. Maybe the body spawns in a different orientation or twists when it falls, I don't know.
---
Sometimes it'll land like how it is in the picture. Sometimes it will land farther to the front where it could have been conceivably caught by the blue chair. One time, in my previous version of a camp in the same location, [it landed with one leg in the window](https://i.imgur.com/zlNl0xg.png). Never saw that one again.
---
Eat anything would produce raw fertilizer, raw fertilizer everywhere. 
---
I have that too, still i'm forced to run this game like a potato.
---
We had a mod for that called Save my Stuff but a patch broke it. 
---
100% agree, this is something that should of been in from day 1. Laziness on the Dev's part, no excuses.
---
Dude that would be AWESOME
---
What's worse about it? Genuinely curious to see what you think they've made worse 
---
Yeah but do u kno how rare it is for him to actually have it in his inventory?
---
Lol not 10k
---
I was kind of disappointed with hacking the robots. They just stop attacking you, but don't start fighting for you. I think they also turn on you again after a while, but that may have been new robots, I couldn't really tell and didn't want to stick around to test it. Still, it definitely is going to be the way I do it from now on.
---
Do you know if the perk that reduces armor weight helps sneak?
---

I would wait, to be honest (I bought at full price and regret it). Given how bug-ridden the game has been and how inept Bethesda has been at fixing these bugs (they keep on creating new bugs when they roll out patches, sometimes impacting player improvements that take quite a bit of in game time and money to obtain), wait until at least after the first wave of DLC has come out (June) to see if the game is worth your time and money.
---
That's weird, I found one there just last night. Scared the bejeepers out of me.
---
I would recommend playing a different game.  Until you get banned from that one. Fortunately, you can then play another game. Until you get banned again. 
---
This is all good information to know. I'm in my 70s and still haven't launched a nuke yet. Prime site was where I wanted to launch whenever I finally get around to it. 
---
Could be any type of water since you're pretty much smelting the cans down to make raw metal
---
Yeah I disagree with OP, too. 
---
Some bases at Whitesprings are harmless and at times, very helpful. 
---
Some are missile turrets and negatively impact player experiences. 
---
Persistence beats impulsiveness in the long run. If you want to get it now, spend the caps. But MMOs are meant for farming and that's no different
---
you using suppressors?
---
Yeah! The pink one would fit with my name and general aesthetic, but something about the red one is just super attractive and vintage-feeling.
---
Good gear won't require such BS. There should be OTHER activities to do which offer the same gear, but it shouldn't be as fast. Literally just like in WoW.
---
Good luck finding it though... 
---
love this idea, i guess you mean it like a personal card slot storage inside the smith or bench
---
As the security system loses robots, it begins manufacturing new ones. So very likely you encountered "new" security teams. Hacking has been by far the best time saver for me. It also reduces the amount of ammo I have to spend for each run.
---
About 3.50$
---
Well I heard someone spent 8 hours with the vendor with nothing but I'd rather spend 8 hours farming something else
---
Best bet would be to find someone who already knows the plans and see if they can mod it for you. 
---
My husbands camp is near mine, we built basically at the same time so there is no issues there. We can usually spawn in ok, in fact in a fresh session we have so far never had issues. Nobody seems to camp where we are.
---
However issues arise if one of us has to leave and rejoin. Then whoever rejoins sometimes cant place the camp, despite nobody being there.
---
Could just be some critter causing issues, but not sure. It's not too much of an issue, since we just use the others camp, but still.
---
Caps?
---
Happened to me yesterday at the same amount of health you have in the picture.
---
So you’re basically admitting that it is indeed pathetic. I simply wanted to say that I don’t get it. But what did I expect... just pathetic Bethesda fanboys who will defend this game to their death, even tho the comment itself wasn’t even a hate comment. I deleted all my other comments so yeah, I take my downvotes and move on. Hope you’re all happy now. Respect. 
---
Thank you for posting a video! So many bug reports are just angry key smashes. 
---
That's a really good question because I just realized I use that perk (1 rank). I would guess yes because it's all about armor weight and not how you get the weight doesn't.
---
Ask someone on market subs u will get a quick reply 
---
Can you please offer another suggestion as well.  A special "growing machine".  Like a hydroponics machine or something like that which will allow us to grow non typical crops.  Running around Appalachia looking for firecracker berries and the such can be a pain.  I'd much rather spend time looking for a machine to build.
---
True enough, but I still haven't participated in a successful Queen kill on my main, and I've tried several times now.  She always screws off to some place out of range, or won't take damage, or just regens until time runs out.  The only time I've succeeded, was on my low leveled alt, which gave me the achievement. 
---
Could be. I spent days for the x-01 jet pack. It's all a roll of the dice. Even in the market subs though 1700 is too much. Reddit actually dictates the in game economy for the most part. Most people would sell it for 1000 caps. Tops
---
And that did it. A thousand thanks friend

Awe I love that! I hope you’re able to find both! 
---
heh okay it's been a while since I played WoW, but that was not the truth when I did. Would take weeks for a 'filthy casual' to grind enough dailies or those war point things or whatever to get gear. That's not acceptable.
---
It was worth $20 before the recent patches.
---
The first time it happened there was a group of people attacking it for the full 30 minutes with nothing happening. Eventually gave up and started harvesting flora.
---
Very happy to help! When I had the issue, I had some shop shag carpeting stored in a blueprint in my CAMP, so I couldn't ever open my CAMP menu! I was stuck without a CAMP for over a week!
---
I have zero regrets for spending 120 on two copies
---
Wow man I didn’t realize you had a PhD in psychology. Please tell me more Dr. Phil. 
---
I’m angry because every day I come on here I see some douche bag complaining that someone is building at his (let me say that again) someone is building at *HIS* grind spot as if only he’s allowed to go there. What makes me angry is the self entitlement that some people have on this game. What makes me angry is that high level players expect everyone to just bend the knee to them. What makes me angry is that I had a camp at white springs with the sole purpose of trying to give people a place to repair/rest, yet everytime I loaded into the game of have to rebuild my camp. No turrets. No “stealing your kills” but yet you assholes still liked to destroy my shit. That’s what makes me angry. Couple that with OP saying he destroys any camp he sees at whitesprings, yeah that makes me mad because there are plenty of people who just like the area. I’ve been personally effected by assholes like OP and I am tired of it. You can disagree with me all you want, I’m not a troll and I don’t give a fuck if you think I am. You’re some random guy on reddit. Cool you think I’m a troll lol. If I’m a troll for saying you don’t own a portion of a map in an online game, then god damn it I must live under a bridge. I’ll admit I could’ve worded my reply’s better. I’m trying to quit smoking cigs and I get a bit ornery at times. That doesn’t  change the fact that OP is a piece of shit and so is anyone else who thinks they can just destroy other players shit because it’s in “their spot” stealing “their xp” It’s not your spot and it’s not your xp. It’s really that simple.

Make C.A.M.P assets take Radiation damage. Not so much that a passing rad storm will take it out, but enough that if it lingers in a Nuke Zone it's toast.
---
Yeah I'm a true grinder I've played ff12 for years but there certain things I refuse to do
---
Significantly better. I played 12 hours on the same server yesterday. Little bit of lag here and there but never had any real issues. With the free DLC coming soon too I think $20 would be a steal.
---
Is stealth not working?
---
The Green is fine, just don't build near the enemy spawns
---
Really he's always at my camp for done reason ..I seen him twice in a day this week
---
If you mean that the SBQ is a bullet sponge, then yes, that is normal.  Also, if there is lag on the server, you won't always see the hit points immediately go down.  Then it will catch up when the server does.  There are many varying factors to taking down the SBQ.  It depends on how many people show up to help, what level they are, what weapons they are using, etc.  Take a look at who is on your server before launching.  If you don't have enough people, you may be better off nuking Whitesprings instead.  But the SBQ is definitely a team event.  Minimum recommendations are 6-8+ players with LOTS of ammo.
---
Happened last time I did the SBQ. Frustrating 
---
It's Mothman week, so he spawns more often (and from what I've read, seems more likely to spawn at camps).
---
I don't know, but half the time i've tried to kill him he just dissapears and now i feel bad about attacking him :(
---
The cannibal perk allows it as an execution of a downed player.
---
I may have missed some informations but maybe Bethesda uses the word raid not in an mmorpg raid like sense but I'm afraid they are.
---
The SBQ is also group content but not gated behind mandatory grouping, I would like to see it stay that way for all the upcoming content.
---
I notice a lot of couples mention they're playing on Reddit. My wife and I also play this together and it's really fun!
---
There's three different versions of Mothman. One just stares at you and will disappear if you get too close. One is hostile and will attack if you get too close. And then there's the event one that only spawns if you do a certain event at the lighthouse, where he gives you a buff &amp; is otherwise passive.
---
Any info on fixing this from Bethesda? I just died, dropped a ton of junk, picked up a jawbone, died again, and all my junk is gone. I picked up that jawbone from my paper bag but if there was one when I died the first time it disappeared. Frustrating at lower levels.
---
Didnt read get a life
---
This has actually happen to me once. She just froze took no damage after her reheal then flew off. 
---
I can jump in from the ground, but others can make the jump from my actual house if they line it up right. 
---
Neither are too great tbh. Pack rat isnt great because junk scrapped weight is always low unless you have 1/3 of the map in your pocket. Junkshield can be fully capped with the weight of 1.4 or a bit less iirc. Sturdy frame however will stay relevant endgame and will always give you more bang for your buck so to say. The reason is most event and legendary mobs will drop armor. Armor that you dont need and want to sell or scrap for mods. Traveling pharmecy still ranks higher in general in my opinion. But If I had to choose betwen these two it would be sturdy frame.
---
I found the savings after following the instructions, and there was a 10mm pistol, some ammo, randomly generated junk, and a meaningful holotape you should listen to.
---
I’m level 88 with hundreds of hours logged, and haven’t seen mothman once.  I’ve tried to do the lighthouse challenge 3 times now, 2 times I logged on with only a few minutes left and the last time I caught it right away but the game crashed before I finished.  Flatwoods monster I saw and killed probably 4 times in the span of a week around xmas, once before when I first started playing, but never since.
---
 There is something wrong with your machine. I'm in Linux now, so later I'll look, but I'm pretty well maxxed for visuals and get a very smooth ride.
---
U don't have any rifle perks?
---
Nooo, don't lock them out as group-only content. That's awful in games, hated it in Destiny too. Some people play this game solo (I don't always but still) and to take away much anticipated content is a disservice. Make them slightly more difficult than the Silos for example
---
Psychobuff
---
what mods does it have? I haven't found any...
---
I think you could certainly find $20 worth of enjoyment in the game, but if it were me, I would probably wait until it was either cheaper or had more content.
---
The game is less buggy than it used to be, but it is still broken in some smaller parts. It's not like half the map is gone missing, but some quests can't be completed, bulk crafting steals your plastic if you're not careful, some perk cards do not work (or do they??), and the game disconnects about once every three or four hours.
---
People who have been playing for a while already know the meta game involved there (don't pick that perk card, don't scrap all junk, don't blah blah blah). But it can be very frustrating as a new player to not know something is broken until after it affects you. It's not like there's a pop-up in game that says 'Warning! You should drop one item in a paper bag first and check if the bag glitches into the ground before dropping more items.' You either have to read here, a lot, or figure it out for yourself at the cost of your own items, caps, and time.
---
That system just puts it on the scroll wheel. 
---
I paid 700 on market subs couple of weeks ago
---
how many characters can you have ?
---
No one above lvl 150 grinds whitesprings anymore lol. Its not us who we destroy them for. Its the people who are newish to the game and know the golf course is a good way to farm xp. They turn up and try to get a few lvls only to be met by a monstrosity at the back door and no way for them to farm a few lvls so they can finally use the decent legendary they got. You seem to have anger issues and maybe you should think about having a word with yourself before you go of on any more tirades that have little or nothing to do with the subject you are arguing for or against 👍
---
Yes. 
---
That’s been my experience. I love the mystery to it!
---
$20 is one trip to the movies, where you get maybe 2 hours of entertainment. The game is significantly better than the beta days, and will be getting tons of content over this year. I'd say $20 is easily worth it.
---
Sometimes the loading arrows spin so long that her body despawns and leaves a meat pile the same size as everything else. Given the shear quantity of adds she spawns, it becomes very difficult to ascertain which pile is her's. This results in much frustration and anger given the quantity of resources expended to take her down (depending on the fight composition). I've been witness to both her body sticking around and despawning quickly. Neither is predictable and can lead to lots of confusion.
---
Ah! Well I’ll just have to be on my toes!
---
Is that lighthouse quest doable alone? It seemed like I didn’t have much time to collect all of the glowing goop
---
Self entitled cuts. Most of them are whiny kids that want the government to pay for them and everyone bend to their wills.
---
Every day whining. Which is likely exactly why Bethesda won’t do it. It’s not reasonable, and they’re laughing at them as much as we are
---
Hell yeah brother
---
3 atm
---
A great use for all those mason jars laying around.
---
then it won't be a raid.
---
Challenge is definitely bugged. I've murdered everything on that list and nothing.
---
 They area test, that you are apparently failing. ;) They have improved my melee a lot.
---
Hah hah yeah me neither never seen it, in about 600 hours.
---
Same, but $50 for one
---
You must've been playing wow eons ago then because you can get high enough ilvl to get into heroic current tier raids with half a week or so of grinding
---
Extra Flame Jets is the mod I believe.
---
You dont seem to understand what "entitled" means. You should stop using buzzwords if you do not understand their meaning 👍
---
I’m going to create a new character who’s only purpose is to do this. And every day I’ll get on this sub and troll people about how they can’t do anything to stop me. And it’ll make me laugh
---
Or just let us plant everything, bar maybe a few types of plants that need to be in certain locations to grow (eg, make it so you can grow bleach dogwoods, but only if your camp is in the toxic valley).
---
Well, kind of stationary. There are nearly a dozen of these on top of Mt Whitney, because it's been re-surveyed a bunch of times with different levels of accuracy, and also because it keeps growing and shifting around a little.
---
Any way we could get a list of suggestions you have already heard? Maybe a sticky at the top?
---
Exploration is great. It's my favorite map thus far, which is saying something, since I'm from Boston (although they left my hometown out, even though it's where Oberland Station is IRL). The terrain is varied, there are a lot of picturesque locations, and some really great spots with little details along the way. Although the map is divided into distinct regions, they manage to make the transitions feel less abrupt than you'd expect.
---
Enemies respawn *much* faster than in FO4. Considering how large the map is, they probably thought it was necessary to keep things populated enough for a multiplayer environment. If course, the map is large enough that you can just not backtrack if that's your preference ;)
---
I play solo 99% of the time. This is the first online game I've put serious hours into, so I was worried about that aspect. The game is absolutely viable for solo play. Glitches are still a problem. Some people have serious problems with crashing, and some big issues can pop up, such as a major bug with a popular mutation at the moment.
---
Given the current state of the game, and your stated preferences, I wouldn't recommend buying it right now. However, I really enjoy it, even though there are things that really frustrate me. I suggest checking back in after the Wild Appalachia content releases to see if that's made an effect on things.
---
I hope that's helpful for you.
---
Man, carnivore + good boy would probably fully fill your hunger bar with a single can
---
5
---
Awh crap you're right. I can hear the thunder of  Keyboard Cowboys now.
---
I failed it too about 4-5 times because the time always ran out, until I finally did it. No way Im going to try it again unless I see the timer being nearly full.
---
I think the event is okay to do once, so you know what it's about. You get some few hour boost from it, was is 10% exp or something like that.
---
Maybe they could make a harder mode like other multiplayer games have a "veteran" rank of dungeons
---
Have you not even tried to read the dozens of posts about this? They know. They’ll fix it. Stop having a stroke
---
This is my rationale for all video game purchases. ;)
---
Also best I have found non pa.
---
  I Am still hunting the arm bos mod plans and a dense mod for chest piece.  Was lucky enough today to finally find heavy combat legs plan at watoga  as thats the last thing I needed to craft a complete set. 
---
I dunno.  I get the feeling that the idea is to make certain plants not growable to encourage exploration and the such.  I feel like exploring to get plans or to get the materials needed for a machine services the same goals.  
---
Plus with a machine you can grow indoors and not worry about plants outside. 
---
I did it alone but it had just started and I barely completed it.
---
I love mine and keeping them
---
Nice!
---
If you block someone, they will no longer be able to see you on the map or on the active players list.  Blocking someone results in perma block until you unblock them.   All resources are lusted on the map.  You do not have to farm all resources, but each resource will require an extractor to be built each time.   Your level does not effect the amount produced from the extractor.  You should defend your extractors as anyone can come take from them unless you lock them (cntrl/f) and choose a level for the lock.  The higher the lock the less chance someone can pick it.  If they do pick it, any turrets you build will engage them and they will be marked as 'Wanted.'
---
Agree with everything you said but I was under the impression that they "fixed" the paper bag glitch. Like patch five?
---
Yooooo thatzzz DOPE! Nice! I’m wanna build one now.
---
I've tried it solo and also couldn't finish in time. It might be possible, but seems tricky.
---
Just don't ake my spot lol 😅
---
 Yeah I have the Heavy Legs plan but the rest I bought from Cunningham at The Whitespring. 
---
Explain please how this bears any resemblance to communism? An ideology that slaughtered more people than the black death? You literally do not understand what you are saying 😂😂 you are not a troll for having a differing opinion, you are a troll for not using a well thought out reasoned arguement, rather you spit forth vile accusations and use words you seem to not understand.......i think thats the definition of a troll, and also a moron. But hey thats just a theory.....A GAME THEORY 😂😂😂
---
That is a good point. Maybe I might even give it a change if I make a second character as I'm now to invested already in my current build.
---
Honestly, my gut reaction is FUCK THAT.
---
However, I would only agree to that IF AND ONLY IF, you had to start a new character that you could only play on survival mode.
---
I can already see it, lvl 100 characters griefing the shot out of new players the second they come out of the vault
---
I'm by the snake icon at the golf course and he's been spawning loads of times right to the right of me where the robots guard the hole in the wall. I've probably killed him 20 times now. Never any good loot but I like the fight. 
---
Is it uncouth? Yeah, cause they’ll try to recover it. And you wouldn’t want it to happen to you. 
---
Can you? And literal role playing should you? Absolutely
---
I'm hoping that with the new  PvP mode coming out , they will either reduce or eliminate the slap damage in the non-pvp mode.   I had some level 120+ douche attacking me in White Springs club house non-stop the other day.   I kept moving to other rooms, and he kept following me and hitting me with a Grognak's axe.   I just wanted to kill ghouls.
---
Make that 3 per day.  Dunno if it is a bug but I only get to do 1 of the 3 activities each day.
---
Sigh
---
&gt;  it should require a group to even enter
---
Yea, because EVERYONE plays this game as a group. /s
---
 I'm the opposite. I will happily fight for fuck all and leave a lot on the ground in this game.
---
I don’t even have a door. I have a tent with a bed and all the crafting tables inside, a cozy fire and cook station outside. It’s all I need.
---
Well it does fit the lore.  The robots are supposedly maintaining the grounds, that should include keeping vagrants from building structures within those grounds one would think.  That said my camp is within ehitespring grounds...though outside the blast zone area.
---
what's your name? i prefer playing with other people
---
Every now and then when I’m selling my random loot I end up selling something of use accidentally. RIP Prototype Hazmat Suit 😢
---
Claiming it, yes. Holding it? Depends on if you think PVP is fun and if you’re not getting your butt kicked. I can easily get a few hundred rounds of ammo before any conflict; that seems worth it to me. 
---
You can easily do it on your lonesome. Just collect 50 bioluminescences from fireflies and the occasional radtoad in the area around the lighthouse. Place them at the top of the lighthouse tower, and Mothman will appear. Bask in his wisdom, and he'll give you an exp buff. Praise Mothman!
---
A single point of concentrated fire is all you need - just enough to be able to target wings. Don't confuse this with a VATS build - it's not!
---
3.
---
This was more than that. The last time it happened it was a dozen players for 30 minutes. While I know it’s a bullet sponge, I can see a slight amount of damage over the course of ten seconds.
---
I used to use Ghoulish, but it seemed to have no effect— sharing lvl 1 rad sponge while on a team is all I do nowadays.
---
weird flex but ok
---
I couldn't believe what happened next!
---
Good point, but remember you can't engage in PVP until lvl 5 for that very reason. 
---
Praise Moth!
---
No one is flexing. I look good without having to flex. I’m talking about triggered whiners and how it’s funny they whine so much about unimportant stuff. 
---
You’re weird
---
If it worked this way the false bans wouldn't happen ;-) it's more like 
---
SELECT User,Rare_pickup_counter WHERE Rare_pickup_counter &gt; 100000
---
U don't need marsupial to be safe from the enemies 
---
Legendaries from campaigns are far less rewarding than from exploring the world. There’s only maybe a dozen of legendary rewards from campaigns. All Rise, daisy cutter, bunker buster, perfect storm, nailer, and a few others. Most of them aren’t that great either. I sold all of them to vendor bots lol. They really should enhance the rewards from campaigns as well as boss monster loots. Did a queen killing yesterday and got no schematics, no stable fluxes only a stalker’s .44 revolver after thousands of rounds and 20 minutes of fighting. It’s like why did I even do this lol. 
---
Thank you! I kept seeing this glitch alluded to but could never get clarification.
---
That’s so weird! I looked yesterday, and just looked again now, and she’s nowhere to be found! 😳 ... do I offend? 😂
---
I feel like the green acid bath the scorched beasts give us do twice as much damage as before.
---
Everyone is playing something else
---
I manufacture 100% of mine. I stock 5-10k each of 5mm, ultracite 5mm, and ultracite .50. I only use my guns for silo runs and queen battles, otherwise I run melee. I haven't had to do a lead run on Lucky Hole in weeks now. I occasionally have to do a run for steel, often through Big Bend. I guess I'd rather get the mats and manufacture the ammo, than go way up north on the map, and wait forever on the factory. I haven't been there in a very long time.
---
What’s a lvl 5 character going to do against the same threat?
---
I can do it for you in about 1hour.
---
The majority of players are casual. This model just doesn’t work in that case.
---
It works for select few top players who are just going to own noobs. And that’s not fun. It’s how you deter new players from joining. 
---
There’s a middle ground, I just don’t know what it is yet
---
The random spawns happens at the end of the bridge. Settlements do not effect this.
---
Is there a way to increase your chances to see him? He showed up for the first time yesterday and I missed seeing him. He just bolted away.
---
I'd say you're the weird one for saying you're going to go out of your way to place a camp with a bunch of turrets behind the golf club, just for it to back fire on you cause you'll have to farm for mats all the time, VERY likely get your ass kicked by other players after they wreck your camp, and you'll get your camp nuked a LOT. So, really the only time you'll be wasting is your own. Lol
---
Once they make us able to decorate, I hope they'll ad the ability to flap things for keeps. It'd only make sense
---
have you had any luck in finding the plans yet?
---
It wasn't instanced before meaning it didn't care of you finished the quest and took the items already so would refresh on each server swap 
---
👍
---
I hope we can find it, because if we don't Bethesda will have to choose between the casual and the hardcore, and no one wants that. 
---
There is something to be said (and rewarding) about doing something solo that was intended to be difficult content for group play. It can take longer, burn more resources, require very nuanced build management and practice. 
---
My first mmo was ESO. While I know a raid (12-man trial) is impossible to solo, it was damn rewarding to run dungeons solo that were intended for groups of four.
---
I’m ok with adding raids that require groups to be successful. The thing I like about sandbox games is that there are many, many, many ways for different types of players to find enjoyment. Let the raiders have their raids and enjoy the game there way too!
---
Thanks all... I’ve tried dropping out surrounding pieces but will try blueprinting and shifting, and a few other things. So frustrating that it’s the last structural piece!
---
Yep had it my first ever nuke. Dropped on prime, must have had the entire server come down &amp; help. At least 10 guys over level 100, plus plenty of mid range 50-100’s and in 30 minutes we managed to do about 10% damage. 
---
Non stop power attacks with my grog axe doing no damage at all, when the next time I did sbq it was obvious every time my axe struck the queen, it made a small, but noticeable dent in her HO bar.
---
What you are suggesting is starting to sound a lot like Ark. and I don’t like Ark. 
---
Yep and theres a few other things to get but k haven't been back since the first time I went
---
 You idiots with CAMPs by Charleston Station are screwing up the only predictable Bot Vendor who sells this.
---
Me too! I'd grab that station and make it U/IM_AT_WORK_RITE_NOW's Metal Mayhem! But I'd only play classical music, and hopefully it'd piss enough players off that they'd find me, take it over, and make an ACTUAL metal station! haha
---
When it finally gives you a really good plan you don't have, you'll definitely be happy, but it might take a while.
---
I wonder if players should have a chance to find legendary items in locked containers and chests behind terminal-locked doors.  Might give some more incentive for players to just explore around instead of deliberately hunting for legendary enemies to grind items.
---
To each their own.
---
That sucks. When I did it the first time I could do all 3 but only completed the hot dog eating contest. I couldn't find the damned wheelbarrows and I tried cheating at the mud throwing game
---
I think forcing PVP on survival mode is the right move.
---
Middle ground would be not forcing people to drop everything. maybe just trash and caps?
---
Same I know i didn't put in a lot of time at launch, because of work and other games. Now with the 2019 road map my excitement is up and I'm playing everyday! I dont regret my purchase at all [power armor editon] plus [regular copy]

---
I dont understand what you're saying?
---
My favorites are unyielding and weapon weight reduction. Rocking a full set and my weapons are basically weightless.
---
That’s why I’m trying to buy it of off reddit everytime I try to get the bot to spawn someone has there camp right there
---
I've never tried it for that long but that's good to know. I just assumed it was under 10 min
---
Try stabbing a legendary bloated glowing whatever to death at ws because both your guns broke within a few minutes of each other.  That was .... fun ... lol.
---
In earlier Fallouts I picked every lock. I rarely pick locks in 76 as the ‘rewards’ don’t justify swapping perk cards in and then back out. 
---
This is yet another case for Perk Sets. Someday...
---
They should at least drop their medical supplies. Those are pretty valuable in the wasteland, but it's not your gatlin gun and power armor. 
---
Thanks, but to clarify: does permablock reset when you log out? I assume not, as long as you have chosen "block" as opposed to "block for session"? Couldn't find any documentation or comment to confirm this at all. Will the game put people you have perma-blocked on the same server as you, when you log back in?  Still wondering about the other questions (any notifications re blocking -to- the blocked person when they try to interact with you? Are extractors needed for -each- resource listed under a workshop? (Poseidon doesn't appear to have a spot for lead, food, water, for example.)
---
that's my point. Let the raids be difficult high level content that require groups to complete. Make other options for players who dont want to raid.
---
That's what they should be doing to make this game a more successful mmo lite. But I really doubt they'll do it well
---
I feel your pain. Same with the guy that did it to me this morning. Grognak’s axe lol but yeah. I don’t get the fun in it. Why not fight someone who actually wants to fight you back? 
---
no, they don't. But the high tier end game content named a RAID should **require** a group.
---
Wicked photo OP and Happy Cake Day!
---
This is a pretty good example of what I mean. Did they fix it? I honestly don't know. My last experience with the bug was my friend shouting because a bunch of his stuff fell into a rock. I don't want to assume it's fine and just start dropping stuff willy-nilly.
---
I also don't know which patch corresponds to which glitch. I just want to hit things with an axe.
---
yeah. I like that.
---
I agree the stakes should be high. if I dropped my power armpit, guns, trash (screws) and all.
---
I’d probably rage quit for the day.
---
If you hit creature once and let turret finish it, you get full XP and loot. I would train mobs to the robots in order to get that sword quest done (was 20 lvl or sth like that vs 60lvl zombie) and I've got a few legendaries this way as a bonus for those high lvl making it hard for others.
---
The images in loading screens are just randomly selected from the photos you've taken. They're not necessarily even from the character you're playing.
---
Well, I'm not 100% certain, but I'm pretty sure your level depends on what level the SBQ will spawn.  The higher the level, the harder to kill.  The level could also be determined by the first person in when the SBQ spawns.  Not sure which.  But either way, I see the one you were fighting was a 95.  So yeah, she's gonna be tough.  Best to bring big weapons and LOTS of ammo.  I also highly recommend the cryolator and lots of orbital strike beacons.
---
I am one of the horrible people that build at the Winterspring golf club, but I atleast use the weakest turrets and stay close enough that I can hear them popping off to come and claim the exp. Also it is not uncommon I will store my camp.
---
I am a responsible cheeser of exp.
---
Problem is most of the turret bases I see dont have anyone there they are off doing something else
---
What will happen is that I will create 2nd char, level it to 50 and then use some max vanilla gear to kill "well geared" players. I will have everything to gain and nothing to lose. Sure I might not win most of the times, but that one time when I do, outweighs all the times I didn't win multiple times.
---
Ohh, wait I don't need 2nd char, I can use same character. Why would anyone come with their best gear, that took them hours to gain just to lose it in matter of seconds to someone with garbage pipe pistol?  
---
I hope Nuclear Winter is a hardcore version of the Adventure Mode with a few new twists while still being primarily PvE oriented.
---
Much more demanding survival mechanics, like environment hazards being more dangerous, radiation storms being more common, all gas-mask items now having a condition so you can't just put on a veil and be protected forever, food being rarer, and stimpacks healing slower.  
---
Imagine instead of just the venting sites of Ash Heap being toxic, the entire region of Ash Heap is dangerous to breathe.
---
Maybe even larger nuke zones that last longer, and have a larger area of effect.
---
I’m in the EST time zone, and mostly play in the evenings as well. Add me if you want: Atomogen. I’ll be on after work today (about 6pm my time).
---
Sometimes a technical data 
---
This. I had a level 20-something get a bounty from picking the lock, so I explained why it happened and offered to kill him and not to take his stuff. He refused, which probably wasn’t the best choice, so I let him go so that he could take care of it on his own. 
---
I wish that would happen to me. I'd put something under it like a bath tub or a basketball hoop. Or a couch, then I'd call him the ghoul on the couch
---
love me some spaghetti westerns 
---
Been playing since beta......ive seen some things.....and some stuff!! Lol hit me up if you have any other specific questions and if i can help i sure will ☺
---
How do you do that? That was my original plan but they changed it from FO4 were the wires can't go though walls
---
You have a point. See, there's a middle ground somewhere. As long as Bethesda keeps looking for a nice medium we can all get what we're looking for
---
Could just add a quick travel point to the golf course right behind the club house and mess up the whole building at that spot.
---
 Got a Gamma gun plan? I could really use that one...
---
I think you need to be hoping for something else. Try to get the Skeleton costume plan (either to have it or to have another one to sell) and then you’re more likely to get the Witch. Good luck! 
---
Well yes, it is worth it, but if you disliked the beta you may not like it. The game is the same, with better performance and less bugs, but otherwise the same game.
---
Though I must say the more I played the game the more I likes it.
---
In what way does the option to solo something lessens the enjoyment for people to raid? 
---
Raiders like to raid, so they form a group and do that content. Gating something just takes options from other players. Would it be more entertaining for solo players if solo content could not be done in groups?
---
I feel you. My character is a savage though. He drinks dirty water straight from the source and eats radiated meat. 
---
Is it broken? I haven't heard anything about it being broken. 
---
I've found this twice in the last 24 hours; both times there were about 8 or 9 people attacking and the health did not go below the Q of queen at any point 
---
Theu increased the limit to 30 min before being kicked.
---
Yeah man. Also I had some issues with  pieces not being able to be removed after placed, so make sure you like what your putting down or youll have to start over. 
---
Or just reduce the number of ghouls spawns. 
---
I’ve got three of the skeleton plans, mask and costume. Lol oh well I still be looking but thank you 😉
---
The vendor also reliable spawns on the road heading west from Lady Janets Soft Serve as you pass the overturned bus
---
So far I've lost  3 x01 calibrated shocks, still searching for my left leg at this point now, and an x01 jet pack that I've literally only seen once in the store because of this terrible scrap system. I've even lost stuff I have equipped, because of course I would want to scrap what I'm using. 
---
 Sorry, a typo. That should be: "they are a test"
---
No sorry, pretty much all of the ones in the screenshot is what I have, plus a few common camp plans
---
The toads drop a lot. Sometimes they get stuck (or at least don't wander up) in the area under the cliff. You can find them it if you take the path back down and go right if they stop creeping up. 
---
Its the one things they really seem to have forgotten to improve on. More variety would be nice instead of always wood/wood frame flooring. 
---
My major problem is you can not intersect with other objects at all and not able to populate containers like shelves or book case's with objects. Who would NOT want to have a showcase of all the magazines or bobble heads they have collected???? 
---
If I had a list,
---
\-intersection with none camp objects needs to be eased up on, ceilings need to be more flexible too
---
\-Another option other then wood flooring for floors
---
\-pots/plants!
---
\-(this is a stretch, given how windows work now in game) windows that open/close
---
\-a better animal/pet system, separate from the camp capacity.
---
\-options to build a robot guard
---
\-an option for camp specialty/bonus's for activity in the camp
---
\-camp related quests or daily's, unlocks new options like player market items, pet related, radio towers, making some unique associated clothing, all kinds of stuff.
---
lots of things that could help deepen the VERY shallow camp mechanics in present fallout 76
---
get 76% off, 20$ is a bit much for THIS game
---
More bugs after every patch, mass bannings of players over the duping exploit, textures still don’t line up properly in most areas, dlc to come looking predominately pvp based. Idk guys, hate all you want on me but it’s just mho. If that’s what you want, go for it but it hasn’t been even remotely a smooth ride for me personally. 
---
For 20$ it's more than worth it, 
---
Ok and what am I failing?  Lol xD
---
Offer to trade someone! You may have a better chance of that than finding a specific plan from a random encounter. 
---
Or maybe make it so that we don't have to eat and drink every freaking half hour. 
---
Where can I get Mothman statue plans?
---
You could give me $20 and I can repeatedly kick you in the balls for 200 hours. I am not sure which you would give you more entertainment. Personal preference I guess.
---
Its just annoying no need to be mean
---
Yeah been looking for someone that wants to trade and am willing to pay also. If ya know anyone send them my way. 👍
---
I’ve noticed he’s automatically hostile if you happen to be carrying any amount of his eggs.
---
Will do. 
---
Thanks 😉
---
Wow, it's 2019 and people still don't know how to use a simple search term in google to find information 
---
Oh so I’ve been doing that already, and I’ve been reading these stealth is broken posts like “wtf are they on about” 
---
Thanks for your post!
---
&gt; Can someone please help confirm to me how this actually works since i'm newish to the game? Am i witnessing some black magic fuckery of balance first hand? Thanks. 
---
If you've tested it, then you probably have a better idea of how it works than Bethesda do. It's undocumented mechanics + spaghetti code. 
---
It's been rumoured that explosive shotguns are still broken, but I haven't seen any other tests yet. Damage per pellet has been suggested, but not a specific interaction with Demo Expert.
---
 I try to kill them without taking damage. I'm pretty good at that now. They are a useful food.
---
Hey I just found a 3* Medics Exploding LMG  - could be right up your alley! 
---
I do like that idea
---
You can clear it then get it again but that will only get it working for your current session. When you log out and back in it will be all fd up again 😐
---
Yes i do. But thanks for assuming my gear, weapons, and experience for me. 
---
That is like smallest problem. You find people just like you find them now and as there is no trinity system, it is really easy to find people.
---
This is why I refused to pick up the eggs in Point Pleasant when I was level 20-ish. Did not want to run into an angry mothman at low level.
---
 Alright. Thank you! 
---
Welp looks like I'm waiting until next patch to play again :)
---
That game exists, it’s called Ark. and I don’t like it
---
This is incorrect. When you log out and back in the text in the effects tab will disappear, like it is now, but the numbers on your weapons will be correct. Tested this myself.
---
Pre ordered it for 50€. Still think it was worth it.
---
It’s broken. If you clear it and reapply it, you can fix it.
---
Being a bit of an "Altaholic" I have started, and re-started, probably 10 times... Also being a bit of a build-craft-theory nerd I'd optimize builds around certain weapons (or combinations of them). \*Shotgun Guy\*, \*Pistol Guy\*, \*Melee Gal\* etc... After so many of these I decided to try to make the biggest \_generalist\_ I could, attempting to get S, P, E, A, L as close to 10 as possible while putting C and I as high as I needed for useful perks in those categories. This turned out to be my favorite build. Rather than sinking \*9\* points into a particular weapon perk family, I'd just put \*3\* points into the first level of each (Rifleman, Expert Rifleman, Master Rifleman) for example.  I'd thought the damage would be lackluster, but there are other perks that adjust for this (maybe some anti-armor, stagger or luck etc...).
---
I found that running around being pretty good at rifles, pistols, melee, shotguns, whatever - was more fun than being \_really\_ good at one of them. Plus once your levels are high enough you'll have enuff cards to swap into a "focused" build if you want.
---
Just my 2cents.
---
Are you on PC?
---

---
Here's the "optimized" combat loadout I use for my ninja main character. Pretty strait forward stuff really. 
---
This is only good for players who play the most. People being the way they are, will just grief those lower than them, hoping to pop a nice legendary. 
---
Free if you bring the parts needed 👍
---
Nah XB1
---
If there are no legendaries in the PVP servers, I'm down for that.
---
Otherwise, no.
---
It can take weeks and weeks to trade for a specific legendary item.  I'm not giving them out as freebies in the PVP server.  Plus if there are no legendaries, it's an even playing field.
---
Couldn’t agree more
---
I solo everything, so excluding us from new content is fucking bullshit
---
It's a shame this reddit doesn't sticky threads. I've created a list that contains only 1 of each plan from this worksheet. It's basically a shopping list of plans that you would need to buy from each location to obtain all the plans in the game without including duplicates.  
---
According to this list, you would need 740k caps to buy all the plans in the game if you were starting from 0 plans.
---
That person is blocked until you unblock them.  Period.  I don't know if that person is blocked from your server or not, but I doubt it.  But they can't see where you are.  So it's unlikely they'll bother you.  You do not need an extractor for each resource.  Only what you want/need to build.  The lead spot for Poseidon energy is right in the front by the fenced cage area.  I use it all the time.
---
I only lock my bedroom so I can have a spot to go AFK if I need to. Otherwise, I leave the bedroom door open.
---
Northwest corner of the map there’s a few lumber places
---
I agree. As a low level I had a 2 turrets at the back of the club so I coukd farm some exp and lvl 250's are destroying mystuff because I just want to at least get hits in so I can loot. If you are anything under 50 you can never farm this area because all the high lvl players one shot everything and then get mad when your there just trying to get kills.
---
I love this game. It reminds me of a combination of New Vegas’s launch and WoW’s launch. Lol. It happens. I’ve always wanted a wasteland with real people. It’s nice meeting other Fallout fans! 
---
Pick it up off the ground.
---
Killing them isn't the problem.  They are a pain on workshop defense because they can pop up anywhere and I always get one that's glitched out. When there is only one left it will just move back and forth between two points half the time not even surfacing 
---
Nooooope, nope. Bad idea
---
[Absolutely](https://youtu.be/qbjhqkB9KpI) 
---
Fallen trees are good 👍
---
There's a perk in luck called Woodchucker or something like that that doubles wood gathered, like Green Thumb etc. Just running around the forest gathering wood is pretty fast.
---
Still open? I’ve got a friend just starting out that may need a raider set
---
Or better yet, get the PSN app on your phone. It's quicker to navigate the menus and send messages, and you don't have to worry about getting killed while you are out of the game.
---
Look for piles of woods next to houses. 
---
Get the wood chipper perk well worth it and you can get like 100 plus wood from the lumber yard..rinse and repeat 
---
Love just seeing em chilling up a tree
---
You can go to the forests or anywhere really and run around to the logs and broken branches on the floor , the luck skill I don't remember what it's called maybe increase the wood you get too . Really handy . 
---
If you're in the mood for a walk just follow the roads through the forest and the savage divide. There's downed trees all over the place, and plenty of log piles around houses. There's also the lumber yard near Vault 76.
---
Selling about 200 caps on a good day
---
I grind and farm and got to my current lvl 120.  Don’t consider myself a higher level person, but worked really hard to get there.  A big part of it is respecting others players that got there before you and stealing XPs isn’t the proper path.  You cheat the process you pay the price it’s that simple.  
---
It’s also annoying to see the same post 10 times a day drowning out useful posts. I’m trying to chasten you, not be mean. 
---
Use the s arch, it’s there for a reason. Bethesda isn’t going to look at 50 posts of the same thing. Keep it on the main topic. Then there is a focus that can be tracked. 
---
You’ll also be received better. Now go do well
---
It is nearly identical to how it was in beta. No content or major features have been added since day one. 
---
https://youtu.be/vWWBq2ppjEs
---
I'd like to see factions in the PVP servers.  There are already multiple in-game right now.
---
Enclave, Brotherhood, Responders, Raiders, etc.
---
The only thing that should be a requirement is you cannot damage your faction members (just like you can't damage team members).
---
That would make PVP a LOT more fun as you could team up with randoms and go try to find other teams of opposing factions to fight.
---
Unfortunately we're going to get whatever they "want" to give us for the PVP servers.  Bethesda has proven time and time again once they get an idea stuck in their heads, that is "exactly" how they will implement it, no further feedback wanted.  Like the ill conceived "contest workshop from anywhere in the build zone" change.
---
I know but i wanna be a real minute man god dammit lol
---
Praise be to mothman!!
---
Same here! Plus your going to spend more then 20 bucks to see a movie. Gas and time to get there. Two adult tickets fot my wife and I (more then 20 bucks right there). Popcorn, pop, and extra butter. 
---
I figure if I get 24 hours of enjoyable time out of a video game then it is worth thw full 60 bucks.
---
As a new player farming xp at whitesprings I was happy to see a few turrets at the back because it ment I could farm really good exp amd actually kill the enemies before a lvl 350 shows up and one-shots everything seemingly trying to steal kills so I can't lvl 
---
Well if you weren't cheating then be worried?
---
Also, serums are aid items. You could gank a serum vendor for good caps. 😅
---
At the end of the day, I’m with you. I play as a rifleman build. I just want a viable rifle that allows me to do my thing. If not for reddit markets, I never would have gotten one. I did get a 1* Instigating rifle to drop, which would have been the weapon I would pour every  resource into to improve if that had been an option. 
---
For every tear and rage you shed over this, like daily posts about it, totally worth it. I can avoid nukes easily with a log off. And I have plenty of mats.
---
It’ll be fun watching everyone continue to whine. You make it worth it
---
Nah you are fine I took two from one guy today died once killed him like 3 times you are fine keep the raider spirit alive brutha!!
---
don't play a game with mmo features if you don't want to accept mmo features.
---
^^ this comment up there he states it perfectly :)
---
Activate the nuclear lamp instead
---
No lol
---
Uh huh. Eventually you'll get tired of having your camp wrecked and your ass kicked all the time. Don't come crying to reddit about "griefers" when that inevitably happens ;)
---
Why don't you create a game, if u know what's best. I've been playing Fallout since the 1st one. So, us old timers are used to soloing. Fuck your group content. 
---
A BUNCH of players supposedly got banned for "duping" for having over 100k ammo lol, even if they didnt (or so they claimed). If it's true then I'm kinda worried. Idk what customer support at Bethesda does, or whoever is incharge of handing out bans.
---
it sounds like the typical "i cant be this bad at video games, so you must be a haxor" attitude.  most likely wont report you, probably just go yell at his mom and kick his dog. 
---
&gt;I've been playing Fallout since the 1st one
---
yeah...so have I. But this isn't a single player fallout game is it. It's an mmo lite where the DEVS THEMSELVES have said they are adding RAID CONTENT.
---
To the best of my knowledge you drop aid items In pvp.,  the type amount and quantity is still unclear. That could be all you aid, just Stimpacks, 1 of everything, some percentage of everything. So short of dropping all aid items or a very high percentage stealth boys will still be viable. 
---
I also don’t doubt you can kill many if not most people in one shot or very quickly, though a the amount of players that know how to build their character to counter that is quite small.
---
ok cool thanks man haha
---
ew
---
WILL DO! About the funnest thing i have to do in this game 
---
(sad ik really)
---
Lol raiders always get the down votes just makes me want to burn the world more 😂 
---
I'd be down for extending the no build area around the club house.
---
It doesn't need to be the WHOLE zone though....lol
---
Just a heads up to all the people that like to camp at other areas of Whitesprings, be prepared for a FLOOD of people trying to get land there once Player Vending comes out.  Why they made the dumb decision to put Player Vending in camps instead of making a hub with indestructible terminals still mystifies me.  But that's Bethesda for you, look at 1-2 reddit posts, ignore all other feedback and possible problems with a system, and implement it.
---
If you are asking if I'm a glutton for punishment for staying then, yes, I am. If the game can move 2 steps forward and 1 step backwards instead of the 1 step forward and 2 steps backwards, then the game will do ok.
---
On rugs or fire pits i believe 
---
Yup, and raid don't have to be groups. 
---
Yes, they do.
---
This made me laugh too hard.. Bad karma incoming to me!
---
I'm sure you can find one in a couple mins with this buggy game
---
Don't worry although I got the down vote, I got you the upvote
---
I hope it will be actually content that requires brains and teamwork, but I feels this is going to be another bs SBQ thing, where everyone uses 0 brains and 0 communication... And if it is, this game is going to stay same joke as it is now. Not having actually group content that puts team up to challenge is exactly why people who play online games aren't playing, because for them this is like playing soccer against team that is made of degenerates. 
---
Unless you used profanity or racial slurs, threatened him, or made repeated derogitory comments, the nost he can do is report you for behavior.
---
That being said, you don't have to be a dick when PvP'ing at workshops. You're just giving everyone else a bad rep.
---
Put on woodchucker under luck
---
I accept the fact that certain boss mechanics are only possible with a bunch of people involved but the biggest issue I have with gated content is that raids/dungeons etc. always contain story elements. To gate this is just bad. Apart from this there has to be a real alternative to raiding to acquire on par equipment. Without such an option the game is doomed to have a small raiding "elite" and an utterly underpowered remaining playerbase.
---
PC for me - fights with her got way longer and less fun since the last patch.  So. Much. Ammo.
---
 I have never seen one in a tree. They do often have a particular tree associated with them though.
---
Hey shit head, the majority of players are solo, dumbass :D lol
---
well the only one that had the nerve to post the amount of stuff bethesda said he had (well over 100k ultricite ammo) could only try to claim bethesda counts its it when you drop yourself and pick it up.
---
so yeah you dont have anything to be worried about.
---
That's true I mean when he called me a cheater I did respond with "You're fucking stupid kid". Cause it pisses me off when people pull the  "cheater" card. Besides that no other verbal abuse was used. But yeah I'll avoid picking on the lower levels next time.
---
I'd love to see that.
---
I specifically said "behind the golf club" you're just a dumb ass bitch who wants to attack me cause...well...you're a dumb ass bitch. Kindly fuck right off :)
---
Part of my endgame routine is breaking your inconsiderate base. Caps don't mean anything to me. Takes me 1 minute to stroll over and break your cheese platform and it only costs me caps. 
---
Even without wasting a perk on woodchucker, find a wooded area and hit every fallen log in the zone.
---
My camp is in the woods, I can easily pick up 100-200 wood just making a 10 minute sprint around my base.
---
ok coolios, that makes me feel better tyvm
---
That's where my CANP is 
---
Hole 4 for life!
---
Sweeeeet!! I guess i should have checked that instead of just seeing the same txt and assuming it was still fkd. Ty 👍
---
This is exactly what is wrong with F76...everything is meaningless, because everything is easy. When everything comes easy, it is easy to let go of it. This means people come and people go as easy as they came, and no one will stay here to play and spend money on MTX.
---
And?
---
The majority of players in MMOs are solo. They quest solo, they level up solo. But some content is **GROUP CONTENT**. Raids are GROUP CONTENT.
---
Praise be to Mothman!
---
Atomic Shop.
---
&gt;A BUNCH of players **supposedly** got banned for duping for having over 100k ammo lol, even if they didnt **(or so they claimed).** If it's true then I'm kinda worried. Idk what customer support at Bethesda does, or whoever is incharge of handing out bans.
---
Somehow I think you'll be alright :) 
---
Do you have deep pocket plan for combat armor chest?
---
Woodchucker
---
Check if your game is using the High Performance Nvidia graphics setting. If your drivers are not updated, your computer may be running the game on Integrated graphics instead. I have a Notebook with a 1060 and I get 50-60 fps on the highest settings, and smooth 60 at the second highest. This is definitely an issue with your computer.
---
How much on a bad day? 
---
Come on, way too many ghouls spawn, worse still once a nuke has subsided they still continue to spawned at level 60+. Which is horrendous for low levels or people not prepared, there’s a reason you can never get those golfer feral ghouls to spawn, it because once a nuke happens only bloated ghouls will spawn. 
---
You’re welcome and not everyone plays like me, I track those numbers!
---
Thanks you alot Much love :) 
---
Honestly if players on this game are too scared to do a raid then I've lost hope for the game anyway.
---
It's a shooter. It's not an mmo where you've got 2 hotbars full of abilties that you need to use and coordinate with 20 people. It's a shooter where you're with 3-4 people and all you need to do is aim and press shoot.
---
It's not that hard. 
---
This! 
---
Absolutely 
---
One of the daily quests, Queen of the Beast has a pretty good chance to spawn the flatwoods monster. 
---
hello! i also asked this question on an fb group because i couldnt afford fo 76 that time then some guy messaged me and told me about this site that offers a 60% off on my region and much more on australia see if its lower than 35 dollars "cd keys.com"
---
Well we lose you, but we gain 35 more players, who love doing group content, to replace you.
---
Apparently i was wrong. I just assumed as the txt in the effect tab was the same it had got fd up again but, if you havent seen the reply to my comment, then it does work but the txt just dissapears 👍
---
you can use the campfire.
---
if anything it's the community ruining the game at this point. Judging by how many people came to my post to complain about group content saying it should be for solo players.
---
 Bethesda is going to have to listen to these players and they'll end up creating highly casual, easy shit that offers no actual endgame. I really hope these people don't get their way.
---
When it comes to, the footprint one , I cant seem to figure out this location on the map.  Seem beyond the fence 
---
100
---
Good for you👍 whatever works
---
You watching them die and then taking their junk makes you the asshole. 
---
Only acceptable time to take junk is through pvp. (Excluding baiting them to attack you / getting in front of their attacks)
---
Bethesda, set up millions of varying computers and varying internet connections with varying users just to test your game. Only then will you have a perfect game.
---
In my 150 hours I never ran into the infinite carry or dupe bugs, saw the power armor stretched person twice, and a stretched head once, oh and what were the other bugs stopping people from playing 900 hours? 
---
I suggest you write down as much detail of whatever problem made you come here and Bethesda Plz and submit it as a bug report on their official website.
---
Oh awesome! Just gotta find some way to lose it without losing my others lol
---
Hey Lone, it would be great if we could get some more info on this. There have been a ton of posts about how the queen fight is harder after the patch but there was nothing about it in the notes.
---
If it was purposely changed behind the scenes it would be nice to know what was done so we can strategize accordingly. If it's a bug it would be reassuring to know it's being investigated and will be corrected.
---
Because right now it looks like another stealth change from our perspective and that's frustrating. Thanks for looking into it.
---
I've found the power fist plan and flamer plan in the Harper's ferry 3 skill point safe. Recently whenever picking any lock I get a blank drop screen though! Complete waste of time at the moment.
---
No I’m considering buying a X-01 helmet but I would like to get a price check
---
I remember my first encounter or two with him. He either got stuck in passive mode or frozen in aggressive mode and so he’d just remain still. The first 1-2 my buddy and I killed him he never moved or attacked. I remember thinking “this guy is a joke. A tanky, ammo sink joke”
---
Then one day I was strolling by the golf course and he appeared. I had 1 egg in my inventory and this lad went into action. I never realized how many abilities he has and how OP they are. He’s a force to be seconded with solely on the amount of health he has.
---
If they add it you’ll have to wait until next year lol
---
I talked to the author of the PLM mod and he said he's working on an updated version of SaveMyStuff. 
---
Ok thanks I’ll keep that in mind since I’m looking to buy one soon
---
There is a lumber yard directly South of the skull cave picture on the map in the top right corner.
---
You can go there, grab all the wood piles, then server hop and they will be refilled.
---
If you put the woodchucker perk on it will double your output and make the job faster. 
---
Keep server hopping until you have enough.
---
You are fine. If everyone got banned because someone reported them I am sure way more people would be banned with they way some people are so quick to report for any little thing. So long as you didn't actually cheat you should be fine.
---
For now, yes
---
Hey! I’m there too! I’ve made a lovely little cafe for passerby’s, I’ve seen the moth man atleast 10 times by now... I’m a level 40 but still using really weak weapons so you can see my problem haha
---
No, rare items like screws, springs and things like that 
---
Honestly I dont even bother to go there unless Whitesprings is nuked. Cant be bothered to fight for scraps of experience with everyone alse there. There is so many better and more interesting places to go and have some fun.
---
Besides I believe teaming up would be the solution to share loot and experience in Whitesprings.
---
I made my first camp on a lumber pile by i think its called wixon homestead. I used the wood at first then bulked it for monies. Its not glorious work being a post apocalyptic lumberjack, and you won't get rich fast, but its reliable and not many people build on lumber piles so your camp will almost always get placed. 
---
ROTFLMFAO. Submachine gun 1000. Probably the most useless gun outside of the LMG.
---
 The BOS Knight, Soldier still spawns reliably in the train car west of Watoga Station. 
---
Yeah gunfu in whitesprings sometime leads to a huge mess
---
Has nothing to do with being scared :) I call it undesirable gameplay elements and forced gated gameplay.
---
And if it is not hard anyway why implement it all together? Like you said, its an shooter not mmo.
---
Just to make this clear, I don't want to be a dick or something but thats why reddit/forums etc exist. To discuss subjets and different viewpoints.
---
Orbital strike their camp, have a friend be prepared to claim your bounty and collect the loot
---
I dont see the cap stash outside of west tek in the little trailer at the gate anymore either.
---
why can't we have nice things?
---
Yeah they changed it in order to nerf it but left it in a broken state for whoever had the mutation prior to the patch. 
---
Not to the Little Chef’s taste? 😂
---
Woodchucker plus a trip to the Civil War camp in the NE and u won't need wood for awhile
---
yeah true I didnt think about it that way
---
I guess they don't spend all of their time farming and grinding one spot. No reason to move your camp just because you went to do quest or sell junk.
---
Would help if you said what platform your on
---
 No Legendaries, no VATS and I will happily play. 
---
 Its the fighting I like. ;) Fuck rewards.
---
Thanks for the correction. I was thinking it was from Rose.
---
Nope, but I can mod it for you (also any piece BOS)
---
Here's a thought. Instead of crying about turents. Why don't you sever hop. Or better yet use them to save ammo. Equip a area effect weapon and lure to the turents.  Tesla rife works great for this. Fight smarter. Stop begging for more restrictions and nerfs.
---
Was playing and I killed a wanted guy who was attacking my camp and got 15 caps. He cam back and killed me and I lost 134. I pressed ignore and respawned at my camp. He killed me in two hits and again I lost 134 caps. Is this intended to be this way? It seems like if you're wanted, you shouldn't lose less caps than you would from just normal PvP, and if the Ignore feature doesn't make you non-hostile when you spawn in, why is it there?
---
Not as of yet.
---
Only place that a camp causes a problem is right behind the gold club doors and no one puts it there other then to farm the ghouls.  If you put it there for any other reason you are just asking for the ghouls to level it
---
Sorry dude. Wasnt intentionally giving you wrong information.
---
CV?
---
For now, *dun dun DUNNNNN*!
---
Go to the lumber mill south of vault 76, talk to robots, they will unload wood scraps to your inventory then go farm the mill. Loads of gears there too!! 
---
Hey, me too neighbor!
---
I've tried to make sure I keep food, industrial purifiers and all the workshops available for any who visit. Also, a friendly neighborhood country porch for all the music throw downs. 
---
Thank you so much for taking the time to provide some answers! Really appreciate your helpfulness!

Or, and just a crazy thought, don't build behind the golf club, especially with a bunch of turrets. They can server hop, too. Especially after I level their camp sooooo
---
Is the red-eyed version passive? I've encountered it a couple times and it always disappears on a cloud of smoke. The only ones I've defeated have Green eyes.
---
To many "I've never seen flatwoods monster" comments, go to the power plant in the forest, there's a dry River bed to the South of it. There's a flatwoods down there every time I go by. There are also some glitched liberators usually stuck about 100 feet in the air.
---
f#ck the solo players. If they want to play solo, go play single player game. Fun fact, some raid bosses in WoW have been soloable, but it takes sh#tons of time to dps them down and that only after you figure it out how to survive. 
---
No worries dude everyone makes mistake

Sony made this change to the PS4 OS a couple years ago as a way to prevent unwanted spam.

You can set a campfire and place plants around the perimeter of it, but it is not aesthetically appealing.

I found this exploit before as well, I duped my X01 power armor set and while I wasn’t entirely sure how I did it I knew it involved me trying to drop an extra chassis and I think I ended scrapping it because it was still in my inventory, which ended up being the wrong one.
---
So what I think happened is I got out of my X01
---
Got the recall notification 
---
Tried to scrap another one in my inventory but ended up scrapping my X01 instead.
---
It gave me the pieces and then my X01 recalled in so I ended up with double parts.  I never mentioned it because items were already being duped and it didn’t matter but I wasn’t worried if I got banned for it because it was Bethesda’s mistake and it wasn’t like I deliberately tried to do it
---
I totally agree👍🏽
---
Had it happen on PC last night. I went through 3 max over repairs on my Gatling Laser (has bonus damage to scorched and a boost to fire rate), and there was a decent sized group of people besides me including a few with weapons that were turning the mobs spawned into swiss cheese. We got the queen down maybe 1/5th of her health, with 4/5ths remaining. Was kind of frustrating considering I went through almost 8 full fusion cores with my gatling laser.
---
Yup they nerfed it and still haven't updated the patch notes to reflect this obvious change. 
---
/u/valseek will the patch notes be updated for this change?
---
I have a spare one, but I honestly don’t know the „reddit price“ for the coat these days. With that being said: shoot me an offer! 
---
This game is complete bullshit.  Several times I have crashed while still alive and when I get back into a world all of my junk in my inventory is gone.  Repeat I never died.  The game freezes and crashes back to the home screen and every single junk item IN MY INVENTORY. I DID NOT DIE. IS GONE.  COMPLETE BS Bethesda I F'n Hate you
---
That's true. But this sub is full of people who cry at the idea of a raid being an actual raid apparently
---
That would be bs. It is always easier to do thing solo, than do things in group. Now why they f#ck should group of 5, who has to communicate and work as an team to succeed, rewarded same much as solo player, who don't have to do those things? 
---
Just going to link to this bug thread as something you should read before you buy. For a game where loot is crucial, you should review it before you make your decision. Three months after launch and Bethesda still hasn't provided a way to lock items so they don't disappear, can't be disassembled or dropped accidentally. 
---

Red is supposed to be the Hostile version, while Purple is the passive. Red won't attack on sight though, you have to get inside a certain range for it to actively go at you.
---
Green is either Scorched or Irradiated Mothman, from what I can tell, which are nastier versions than normal.
---
1250 to 1500 cause that’s what people are telling me that’s a reasonable price but idk that’s my offer
---
Im hoping that raid bosses and vault raids will demand non-power armor. Hopefully. Im running at 560 DR full Sentinel Assassin with dmg reduce perks. Probably a lot more with a vanguard set.
---
But fucking nuke zones man. Fucking nuke zones.
---
You would need a full set of legendary Vanguard or sentinels armor depending on your build.
---
Seen a few so yeh, my mele can go without pa for a while.
---
Read the road map they posted. Some interesting things in the works. 
---
100%. It happened.
---
I'll jump in and add a +1. We had the same experience. Got her down to maybe 70-75% and then we just couldn't go any further. The sonic screeches were fewer, but the mob spawns were greater and she certainly absorbed a lot more of our attacks than before.

---
If they are implementing a RAID as their end game content then it has to actually be a fucking RAID.
---
This is a multiplayer game. It needs multiplayer elements. Group content is required.
---
If you guys keep crying whenever Bethesda suggests that you might need a group to do something then this game is going to die this year. You guys are the minority. There are tons of players that would probably play if this game had hard, meaningful group content. 
---
Believe it or not, people don't play multiplayer games and then cry when they can't do everything solo.
---
Literally any branches or logs on the ground, or wood piles near homes in game. 
---
They can't. If you look every single house item they show on the Atom Shop, you can see through the windows of the model they built that they are always building at Whitesprings for those beautiful money shots. 
---
I play stealth but armour its not really an issue. Sometimes there is no creatures around and danger or cautious still shows up on hud. Sometimes they see me even though there is no chance for them to do that. I think stealth is a little bugged now. It use to work smoother.
---
Perk card slots on workbenches is legitimately 5 best idea i have seen would save having to switch out utility cards, and make it mor usefully to use others bases 
---
Yup this is the perk to get— under Luck.
---
I don't believe making a second account would go against the ToS, but I haven't personally read it so I'm unsure. However, I think you should be fine but that's just my guessing. 
---
And just as a heads up the suspension are only temporary until some exploits are fixed, so meaning you can get unsuspended next week or several months. Honestly, its best to try out other games until this happens, but that's just my own opinion.
---
My melee goes with out pa all day long until there is a sbq... 
---
Still suspended, still no response from my tickets that were opened questioning what specifically caused my suspension. Ignoring tickets in your queue doesnt make them go away. It does however fuck up your SLAs.
---
Fallen trees, tree stumps, go to the to lumber mills, top left corner of map will see u for a good few days
---
To check if it's working note your weapon damage when you are at full 100% health.  Check your effects tab in the pipboy for numerical health numbers. 
---
Then, get into dirty water and let yourself go down in health or drink some toxic goo from West Tek. 
---
Each time your health goes down a bunch, check your weapon damage again and it should keep going up the lower your health goes in increments of 10% starting at 59% health. 
---
Claim the workshop by new gad river in the center of the map or gorge junkyard, they have a wood extractor. 
---
I RP as a structural safety engineer, send me ur gamer tag and ill come see if ur base is safe 😉

thank you, very cool

Its the wasteland....dieing otherwise has no repercussions. It'll teach them to carry more stims or retreat when they're overwhelmed

Tie it to a Recycler perk cark. Rank one gets you bottles and cans from consumables, Rank two gets glass, plastic from chems, Rank three gets casings and lead from spent bullets.

I am on now.

Was in the Whitespring nuke zone the other day and saw a huge camp behind the golf course. "Oh, this asshole is about to get it, I don't even care about a bounty" I said to my friend. I rushed over there, cocked my gun, and set to blowing this dude's shit to high hell.
---
When I got there, I realized there wasn't a single turret. Instead, a beautifully laid-out warehouse with work stations, a decontamination shower, and a large room with at least a dozen water purifiers (somehow set up on campfires to work indoors). It was amazing, and super convenient for dropping off supplies/resting up without having to shlep all the way to the resort.
---
It was just outside of the nuke zone, and I later realized its owner was the one who launched the nuke. He obviously did everything on purpose to give players a safe, rad-free place to rest and resupply.
---
That changed my view on Whitespring camps. I couldn't care less if someone has one, it's the lame turret camps that are an issue. Barring all construction within the WS nuke zone isn't a perfect solution. The best we can do is keep destroying WS turret camps so their owners get the hint that they aren't welcome.
---
Bolstering set with the right perks gives DR of about 600
---
I've never seen a SBQ that was less than 95, tbh. And yes, she's supposed to be tough, but she's not THAT tough - i.e. immortal.
---
The OP is reporting a bug - watch the video.
---
I dont understand why this is such an issue for everyone. When the turrets fire, its a signal that ghouls have respawned and a call for me to spring into action and kill as many as I can. Also, continually closing the backdoor of the club to annoy the CAMP owner is a favorite past time of mine.
---
Yeah that’s what I was thinking, it’ll work fine in daily runs with the right armor but if I want to do nuke zone or sbq I’ll have to switch to a PA build which sucks. 
---
Amazing! Thank you. 
---
Shotguns add the explosive damage to each pellet. Demo expert adds significantly more to explosive shotguns than it does other explosive weapons.
---
With explosives..? 😂
---
I bought a PS4 on Black Friday just to buy Fallout76. I’m happy with my decision and haven’t looked back since. 
---
Oh really I’m in Europe too and I see it :(
---
My though is that they'll link to other camps on the same?
---
Beth has to be aware that our camp placement isn't exactly ideal for trading.
---
That being said, fully expect to see vendor/trader characters dropping their homes in frequently traversed areas. 
---
I'll be coming back for this patch.
---
The same glitch or one very similar is happening to me where a bunch of items I built appeared in stored but they were still placed. I placed one down and sure enough it was a duplicate. Pretty neat. 
---
If you laughed at them on mic while they died, then swooped in for the loots, it’s legitimate role play.
---
other than swaping special points or getting cards, lvls dont mean much. just dont used the lvl ups.
---
though I think the only other thing the influence is the caps you lose if you attack someone first (not sure if it applies if you attack someone after they attack you)
---
Alright guess that's what im doing doing tonight sigh
---
I think her level is always lvl 95. she is harder to kill with more people around, so when a lot of lower lvl players join who either do no damage or don’t even fight her it gets harder. But it doesn’t matter when this bug here appears... then nobody does damage 
---
I had someone do it for me last night but thanks.  Now if i could just get my metal leg deep pocketed lol
---
Hey Cow! Happened to me two nights ago. Scorched Earth failed because SBQ seemed bullet proof. Thought something was not right... But wasn't sure...
---
True, but this is for another of my characters, may have to resort to that though.
---
I plant my base there every time. Best part. No torrents 
---
Why because YOU want it to? Because that is what YOU envision it to be? Because YOU say so?
---
Many of us bought the game to play solo and all content should be available since we paid for it. If these raids were separate content at a an additional cost, I wouldn't say a word, because I could opt to not purchase that content. But if I have already paid for the content, I should be able to play the content, regardless of play style. Even the events that occur allow for individuals to participate as they want without being part of a group (team). I see no need for that to change. 
---
You upvoted a domestic terrorist because him and his friends are the only one using the exploit that we clearly don't know about yet? So hes going to release it because his characters are immortal and he knows how to repeat it but no one else does?
---
Update could Knife Edge be the location of the Footprints?
---
is there a plan for the mothman statue? how did you get it?

Would love to. Currently without power (replying on mobile) but if you have time to check it out before I can get a screenshot, it's in the main building. Faculty wing on the upper floor. office of Michael Blake, language instructor.

How far away from mobs can you use the shotty at range?
---
Every single SQB I've ever done (30+) have been successful. Almost everytime people are amazed how fast she dies. Not always just me but I've done plenty of legit under 2 minute SBQ fights without any TSE or exploit.
---
Are you guys sure you are optimizing your builds? This game is extremely easy and tolerates all kinds of builds for almost every encounter except SBQ. If you are running plenty of armor piercing and multiplicative damage multipliers, SBQ is very squishy. I have taken off large (1/8 health bar) sized chunks per swing.
---
SBQ is kinda hard but it's child's play compared to EQ/ FFXI raid bosses I used to do back in the day...
---
Good point. I'm on the crapper but I'll be sure to message LoneVaultWanderer with my current gear.
---
However, I'm not the guy with PA and missiles haha. Well, I am, but not in these cases. I can't attest to how heavy my armor is but I've got like 14 again, lvl 2 sneak, and no escape artist, plus gear that helps including a "harder to detect" legendary and lots of shadowed stuff. Doesn't seem to matter much as I can get marked as [Danger] while standing still and 100 ft away from a guy facing the other direction that, all of a sudden, turns around and sees me. It's _that_ stuff that makes me think it has little to do with gear and more with just stealth mechanics. 
---
I ran into it three time this week my friends and I were pissed
---
Build a wall with a door frame. Put a wire through the door frame. Might be a little tricky, use extra connectors if you need. Then replace that wall section with a solid wall (I think it's T hotkey on PC, reads as "Replace" or something like that). It will ask you if you want to store, delete or replace the wall, choose "Replace", then choose a solid wall option. 
---
Yeah it's more expensive now because the vendor price went up. 
---
Hell yes. I enjoyed the game in its full bugged glory, tbh, and have logged in every day since release.
---
Sure there was stuff that pissed me off, and even stuff that tempted me to exploit the hell out of the game, but I stuck with it and just had fun.
---
Worth it. The roadmap has me STOKED.
---
I keep finding Vengeful ones and they keep killing me :(

---
And all the other players who don't want WoW style raiding because this isn't an MMORPG
---
There's conduit junctions that you use to get a wire through walls
---
No it's a mutation. Sometimes when you radiation level is too high you have a chance of getting a new mutation that comes with bonuses and penalties
---
No they don't. Most the story is gated behind some tutorial level difficulty group content that can be done with random people and doesn't really require some 24/7 playing to get gear. Take ESO. You have story that leads you into dungeons. These are normal dungeons, that most of the times people don't even care about meta or mechanics.  
---
&gt; Apart from this there has to be a real alternative to raiding to acquire on par equipment 
---
Group content is always harder than solo content, because in group content you have factors that are out of your control. Now why should solo player do less and have same gear as those who do more? This one reason why SBQ sucks- I put hours into making ultracite ammo, spend caps on buying good gear, clear silo and then comes f#cking level 35 with his pip pistol and gets same reward as me. Now wonder people are sitting in shed doing nothing, because why should they.
---
I don't know why you got downvoted. This is a good comment. Have an updoot to get you back to positive!
---
Pa armor only gives you increased carry weight if you have calibrated shocks on the set. Excavator armor is the only one that give you a free +100 pounds carry weight
---
Rip holotape
---
You don't need PA in nuke zones. It's debatable if it's absolutely necessary in SBQ zones, I've managed it with just a hazmat suit. I just wish we could wear armor under hazmat.
---
I rarely if ever wear my PA. Obviously the trade off is needing more Stimpaks/chems.
---
True dat.  I love the smell of burning turret platforms in the morning.  It smells like high level victory! 
---
If you trigger your own SBQ you can position it so the fight takes place outside the nuke zone, fwiw
---
The surface-to-air missiles are the worst for this!
---
Yes, when I load into the game in excavator, I get an extra 200 weight and if I exit the armor and get back in, then I only get the normal +100 weight from the suit.  I do not have calibrated shocks yet which is supposed to give +50 per shock on top of the regular 100.  
---
When I need to fast travel back to base, I exit server and come back in and then it allows me to fast travel at up to 425 weight.
---
Kudos. Great photo!
---
My God. All the outrage over this game made people salty as fuck to people who continue to take issue with it. You guys are a dumpster fire. 
---
It would be best as an option to target or not.  Sometimes you want to aim at a non-hostile player or turret ;)
---
This guy is going to make it a problem just to get it fixed when only him and his friends know how to do it. Maybe they shouldn't keep repeating it and releasing the information and it won't become a problem. Oh wait hes here to release the information so it becomes a high priority problem. 
---
I love domestic terrorism.
---
&gt;Why because YOU want it to?
---
No. Because that's what a raid is. If it's not group content it isn't a raid.
---
&gt;Many of us bought the game to play solo and all content should be available since we paid for it. 
---
And it is. But if you want to do a **raid** you can find a group somewhere. Just. like. every. other. game.
---
&gt;because I could opt to not purchase that content.
---
You can opt to not play group content.
---
&gt;I see no need for that to change.
---
It's not a change. it's the addition of high tier group content. Which is what any mmo **requires** to be successful. And no matter how you look at it, this game is trying to be like an mmo.
---
I have no clue why you're crying so much over the idea of group content. Suck it up.
---
has anyone had any luck finding these at a vendor since the patch?

The BoS material mod for Combat Armor Arms, Legs, and Chest can only be learned by plan, not by scrapping. You can get the BoS material mod (and other material mods) for the Combat Armor Helmet by scrapping any Combat Armor piece (low learn chance though).
---
The idea of scalable items is awesome. Equipping perk cards to a specific station would require a perk system overhaul. 
---
Divide the perk cards up into additional sub categories on where they will be used. Character, CAMP, Workstation, etc. All perk cards still fall under the SPECIAL system. 
---
Perk cards would still be acquired in the normal fashion. 
---
Lock the max upgrade behind a level requirement of sorts. 
---
Player has to upgrade said work bench to tier 3 to use up to 3 stars worth of perks. The same as it is now with perks. 
---
Which they can’t unlock till X character level has been reached. 
---
Well, not much of a loss is there?... 
---
If you're in excavator armor, it's a pleasant bug.  Once you exit the armor and get back in, it should go away.  I is it to fast travel while loaded up.  I hope this bug sticks around for a while.
---
Atom? You must be a lunatic aswell as the others!
---
Also i agree strongly
---
As someone who works in Unity3D and Unreal I can vouch that it is easy to track someone who Dups. 
---
I started leaving my water purifiers unlocked. I always have more than I need anyway, so if someone wants to roll by and grab 8 waters then go ahead.
---
I had the reverse problem, I took over this guy's workshop and I was like 70 levels higher than him and he kept pestering me so I finished whatever the heck it was I needed it for and ended up switching servers 'cause it was so annoying having to wipe the walls with him every 90 seconds.
---
Le Sigh* No
---
Yes pls. Or at least a color coded system or something lol
---
In the Atomic Shop. I forget how much it costs.
---
For a second, I thought this was ridiculous. Then I realized how brilliant it is. Even better if it frees up those perk cards I hate holding :)
---
Again I never said I am a solo player. Your assumption that the majority of players like this or that game elements is just unfounded. Also your assumption that a MP game needs mmorpg elements like raiding to be a MP game is just your opinion. Lots of MP games have no raids or any forced grouping.
---
And looking at the respones here a lot of people play MP games and "cry" about not being able to solo content. 
---
fo76 started out with no group requirements whatsoever and therefore a refusal to implement such thing is highly understandable.
---
oh lol
---
Has to be 1x1 for maximum mobility else just build a permanent home. 2x2 was a hit and miss for me.
---
If you mean when do they change the theme and add a handful of items? That would be on Tuesday same time as weekly challenges switch over.
---
Buddy is still my favorite robot in all of Fallout lore.  I wouldn't mind if he made appearances in every game from now on, like Dogmeat is supposed to.
---
Cool. We just found that one a couple days ago. At first i thought it was a button, but if you zoom in it's incredibly detailed.
---
SBQ is bs content to start with. It's the most boring and idiotic endgame content I had to experience. It is only good as an example how to not do endgame content. 
---
It's a bug 
---
It is not wrong what you say, especially the part that the more players join in the harder it is to kill her. But this bug is real, her health always stops going down at 3/4 at her health bar. I would suggest to edit your comment if you’re worried about karma... because people downvote you really quickly on here. 
---
Saaaaaame. Every single Fallout build I've ever had focuses on getting to 100 lockpick above anything else. But it's just tedious to switch cards for little reward, like you said. I *might* do it more often if it were just a one card swap rather than three.
---
The upper level of my house is like this too actually, has all the crafting stations and a roof but no doors. That's why I make people work to see the downstairs lol 
---
I don't think I have that plan unlocked yet
---
It prolly doesn’t count but I have a bunch of Brahmin in a pen at my camp (fertilizer) just looking to tame some chickens. Why is there no horses in Appalachia?
---
Doesnt matter if they do. Its a legit game mechanic so if bethesda smacks you with the ban hammer they are way out of order. It seems you simply encountered a salty little prick in the wilds lol
---
cosign
---
Gunfu doesn't even work for me anymore after latest patch. Never switches targets. One and done.
---
"salty little prick in the wilds" love it. just fucking love it!
---
There is literally nothing preventing you from finding some players to do GROUP CONTENT with if they added it. And if you don't want to do GROUP CONTENT, then nobody is forcing you.
---
But if Bethesda themselves have said they are adding **raids** to the game, which in literally every other game are GROUP ACTIVITIES, then they should be group activities here too. When people hear raid, they assume it's going to be very difficult, end game stuff. 
---
They even outlined in the roadmap that they are adding 2 content updates for story and other factions. Which is solo content. Raid content should always be group content. I don't know why you''re so against the idea of the game having both solo and group content. 
---
Still works fine for me. Got to love the bugs
---
If you fast travel to vault 76 then take an ambling path north, with wood chuck on, you should get a shit tonne pretty quick 👍
---
It is
---
Cool, thanks  
---
Is that per piece or the whole suit?
---
Why do solo player have to do less to get on par equiment? Difficult and time consuming solo content can or should reward high end equiment.
---
Plus with open world PvP a too greater advantage does not entice fun PvP. We already see stupid things like one shot killing.
---
I am not sure you are getting what I'm saying. I don't want to grind for a week just to get into high tiered raids, why the fk would anyone want that? Don't answer, I know why some want that, the answer hasn't changed in 20 years.
---
Raids should be for fun, all content should. Gear should be a secondary consideration, not the wages of a stressful job.
---
I farm the first aid kit in the Watoga transportation services office, it usually give me between 3-5 stimpacks. 
---
The only time level three lockpicking is at all interesting is to help you skip that one annoying part of the Nuke silo. 
---
Wish there was a location in the game known as The Forest, with logs laying around all over, that can be picked for 2-8 wood pieces each. And wish a bunch of logs seemed to be close to Vault 76, since it’s a free fast travel spot. That would be a dream come true. ;)
---
Like I said, I based it off of what you could buy it for at a vendor. 
---
The submachinegun sell price at a vendor is 1500, 1100 with hardbargain.
---
Kinky
---
Ah true. I have gotten plans.
---
Seems like folks are misunderstanding my post. I understand that you take a slow dose of radiation, even in the X-01. What I'm trying to convey is that I'm taking far greater amounts than intended, even with Rad-X on and no diseases.
---
It was not always like this. This is a recent change. According to those I was playing with last night, I seemed to be taking radiation at about a 4x higher amount than my party members, and I was the only one in X-01. If anything, I should have been taking the least amount of radiation damage. I was having to pop a rad-away maybe every 45-60s and following up with a diluted stimpack because of it.
---
I'll continue messing around and experimenting in an effort to better understand how and why it triggers but was hoping others had some additional insight as this definitely appears to be a bug.
---
;_;
---
Blazemarko99 add me
---
Gamma gun refills their health?  I have one but have never used it.  
---
&gt;Raids should be for fun, all content should. Gear should be a secondary consideration, not the wages of a stressful job.
---
And they are?
---
You don't need to raid in wow to get the best items. But the people who do raid can be in their own league because they put the effort in to manage a group and coordinate themselves.
---
If they put a fucking **raid** in fallout 76 that doesn't require teammates, or tactics, or any thought whatsoever then it's an objectively terrible raid and the game will die.
---
Too bad i have to wait till summer and fall for the fun stuff
---
Ah got it
---
You’re hitting the SBQ with an explosive Tesla when her resistance to energy damage is 300. I’m not sure what you were expecting since you barely see any chunks when you use bloodied melee on her 
---
I build a camp behind the GC to prevent turret farms. It's open, has water, bed, instruments, and workbenches.
---
I call it the Anti-Turret Rest Stop.
---
If there are no turrets, why bother destroying it? You just make those people leave, and then you end up with turret camps.
---
It starts it over, though I want to say maybe in BOTB all the mobs are just going to be high level regardless, at least scorched are fairly weak and can be taken out easier by low levels. I know for sure scorch beasts don’t scale below 50, not positive about their groupies 
---
I stuck around and I really want the best for this game. However I think it's important not to lose site of the fact Bethesda promised the earth with this game yet three months in mob healthbars still don't register damage properly and the favourite wheel can't remember what you had on there from one session to another. So the roadmap looks good but I'll take it with a pinch of salt.
---
Though as an aside it seems that if you reacquire it with a serum made before the patch, it will reapply the old, broken mutation. This may be where a lot of the confusion comes from where people checked their damage numbers and it still didn’t seem to be working. 
---
Or maybe that’s not true either but there are loads of conflicting bits of info floating around. 
---
This was after the price raise..I went on there and said I'm not paying 1850..someone said I can sell it for 700..done
---
Or they could have spent some time actually coming up with an engaging storyline as well as built a game (that was actually entertaining) around that storyline... and then the few remaining players wouldn't have to resort to griefing/building behind the golf club/etc. to extract some elements of fun out of the turd.
---
You're silly 
---
Aw jeez you're right! I guess I can't be excited when a game studio announces updates to a game I like to play!
---

I am on PS4 and have recieved a full duplicate set of Raider Power armor that I owned one of, about a month ago. I have also noticed that if removing an armor panel and then placing it back on the frame, the game duplicates the panel placed. If you look away and then back at the frame inventory it settles back to one panel eventually. I have not been banned due to my duplicate Raider set and had no intention on duplicating it in the first place, it just showed up in my carry inventory one day.
---
I asked the question a little bit earlier, why does it bother you that people can enter a "raid" alone and maybe clear it? In what way does this have any influence on your gameplay experience? 
---
It is no different. It's just butthurt whiteknights that complain about it.
---
Wild Appalachia is not a vague dream. It's content announcement. Why do you have reason to believe that those features will not be actually implemented in the game?
---
Great idea, the chance should be small, and the legendaries could scale with the lock level. So the ones requiring 3 lock pick could have a chance to spawn 1-3* legendaries. 
---
Solo'ing a silo without great gear or min-maxing isn't easy.
---
But FO4, 3, NV, they were all easy. Didn't make them meaningless. 
---
Your conception of MMOs is highly limited based on what was distilled, and thereby ruined by WoW and EQ before it, but mostly WoW.  
---
That game is shitty and shitty people play it now, having driven off anyone who wasn't hardcore long ago. 
---
Lots of things can drive MTX. New solo content, easy but co-op required content, new changes to bases, new social elements, new areas to explore, new PvP, seasons play, etc. 
---
Raiding as a requirement for gear will drive off far more than it will attract or maintain, and it's a dev cost sink to try to make challenging. It's the reason why WoW's systems got overhauled twice only to be more bland. Nerf everything, nerf it again, then nerf it some more. Just an endless cycle of nerfing and altering gameplay just to thwart people defeating bosses too easily. It's a trap, and this game will absolutely die if it tries it.
---
I think you're taking the definition of "false" very liberally. They did specifically say they were rare items. I'm sure they did more than just use a simple select statement (mine was made in jest). Probability would factor in far more than a simple tally. The acquisition of say 100,000 Ultracite within the span of 30 days is probably so minute that it would be humanly impossible for someone to acquire such vast quantities. This can be applied over a number of items and would result in a very high probability of catching individuals who were gaming the system. For instance, let's say it was programmatically possible to acquire 100,000 Ultracite. When you factor in the human, you realize they would have to spend X number of minutes playing the game. Let's say, for argument's sake, that X equaled 40,000 minutes spread over 30 days. That's 22 hours per day. It is highly unlikely that a single human would be able to accomplish such a feat.  It could, however, be accomplished by using computing methods available such as AWS to programmatically cheat the system. Either way, the individual would not acting within the spirit of the ToS. Bethesda isn't going to outright tell us how they ascertained cheating, but I imagine it's quite a bit more than a simple tally or select.
---
To be fair, they’re not updated until they are actually published to the live game. 
---
Either way, it’s still nice what they have planned. 
---
Trying to stick around, harder to do with everyone I play with leaving the game. The group I am playing with now has merged with two other groups and is now "allied" with another group. The concurrent player count is differently at an all time low.
---
&gt;But the people who do raid can be in their own league because they put the effort in to manage a group and coordinate themselves.
---
gtfo. just go now. game would be better dead then taken over by a bunch of twitch elitists who can only think in black or white.
---
I don't farm it either. I might do one or two silo runs per week. Far less than my shopping trips Whitespring.
---
Wow, good to know.  Would love someone to 2nd this.
---
&gt; Is hating on gaming now more popular than actually playing them?
---
Some YouTubers have realized that it makes them quick money, so they keep spreading the hate.
---
We are just the clean up crew for the real best and the brightest lol
---
That's a great idea. 
---
It could work. 
---
&gt; Many of us 
---
What many? Mice are big too...if you compare them to ants, but when you put mice next to a elephant, they are small. Same is with F76 playerbase... its a f#cking small when you put it next to playerbase that loves challenging endgame content. 
---
agreed and I have the same feeling towards raid endgame content :)
---
Have an upvote for the posting the only reasonable comment in this idiotic thread.  
---
If, say, I find a camp and an extractor on one of my steel or lead deposit sites, I move on and do something else, or switch servers. These assholes in this thread want to ban people because they feel entitled to farm a location. LOL.
---
Perk sharing only works with base Charisma. Boosts don't count.
---
Trolls.... Trolls everywhere!! 😂
---
Been running smoother, plans are fixed so no more needing to server hop to find them. Couple other QOL improvements. 
---
Well, to be civil, I will explain my thoughts on the matter...
---
The reason why the roadmap got me excited is not because I think 76 is/ was a hot pile of garbage and Bethesda is going to fix it. I personally really like FO76 quite a bit, but I was starting to get a bit worried that Bethesda was going to be abandoning it. Now that is seems clear that Bethesda is not abandoning the game any time soon, I am very excited. I am guessing you think the game is pretty bad. If so, no, I do not expect a roadmap to change your opinion. That is fair. Some do not like the game, some do. I personally do like it.
---
With the extra food and water that is being consumed and add in the parasites, it makes you're consumption rate go up way more. I remember getting parasites before and not having to consume so much food and water. Even with the speed demon mutation.
---
Then 2 patches ago something was added in and not mentioned. Now you have consume so much water it's ridiculous. With no mutations or diseases. 
---
I carry disease cure all the time since Bethesda actually fixed the reduced weight for them and other things. 
---
So parasites are working as they should but at a much higher rate than it was before. 
---
As much as I would support it... the greens of Whitespring make an amazing lawn for making a fantasy 50's style camp.  But yes, NO WHERE NEAR THE CLUBHOUSE!!!!!!
---
You'd have to have a jet pack or be willing to destroy a wall to get into my base, the only externally accessible door is on the 3rd floor. The 1st floor has a powered door but only powered from the 3rd floor. Security is by design, its a roleplay military base.
---
But, then, why don’t I get the “I’m sorry, Dave” interface?

Most the golfer ghouls spawn near the rental homes in whitespring

Not sure if this helps.. Sometimes my ps4 camera mic stops working. I have to actually power down the ps4 and reboot instead of "rest mode" or "restarting". It forces everything to reboot and then my mic is back to normal.. 
---
A couple I had joined with once made me my first Excavator PA set when I was very low level. They gave me a PA when I joined them and then asked me to keep it. After the quest, I returned to my CAMP, deployed the PA, and lo and behold, another copy was still in my inventory.
---
&gt;  chassis (I don't know how to make that word plural.)
---
Plural of chassis is also chassis, but pronounced differently.
---
Don't see how it affects anyone? I mean, they had to change workshops so you could claim/contest then from anywhere, because people were building unbreakable structures around the workbench.
---
Yup. Thought it was great until it keeps logging to the same sever over and over with same message. Manually disconnect shut down launcher and restart solves the endless loop.
---
7 prewar dollars = 7 cloth = 7+ Civil war tophats = 245+ caps at vendors

This happened to me as well. It was about the same health as the one in your videos
---
It actually works normally 🤷‍♂️
---
What thing?
---
Also note that wearing PA cancels the effect of yout pocketed armor.
---
Thank you.

I learned a thing. 2 points! Here’s my location. I’m on Xbox. (https://imgur.com/a/rFPT4O9)

We've done something similar and did a reboot of the Xbox(s) on a few occasions. Most of the time quitting 76 and relaunching fixed it.
---
I thought I saw in the road map a feature to rename items. 
---
Your 30% dodgy perk doesn’t rapidly recharge your AP (and your AP will deplete) while you’re being hit, wearing assassin/*/powered *and moving*
---
It does when you’re in weightless/*/powered and *standing*.
---
My video is just a small moment within thirty minutes of multiple people pounding on it with everything and zero change in the health bar and the SBQ not moving at all.
---
I think a lot of people are shouting "bug" beforr they are considering the level the SBQ spawns at and the weapons they are using against it.  A level 95 SBQ isn't going to show any damage when you're using a pea shooter on it.
---
It's in there but setting out 4 or 5 sets of PA all the time has been killing me. Just venting I guess. 
---
How to use Imgur to link a photo. Someone asked me where my house was when I responded to your post last night but I didn’t know how to add a photo. 😅

If you block them you will never be put in the same server on subsequent logins.

Makeshift warrior helped a lot, only 1 repair last night.

I've been using my atoms on paint but this I want.
---
Beautifully-stated
---
They are $48.79 for a US code.
---
Yeah, that's not true at all. Us high levels farmed WS when we were lower levels and we did it without building those annoying turret camps. Just pop a couple of shots into the ghouls and kite them towards the robots or some high levels and they'll mop them up while you still get xp and loot. Or go stealth and do it the hard way. If you can't farm WS without a turret camp your build sucks, period.
---
Also, the vast majority of us high levels don't care what level you are, quite the opposite, actually. If you're level 150+, levelling up is no longer a thing that happens constantly, so we do our best to help the low levels when we aren't busy nuking places.
---
I have played against a level 50 SBQ, so no, it's not always a 95.  But if there are high level players when it spawns, it will be a high level SBQ.
---
Not a SBQ, but yesterday it was a level 10 super mutant that wouldn't die. Health would decrease to 0, but it wouldn't die. It was much more an annoyance than a risk of death.
---
Right. I didn’t realize it’s not necessarily the lot. Ok. There’s a good chance this option remains valid then. 
---
Only problem is, again, that it’s reactive. You only activated after someone made themselves known to you. And you’re dead in those times where the way they did it is through the ancient art of instagib.
---
First batch of new content starts dropping from March 12 and goes up to May 7, followed by two new batches in Summer and Fall.
---
I’m enjoying the people saying that my build isn’t optimized or that I’m using the wrong weapon. That’s fun.
---
Why should you get to prestige five times when other players to do the same would actually have to start off at level one being weak little sponges several times while you server hopped to nuke zones in power armor and a two shot rifle?
---
It’s driving me insane to sit there and turn a SBQ run into a flora foraging run.
---
God you sound like an absolute moron.
---
An intriguing theory, I like it.
---
But also we need wastelanders so that we can have settlers to rule over ;)
---
If they can clear it solo then it isn't hard. A raid is supposed to be hard even for a group of people to clear.
---
Mega sad
---
The game is actually bad... loading screen for days despite the devs telling us before release it would be a “ seamless” experience.  And many other bullshit that I have to question if it really took 6 years to develop such a flawed game. 
---
When you pay 60$ for a product you expect it to be honest and finished.  
---
Not bullshitted and half assed much like fall out 76 lol.  
---
You people really can’t deny this game was bullshitted and half assed because everyone knows it is.... I mean Todd  won’t even say a word and he is probably hoping people forget.... trying to redeem the brand with “starfield” and I honestly hope they do.  I hope they make one hell of a comeback with that game.   
---
For me it was at white springs, I walked in and immediately saw a glowing snallygaster, which died immediately to the assaultron. 3 minutes later I found two level 42 gangrenous ferals. Tried to run to safety but died immediately.
---
Overseers camp or the forest in general
---
There's a hell of a lot of shilling going on. Enough to drown out any criticism and make things appear contrary to popular opinion.
---
I asked this earlier and my thread got removed by mods, so you should probably look elsewhere. Dont want to spend $60, then not enjoy the game
---
Because in solo it is only up to you and if you fail it is on you to try harder and better, but in the group content if someone else other than you is failing, you can't make him do better. If player aims bad, I can't make him aim better. So in group content I can be stuck in situations where things are out of my hands and I can't do nothing about it, but in solo content I can, because it is up to me. 
---
How do you get enough acid to smelt all the lead ore.  I currently found a nice place at the hemlock he's where a Grafton monster and 3 snallygasters always spawn every time you load in.  Before that, it was searching for axbro cleaner.
---
Can you pacify him? 
---
While you're at it, make it so crafting nuka grenades gives you a cap after crafting it. A nuka cola goes into crafting if, after all, and you can hear the sound effect of opening up the bottle while crafting the grenade.
---
Damn. I dont think it's illegal asking to buy something on sale but that sucks
---
Depends alot on playstyle, for sneaking leather /wood are the best (unless you get weightless legendary) Chameleon is nice to have on a piece too. 
---
Pure ballistic and energy resistance, marine or BOS combat.
---
Can boost resistance further with bolstering/vangaurd (higher res based on health)
---
Sentinal/cavliers gives straight 15% reduction per piece to damage when standing still or sprinting. There's also one that does the same while blocking.
---
Assassin's reduces damage from players by 8% per piece
---
It really is broken, otherwise it wouldn't be possible to fast travel away while in CAUTION or DANGER. 
---
One thing that seems to be connected to stealth being screwed seems the time of day. Whenever it stops working for me the ingame time switched from day to night. And it will stay broken until I hop the server. Thing is, this doesn't happen on all servers which makes me wonder if the code is the same on all of them.
---
Ok destroying turrets I can understand, been guilty of it before (mainly out of boredom.)  Destroying a camp that is just there and no turrets or defenses?  That just makes you a salty griefer.  I've seen people who build there just because the like the location and they don't put up turrets.  I see both sides of this.  It is pure entitlement to think that you own the golf club when you arrive.  If someone is there taking out ghouls before you, guess what, too bad so sad should have gotten there sooner.  You can always jump servers.  Don't be a crybaby it's only a game.  Save the salt for the steaks and don't forget to season to taste.
---
I love the Mothman urban legend but I can’t seem to find him often or interact with him since he just disappears
---
Is there a quest you have to do before you fight or interact with him?
---
He's really easy to beat. It's like feathers tickling you. I was around level 20 and killed him by myself. 
---
That's what I meant when I said "so long as the other guy doesn't have the right setup."
---
PC and this happens most of the time lately.
---
I had issues beating him at level 40, so YMMV.
---
Yeah, just make sure to have the double animal material perk that makes it possible to find 2x scrap from animals which helps. You have to find 50 bioluminescent things from the local fireflies
---
We end up using party chat. It just works. The in game voice chat system is hella buggy.
---
Maybe, but not in this case. I witnessed this several times and it’s been reported several times... I just thought that this has been patched, since they changed something with the SBQ as it was stated in the latest patch notes. 
---
As a level 20 those turrets saved my life :(
---
Nice!  I never thought of that. 
---
I am sure the fact that she isn't moving at all should at least be looked at, no point in defending the game when there is clearly more than one problem in this video.
---
Probably auto scales depending on your level. 
---
Legit sellers usually have it for $40. If you find it for under 25 it's probably an illegally obtained key and I wouldn't risk it
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asd5dl/psa_to_fix_missing_atom_shop_itemstextures/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
I have not seen someone complain about the build yet, but someone talking about the weapon I told them... She isnt even moving let this be something to get fixed in general.
---
Plausible.
---
Nevertheless a proper scaling system would be highly more desirable than just a group requirment.
---
I guess lots of people know the pain of rushing trough a dungeon with a group because everyone else did it already a thousand times and the only incentive is grinding the boss for loot. Imo that is bad endgame content.
---
Damn. I have 28 and some odd cents it's just I figured taxes and shit would be 3$+ I guess I'll delete the thread

XB1?
---
On PS4 drop your psn and ill add you in a bit
---
Yes, you should be able to LOCK things in your inventory so it can't be dropped, scrapped, traded, or sold to vendors.  Just having that be "favorited" items would ignore all of your armor, mods, etc.  It should be a Lock / Unlock for all items.
---
damn sorry ps4 forgot to specify that 
---
It's just the devs finding and nerfing the exact things we actually find to do in this boring game again.
---
Whitesprings, kill loot.
---
Queen, make immortal
---
Ranged, shit plz.
---
Stealth, nun for u.
---
Hoarding,not happening.  Love that limited stash.
---
Crafting, see above.
---
Exploring, see above and add bs weight limits, with costs to travel if you manage a work around
---
Bankers, unless you duped, limit sales to merchants
---
Rare item hunters, nerf basic world spawn rates to once an fing day.
---
It seems to me the games so broken that the only way these devs can justify their jobs is to go out and neff/fuck up functional parts of the code under the guise of "patching".
---
At some point they're just going to have to come out and admit that the game engine, it's very foundation, was never ment nor able to work as this type of game.
---
That point will also be when they close up servers too, so not holding my breath.
---
What we have here IS the state of the game.   It's not ever going to be  "fixed".
---
Fair enough.  Like I said, I've seen it when there's a lot of lag in the game.  Definitely a server performance issue. But it's not exclusive to the SBQ.  People just notice it more because it's a critical enemy.
---
PC. 
---
No worries mate
---
I don't understand what are you trying to say?
---
I recharge AP same fast in crouching as I do in standing up.
---
I lose same amount AP while sprinting whether I use Weightless or Assassin armor. So you lose your 30% avoidance same way in Weightless as you would in Assassin.
---
I have been reward the Pink hat after launching a nuke
---
That is so sick!
---
We meet again...
---
Super jazzed about this post, thank you much for the info! 
---
So your upset that rare monsters are rare?
---
Ya, its about the only thing the gamma gun is good for lol and if you get a ghoul slayers gamma gun you can have a little immortal platoon with you 😂
---
I'm assuming I won't be banned since it is only one chassis, but you never know.
---
Or even crazier thought...don't be such an entitled cunt.  It's a game.  Calm down take a deep breath and server hop.  Don't be salty.
---
Gladiator?
---
I know singular chassis is chassee but how is it pronounced plural? Chassees?
---
If you have a hunger or water draining disease, I.would hope that you find the game challenging! Just carry a few antibiotics or disease cures, and about seven food and water separately for every few hours of gameplay.
---
Yeah. I’m 100% sure the SBQ was bugged. Let’s say the sbq is ‘landed’ for 10% of the time. So that’s 3 minutes of me sequentially hitting with my grog axe (inc 40% increased power damage). 
---
First (bugged) fight, her health didn’t move.
---
Second (non bugged) fight, I did enough damage in one ‘landed’ period to notice about an inch a worth of her HP had dropped purely due to my damage.
---
Fight was just bugged yo’
---
Hopefully Anthem turns itself around like FO76 looks to be doing. Though I do enjoy looking back on all the rage quit posts and people saying they're going to get Anthem because Beth rushed out an unfinished game, bugs, yada yada.
---
I'm not sure if they purchased Anthem because of stupidity, irony or if its plain old fashioned karma for bashing FO76 and praising an unreleased game. Some people never learn to be patient and see how a game release unfolds.
---
I don’t suppose you’re on xbox and willing to sell your plain white one?? 😂
---
Any fallen log
---
Can’t add you, a message pops up that you don’t take friend requests. My psn is rammsteingeorge. Iam on in the Next 30 mins! 
---
its because the devs dont like us doing decent dps so they nerf everything
---
Can you tell me exactly what Wild Appalachia will entail with its content addition? If not then isn't it quite literally a vague dream at the moment?
---
The picture in the middle of the shrine should be the Lighthouse painting because the Landview Lighthouse was a place of worship for Mothman and it has the “Path to Enlightenment” Quest
---
Apparently some people think the fusion cells that powers the laser weapons was close to ending the resource issues that lead to the war but the US was to greedy to let the tech spread.
---
and them some think the enclave was inside China and other nations the same way it was in the US and actually launched the nukes to wipe the world clean and rebuild it in their image.
---
We probably won't get any real answers unless they make something like Fallout: Before the Bombs.
---
I have had to server hop a few times to get a quest to appear again when it disappears from my pip boy. I have heard that sometimes you need to go back to a prior location to get it to trigger the quest again. 
---
You'll have to look deeper into the lore of the other games in the series as well, that's not really a viable theory. Most Theories conclude to possibility being Vault Tec starting it all. 
---
Hmm. I am not entirely convinced thats a good think. Is the reality of such a situation just frustration? I know the pain of PUGs and it isn't fun for all involved most of the time. The lack of proper ingame communication (Textchat) does not help either. 
---
T60.
---
Carry weight remains constant. 
---
Carried items jumped 200lbs in value
---
Excitements fine but theres a brigade of folks here that are like "OMG THANK YOU SO MUCH BETHESDA! I CAN'T WAIT TO GET ON THE HYPE TRAIN AGAIN!!!!!!!111" Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me y'know.
---
TY for the link!
---
Optimisation isn't necessary in FO76, and there's no wrong weapon. If you're having fun, then you're the one that's right :)
---
That's how VATS worked in the other fallouts... Or that's my experience of it
---
I forgot my setting are different than others
---
No, the Stalking Mothman always runs away at half health. You can fight any other ones you find in the wild (Vengful, Albino, etc). As for interacting? You can’t unless you do the “Path to Enlightenment” event that sometimes appears at Landview Lighthouse, but even then you can only interact with the Wise Mothman that spawns there.
---
PA also raises your strength to 10, unless you have higher that that. So if you run a perception/agility/luck build it may increase your carry weight. 
---
Excavator (when all pieces are equipped) give +100 carry weight, paired with 2 calibrated shocks gives another +100 so your looking at ~+\- 400 carry weight
---
All other PAs will not give you carry weight bonuses outside of 10 strength and calibrated shocks ~300 max
---
700 Atoms
---
Use two doors until the design flaw is fixed? One to enter and one to exit
---
I don’t think so. I’ve tried
---
Still looking?

Damn. 😔 
---
Happened twice yesterday. PC.
---
I feel your pain, man. I quit playing around the time I posted this. I absolutely love the fallout series (fallout 3 is my all time favorite game alongside Oblivion) so for now I'm just taking a break until I see improvement 
---
Been doing Whitespring nukes for the last little bit. Every time we find a base we don't even bother with the current wave of ghouls, we will destroy the base and grief the dipshit player until they leave the server. 
---
If they do their best to ruin experiences for others then I'll be damned sure to make them never want to log in again. At least that's the hope
---
Kind of disappointing considering how cool they made Point Pleasant and the Mothman Museum.
---
Are the vengeful and albino ones just random encounters?
---
I was on xbox. Sorry for the slow reply! :)
---
I know am kinda late,but can I have one ?
---
I saw it posed by someone else that we are actually the very disappointing offspring of the “best and brightest” - spent our childhood smacking radroaches and disassembling toasters, much to our parents chagrin. We’ll never live up to Vault-Tex’s aspirations lol
---
No not upset at all. I was just curious if anyone else has never seen mothman or a sloth. I understand that they are rare, I’m just surprised I’ve never seen one. 
---
Sounds like you build bases there and just can't stand being called out for screwing with other people's game experiences. I hope we've killed you, destroyed your base, and griefed the shit out of you for being there
---
OP is going to jail.
---
Imigine fallout with freinds some survival aspects and you only lose scrap when yoy die
---
And wave goodbye to all mutations for nearly an hour.
---
Not being able to jump out of swarms at ws during a Nuke run?  Fuck that noise.
---
If you've played Fallout 3, 4, or Vegas, those are it's immediate predecessors and most similar games in themes and gameplay. There is no perma-death.
---
Multiplayer in 76 is interesting. I mostly play alone but it's nice to have the option to join other humans during special events or occasionally stumble on someone out in the wilderness. Most people are friendly but there are a few bad apples.
---
Nukes are end game items to summon the Big Bad.
---
I enjoyed the game but its felt like Beth has been busy sucking the fun out of it with each patch to turn it into a grind for bullets and caps if I'm being honest. Maybe the new content will change that, as it stands though the core loop now frustrates me rather then being enjoyable. 
---
Yeah
---
Lol, if you need to set static turrets in order to level up then you're playing the game wrong. Or you just suck. 6 of one probably 😉
---
Same with Stalking
---
That’s the whole level 25 suit
---
SigmaX_kz101.  Adult and chill.
---
it feels like every game presents a new theory as to how and why the bombs fell, maybe only one of them is true, maybe all of them are true, and maybe none of them are true, we might never know.
---
One of them says the Vault-tec CEO is responsible. One of them says that aliens may be, at least in part, to blame. One them suggests tensions over the Earth's resource shortages (mostly power) were what led to the global war and thus the global nuclear annihilation; A resource shortage that, ironically, might have been solved by the small-scale fusion power cell technology that emerged just a short time before the bombs fell. 
---
I don't think we'll ever know for sure until the creators decide to let us know. Personally i think it's probably a combination of several, or even all, of the reasons we've been given so far, including some reasons we haven't yet been told.
---
- gladiator:)
---
When it happens to me I go and loot everything from the meat piles in the area in order from the first to last kill. The corpses tend to change into piles. Just drop the stuff you dont want after taking it from the pile.

Well aren't you just a pleasant human being.  Give me what I want and to hell with the rest of the players.
---
Have you considered you are not as important in the world as you think you are in your own mind. In case you need help, you aren't.
---
If you need to farm mobs with turrets to level then you just suck at playing the game, simple as that. Go back to Roblox
---
Are you fucking kidding me? They have release dates for all Wild Appalachia content. OF course they're not gonna spoil the actual quests. They also said that next week onward they'll start revealing more info about the new content, in detail.
---
Read this if you want to know more about the content: https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019
---
Yes.
---
Part of my endgame is interrupting bitches and making them lash out because they’re entitled punks. Hope you’re not on Xbox or you’ll be wasting a lot of your time while I laugh at you
---
Use powered doors, and pressure plates
---
And I love the smell of whiner tears while they cry about something being unfair to them. Get over it junior
---
Buy those mods and trade in the marketplace.
---
I have you tagged as being banned? Were you and if so are you still?
---
I don't know wtf people are talking about with sneak not working.  The only Issue I've had lately is that for some reason there's a lag in between when I sneak and when the hidden/caution/danger display pops up.  Aside from that every time someone complains that sneak is bugged or not working or not working as well I'm here with the maxed sneak and escape artist walking circles around everything with caution barely popping up.
---
This still happening?
---
Ah, OK.
---
China.
---
I did. Too many sites, a lot of them from the beta, and not the most comprehensive. Hard to tell what is accurate and what is not.
---
Thanks!!!
---
Can you do t51 jet packs?
---
They appear to still be broken. 
---
I can remember when we were supposed to get a Christmas event as well, how'd that go?
---
I think that could be the core of what made it's launch so Rocky. It's easy to plug elements in to pre-existing formula and call it a game as so many other games do. 76 went for something unknown, it was risky, and best them up. I still don't think we will know what it is until these updates come out. We'll have retrospect to understand what it is by then.
---
It does work with boosts and I’ve had a similar experience. Have 3 charisma and I can add magnetic personality 2 and share level 2 perks but not level 3 perks despite having a 9 boosted. It looks like I’m sharing it but it removes itself after  a few seconds. 
---
I'm on PS4 and need to launch a nuke too. I'm in 
---
The only way is to rock some weapon weight armor.
---
Two pieces does the trick nicely
---
I thought it was because humans put too much faith in technology, and lost compassion for each other
---
You remember this is an alt. I have time, patience, and enough laughs to watch you try lol. You’re my you, not a griefer. I own you. You’ll only get to because you have my permission. Otherwise you’d be trashed. 
---
Have fun crying in your game
---
No we were not. There was no announcement.
---
Hahaha on my alt I didn't unlock any of the perks
---
I think that awesome but what's with the whole mothman thing? I saw mothman prophesied in the movies and that kinda sucked. The moth gives nothing good except ballistic fiber and its easy to kill. I think Bethesda likes it more than the player base.
---
That just has not been my experience. Every time I'm at whitesprings it turns into a race to tryand hit anything before a lvl 150+ runsthrough and actively tries to block shots and steal kills before I can hit anything. Thats the meta as of right now. All the high lvls have one shot weapons so they run throughand fight eachother over kills so I never can kite, take shots at or usually evem see a live ghoul before the place is wiped out 
---
I recall an inside the vault that went "Look forward to getting into the christmas season with Christmas themed challenges and events!" At the time people were concerned it was going to be lunchboxes as they had their tags changed in the esms, do you not remember this or am I crazy? 
---
I did actually want to put the Lighthouse painting there, but that piece with foundations and benches predates the shrine and now it won't let me select and remove that other painting for some reason. Can't delete the foundation either because the stairs to my house are on it. :/
---
I also haven't played for a couple months (I tried but couldn't stomach the instability anymore). I was chuffed when I logged on yesterday and found we can adjust/disable depth of field on Xbox, I don't know when they added that. I found it in the display settings on accident.
---
Also client stability is great now but the servers are still ass for me, I get disconnected about every 30-40 minutes so I quit trying to play after the 5th crash.
---
yeah I am mutated, I still don't understand why it's so low when all my other weapons are still doing their regular post nerf dmg. It is probably to do with adrenal reaction tho, thanks
---
OP are you serious? I really dont think that sub is toxic at all.
---
Any examples?
---
yep ill add you in about 15mins and you can join the team whats your psn?
---
wild, might try that
---
awesome ill add you in about 15 mins what your psn?
---
Thanks but somebody snagged it for me!
---
I'd love to see that sometime in the future! Take my upvote!
---
I actually had it separated in several sections and it posted it as a fucking wall...go figure.
---
&gt; At least he’s trying to redeem the brand with “starfield” and I honestly hope they do.
---
How can you redeem a brand by inventing a new one? How does *that* work?
---
Thanks for the suggestion. Any idea if you can use a pressure plate with the key code door? That would be ideal.
---
I might just have to. Appreciate the suggestion!
---
Title says low effort, weak understanding of english.
---
"why enemies ARE buffed to..." and then you weirdly capitalized Oblivion when that doesn't really make sense as a figure of speech in the first place.
---
You're not even providing any sort of objective determination of what you consider artificial difficulty.
---
They're not too hard for me, maybe you have the wrong build or don't know how to get strong legendaries.
---
Yes, Ive seen it done, pressure plate on the inside
---
It's effectively the multiplayer version of Fallout 4. 
---
What it does right (in my opinion): 
---
\- Open world exploring and dungeon delving.
---
\- The chance to explore the Fallout Universe with friends.
---
What it does wrong (according to the internet):
---
\- Removed all human NPCs
---
\- Implemented broken PVP system.
---
\- Implemented broken Perk Card system based on Fallout's long standing S.P.E.C.I.A.L. System.
---
\- Mashed together story line that doesn't hold up one little bit when you look into it.
---
\- Not released as a multiplayer mod for Fallout 4 first to help prevent the cluster that it is now.
---
Do I enjoy the game yes. I play it because I like it.
---
Will you like it? Hard to say. I like survival type games that make it difficult on the player. FO76 just doesn't seem to get it right.
---
Bethesda just released a Road Map for the game this year that focuses on the next 3 patches. It looks promising.
---
So in a nutshell, FO76 is an open world game with survival elements in a shared world experience. You have to be online to play. You can play with or without your friends. There are no specified servers. When you log in it just assigns you to a random server. 
---
Shared world is not an MMO. You can have around 30 players per server at anyone time. The world is static and stays the same for everyone. Very similar to how the server work for the game Destiny. 
---
Had the same thing happen last night. Even with a dozen of us lighting her up the health bar never moved past a certain point. Frustrating as hell.
---
Yes, use the plate inside the building
---
90% of my post was examples i don't think you know what that word means.
---
You are crazy. Here's the ItV from before Christmas, and the last one in 2018.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6Gmr5HkkEgOY2k8qyey4M8/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-december-19-2018
---
They only mentioned that Christmas themed photos by players would be shared on twitter. The only Christmas themed content was put in the Atom Shop. Atom Shop items, as far as I can tell, have not been announced beforehand till now.
---
I've had him spawn at my camp 3 times this week! 
---
I AM LATE TO THE PARTY BUT WE NEED ANSWERS!
---
Im glad I left, and just came back. The game runs smoother, QOL updates are great, and im coming in reinvigorated. I didn't sit through all the crap, thankfully, so I can experience a better game now without memories of frustration. 
---
Very nice! You’ve definitely used the frames more than I have, I usually forget about them 
---
Is this 4 hours per day or per play session?
---
Most enemies deal regular damage, so I would say that heavy polished/alloyed metal armor is the best. It has awful energy resistance, but you can counteract that with the grounded mutation. The only downside to heavy metal armor is that it costs screws to craft, and the heavy armor plans are very rare. So far I have only found the heavy chest piece.
---
To balance the game. Happens all the time we are not gods. We are regular people in a nuclear waste land the enemies are baked in radiation and mutations they should be beefy bois. Its not fun to kill things in one bullet nor is it practical for the lore super mutants are big and bad they can take a beating and dish it out. Scorched are just people and they die quickly. Mole miners are mutated and have mining gear thy are a little tankier. scorch beast are big behemoth mutants they should be hard to kill. 
---
I killed all the turrets on someones camp that was right outside the backdoor. It was just a tall platform with about a dozen turrets pointed at the clubhouse mowing down ghouls. They weren't even around to collect the loot from their turrets doing all the work. Sure I got a big bounty on me, worth it.
---
I am choosing 35 people over 1, that is more selfish than you wanting to game stay bad so that you could enjoy and 35 could not. What makes you so important, that you are worth of 35 people? 
---
Hownny add me
---
LMAO you do not own me, ass hat. Nice try. Have a fun time being griefed! :D
---
jxc0187
---
It makes me feel like i have some sort of super human genius IQ because it's all so predictable to me; you play the demo's for both games and the overall quality should be obvious. How are so many players pretending to be surprised.
---
Like the other guy says; youtubers farming hate.
---
Do you now have the Grounded mutation? It halves energy weapon damage, which the gauss rifle is. Also adrenal reaction is broken. 
---
Those disconnects are on you. I, and many others have no issue now. 
---
Oh I do. You replied. Come get some. Prove me right
---
Kinda like Pebbles the cat???
---
I had to put up several of those posters in my C.A.M.P.  and that's only because that's the name of my dog. (She is a Yorkie and in my defense my ex girlfriend's daughter named her. It was supposed to be her dog but she never did anything with it and I ended up walking it and taking care of it and it bonded with me). 
---
Unique quest rewards drop at your level, but they are all inferior to the best legendary items you can find. I would work on the main quests at whatever pace you feel comfortable with.
---
Possiblyissue with your system. I have never heard of nor experienced an issue this severe.
---
I've only experienced one nuke since patch and I had no issues with it but it was in an unusual place (grafton) so I'm not sure if that would effect anything.
---
Haven’t actually logged back in but definitely will as this nee roadmap drops. 
---
I suspect there is new management in place and the first guys/gals got the axe. 
---
Hopefully the new leadership will get this back on track. 
---
I've been hitting that old possum too hard I guess
---
we3jesters
---
I did think it might be, figured i would ask incase though
---
I like how there are responses during trading with people, like too expensive or want more or less. Anything that improves on player communication is helpful.
---
I'm just curious if it has, like, it's own chance of calling him. Like it's being multiplied by the Mothman Week chance so people who keep messing with the statue are getting him more often. but I don't know.
---
It all started when Vault Tec sent out power armor helmets in plastic bags instead of canvas, and the overseers went completely batshit.
---
Thank you for explanation! Very helpful.
---
Break all their legs and you're sorted.
---
How often is one able to get mutated? I jump into toxic water naked and get a mutation, but if I cure it, I can't get another until the next day.
---
Yeah reddit formatting is weird, you have to use double-spacingwith enter to make separate lines
---
Let's see, I recently jumped back in and here's a decent list of things I've noticed: Camp items show owners name and icon, hovering over a player on the map shows name and icon, you can fast travel to any player for caps, known plans are labeled, smoother all around, workshops show players name and icon, stash limit is in a sweet spot (opinion), less "hitching" when interacting with objects, quicker load times. It honestly feels like 76 1.5 with all the improvements, a much better game then when I left it. 
---
Same. What I did is uses Good With Salt (Luck perk that extends food/drink life) and jumped servers until I ended up in another session where the event was running.
---
What about yellow?
---
Where did you come up with 35 people? 
---
Also, game is not bad.  Game is great.  If you think the game is bad, try another game.
---
Honestly, I've never seen a yellow-eyed version &amp; what people have said about it is contradictory.
---
The Bethesda brand.
---
When I eat canned dog food, I expect to have an empty can at the end that I can scrap. I'm not a goat, darn it, I'm not eating the can.
---
I helped someone beat it earlier, but it was already attacking them so I don't really know how it behaved before. Oh well.
---
A lot of that stuff are normal suggestions for the game. How are those questions toxic? 
---
besides that, who says reddit should be fun only? Do you think Bethesda reads here just for fun? Do you think BioWare is extremely active in the Anthem Sub just for the laughs?
---
And where do I check if my game is using the high perfomance nvidia graphics setting then?
---
No worries! I am viewing on mobile so it may be me. Enjoy the trip!!
---
Praise Him.
---
Praise Him!!
---
Pack rat is better, as it allows you to carry lots of junk you need for crafting, and can help you carry a lot if there isn’t a workbench to scrap at in your vicinity.
---
This happened to me the other day. Everyone was getting frustrated and just started going after all the other scortch mobs
---
Excactly the same - what’s up with that?
---
Yes ! This happened today ! SBQ dropped abou 10% of HP and then stopped taking any damage. We were about 10 people trying to bring her down, her HP didn't move.
---
Go to the folder where 76 is install. Right-click on the game icon there, and hover over something like 'Run with...' with two options under. One of them will be marked as 'default'. See if it's the High Performance Nvidia Graphics.
---
Sorry but after 400 hours played and at lvl 189 I think i have the right to be a "god" in the wasteland, or at least be able to kill a lvl 16 super mutant in one hit. And what about melee? Nerf melee for christ sake. And unless you were cheesing the game with melee, scorchbeasts were hard to kill. Took 20-25 shots with a TSE handmade post TSE nerf.
---
Can't you buy Grenade ammo from most vendors?
---
How pathetic
---
My base is in the same place and I’ve had to fight the vengeful mothman like 3 times this week on logging in
---
The problem isn't bases with turrets.  The problem is bases with missile turrets.  Those are annoying as all fuck.  The MG turrets are simply tagging the enemies and also often grabbing aggro to one spot to make them easier to corral and kill.  This doesn't prevent lower and/or higher level players to get the kills, at all.  In fact it creates a safe zone for the newbie players you are professing to want to help out.  The new players are more likely to see lots of XP by just tagging the aggro'd mobs than they are when it is done your "legit" way with guys in PA and legendary melee weapons going around 1 shotting the mobs (this results in zero XP for the new players as I'm sure you understand).
---
All insults aside, I absolutely don't understand your argument that destroying these camps (with the exception of missile camps which we can agree are the devil) = helping new players.
---
I maintain that this argument is simply used by people who would like to destroy some camps but also want to feel they are on the "right" side of things and not feel like guilty raiders in the eyes of the community.  So far there hasn't been an argument made to really contradict this.
---
There is nothing wrong with raiding the camps for raiding's sake btw, it's part of the game.  But pretending to do it for "helping da newbs" is smoke and mirrors.  The mechanics of how the kills work are clear, and anyone that has ever encountered MG turrent camps in WS knows exactly how it actually goes down.  There is no need to act disingenuous.
---
Yes you can. I just got a cool vampires cryolator and auto launcher.  I know before I had these I threw out a ton of both ammo so I figured I’d ask. 
---
A drunken bet. 
---
Dude 1:"Bet you can hit that launch button with a bottle of nuka cola" 
---
Dude 2 "You're on what do I win if I make it?" 
---
Dude 1 " more beer" 
---
Dude 2 "I'll take that action"
---
BOOOOOOOOOOOOM
---
Dude 1 and 2 " oops"
---
Never seen sloth. Seen mothman 4 times this weekend. Hunt for him in the north of Grafton.
---
Thanks! I took the advice of some of the posts in here, I added more lights and worked to make the interior better fit the theme.
---
See the link I dropped in the comments for the images.
---
Oh no, that cut so deep I'm not sure how I'll recover. Guess I'll just go destroy some more turret bases to feel better 😉
---
I looked at your examples of what you think is toxic for both anthem and fo76 and I have to say you seem to think opinions are toxic(I'm guessing the opinions are different than yours).  There was maybe 3 headline examples I saw that I agree with(like the one demanding bethesda fire everyone and hire new ppl etc).  But giving an opinion like - Graham is an example of why we need more PC's is simply what someone thinks. Its not toxic. Or that a refrigerator or fusion core schematic would be cool.  Ok. Thats like...just a regular opinion on something people think would make the game better.
---
Toxic to me are posts that dont bring anything to the table.  Some of the "why bethesda is a terrible company".  But I also throw in posts by people who defend bethesda.  I dont think writing up 5 paragraphs of why you thinkBethesda is doing their best is helpful or advances anything, just filler.
---
So ok.
---
thats my opinion, guessing you consider it toxic which is to bad.
---
Zetans.
---
she should absolutely be fought out in the open and players in the bunker / on tanks will cause her to not land and keep flying 
---
Awesome profile pic 👌
---
So this happen to me the other day when I selected to try and finish the Overseer's quest line. Turns out I had already picked up the holotapes and just needed to listen to them.
---
At the very least, give us an option to program our VATS to toggle what we want to be a priority and rearrange them as we see fit. Example of what I would set mine to:   
---
First: Enemy units  
---
Second: Enemy structures  
---
Third: Neutral players who've already instigated their slap damage  
---
Forth : Neutral NPCs  
---
Fifth: Neutral Structures  
---
NEVER: Teammates, Mission objectives, players in pacifist mode, event only teammates  
---
Sooo neither that sub nor this one seem especially toxic. There are individuals who chose to come here, to Anthem’s sub, or even r/fallout and post to hate on the games. But they’re just individuals yelling. If anything I am starting to wonder if there are people who just make up posts about games just for attention or because they thrive on negativity.
---
And a lot of what you cite as negativity are just player suggestions. I’m just not seeing it.
---
It says it suppresses mutations but it doesn't. Marsupial jumps are a really easy way to test it
---
Fair points. I can't say I completely disagree with you. I personally think that I already got more than my money's worth out of the game (granted I only paid $40, but I have gotten about 200 hours of fun in before it became to be a big grind). Hopefully the updates will be good, but who knows at this point? I am personally glad to just see some good -looking- updates coming. I will try not to get my hopes too high.
---
Most of these posts ignore this type of thing, which is why I believe it is just a bunch of BS and these people just want to break some stuff but are upset with getting the Wanted status for it.
---
"They hurt me so I hurt them back" Sounds like a 5 year old who cannot solve their own problems
---
I used to live by there on the golf green, but I ran into a lot of enemies and disliked how often the greenbrier was nuked. I’ve since deconstructed my camp and moved south. 
---
I’ve built my little cabin just west of uncanny caverns on the side of a road in the woods if anyone wants to visit me! 
---
&gt;Do you think BioWare is extremely active in the Anthem Sub just for the laughs?
---
Do you think Beth's Dev. team needed reddit to tell them to add camp decorations? It's baby sitting but the echo chamber will still pat each other on the back. I'd rather they employ for programming content than ads and Customer Service.
---
Check out the Warframe subreddit and tell me: when is it ever too petty? You post here instead of the official forums simply because you're allowed to be disrespectful.
---
I really have to wonder now if companies are paying PR firms to run “negative ad” campaigns on social media. PR companies certainly won’t be honest about what they do, so I dunno how we’d even find out if it were happening. Would be nice if somebody leaked it and confirmed it for us all.
---
Wouldn't destroying their base be solving the problem? Solves my groups problem every time, that's for sure
---
It's at Site Alpha on the shelves with fallout 76 colors/icon.
---
Yes, I have to say I admire that you acknowledge the realism. The radiation would have no affect on how many survive or if they could even reproduce. I mean just look at Chernobyl, that worked out perfectly and while that would produce different isotopes than a nuclear bomb, I feel the effects would be similar enough that they would not be “beefy bois”probably closer to, disproportionate masses that live for as little as a few hours after birth.
---
That's funny! Seriously the 76 subreddit has to be THE most toxic community I've ever experienced! Even the Rick and Morty fandom at the height of the Szechuan/Pickle Rick shit was a freaking paradise compared to most of the people on here!!!
---
Great, and the plans don't appear to be populating in vendor inventory.  Would be nice if they fix this.
---
Yes!
---
This how stupid F76 playerbase is:
---
"If you think the game is bad, try another game "- Players goes play something else.  
---
F76 players:"[why\_i\_cant\_see\_stronger\_players](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/au7tvl/why_i_cant_see_stronger_players/)?"- Well they are playing other games.
---
And when you switch the sides:  
---
F76 player:"We don't want challenging content", "We don't want PVP"  
---
Players:"If you don't like it, try another game"
---
&gt;Shout out to the trolls who wanna hop on here with their crappy "insults" and what not.
---
Proceeds to call them names and insult back. How about you learn to solve your problems instead of trying to hurt those who bug you? 
---
I play odd hours too! Add me... Bethesda username is jgourley
---
At this point this must be implemented as QoL change, at least for crafting cards, because they just waste time - switching them in, just to craft something. They would make sense if perk cards couldn't be switched, and crafting builds would be essential to player economy. But for now they need to be removed or reworked. 
---
Right because there is no other solution than hurting those who are bothering you.
---
Light ya light his holy beacon with the radiance of the fireflies
---
More than agree. Doing event Bots On The Parade is pain in the ass sometimes not to mention farming nuked zones and having melee players in front with my stealth vats range build.
---
It’s a mess. You’re welcome. 
---
Don't make up a false narrative.  This isn't in any way *cheating* and you know it.  Confused?  Send an email to the Bethesda customer service to ask if this is cheating and post the response.  You won't because you already know it's not.  But it sure does sound more dramatic to call the people playing in a way you don't approve of as "cheaters", eh?
---
Does it have to always give you stuff to be interesting?
---
I think having the hunger bar full gives you +25% disease resistance.
---
&gt; Damage and maintenance are correlated.
---
No they're not. Certain things cause more weapon durability damage, they also happen to increase weapon damage usually. However, there is no linear scaling or relation, there is a set amount of weapon durability lost per shot and certain legendary effects and weapon mods affect that directly, which has nothing to do with damage. That is a fallacy.
---
A genuinely brilliant idea, would also save the hassle of having to rearrange my cards every time I go home. I say home rather than camp as I feel it’s far better suited to what I feel I have created.  All I need now is a camp budget increase so I can use all of the things I’ve paid for with real money in the atom store.
---
it is the most time up :/
---
Man what the hell. The one time I fought a guy we went back and forth a bit over the workshop till one of us won it, exchanged thumbs up and that was that. Guess some people gotta make it negative.
---
I have to wonder what these people are like IRL and sports. Is there a bunch of angry weirdos glowering on a basketball court constantly getting dunked on out there somewhere?
---
Yeah, rarely do players travel over there.  But it is quite nice in that area and not uncommon for CAMPs, since there's a big lake nearby.  I thought about building a lake house in the middle of it once, on that rock outcropping.  It was too difficult though, and I didn't care for the increased travel costs to... well... pretty much everywhere compared to where I am.
---
I noticed this too, my old 51b armor took much less radiation then the x01 i just started using.
---
:(
---
Don't get upset that people use established game mechanics (destroying bases) against other game mechanics (building bases) as a solution. They have no more right to a server than any other player on said server does
---
Yes as a matter of fact it does. They force it down your throat I want something for it. Answer your question? 
---
I have crouched down and waited literally for HOURS, and the \[Caution\] never ever goes away, and when I talk to the Master Sargent, all he says is well well.  I've completed all the courses.   If any one knows a way to clear this, it would be greatly appreciated.
---
Yeah, that broken in patch 5. They are still in the Grafton Rail vendors levelled lists, but they are not appearing for sale in the vendor's inventory in-game. Nobody knows why, or if this was intentional or an unintended consequence of the changes from patch 5.
---
I don’t destroy turret camps to help anyone.  I do it to send a message.  Earn your XPs like everyone else.  Once you screw with others, well, it’s on. 
---
Glup glup
---
You're asking why they buffed enemies and wondering why you're not a God but also saying nerf melee at the same time? Sounds like your just unhappy you can't one shot with TSE any more.
---
I wouldnt imagine that it would be too hard to implement considering you can dual wield weapons on skyrim
---
What are your play times?
---
Hahaha
---
I'll add you up.
---
Yes they will.  Just reading these threads and the "lol-bro" responses from the camp destroyers, it's plain as day what's up.  But the other side shouldn't be angry it's all part of the game too.  Camps are just being wrecked by raiders who for funsies are trolling that they are not raiders.  Simple.
---
Stands for Freak Out ‘76, it’s kinda like Dance Dance Revolution but it’s all 70’s disco, you can sing or dance and team up with friends to perform. Real popular with older folks.
---
Hail Capitalism. 😒
---
Judging by you downvoting everything I said, and wanting to destruct the community, it would seem you are the one who is upset.

There is a second connection point you attach the pressure plate to,  its invisible. But aim above the doorway and it should snap to it.

So we have to put restrictions on every place where people dont want camps? I dont like camps being build nearby the first overseer's camp. For no reason. I just dont like it. So please Bethesda, please restrict players from building there.
---
I paid so game should be way I like me angry at Mr todd
---
Two incoming damage scenarios: 
---
1. A L52 mr gutsy plugs you a couple of times. You have enough AP, even when sprinting, so you get 30% of it dropped pre DR thanks to dodgy 3. 
---
2. Another player with a rapid weapon hits you 5-10 times over 2 seconds.
---
Rapidly recharging AP while stationary will make your DR eat only 70% of what’s coming, as long as your AP is up. Once it’s spent, you’re eating 100%.
---
Because all this reddit demands is nerfs. First y'all want nerfs to TSE. Now people are asking for melee/bloodied nerfs. Y'all want everything to suck as bad as laser rifles? Will that make y'all happy?
---
I'm sold, sign me up
---
im a full unyeilding and dont use PA at all. die a bunch but my 2k mmgauntlet 1shots everything is more than worth it.
---
Just using random weapons you pick up just to stay alive lol
---
You’re completely full of shit. She only spawns at lvl 95, you’re talking out of your ass.
---
Fuck off. I want to see people own that golf club house and clear the gouls 
---
You may feel this way but the rest of the people on your side of the argument seem fine with wrecking any and all camps.  What if the camp only has 2 or even 1 turret to help some new player tag enemies before high level players insta-kill them with 1 shot melee hits?  Is that deserving to be wrecked?  Don't think so my dude, not by the "Help the Newbs!  Turrets are Griefing me!  Stealing my kills!" arguments.
---
Make sure you have starched genes maxed so you still can use radaway and not lose them. 
---
is he a vengeful one or is he chill?
---
&gt; You post here instead of the official forums simply because you're allowed to be disrespectful.
---
Ehm no? You are not allowed? Im getting the feeling you have no idea what the point of reddit is.
---
Well a level 0 lock, sure. But I found good stuff in some level 3 locks (before I started collecting legendary weapons). The graveyard near Lewisburg has 3 high level safes and I’ve usually had good luck picking those locks. (Though after level 40ish, the rewards aren’t as desirable as they were beforehand). The level 3 safe in the Mistress of Mystery manor usually is pretty decent too, and the clarksburg shooting range bot building are decent. 
---
If its so easy to wreck then what are you complaining about. Wreck it and go farm xp.
---
Yup, got it. Thanks!
---
So it takes two shots. 🤷‍♂️
---
Vault 76 does contain the best and the brightest.  We are the best.  We are the ones chosen to deal with the hostiles of the wasteland.  Now that we have (mostly) done our job it is time for the brightest.  It is time for the NPCs who will rebuild civilization and form communities.
---
YES! I have two "harder to detect while sneaking" pieces and maxed sneak perk. I tested it at whitesprings:
---
* lvl3 sneak only = detected somewhat easily
---
* add one = caution, detected only at close range
---
* add both = hidden all the time, even when I try to be detected
---
It is awesome!
---
Yall want everything. Ffs i have like 20 bundles of glass take it.
---
😏 Melee build over here 👋
---
The first time you visit, you get all 3 quests. After that it becomes a rotating series of 1 per day. 
---
I downvoted 1 comment lol. You're pretty hung up on someake believe points...
---
And yes, you've caught me. I'm secretly an Obsidian employee trying to pull at the threads holding the FO76 community together. Anarchy is all I seek, destruction is my way
---
How much?
---
Ty for that, im still waiting to hear why destroying turret camps at whitesprings so everyone can get xp and legendaries = entitled behaviour. If anything, building your camp at the back door of a well known levelling spot is the epitome of entitled behaviour.
---
I prefer Dromedary. Boiled water is everywhere. With full Dromedary, to purify water will fill your meter. Nuka Cola does the same if you use the cola perk
---
Kys
---
Yeah, you're right but it at least gives them points that are fairly close to their previous locations. And they can use their original elevation and new elevation to see how it's changed. I still think it's really cool that they're in the game
---
Yes. But then again, no
---
SBQ gets killed in under 5 minutes or in many cases under 2 minutes, with quite a few cases of 1-2 players killing her by themselves. early on many players with  the TSE’s literally could wipe and kill everything with 1-2 shots to include other players... weapons got a nerf and enemies got a buff to combat this now players are getting killed and actually have to fight... 
---
Can’t say we didn’t see this coming...
---
There wasn’t even a pile.  Nothing, nada. At least I got the xp.  Back to the grind
---
reset your ini files, when last patch came I was still using the same inis since the beta, I wiped them and iteratively re-applied the changes I wanted. Don't think I've had any CTD since.
---
Definitely.
---
I have been one of the lucky and started playing 6 weeks ago and have experienced very few issues. 40 hours in and struggling to put the controller down and itching to pick it up again. Great community from my interactions so far.
---
Intresting, ive never used mods and i assume unhadnt either,l. Ill give that a shot, thanks
---
I noticed if I log out of Fallout and quit the game and then also log off the console I crash less. 
---
The game doesn’t auto quit and I’ve turned the Xbox on and it’s still has the option to quit at the bottom or it gives you the error you have to login. 
---
Hard reset helps a lot if you play for a few hours. 
---
Not saying this is the golden ticket but it seems to help immensely.
---
What system 
---
Yo, have a good cake day.
---
Ah im on pc so i dont think itll make a diff to me :p added that to the post now. Thanks though
---
Umm.
---
Well...
---
In first scenario: Both of armors will perform same and provide same protection. Both armor will get same 30% DR from dodgy 3 for same time duration.
---
In second scenario: Assassin set will out perform, because when Assassin runs out of AP to feed dodgy 3 (just like Weightless would) it still provides 32% DR, meanwhile weightless provides neither 32% DR or 30% DR from dodgy 3 when you run AP.
---
I’ve just gone off for the night, will you be on tomorrow? If so I’ll defo stop by 😁
---
They reshuffled them around in a patch. You can get them from certain events in the watoga region as well as from the phoenix vendor and the watoga vendor.
---
BoS skin is bugged atm though and is rarely rewarded from the technical plans repeatable quest.
---
Yep venders have them. They sell fast so you need to be lucky. 
---
Someone that chooses to grief and wreck your camp “just because” is different than people settling up with the lazy ass cheaters that put up a turret platform behind the GC.  
---
If you want to level up and get more XP then just team up or go into the club with others.  You’ll earn the XP and more importantly earn the respect. 
---
what do u do for food..I cook soup because it quenches hunger and thirst
---
For the scorchbeast I think the technique is to shoot with a moderate fire-rate gun until it lands. Once it lands, melee especially when spec'ed can be very effective.
---
When doing "mayor for the day" (if you're a melee build, then wait to do that one for a level 50 all rise). spoiler: there's  sometimes a scorchbeast you've got to contest with, while keeping robot from resetting the timer. I straight up ignored the scorchbest while taking out the robots until the timer ran down.
---
This sub isn't really toxic. It's so irritating these kind of posts come up, someone says something negative about the game that automatically means they're toxic? 
---
Also i've been playing Anthem since launch, the feedback there is the same that can be found here. Game has great elements, and some really bad ones. Criticism there is valid as well as the criticism here.
---
Here's something toxic for you: delete this stupid, obvious karma-whoring thread   
---
Pretty sure I saw it at Morgantown station last night
---
I stand corrected.  I looked it up and you're right.  Only level 95.  No need to be rude though... :)
---
This is also not our experience as both me and my friend had “old” serums that we used. 
---
I’m not gonna say there is not some people still having problems after the work around because it is buggy right now but we are good to go. Bethesda needs to fix it, period. Wish everyone the best of luck!
---
What location are you near in the game. Charleston?
---
Anywhere honestly, right now near the vault on the bottom of the map
---
I've always loved 76..I heard anthem has problems but it definitely doesn't seem it is getting as much hate as 76 did
---
Thank you so much, for now I’ve given up on them but using your information I will try again when I get the energy.
---
But you are stepping on people’s toes by taking their XPs without even trying.  I mean, that’s it.
---
Ive gotten to the point where ill call a queen fight when theres like 25 minutes left, If her health isnt down by atleast 25% on her first regen in the first five minutes Im out, I have to farm ammo for a few hours before to have 4-5k 50 cal rounds to take down there and I dont wanna waste my time and resources for a lost fight. even then without a guaranteed 3 star its almost not worth it. One time I got a 1 star Hunters Mr handy buzz blade and a 1 star wood arm lol 
---
Yes indeed, I got the two I was missing in the past couple days from wallace / haprers ferry,

---
Yea but I’ve also dropped a ton in the past and now I’m regretting it. 
---
I'm not on until tonight. I'll see if you are online then.
---
If I want to go into someone's house it's to scrap my junk so I can go back to doing something more productive. Not especially baller of you all to keep your doors locked.
---
It's entitled because you believe yourself to be inherently deserving of privileges (telling other players where they may or may not build their camp, even if the game rules, created by the developers, fully allow them to) and special treatment (hey I wreck camps but treat me like a white knight of camelot doing a community service, not as a raider wrecking camps for fun b/c I'm bored).
---
The correct answer to avoid entitlement is:  people build their camp wherever they want, and other people wreck or don't wreck their camp based upon their mood at the time.  This is the behavior allowed and encouraged by the mechanics of the game right now.
---
But pretending to wreck shit and be a hero is just weak as fk.  Own your mayhem!
---
Twice too, both near Pumpkin House
---
Will do! 
---
I am sadly humored by all the crying over this. Destroy them or get over it, honestly. Also switch server? I have yet to see even once someone set their base up and be able to obscure the ghouls that spawn there. And if we remove the ability to build around white springs bunker because of the ass-twattery I’m not gunna be happy about having to find another flat ground with few enemy’s and natural defenses next to me. If people are appearing to build directly on top of where the enemy’s spawn then yeah the area is needing adjusted. But to remove building removes my strategy to save me sum caps when heading to the bunker, sorry your easily fixed by changing servers strategy doesn’t always work, but don’t be hard on building on the golf course cause most of it is empty. 
---
P.s. NUKE THE AREA. Nuking the white spring club house area will obliterate EVERY part of their base, it happens to EVERY TIME you nuke an area and someone had a camp there, justice and revenge. Sadly my camp is again away from enemy’s but close enough that a nuke dropped on white springs golf course, club or bunker blows it up. 
---
note to those building these structures, I don’t believe you receive exp, unless you shoot them at least once, heck rarely even get scrap. And you know for a fact the people go to the specific area to farm exp and loot. It is the number one bombed location. If you are not going to be at the location farming why bother building there? It makes no sense. Tower traps are easily moved, just move it slightly further out of range to help players kill them and lead them to the slaughter, it makes the most sense, so as to not be targeted, and profit best. 
---
But where are the tophat plans
---
So people are willing to forget how they shit on Battlefield 2, or Destiny 2, or Destiny 1. The general rule of thumb is "my dumbass made high expectations from a fucking trailer and am being a whiny bitch about how my high expectations were not met." Entitled cunts the lot of them.
---
I accidentally had mine not played and went through a shower and both came off...lol 
---
Two major theorys seem to be the most likely and that is either vault-tec caused the explosions to basically make a new world (and didnt expect how bad things really got)
---
Or
---
The zetans cause the bombs to go off for their own reasons, possibly to take our planet as their own or some such.
---
Probably a combination of the two since theirs lots of evidence about both being true.
---
At present I don’t think you can. Protected is not working in game and you need that one first before you can get shielded. I’m sure it will be fixed in future patches. 
---
Haha No problem, I feel your pain, it took me an good 30 min - 1hr  to figure out a good way to get them to work.
---
Why do they have to make it so difficult to do the simplest things?
---
No one is here
---
I just got back from put in my eye contacts. I read "This is a bot providing a sacrifice."
---
... I'll be back later.
---
7 flavors. Nika cola, cherry, dark, orange, quantum, wild and grape
---
So your whole meta is that you build around having high AP and its regeneration to feed Dodgy 3. What stops me taking Assassins+Chameleon and use same meta? I still would do what you would do, just also thanks to my assassin+chameleon combo I get extra 32% DR and yet I am regenerating same ammount AP same fast as you do. 
---
They used to before the vendor change. I've acquired them twice, personally. The first was a reward for completing a Brotherhood Technical Data quest the other was found in a decrepit tank outside Watoga. But, no, I have not found them for sale.
---
Lemme kno if u want the serum..I will be on in about 4 hours
---
I enjoyed Fallout 76 for over 100 hours but it is a pile of shit compared to Anthem. It’s not even close. 
---
Nah you drank it, then smashed it on the ground. That is the more reasonable thing to do.
---
Whitespring, lvl 3 lock in wall safe in manager's office. lvl 3 lock in wall safe in the bag check-in room.
---
There's usually something in there to make it worth the effort. I usually hope for a rare weapon or armor to scrap for mods.
---
I don't like Carnivore at all. Feels like a debuff tbh. But I don't want to risk losing my other useful perks by RadAwaying it
---
I experienced this too.. glad it’s not just me. 
---
Since it is an EA title I think the bar was set low to begin with. Bet
---
It's 2.5 hours long.
---
Could someone please offer a TL;DW?
---
(I'm busy playing FO76)
---
I’ll be honest, I bought a Mothman poster and posted on the outside of my camp building wall. After that I signed in the next morning and there he was staring at my camp!!! My camp is in a wooded area south Morgantown Airport.
---
U asking about irl right? If so, all benches will be replaced by a sturdy wooden bench (with a thin metal removeable top cover for welding stuff as and when you need) the bench should be at least 2 metres long so can have space to do multiple things at once. Id suggest a rack behind or several large tool boxes close to bench cos if you wanna do everything we do in game youre gonna need a bit of speciality tooling and stuff. Get a lathe, a pillar drill, a welder (sticks easiest to learn and set up etc but all types have different applications and strengths and weakneses i.e using a stick welder on a very small and intricate machine or piece of work is v difficult) angle grinders of various sizes, chop saws with all diff types of cutting blades, hand drills and any other relvant power tools. You will need to make yourself a forge, doesnt have to massive you can make one with some bricks and a hairdryer, and a flat solid surface for forging on. Unless your thinking of making swords and armor (which i guess you are) a jewellers anvil will suffice but a blacksmiths anvil would be better. All relevant tool. At least 20 pairs of good sturdy gloves. Cable ties etc etc. For power you will probably want either a very effecient generator and solar power panels, for heat you will really benefit from a geo thermal system as it will go forever, costs a lot to set up but would you rather have hot water and an emptier wallet or mucho cash and cold showers? Then stock your bunker with all relevant supplies 👍 i hope this helped.
---
Lmfao ikr what did that come it to? Like almost 24 hours a day since it came out? 
---
OMG that would be amazing!
---
Speaking of trailers, people are getting pretty upset about the comparison of the E3 trailer version on Anthem and the actual version. Pulled some stunts straight outta the NMS handbook, its pretty funny actually.
---
However, since they are in no way cheating in this game, simply playing in a way you don't endorse, then griefing and wrecking their camp is actually exactly the same as doing it "just because".  You're bored and want something to do.  Pretending you are doing your good deed for the day while smashing some stuff into the dirt is fun in a video game.
---
(Please note, that technically griefing others in a video game for ANY reason is usually looked down upon by the gaming community and developers alike.  Your words "...chooses to grief and wreck your camp...")
---
If you want to level up and get more XP, just hop servers.  If you want to level up and get more XP then just make your own turret camp.  Do you see how this works, it's just telling someone how to play because you say so.  
---
Earning respect in this game is a bunch or horseshit.  We are playing a video game.  How much respect are you expecting to *earn* by playing the way you endorse?  Maybe from like minded people, I dunno.  I play to have fun, not earn respect in this game.  To think people that go inside the club to 1 shot things with their bloodied/instigating legendary sledge "earns respect" is completely laughable, stop being funny! XD
---
Listen to yourself... Your actions do not make me angry. They are mildly annoying at best and it's cathartic to break your little base and hear you try and instigate some kind of verbal altercation. I'ma just break your base and move on. 
---
I stand by this as well, I feel even the best pistols in game right now don't stand up to any other class. We need something to make our pistol builds more viable. 
---
P.s. it's 2.5 hours long. All credit to Many a True Nerd
---
The issue is activation.  After activating, you can play from anywhere. 
---
So you can either VPN and activate it yourself or if you trust the seller, they can create the Beth.Net acc for you and activate it in EU then pass you the creds.  Then you can change the password of course. 
---
Nah man, I love my Whitesprings camp. I agree that near the Golf Club should be off limits but the course itself should be open
---
I just found the plans for em inside of a wooden crate inside of the Gauley Mine, don't remember which one though...
---
I have played neither, so I can't confirm nor deny what your saying, but if public opinion is anything to go by then you're probably right.
---
I thought the same thing. Two hours ??  Give me a break. 
---
It also empties room in your stash box, i have just shrunk down 400 points of space by bulking all my junk, plus i notice waste oil turns into bulk oil (oil) possibly others like it but i have only just bought the game, i hope they add a few more resources into the game.
---
Happened to me too. Level 95, and wouldn’t lose health.
---
They pulled their schtick from Ubisoft. Ubisoft is the video game developer equivalent of Expectation vs Reality meme.

---
Nice, now do Anthem and ESO next. Oh wait ESO fixed its own problems and turned into a successful game
---
I got a temp suspension a week ago and can speak on behalf of folks who did not cheat to acquire what Bethesda is deeming “rare” in game items. I was actively selling on the reddit forum. Most often I sold 3* armors that I farmed out of white spring or other legendary wielding events. I made a lot of caps doing this. I believe that’s where my suspension came to be. Many people on the forum have traded with me and added as friend. My GT is SP4RTAN360. This suspension did in fact affect some players who are not guilty of cheating just to clear that up. 
---
Perks unsharing is a bug unfortunately.  Did you also have Strange in Numbers equipped too?
---
They don't get either loot nor xp for doing this and being absent.  Pointless camp.  If you just killed the turrets b/c they were annoying you and the owner wasn't there to farm, then kudos to you.  You showed great restraint that others usually don't feel like showing.
---
As someone who has over 300 hours in the game already, I don’t care what those critic sites say. They don’t determine my fun. 
---
And I'm stuck at work...  
---
Interested in 10 violet. :)
---
Ah, Ubisoft, I completely forgot they even existed. You know with all the trailer bait and switch that has been happening recently it makes me kinda worried for cyberpunk. It would suck ass if the amazing shit from the trailer was just a ponzi.
---
Currently dying from radiation and respawning over and over in fissure site prime because there is no option to respawn at my camp or anywhere else.
---
Thanks. Unfortunately that seems to be the experience for most. Totally random.
---
Where have i told anyone where they can and can not do anything. It seems there is a basic lack of understanding happening here. The people who are building at a well know levelling spot are the ones who are displaying entitled behaviour. Just as you have shown with the statement that you have "the correct answer" 👍
---

Grab concentrated fire and stack blight soup, eagle eyes, and better criticals card and you stop having a problem with pistol base damage.

I have yet to luck out and snag a legendary critical handgun yet though.

How many did u have?
---
I would like to see being able to use a 1 handed melee with a pistol instead
---
That’s trespassing, and you have now been reported.
---
I made this same comment in a text to my friend the other day woah.
---
It's an audio driver issue. If you have Mobo audio, look up the latest version and install it, should fix.
---
Google the questline and re trace your steps back to the last thing you had to interact with regarding the quest and then try re interacting with the current, then try the previous, then try the next step. Mine got bugged out too and thats what I did and it worked.
---
Right, but they do give a good indication of what the majority (at least the majority who wants to give their opinion) thinks of the game. I know the hatred might have been a bit exaggerated but I feel confident in my statement that most people would consider 76 a failure. 
---
I can bet you anything after they stop updating this game they won't try something like this again for the next 60 years.
---
Posted twice on this sub.
---
Now we get to see if they make the comeback that ESO did. Doubt the studios abandon either one
---
People need there workshops defended and hey it pays
---
As long as you get hit markers it seems to have a chance to cripple.
---
Just drink from the fountain at Whitespring to remove diseases. It's free and easy. Or make disease cures (or scavenge them). Also, higher endurance means you're less prone to diseases.
---
I mean, even NMS wasn't abandoned. I hope both Anthem and fo76 will follow in NMS's footsteps.
---
Only way to find it is in protectron vendor bot of charleston station and if u find it (200 caps)
---
I got you for 1000
---
Not sure which video you’re talking about... care to post a link? 
---
That's brutal. Guess I'll never be getting that outfit
---
Yeah I know how to find it but I spent ages grinding and couldn't find it, so was hoping someone could sell it to me
---
This is tough because what if I want to start a fight using vats with something you don't normally fight. I don't want to be SOL in this situation because everyone is using it as a general enemy finder  by hitting a large area with it in hopes of targetting the enemy. 
---
It works pretty well if you're looking close to someone and if it doesn't a quick hit of the D pad takes care of it for me.
---
I sure hope so. In the meantime, use a campfire, it looks dumb, but its better than nothing.
---
This is the biggest fk'ing myth thrown around in these threads.  Nobody is stealing anything.  The turrets take far longer to kill enemies than most players hunting in the clubhouse and area (most will 1 shot them).  If two people tag an enemy it doesn't matter how the enemy dies they both get XP.

Going into 76, I was actually expecting a lot worse, just judging from all the negativity YouTube videos I had seen.  My biggest gripe was just all the disconnects.  I feel like I've definitely gotten my money's-worth; it's the gift that keeps on giving.
---
&gt; Is hating on gaming now more popular than actually playing them? 
---
Outrage has always been profitable.  YouTube, Facebook, Twitter - their algorithms are all based on keeping you angry with a constant infusion of controversy.  And where none exists, the YouTuber manufacturers it.
---
The difference is that the *viewers* of this content started taking it literally and without question.  "If it's on X, it must be true!"  They lack critical thought and healthy skepticism.  They only listen to what they want to hear, and then they go off on these self-righteous crusades to evangelize their beliefs and burn the heretics.
---
Sorry for taking so long to respond we have fireteams of 4 but if you want to add more guys you can but it will cost more caps
---
Any way you can go cheaper?

It sells for 879 by the rare vendor bot in Charleston, spent a lot of time trying to spawn him. Gotta make money back somehow

2 currently. Sunshine and Thunder. Saw someone take 6 in quick succession and they didn't spend enough time at any of them to reap the rewards. Not sure I understand their motive.

Once powered up all 3 power stations and got the workshops producing crazy amounts of fusion cores, whilst holding the ammunition factory too.

Add me and we can squedual were in eastern

Lol.

People building camps where they want = low level dupers now!
---
Hahaha, or maybe murderers and rapists?  Low level murderers and rapists I mean!  Ahahahaha, these arguments are getting absurd :D

Just like you did from this topic? You’re doing a bad job lol. Just admit that I run your life cause I force you to do something and move on
---
The beaver dams outside Watoga are a good spot to get more wood scraps
---
Hm... This is comically sad but it stands out to me because it could be the root of this issue. A lot of my experiences would be explained by the fact that *I* was somehow noticing *myself*, getting into \[Danger\], and then everyone else notices due to my "in combat" status. 
---
IDK how the programming works with the stealth but this could be important.
---
Im not 100% sure i have one anymore but if i have and if you are on in about 8hrs i can sell one for 200 caps
---
He's been working on that video for weeks. It's 2.5h long. It has discussion of almost every mechanic and system in the game. It's good. 
---
Nah, NMS has a small playerbase, I think either one/both will make the comeback like ESO. The main complaint about Anthem is long load times and the main complaint about FO76 is no content. These are both really easy fixes
---
That would be mad helpful, are you EU?
---
Pretty sure it’s the red bridge along the 64. I’ll do some testing. I ran into him on my way out of there early in the game.  
---
As for spawning north of the Charleston station, I can confirm that 100%.  My first time running into him at Charleston was across the north bridge but he had no escort with him so I figured they were hung up on some landscape somewhere.  He was walking in the direction of Charleston though.  Bought the purple ski outfit that time. 
---
I’m all for good fallout content. But I can’t help but assume this will be mostly regurgitations of what we all already know and talk about here every day. That is a long time to invest. 
---
Yeah at work atm
---
By "You all" I beg your pardon, I fucking hated the TSE nerf. Did it need a nerf? Yes. Did I advocate like a sissy SJW? No. Infact I hated the nerf because it was overdone but I got over it. I was mad. Not happy.

Ive done that, just to get a free travel point and get the plans that get awarded for taking it over.
---
Probably by the time he got to number 6, the "defend workshop" event for #1 started, so you can fast travel back for free and do another event to try and get some plans
---
Watch the first 2 minutes and see for yourself. 
---
Might do that. Makes sense actually
---
Yea, I don't go out of my way for it. But if I happen to be wandering past, I'll swing in and do the daily. I'm a former Everquest player who complete the complete Epic 1, 1.5, and 2 quests for every class in the game, so I'm VERY used to long drawn out shit that takes forever to finish. 
---
That's awesome, I'll pm you
---
:)
---
Sorry man, I got booted and just shit down. 
---
Well, in his defense, I think ManyATrueNerd offered the most honest playthrough of 76 that I have seen.  I haven't seen this new two-hour extravaganza, but if it is anything like the playthrough, I would expect it to be candid and constructive.
---
I thought this reddit was pretty chill, especially considering the quality of the game, but then I did CSGO and World of Tanks forums before.
---
Not sure what people were expecting from Anthem. Demo was representative.
---
I don't wanna one shot shit with a TSE. I wanna one shot things that should be one shot (lvl 32 fucking mole rats). And I wanna two shot things that should be two-shottable charred ghouls, which were human (just like scorched were?). And I wanna atleast maybe three shot lvl 48 super mutants. NOW WITH ALL THAT SAID! WHAT ARE THE ACTUAL NUMBERS LIKE? 2 shots to kill a degenerate mole rat, 3 shots to kill a ghoul, and 5-6 shots to kill a super mutant. If you think this is ok for a guy who spent 400 hours to get the most powerful rifle build possible, suck a wet fart from your grandpa's arse. Also you still haven't touched on the fact that Melee is allowed to one hit, but not rifle? Where the fuck is the equality in that you hick?
---
Stay away from my fusion generator and decontamination shower! I'd love to share but the amount of trolls I've came across, I'm not trying to spend all the materials again. 
---
I do, however, have a sign advertising the free water from industrial purifiers and lead from an  extractor!
---
Your right, I should have said "In my opinion".  Can't argue with that.  But by that rationale you saying "The people who are building at a well know leveling spot are the ones who are displaying entitled behavior" is just as entitled.  Or we can just agree that we are expressing our viewpoints and didn't explicitly indicate that's all those statements were.
---
But you did say that building in a certain spot is entitled behavior.  And in general it is commonly understood that entitled behaviors is a negative trait.  So it's not unreasonable to understand from your post that you are telling people where they can or cannot build (hence you are telling people where they can or can not do something).  
---
Dammit. I really want those so I can write down the pin number for my keypad door.
---
Majority who want to give their opinion does not represent the actual majority. Think of yelp. More people go out of there way to talk bad about something then those who want to say good about something. Those who enjoy things just enjoy them. 
---
What’s wrong w/fusion core regenerator? Lolz it beats the pvp lines for the plants.
---
Before I click the link, do you think it's any good? I really liked the "Fallout 3 is better than you think one". His points were very spot on.
---
No false, LVL 48 mutants used to take 3 shots which I was fine with, to an extent. But now it takes 5-6 shots which is motherfucking downright outrageous for a guy who spent 400 hours to attain max rifleman build. 
---
Your list of what you seem to think is toxic is ridiculous. You seem to think people having an opinion and sharing it is toxic, and by your own definition that makes you and this post toxic.
---
You might want to sit and think about yourself and your ideas a bit before sharing them, your head seems full of contradictory hypocritical bullshit, sounds toxic honestly.
---
That’s my spot... hopefully your are not on Xbox. 
---
They used to, but I haven't seen them since.  They do show up as random plan spawns in the world.... and probably Workshops too.  I recall getting mine from one of the substations, not that it helps.
---
I’d be more stoked if I had that much faith in Bethesda actually delivering on what they say. Keep in mind that just because it sounds super amazing doesn’t mean it will be implemented and be super amazing. The thoughts that we have are likely to be different than how things will actually play out. 
---
I’m near there I’ll stop by 
---
This guy has some good points here.
---
The reason why SBQ can be killed that fast is because cheesers do a bug where it forces SBQ to land/stunned while landed. Then all the melee fuckaroos will whip out there bobbleheads and chems and 3* all-rises and go ham on the SBQ doing THOUSANDS OF DAMAGE per hit. Also this wasnt asking about SBQ this was asking why things like a lvl 32 fucking mole rat get buffed.
---
I've had lots of fun playing FO76 as well as FO4. My concern is with getting to understand how to play 76 to the full, from chosing the right perks to how to obtain gear and plans. Byt l'm still playing daily. 
---
They've changed this for players in events. Can't target other players during uranium fever &amp; scorched earth events. Maybe more. 
---
I think it’s kinda clear that he’s the hyper toxic one, and just doesn’t realize it yet.
---
You asked about enemies... they buffed them all for the exact same reason and nerfed weapons the same regardless of what enemy you face and at most levels. 
---
Look at all the posts about it...
---
Maybe I'm not clear.  I'm talking about a Lv. 16 Super Mutant.
---
Makes you wonder if the people posting are shills?   Makes me wonder...
---
People play eso now?
---
There was not even any options like that, I tried to google for maintenance framerate issues, and I got this vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJzgi3w5KVE
---
and even that video couldn't help me, I mean, everyone can keep telling me that it's "my computer" that its wrong with, but if I can run Apex, AC: Odyssey, and millions of other games perfectly fine, then I'm PRETTY fucking sure that it's not my computer, and the asslickers UP in here can sit the fuck down.
---
This post got 100's of upvotes "Bethesda needs to hire new people" = toxic.
---
Reddit is for fun and organizing; if you want to LARP a beta tester go to Beth official.
---
not that much lol but I think at the time it was like 90 days old or something so 10 or so hours each day.
---
I *think* I had eight once. Not that I claimed all of them, but when someone in your group disconnects, it makes it easy to accumulate problem children.
---
I think it looks great too, but they really need to be careful when rolling any patches and content out. I can't even play, unless I go back to melee, because the damage bug is back... and I'm not a melee fan. 😔
---
I saw that camp
---
I thought this said "urban wave" and was like what the fuck is that supposed to mean lol. You can expect it to be the March update. Possibly when they fix duping fur sur so they don't have repeat offenders
---
Yes it was needed, because you’re trying to act like you know what you’re talking about and give advice on something you have no clue about. We need A LOT LESS of that on this sub.
---
disease cures are super easy to craft ..so I never really had an issue
---
Mods don't give a crap. Wish they did. 
---
Even so, needing to expend two rounds on a guy 170 levels under me is re\*arded.
---
That is impossible. You must be looking in the wrong place.
---
It's a temporary suspension . .....   sorry.  Haha
---
Nope, but Class Freak III. (?)
---
I think he is a bit misleading to suggest that the community doesn’t discuss the deeper issues of the game as well. Im sure this will be great content for the average 76 player. But IMO many on here are aware of and discuss the deeper issues. 
---
All rise is only 2* bud
---
If the history of this game has shown anything it is that Bethesda will "fix" the problem by just making it so White Springs just doesn't spawn ghouls when nuked, thus "solving" the problem.
---
If there are two fixes to a problem and one makes the game better and the other makes the game more of a grind, they seem to always choose the latter.
---
Dead civil war reenactor random encounter.  Run south on the road from point pleasant, two possible spawn points there, a third one close by the overseers camp.
---
Can find union/confederate uniform/hat plans, civil war suit/dress plans, and the top hat plans (last three all valuable and cheap to craft). Got lucky the other day and found the marine tactical helmet too which is another good money maker. 
---
Because I already have 5 points in perception and there's no way to respec
---
Umm... Shouldn't this be a more on the Anthem sub? 
---
Umm... Shouldn't this be more on the Anthem sub? 
---
When the turrets at my camp kill things I get loot. Is that because the server specifically spawns them to attack my camp? My camp otherwise seems to be away from normal spawn locations.
---
The fact a small factual error is the biggest counter argument you can come up with shows the lack of intellect you melee builds have. Oh wait what am I saying, of course it's so. Your Perception and Intelligence points are completely MIA in most cases.
---
Xbox- three scorched earth events, not a scratch on her..
---
It always seemed pretty bustling whenever I logged in when I played and actually had praise and awards lol. Much better than when it released. They boast some insane numbers and pvp seems pop locked on some servers
---
Guh, I'm lucky then as I still get sneaks 2.5x damage modifier even when I'm perma[CAUTION]ed.
---
I'm on ps4, I didn't realize that sneak was *completely* broken for some people :(
---
I agree
---
https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Toxic
---
No every discussion is toxic. Maybe you dont agree with the OP, but that doesnt mean it is toxic.
---
Thankies, wasn't sure which location you meant.
---
"bud."
---
I've seen several out on the grass before but this one was built as close as they could get it.
---
I did this solo once but it was kind of a pain, a team is very nice!
---
I guess you are right
---
Well that's good to know at least. Yeah it's odd how the fix seems to work differently for some people. 
---
I donno, everything I've read or seen about FO:76 is pretty damn accurate.  I've been having a decent amount of fun with the game but the 5 or 6 out of 10 scores are pretty spot on.   I would have been pissed if I paid full price.
---
The exploration and building is what I spent a lot of time with in 4 so I knew I would be at least okay the game play loop.  A lot of people really hated that about 4 though and any long time fans of the series ended up disappointed.  
---
I honestly just don't like Anthem's aesthetic.  It has that generic sci-fi look that seems trendy these days (see also: Destiny, Warframe) and the bottom line is that it's hard for me to identify with a suit of robotic armor.
---
I'd say the same thing if 76 forced us all to play in Power Armor.  It doesn't do anything for me.
---
How much is it / how much to craft?
---
Umm... Is the problem location? It's not hard to find people in high traffic areas like around watoga station, Whitesprings or Flatwoods. 
---
This game is dope..I'm approaching 400 hours..it's addictive and has a ton of content..last night I was on a team with someone from Finland and the UK and was asked if I completed a specific quest..I said no..and they were like ok..let's do the quest for u..most the ppl I encountered in the game are mad chill..and there's even a trading community..if u like grind-style games ..this one is a no-brainer..I'd suggest for u to ignore all of the negativity and check it out yourself..every other game has been put on hold..there was a lot of crazy releases recently and I have passed on them because I'm pre-occupied
---
Lol man im just counting
---
And what it supposed to make anyone here believe you and your crew is actually good? Or just some squad I could take on 8v1?
---
Naw I was just ~~talked~~ lied into it by the company itself and a die-hard fanboy irl friend of mine.
---
Again, never preorder a *Bethesda* game again, they straight lied about what this product would be.  Fool me once shame on you, won't let it happen again.
---
Just had fight with SBQ, me and 2 strangers  (all 100+ lvl) did as much damage as in OP video and quest failed... she disappeared. 
---
In addition I playing solo, last two days I was collecting codes, hunting down cargo bot with keycard launched nuke, took fight for half an hour and in the end I failed quest, and of course had no reward, very disappointing :(
---
It looks after last updates, no matter how many stars legendary enemy i kill, max legendary item i got is 2\* if i am lucky.
---
Like just repairing the pipes in time! Homeboy was a pro tho and got me thru in a heartbeat. Complicated mission!
---
Cold spear sounds like a Cold Rock knock-off i.e. Ice cream shop. 
---
Damn thanks man! 
---
I usually use the marine tactical to trade but that one sounds good too
---
Spawn your base and go hide in it 
---
Honestly I’m about to stop playing until the next update too. Under no circumstance should a game of this caliber with the anticipation everyone has be released this broken. No other creator would do that, they should atleast create a way of compensation to players that have had to put up with all their laziness and lack of attention to detail. And they should buy me a new controller and patch my wall lol
---
Yea it was right up there with just a row of turrets. Kinda pointless. I have one on the lawn first by the tree with the robot in it and then I moved it to be next to the bathrooms. Full crafting, bed, music, water, all unlocked and open. 
---
Although I can't know exactly what's going on there, it's possible?  Also some enemies drop minor loot (meat, or glowing mass) no matter if you tagged them.  But major loot in general doesn't populate on the body of an enemy who died and you didn't tag at least one time.  Plus if the turret owner is away from the area a long time, it's arguable if the corpse pile will still be there when (if ever) they come back.
---
Nah!
---
Good job on the documentation. Hopefully they look into whatever the hell is up with the SBQ.
---
My experiences with the SBQ had been wildly inconsistent. I've have times where she took so many shots that both my heavy weapons broke, other times she's dead before I even reach the event. Just yesterday I joined a SBQ event only to have her fly half-way up to the damn Robco Facility. After about 15 min the event gave us a marker showing her new location and we all had to high tail it over there to finish her off. 
---
Ok buddy.
---
I'd like to see them at some point.  I don't think anything on the roadmap suggests it's coming soon though.  Honestly, I'd much rather have garden plots than a distillery.
---
Grahm sells the Small Letters Set. Saw them on him last night. I've also gotten them two times so far from claiming workshops.
---
Do you know what a menagerie is?
---
I have raider shielded. After loads of grinding, I ended up getting it on an alt as the quest reward from the first Rose mission. And I did not have protected on that character beforehand.
---
This is why we can't have nice things...
---
Got the game about a month ago and im obsessed tbh. Hardly have any issues at all, literally. Xbox player.
---
Unfortunately, I'm on Xbox, so I can't mod yours, but if anyone on Xbox does need it, let me know.
---
The keypad doors can open both ways if you add a pressure plate or switch to the inside. The door has two wire attachment points, not one. You attach a wire to the electrical connector on the back of the door to power the keypad. Then you attach a second wire to a pressure plate/switch and then wire that to the door itself (I target the keypad.) You can then use the pressure plate or switch to open from the inside.
---
For someone who loves 76..and similar sandbox rpg games..u think I might like anthem..it's seems to be next on the purchase list for me 
---
I just started playing recently and been having an okay time with the game.  I think the game's score of around 5 or 6 out of 10 is a pretty good representation of it.    I would have been totally pissed if I paid $60+ for this game though.  I got it used for $20 and I feel that's where they should have price marked this game.   So I can see why people are angry at BGS for releasing this game in the state that it's in.  
---
I'm interested in the road map and hope that it leads to a game that would be worth it's $60 price tag.  I'm mostly interested in the Waste Landers thing that they have set up for the end of the road map.  I wonder what they will be adding with that.  We don't know anything about it yet so can't hyped but hopefully they will bring out something cool with it.
---
Wow are you on pc ?
---
m8, ini edits and mods are two completely different things
---
Yeah, i thought some mods edited the ini or something. Again i havent modded 76 at all so i got no idea
---
It’s pretty stupid how you can have 15 players all level 100+ with good weapons and builds and still not be able to get her down. someone nuked prime and we just couldn’t beat her. I broke 3 weapons and used up all my ammo for my primary’s fighting her and the other 10 people that were there couldn’t even Fucken get her to half health it’s not the players fault because some of them had explosive weapons and a damn mini nuke but she just absorbed everything. Right now I’m not going to bother nuking prime until they do something about it. 
---
I owned them all once (except the ones that the monsters took over because I too many concurrent defend / reclaim events). The secret is to play on a server long enough until it stops taking new player connections and all the existing players leave. Then you have a server to yourself, until it shuts down for maintenance anyway.
---
The fact that your still crying about tse nerf is funny. Can you prove this queen bug is not Bethesda fault? I've seen the thing where she gets stuck but she still barely gets killed everytime I do scorched earth. And I love it when people get upset that someone points out a simple mistake. "Bud" was not meant as a attack. Just what I call people. Lol
---
Yeah literally ridiculous lmfao
---
No, what we need LESS is the stupid exaggeration over some misinformation/misinterpretation. He admitted to be wrong, but still you trash on. Same thing happened to me the other day bc I wrongly suggested that bobblehead stacking is back, bc I got nearly killed by another player without fighting back. Got downvoted into oblivion and lost 20 karma, even tho I edited it that i was wrong. THIS drives me 100 times more crazy, seriously folks... this is a very toxic place! 
---
I'll present a number of these different ideas to the team so they can get an understanding of the varying opinions on this issue. Thank you everyone 
---
Lamentably, I'm on Xbox.
---
4 plastic 1 aluminum
---
Tip: Prepare to get kicked off ya server at times or die and respawn on another server thereby losing all ya loot... Also if you ever partake in the Hunter/Hunted mission..if you get killed your gonna lose any scrap loot/junk you havein your inventory...
---
Oof, Well what are the mission you go through do you recall.
---
Oh and I run a tse build too.
---
I always upvote for any MATN content! Love the guy
---
SLA?
---
Lol, damn. Is that with contractor perk?
---
I’ve had the exact same issue ever since the B.E.T.A.  Since the last patch I have had it come back for the first time intermittently. That gives me hope they are working on the problem. 
---
I’ve also heard PC players mentioning having an issue with their friends list syncing. Since this latest patch I’ve seen this friendship syncing error message for the first time. Who knows. 
---
What’s that
---
It just needs moved back out of aggro and turret range. Let people build on the green and the outskirts. 
---
Had the same thing. One of them is marked with a diamond for you
---
Reduces material cost to build camp stuff
---
K
---
Unless something broke since I got them (which is entirely possible), neither of those claims are accurate. I got protected fairly early, and the character that eventually got shielded to drop didn't know protected.
---
Yes please
---
The same thing happened to me it gave me 60 and I had to figure out which one I could use
---
PC. I've got it decked out. 
---
I'm about half way through it, and it's excellent so far. Jon's video essays can be listened to as you would a podcast, but the video-part is also super-entertaining. You can tell he has put a lot of thought, time and hard work into this one as well. Quality conentent as expected from MATN!
---
It was the very first mission for Rose, I don't recall the name for it. But it must be a rare random drop, since I've run through all of her missions on five characters, and loads of raider area events, and only ever had one plan.
---
How much ?
---
For some reason going in power armor makes my strength go down, I’m on Xbox
---
People on here really don’t want to see that this game is dead. 
---
The people setting up turrets are effectively “owning” an area when their turrets kill mobs and deny EVERYONE (including the owner sometimes!) their xp and resources, unlike a fight down on the ground where most people can get a piece of the action.
---
And using a “everyone can play how they want” argument is kinda weird when you’re complaining about some people want to fight mobs in the gold club without turret bases auto-clearing them.  If you’re adamant about people getting to play how they want, then don’t complain that a lot of people want to take out turret bases by the gold club and fight the mobs themselves!
---

If you watched his FO76 series, I was actually part of his team in the final part. 
---
of duping
---
Are you on pc?
---
Maybe you shouldn’t open your mouth about things you know nothing about. I mean you’re literally getting mad because someone else is mad you fed them incorrect information. It’s not all about you fool, your misinformation is wasting people’s time and maybe even efforts when they act on your misinformation. 
---
Yeah I’d say charisma builds hopefully will become very viable after they introduce raids but sneaky sniper might take a hit.
---
why not both.
---
PS4 😬
---
Can i have a set of modified x01 power armor?

Service Level Agreement. Most call centers / help desk have to resolve X amount of tickets in a given time span or they they face a monetary penalty on the contract / agreement made. 
---
too funny
---
Just have fun playing!
---
Alright thanks for the information, I’ll try that to see if I get it.
---
This made me chuckle. Calm down there, rover.
---
like you, I've been more or less playing it like I did with Fallout 4.
---
I have a crappy CAMP, I go out kill stuff, gather resources, do events/quests, eat, drink ...   
---
The main difference is that I sometimes meet other players in events and/or on the road, I just say hi and be on my merry way.
---
Uninstall and play Anthem or wait for The division 2
---
Make a list, not gonna watch 150 minutes video.
---
Yeesh, if they have quotas that they presumably meet everyday how many tickets do they have??
---
You can move those after level 50. I'd strongly suggest it.
---
Im on Ps4 , no KB otherwise i would have wrote this out a bit better. No excuse :)
---
Agree! With 10 ghouls swarming at me, it makes zero sense that vats targets the one friendly player who is further away than the ghouls :/
---
Or nuke zone- whats that? There's a deathclaw running at me? Naw that friendly player behind me up on the fence is a bigger threat *lol*
---
Based on what a Beth Rep said it may have something to do with rad worms. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Anyones guess at this point really.
---
Where did I fed the misinformation? I said that he’s partly right but simply wrong with the main point that this indeed a bug. But you CAN do that in another tone without insulting. And don’t call me fool, didn’t even hinted an insult towards you. This just proves my point, never saw a more fu**ing toxic place then this subreddit. 
---
r/wowthanksimcured
---
because the cryptids in the game aren't supposed to be real fantasy beings. They're supposed to be the result of radiation creating mutants that resemble cryptids.
---
going to pass , I've given up on you tubers . 
---
Yeah..CAMPs on The Whitespring that don't affect the rest of the game should be ok. I build on the golf course, but it's location doesn't affect other players trying to kill stuff.  
---
Because it’s a moth, man.
---
Try me
---
So it'll be a good anti melee bloodied then?
---
Happy cake day, the MothFather knew it was your cake day, so he figured he would stop by, and say hi. 
---
This isn't wow.
---
Though, a lfg tool would be mandatory if the raids require a group.
---
I'm watching it now and it's really good, though. Not a 10 minute hate bash but a 2.5 hr long in depth discussion. 
---
My opinion melee should be underpowered if anything because it's benefit should be that saves you on ammo.  
---
Every weapons class should have a distinct benefit from other class.  Melee should save on ammo but do less dammage, submachine guns should do weak dammage but high rate of fire, explosives should do above normal damage and have a wider area of effect but weigh a TON and have a slow rate of fire, auto rifles and machine guns should do the same dammage as it's semi-auto counterpart but have a greatly-increased recoil and a greatly-reduced accuracy as well as weigh more.  And semi-auto and bolt guns would be the base gun to gauge other weapons off of.
---
That is just my $.02 and obviously other will disagree.  I have never made and released a video game so don't have much room to bitch.
---
Forget to change accounts?
---
This problem is very real. In the beginning, I'd only run across a very few people in a week that built their camp on the whitespring but now every server is just packed with turret farms. Its way to crowded. Is this why I havent seen many legenderies the last few days? I heard that the rate of legendary spawns were going to drop because people wont stop farming there.
---
So.... what the fuck is the Flatwoods Monster? Did some humanoid animal mutate itself into a space suit? Is the Wendigo just a different kind of Ghoul? 
---
Does anyone know if this is still current with the latest patch? 
---
OH
---
Why is man bay just a giant bat?
---
I just discovered Whitesprings last night, pretty cool place.    But it appears to be like L40 mobs and I'm only 20...   And yet I have quests there.
---
The residents of Whitesprings Golf Club are such welcoming people. They always come to say hello to new visitors.
---
Probably in the end hotspots would be the best (for ease), but I really like the idea of stumbling upon vending machines with good items out in the middle of nowhere... It might add something to the exploration part of the game. I fully plan on having mine out in the middle of nowhere.
---
When did they add the ability to respec? Last I checked,  we're stuck with our special points. 
---
Did you try to block the melee attack (just curious, I'm not sure how much of a melee attack goes through when blocked)  or retreat/fast travel to get into a position to snipe?
---
this is dope af
---
Awesome thanks for the input! Lol
---
Or maybe these games are actual repetitive garbage with nothing new, nothing innovative. Why do YouTubers just have to be targetted? Is this some sort of new fake news trump garbage you guys are perpetuating towards games media?
---
No, i need comment karma 
---
I don't know what's going on with the SBQ. A few nights ago I joined a fight where she seemed to take only about 10% of the damage inflicted, that fight went on for over 20 minutes before we downed her and a lot of people in area chat were saying that they broke 2-3 weapons during the fight. About 1.5 hours later I joined a second nuke launch and we put her down in under 3 minutes no problem. Haven't joined any others since and not really sure I want to until this is addressed.
---
I've done this several times. The ridiculous amount of defense events that eventually begin to overlap isn't worth it IMO. I just started fighting the 3 SB event at munitions, when in succession, all within a 7 minute period, all 3 power defense events spawned.
---
I just traveled to each to grab loot, and let the dang mobs have them all.
---
And the YouTubers are reporting 100% correct, non-clickbait content? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
---
I just cook whatever meat I find. I usually have more than enough. Glowing meat is everywhere. If you use super duper as well when your cooking oh, you have more food then you know what to do with.
---
For the most part I think you can really just for it as you go, as opposed to stockpiling anything.
---
Doesn't hurt to keep a cannibal card so that if you ever get desperate, you could activate it defeat on some Corpses. I have one that I got from a perk pack, but I've never actually had to use it.
---
You can. ive done it once. But you have to be booted off not choosing to exit game
---
I have inscior (armor penetration one) and I could solo the SBQ with it is a F***ing God send in this fight  
---
Thanks for saving my time.
---
Well 1. That's not a good habit, should consider fixing it. 2. Deleted comments can still be read. 3. I don't and never "whined" about the TSE nerf. Infact I was all about nerfing TSE's I just feel the extent to which they did the nerf was fucking insane.

wendigo is pretty obviously a different form of feral ghoul. The flatwoods monster is the exception because aliens do exist in the fallout universe. And the flatwoods monster is an alien
---
I have a simple farmhouse setup; mostly there for the already existing brute squad. Was thinking of “repairing” the wall. 
---
All who have a home in that area should share their C.A.M.P. builds so we can share ideas. 
---
Never had one overlap. I tend to stagger them by roughly ten minutes... so I’ll take a workshop, do the initial defence event, grab a smoke then head on over and take the next power plant. 
---
I also found Flatwoods monster in the Mire 
---
Probably a hotspot would  be the Whitespring. I mean people already put their camps there since there are sentry bots along with assaultrons  patrolling the grounds. 
---
Stockholm syndrome. Wait til is out, hold your celebration until then.

Saw mothman about 7 times this week with the mothman event going on. Had a vengeful mothman attack us in Ash Heap last night. We turned him to dust and he gave us some stuff. Never seen a sloth, but I'm only level 24 (was level 21 earlier this week), so I'm usually mostly in the Forest or the edge of Toxic Valley.
---
I wish super duper wasn't unlocked at level 50..my alt needs it bad
---
It really depends on your store of  play. Pretty much all builds should carry a melee weapon or two, as v.a.s.t. does not slow time in 76.
---
These days the hoards are that high due to higher level players coming through, a few months ago they used to spawn in closer to your level. It can suck going there if you're lower level without help
---
I personally never use the term “my xp”; it’s that NO ONE can get that xp or loot - including the CAMp owner - if they’re not around or don’t get a hit on a specific mob.  Whether they realize it or not, it’s a micro version of some of the crazy-abusive things you’ll see on games like Ark when people will literally block off entire zones so no one can build/harvest there.
---
It’s not a matter of “mine” or “yours”, it’s about one person vs. everyone.
---
I think that was random luck or you were in a team. 
---
I dunno.  I collect silver and gold for vendoring, and lvl 2-3 locks tend to have silver and gold items often.  I also find a decent amount of plans behind lvl 2-3 locks, and technical data.  Maybe 5-10% of the time.
---
So levels magically change the ballistics characteristics of bullets. 
---
No wonder 80 year olds aren't allowed to join the military.  They would be one shot killing tanks with BB guns and would be totally unfair.

"Fallout 76 is going free to play."
---
"Fallout 76 is selling non-cosmetic items in the store".
---
And the cherry on top of the mountain of lies: "Bethesda bans player for having too much ammo".
---
Lying by ommission is still lying. These YouTubers have nothing to lose by lying abd generating hate and a lot of money to gain from gullible viewers. So, by simple calculations...I'll let you figure it out yourself. 
---
I've built onto the existing building with the milk and soda machine in front of it. The exterior white brick walls of that building are my downstairs interior. People ask me how I built the white brick all the time and have to show them how I did it. If anyone is on PC that wants to check it out, add me. I have every furniture plan and have all kindsa ideas. 
---
Almost heaven......
---
All I see is so many opportunities for legendaries.
---
So are serums the same mutations without negative effects?  MODUS was talking about how their mutations are "superior" to getting them out in the wastes (but cost a few thousand caps).  I bought the speed demon one and I think class freak suppressed the negative parts or I have a glitch where I only get the positive aspects of the mutation.  
---
If that's the case I'm going to buy Bird Bones from the Enclave and not worry about the -STR effect.  Unless I'm mistaken.
---
Possibly.  O remember getting a booted off. Offered me to rejoin the server so I did
---
I'm glad this game didn't have the same fate as metal gear survive
---
I’m on PC. A group of us, who previously took her down, are now having immense difficulties doing noticeable damage to her. Each time we fight her we are stronger and more equipped. Recently we have been burning through thousands of rounds and breaking guns left and right, to no avail. Something is definitely off. We think it’s perhaps lower level players or those who have not completed the Enclave quest. Looking forward to this issue being resolved. 
---
sorry I don't have that much, my total caps stands at the staggering amount of 2189, so unless you could do it for 2k that's all I got
---
I feel like destroying _just_ the turrets would get the actual point across compared to wanton destruction - the whole base makes them think it was just another asshole griefer, but only turrets... maybe someone’s sending a message about “no turrets” here
---
I can do it for 2k since it’s been just taking up space.
---
I love watching videos like this while I play a game, so relaxing...
---
I think around vault 76 because it's free to travel there
---
sounds good, GT?
---
I think the worst is fissure prime, where the landscape is full of targets and VATS wants me to troll allies or something.
---
Mine is kspek9666
---
Mine or his? If mine, you're welcome to come up with ways around what I said, because its the truth.
---
I have not updated it since I posted it.
---
You only carry 2 guns?
---
First time doing heart of the forest, ran out of ammo about 75% of the way through. Fortunately my wife and another rando had bullets, I was punching the queen...it would have been easier to just use my body as a flail at that point
---
ok, mine is PlaTJyer
---
I like how wendigo just derps. 
---
Gold club turret bases can pull waves of ghouls out the back door before players can wade through the rest of the spawns.  If no one hits them, no one gets xp.  Simple as that
---
Day 7, still no response to either of my pending ticketd
---
I have an anti-armor the dragon, lucky I speced into Rifleman but I can't find mods for it.  (hate the reload speed on those things.)  Trying to find a good gauss rifle drop, but RNG is RNG.  I could build one but the plans are pricy.
---
I had that with an immortal bloodbug.  At zero it would heal to 100% again, repeatedly.  I felt like I was being trolled after the 5th or 6th heal.
---
This. Place the nuke properly and everyone can fight the queen without PA if they choose. 
---
I always wondered why there is a distinction between 1-handed and 2-handed weapons in Fallout, yet we can only hold 1 weapon at a time regardless.
---
Up2u... The perk system very flexible. I guess that I am running stealth bloodied melee but had lots of fun kneecapping with a combat shotgun around lvls 30-50. 
---
He goes way further than anything I have seen raised in this subreddit. 
---
The areas that surround it and don't get nuked will be popular. Any place next to existing venders and train stations is already camped out pretty good. 
---
I would like a more relaxed building system, there is no need to have to build on a foundation or to not be allowed to scrap stairs becuase "it would leave some of the building inaccessible" ect...  
---
All it does is stifle creativity, clipping should be allowed as theres already a build budget so its not like clippong things is going to make people have bigger bases, it would however make blueprints easier to place
---
Could there be some kind of system that ranks a player based on their level, weapons, and armor to avoid excessive buffs to the queen from low level players?
---
I can't control who joins the scorch earth event, and it's frustrating when a bunch of very low levels join and throws a wrench in our hard work.
---
I had several level 30 Randoms and a level 6 join our event last night, which gave our 2 squads of level 150+ players a very bad experience.
---
This makes me happy to see. At least I’m not the last nice human in the wasteland!!! I’m out by the bogs and I’m literally starving and disease ridden and can’t find any veggies!!!
---
&gt; there's no wrong weapon
---
Except lasers.  They should do more than NO damage, but they shouldn't be weaker than a protest sign.  Energy needs a proper balance buff.
---
"Many people like something, that can't happen naturally so they must be paid. Nobody spreads things they like without being paid." 
---
The easy answer/request is make some perks passive. I hate swapping perks to do things. And always forget to switch back after. 
---
Did it actually work with a key?
---
So, SOME of the cryptids are mutated animals. 
---
I was thinking the major existing vendor hubs... harpers ferry, watoga, whitesprings.  Most players are already making daily runs to those spots, seems natural to set trading post there since they have existing traffic
---
OP isn't soloing her and that life bar is as frozen as the SBQ model.

Be more vigilant when exploring. I always pick up items that contain what I typically need. Always.

Probably close to train station vendors
---
Have you tried cold rebooting?
---
Or running at default settings (to see if it is an unstable overclock)?
---
I've been having this happen a few times a day mostly on ghouls that were laying on the floor to start with.
---
I looked at Bethesda, then looked at ESO/Zenimax online then looked at EA and the (then) rumoured Anthem. Bethesda could rework things for the better but I knew Anthem would be destined for failing and overpriced micro transactions.
---
Gilman Mill, it's just south of Vault 76. Woodchucker perk helps. One trip through nets me enough for all my cooking needs for 3-4 days.
---
Fast travel to vault 76, equip woodchucker perk and walk south gathering wood on your way. Fast travel back to your camp. Free and easy wood. 
---
Man Bat os the most creatively named Batman villain. Also, catching him in Arkham Knight was a bitch.
---
I didn’t have it before patch and applied a freshly crafted serum from after patch and the text is still borked for me. Seems like I still get the added damage at low health tho. Seems wonky. Goes up and down based on hunger/thirst
---
Could you pm the link tomorrow so I don’t forget?
---
Fixing bugs and glitches isn't going to make the game good. It has deeper issues with how equipment progression works (rare weapons are weaker because you can't get mods for it because it's rare), with carrying capacity and stash limits, biomes, and the lack of super in-depth locations with stuff to do in them (I've only gotten this far, 1.5 hours in).
---
And also various things Bethesda could do to fix it. I don't remember it entirely, I was just listening to it in the background.
---
We have a name for people like you.

whenever I see someone with a setup there, I let their turrets hurt me, then go nuts and destroy everything.
---
Plug it into something with a re-settable 13 amp circuit breaker - It'll trip the circuit before it gets any force into the kickback. It's not perfect safety, but it's better than nothing.
---
I am watching it right now. He's put in a lot of thought and effort. I expected nothing less of Jon. I saw him edit a video on livestream and he was at a 15 sec clip for almost 1.5 hr, till it was absolutely perfect. Also, guy's a goddamn genius when it comes to playing Fallout. 
---
Yeah I read that too lol.
---
Good way to get help.
---
Enjoy your faulty machine.
---
At least it plays everything else, right?
---
Yup. Long ago around out that one of my stash chassis was an extra set of Excavator. I found a low level to drop it for. 
---
Is this open right now?

Dang that sucks.

Hope microsoft doesn't do that.
---
It's so easy to click my name and then click send message than to leave the game to type a message after remembering how to spell someone's name.
---
Were they the one vandalizing the wall? Who's Allison?? I guess I'll wait to find out more at 10.
---
Which is why it’s not a spot for lowbies.  My lvl 110-ish in X-01 and a 50-cal?  No problem.  My 32 with trapper armor and a modded baseball bat?  They’d wipe the floor with him, so he doesn’t fight there.
---
There’s soooo many places on the map where lowbies can fight and survive.  Don’t fight at golf club or cranberry bog or places that are too tough for a character if it’s too tough for that character!
---
Dang that sucks. I hope microsoft doesn't do that.
---
Yep
---
Well, Bethesda hasn't mentioned anything about (I believe), but being able to publicize our camp or at least vendor machines on the world map. I would definitely like if they did since my camp is in the mire.
---
To answer your question, I believe the hotspots for vendor camps would be where a lot of players coming walking by. Vault 76, Flintwood, Whitesprings, Top of the World, and Wartoga. There's probably other hot spots (Maybe the raid vaults, maybe) I haven't thought of but these are simply my guesses.
---
I like MATN and a few others, the biggest issue I see is that most of them gave up on FO76 a month or more back.  So, they left under pressure from the hate machine, and left at peak dysfunction.  Those of us who have been playing through know that this game was never really that bad, and the problems have been generally all fixed, aside from a needed balance patch.  But the game is very playable and very fun for a solo, coop, or not too demanding multiplayer.
---
What's sad is listening to these guys talk about FO76 after putting it down and realizing that maybe they had issues, but the main driver was the fact that their viewers were so invested in the Hate Machine that they couldn't continue FO76 heavily without losing subscribers.
---
Any chance the old lower number was wrong due to glitch or something? Maybe go through the list and find out the correct total. 
---
I am not tho? it doesnt even give me the option to "run as" anything.
---
"faulty machine"
---
aight, enjoy brown nosing bethesda.
---
Long story in short- Compromises in F76 to cater singleplayer playerbase is limiting game to be fun experience. Game needs to be more harsh, things needs to be more sacred
---
If you say so. I rather be skeptic than hyped and then disappointed, but you do you pal.
---
Sorry what does that mean?
---
10 times? More like ten times a day
---
And if it takes you more shots to kill, then it costs more durability to kill an enemy. So they are correlated
---
That's supposed to be present on every system with an NVIDIA 10 or 20 series card. It should be the second or third option from top. That not being present straight up indicates drivers are nit properly installed on your system.
---
Meh I just use Fireproof, no jumping away necessary. Plus no TSE anyway I use Mini-Nukes at my own feet :)
---
How do they follow them from server to server? I don't doubt it could happen but I think there are just jerks out there on every server. I just had to server hop a few mins ago cuz a couple lvl. 100+ came thru and started destroying my CAMP as I was still building it. Pretty frustrating. :/
---
Yeah, right?
---
people use missile turrets now.
---
everything in the building is killed before you even spawn in. 
---
They are properly installed and also they are updated to the current one aswell, I mean I don't know what to tell you?..
---
Upvote for the title alone
---
Looks like he has nipples on his wings lol
---
Well, 1 what's a bad habit? Calling people bud? Seems like you need to relax. Maybe get off the internet for a few days. 2. What comments did I delete? 3. That's what you ended your post with complaining that they RUINED your tse build. 4. Have a good day
---
Yeah people don't mind consuming 10 minutes. But over 2 hours. There are much better things to do or watch. Like half a season of a TV show, or a (really long) movie or something.
---
lol made me laugh. But still u get the gist.  lvl 50 having issues killing a lvl 36 should be a bad sign
---
It does not matter when the serum was crafted, only when it is applied and that the mutation is not present.
---
Blocking them via xbox will make it impossible for them to follow. Why people insist on being toddlers, and harassing others on a game makes no sense to me whatsoever, and this kinda shit is exactly why I've said since launch that making this game pvp was a horrid idea. You only need to look into nearly any other pvp style game to know how toxic that community is,  and the Bethesda fan community used to be one of the most tight knit communities I've ever seen, but this game is tearing it apart. Between Bethesda's fuckups, and the "raider" community being nothing more than griefing tools that make playing this game impossible some days, the community, and the company has taken a massive hit. It pains me to think that a choice to make something different could do this level of damage, but I hope they turn it around. Maybe launch a pve only mode, and fix the neverending amount of bugs, and this game can become something better, something we can actually enjoy as a community, instead of hating it, and dealing with people that have no place in normal society because they feel it's their right to treat others poorly....
---
Then there's no reason for the option to not appear.
---
Let me remind you that right clicking on Fallout 76 on your desktop will NOT show these options. You need to go to the folder where the game is installed. 
---
No it is a bad habit. Bud is for kids, not for adults.
---
I applied mine for the first time ever after patch. I have the same issues as everyone else trying to reapply it
---
At the risk of being critical, it sounds like you’re asking for a solution to avoid using Perks points for the “Good with Salt” perk...
---
Did you also follow them from server to server or did they just keep getting put back on the same one?
---
There may be another 'old' mutation causing things to go wonky...
---
Ok but then why complain that it's illegal to post these videos on this subreddit? The same should apply to Yongyea's video links, then.
---
I honestly never saw it before today.  It was weird because I told the others to block them.  Maybe it was pure chance but it still stinks to high heaven.   One of them told me it was the same guy who did it the night before.   Maybe, this is just a guess, they do their thing, get blocked,  then the next time they are on they search for the same people they attacked?  
---
Block them  
---
I don't think there is a time frame. Bethesda said they will unban people once the exploit is fixed. As someone mentioned here it may come in March, but it all depends on the Dev team. 
---
No one claimed Fallout 76 was going Free to Play. All top Google results in the question being asked because of information that was gathered.
---
Fallout 76 is selling non-cosmetic items results in 0 results, instead I've found results about players complaining about Atom Shop prices. I think this community might actually be the ones fabricating outrage.
---
Bethesda did ban a player for having too much ammo, it was too much rare ammo. Infact more accurate it wasn't in possestion of ammo, it was ammo that had passed the accounts inventory in the last 30 days. So that one was true? Technically?
---
Seeing a massive crossover with fake newsers and Fallout 76 players. 
---
Nope, actually forgot about this post.
---
I paid full price, during beta, and don’t read reviews. I’m having a great time
---
Oh and getting upset over a persons comment on the internet is adult-like. Lol
---
I ruined my Summerville house the other day with some careless building and I was going to move out into the sticks again like before but I had the same thought about traffic and vending. I ended up building at a different spot near Summerville. I'd like to run an inn where people can stop and buy some of the higher end food items they normally wouldn't bother to collect all the ingredients for and buy mats to fix their gear in the workshop and rest up and refresh their well tuned bonus. Wish I had about 25% more workshop budget though because I could use some extra for a few more bedrooms. I hope the vending machines don't take up too much budget or I'll really have to get creative with the amenities and I don't want to end up putting guests in luxury disaster tents.
---
I would've never seen that. Thank you,  Lol
---
I’ve been online when a random player comes up and continually hit or shoots at you. They have nothing better to do I guess 
---
Thank you! I named my character Allison and always wondered if the game put the characters name on the wall or if it was static. 
---
I went to another server first and told them to follow me.  Same two guys showed up about 5 minutes later.  I said in another comment that it might've just been unlucky but either way the end result of a destroyed nuclear reactor was the same.   This is why I dont leave my decontamination shower out for free use by others and keep it stored.
---
I removed and reapplied and it (and everything else) is working as advertised, but I did clear 5 others in the process (including speed demon, some people have mentioned this as possible also having been messed up in an old update, but idk)
---
One way to test if they're truly following you is server jump a few times then stop for a few minutes. If they are only jumping as well and keep happening upon the same servers then they'll go ahead of you and miss you.
---
BUT if it is a large group of griefers and they put your name out in some public chat/Discord then just having ONE of them on the same server and calling the others to join seems just malicious.
---
Otherwise they are capturing your IP and following you that way? Some people in the BETA claimed to be able to see your data just by looking at you... Not saying it isn't possible. Just why, seems like a waste of time to me.
---
I agree with you, I don’t lock pick in this game as much as other games but despite that, I’ve always felt the loot was better in 76. 
---
It would be cool if the next fallout and more than just hacking and lock picking. 
---
Idk something like different hacking games/puzzles , breaching certain walls with explosives, a high level perk that lets you use a shotgun to shoot a lock on a door like the army does in real life 
---
I don’t use speed demon and have never had it. So it’s def not that
---
I just told them to block them via xbox and not the game.  I dont think they knew there was a difference 
---
In your reply to me you admitted spreading misinformation. If you act a fool you get called a fool, reddit isn’t your safe space. 
---
It could be any mutation that you have not updated since the patch, I cleared 6 total while rebuilding
---
I only had marsupial prepatch. If it’s another mutation causing it, it must be marsupial. 
---
Any chance we can get bullet points from the troopers who watched the whole vid?
---
How when you can’t even access my base to get inside and destroy it. And I’m thinking after at least the 4th or 5th guy in your team joins my server they will hit a queue anyway. 
---
I was talking more about gear, unless you’re all geared to the tee, you won’t even damage me.
---
Didn't myth busters do an episode on this and prove it's a Hollywood myth and it's literally never better to akimbo pistols over using a single? 
---
Doesn't fallout also have a suit of robotic super armor?
---
Could be, it seems that they get messed up anytime they are updated in a patch.
---
Then watch the video, im not making a list
---
&gt; It's Mothman week
---
I haven't been keeping up with the game recently.
---
That's not a sentence I was expecting to read today.
---
So I'm still having no luck finding my buddy. If any of you know "leftovers", can you let him know RRWeed is looking for him. Thanks
---
I lost marsupial and reapplied when rebuilding, so it is Def a possibility.
---
'Wastelanders' would be my bet, since it could mean that people are returning to apalachia after the events of fo76.
---
If that’s all you find, what in the hell are you searching?!
---
Literally just searching ‘Fallout 76 mutations’ comes up with more than enough results
---
If reading is difficult search the same on youtube
---
Like the other guy I’m amazed this is happening in 2019
---
I know, I went to the files where the .ini file was, and I right clicked it, no option.
---
Yongyea and ESO (yeah that's his channel name) both put out videos *last week* that start with "Bethesda is selling non-cosmetic items in the store". I'm quoting. It's still on YouTube, go give thise liars your hard earned money.
---
And like I said: lying by ommission. The YouTubers failed to mention that it was ultracite ammo and how it needs to be crafted. They made it sound like he just collected ammo through nirmal gameplay and got banned. As for him not having the actual ammo is still debated. So far, he has not provided any proof except word of mouth. He and his "friend" (a suspicious account created a day before glorf12 announced his ban) claim that the game counts any item that's picked up: but so far several of ys have run tests that seem to lend evidences to the contrary.
---
It's going to naturally happen. I imagine it's going to be near the vault because of travel and it's safe. What would be nice is to have it in a non pvp area. For reasons.  
---
The snake never gets nuked and there's always at least 3 houses there
---
So you're saying they might have soupcan harry'd us... hmm. Interesting.
---
Huh. That's weird. Fallout 76 apart, that's a more fundamental issue with your PC that you shoukd definitely look into. It means somehow your PC is not properly recognising your gfx card all the time.
---
Well, apparently there are more 5 star reviews on yelp than 1 star reviews, this is according to a guy who works with that kind of stuff: https://www.quora.com/How-reliable-are-Yelp-reviews-How-well-do-they-actually-reflect-customer-sentiment-Are-corrupt-or-fake-reviews-prevalent
---
I would have to disagree with you there, I think user reviews (not the critic ones) are a perfectly good representation of what the majority of players believe about the game.
---
I'm a teacher by trade, 15 years in, and that last point you made is spot on.  The self entitlement I see oozing off these asshats is palpable.   I'm mad at bethesda/lack of content/life in general so I will take it out on others who maybe, just maybe, wanted to play with others and were genuinely intrigued by the new stuff coming and wanted to get back in.  I thought twice about even putting something up here because I just don't have the time in my life to be talked down to by the anonymous who think this behavior is ok.  I did anyway just because maybe,  probably not I know, others could know that this stuff is going on and that the majority dont think it's ok.  I have played fallout since it was on my old crusty PC in the 90s.  I love it and I like sharing that love with other like minded individuals.   The first 100 days has blown to be fair but I look at No Man's Sky and Destiny and I'm hoping that they can turn a corner here shortly with this content map.  Not going to matter if occasionally when you log in someone with nothing better in their lives decides that you cant play today. 
---
That seems excessive.
---
I sent it to your AOL email. 
---
&gt; Yongyea and ESO (yeah that's his channel name) both put out videos last week that start with "Bethesda is selling non-cosmetic items in the store". I'm quoting. It's still on YouTube, go give thise liars your hard earned money.
---
Because of the Super Hero event that gave you +15 health? because everyone had to be wearing a 'Unique' (According to Bethesda) outfit, 'Unique' being a different one to what your team is wearing, where only one outfit of the set is actually findable in game, meaning you had to buy the other ones?
---
Doesn't sound like lying to me. Good reporting, gaining health for wearing outfits you buy on the store sounds like the first step to pay2win.
---
I'm surprised you're the only one who mentioned this place. I get 80+ wood pieces every time I go there without the perk. It's the easiest material to farm in the game lol.
---
Also worth mentioning that you can interact with the robots there and they'll give wood pieces too.
---
I decided to try the time of days perks, and I haven’t gone back.
---
Fully upgraded Solar powered, photosynthetic, sun kissed are amazing. I almost never carry RADX or Radaway anymore, and I almost always eat just for hunger or thirst; rarely to heal. Unless I’m doing PvP or really difficult PvE, I generally never look at my health bar anymore. I can almost always fast travel back to my base after dungeon looting because of the increased strength solar powered gives. 
---
First it's TSE nerfed to hell and oblivion because normal rifle builds couldn't keep up with the damage.  To be fair TSE did need a nerf but not the neutered version that it received, hell the best fix would have been to not have TSE receive bonuses from explosives perk cards, it would have decreased the damage but still make them better than the glorified airsoft gun they have become.  Melee has always been high damage but as majority of enemies in this game are melee creatures Melee is a "High risk High Reward" build meaning they will take more damage from enemies than a ranged build because well....range.  PvP wise if you can't take out someone who is Melee and coming right at you or at least be able to slow them down, then you may need to recheck your build, that's my opinion.
---
Nothing stops you doing same with chameleon. 
---
Remember when you’re invisible you can’t be VATS’d, and being VATS visible = being hit by 20 handmade rounds before you can react, from a fair distance. 
---
Crouch-dependent invisibility means people can more easily get the drop on you when you happen to uncrouch for any of a million reasons. 
---
When was this and what console? I got there today, and it also happened to me, I guess it was because people kept coming so the ghouls kept respawning and there was a massive wave.
---
I'm level 45 and I don't have any trouble killing level 40 enemies. Maybe the problem isn't with the game maybe it is the user. 
---
Exactly - so refreshing to not just hear high level players saying “get gud, noob” :)
---
I’ll check my Aid mule. I’ve never used a magazine so he’s got all the ones I’ve found 
---
Very cool.  Just curious, do you have any problems with other creatures attacking or coming inside your camp?  My only camp I've ever made is still over by vault 76 and is just a fenced in area with 5 turrets.  I'd love to move my base somewhere closer to Watoga, just not sure how to defend it properly but a bunker-type base sounds cool.
---
He's definitely kept playing it at least, he's mentioned the 800 lb stash increase and stuff in the video, so it's quite up to date.
---
Or just have any area that's being nuked deal constant damage to buildings. That'd work too as far as I'm concerned.
---
“I’ve heard your call brother!! I’ve come to join you in our union with the light!!”
---
Jon's making great points here. Everyone really should watch this thing.
---
Nothing wrong with it, but you aren’t going to find any armor legendaries that enhance it- Unyielding helps VATS builds with accuracy, AP, and crit gen. 
---
And not using stealth/VATS doesn’t give you any benefits- a stealth/vats build is always going to be doing more damage than you. You can just use a lot more utility cards if you aren’t building in to stealth/vats. 
---
Twice myself. Once at the Whitesprings whenever i was getting pounded by a scorchbeast, second up near that adventure park thing near Sutton
---
To build on this: Charisma perks!!  A lowbie can still help out a ton with some well-places charism!
---
To build on point #5: Quack surgeon.  Let’s you res with any alcohol!  Saves on stimpaks.  Pair that with the ones that regen health/AP on res, or clears rads, and you’ve got yourself s combat medic!
---
Except that the outfit was also available in game. P2W issue was completely made up, just like the lootbox controversy was made up. It's conjecturing, not reporting. It's not news if it's "I *think* 76 is going P2W" and it's worse when it's presented as "76 *is* going P2W".

Do i need to have all launch codes or can i go right to thr silo?

"Rejoin Server" is something we're looking to add...

The ARMOR is 25. I’m not sure what level the QUEST unlocks at, if it’s even locked. But you can’t wear it before 25
---
Thank you let me know if you have this impossible to find  magazine 
---
Do you have the Luck perk that gives you a chance to instantly reload after firing the last shot?  It can really up your Dragon’s dps :)
---
Bethesda and I quote said "everyone wearing a 'Unique' outfit" you understand what Unique means, signular, one of a kind. The event required you to wear different outfits to your team, ONE of which is aquirable in game, the other 3 of your team were required to find an alernative.
---
The alternative was in the shop.
---
Ws bunker where you get x01 mods turn around inside the black metal box I drop extra ammo there all the time because I know higher lvl players usually there and may need that ammo of all kinds. 
---
The level 3 safe in watoga EMS has rare plans from time to time. Found the MG42 and Super Sledge Plan there recently. So I try to make a habit of checking it whenever I’m there 
---
*Alternative*.
---
This is excessive.
---
I have a better idea: Make more places with high level mobs and good drops! Everybody cramming into one spot, in a mid level zone by the way, to farm is silly pants!
---
Yeah. Not gotten nuked once yet. Always have a few people close by when I log in. I wish we could be closer together and all join one server and have a heavily CAMPed Whitesprings. Expect for that guy that puts turrets behind the clubhouse. Fuck that guy. 
---
Why does Melee need a nerf?  Rifle build whined about TSE needing a nerf and it was absolutely neutered.  Granted TSE needed a nerf but the fair way would have been to make it to where TSE did not receive bonuses from Explosives perk cards.  Melee as it is is fine.  They are face to face with enemies trading blows and taking the most damage and having to make more repairs than rifle builds.  If anything needs a to be buffed a little its rifles, if anything needs a huge buff its Energy weapons!  But seriously Melee is a viable build for a reason in this game as it can stand up to a lot of other builds with the exception or the sneak/crit builds and maybe unyeilding sentinels.
---
I'm not defending the game, but if we're holding OP to the same margin of evidence we're asking of most bug claims, then this video doesn't seem like proof positive of anything. The tesla kind've sucks for damage even when specced for. It's a utility gun, not a main gun. It's ill-suited for fighting a SBQ as is.
---
It is kinda weird how a game series where you could become a super mutant’s gimp for the night, then kill a village’s-worth of children and slaughter some junkies to counter the negative karma you got for killing said children, doesn’t have much stomach for swearing 20-ish years after the bombs fell.  (Also, the lore kills off most everyone on the planet, which is also kinda dark)
---
And I’ll rebuild, and make you do it all over again. You lose because it’ll still be there the next time you log in. It’ll just amuse me how I drive you to obsess. You’ll be so fun to watch, just like here, being infuriated because you whine and whine and don’t get your way. Like a child.
---
And then you’ll still have nothing but your rage. Problem solved. And I’ll still own you, your time, your efforts, and your hate. Cute
---
For the most part no. I have had a group of scorched spawn on top of the bridge once, but that's it.  My other camp was attacked constantly. Closer to Watoga you go the worse it gets. I had have had attacks on my last base that included 7 Gutsies, a scorchbeast + scorched, and some cave crickets that spawned on the road. It was bad and I got tired of repairing walls, so I got the hell out of there.
---
Are you obtuse?
---
I just told you 1 of the outfits was aquirable in game. Your team had to then wear different outfits to the one you were wearing. The other 3 outfits were in the cash shop. Jesus christ.
---
Jon put in hours upon hours of work and effort into making this video. A simple list won't do it justice. Just watch it.
---
We range from level 50 to 200 we are all geared out in brotherhood combat armor so you won't touch us
---
Make areas near the building with spawn point no build zones.   My camp  on the south lawn by the snake isn’t hurting anyone.
---
Something I noticed. The good teachers never had "asshat" students. I also notice you used the term "talk down to". Interesting projection. That's exactly what the bad teachers did to their students, and why many of them rebelled against them. 
---
Man, now I want to start a “Most horrible in-universe thing you’ve seen/done in the Fallout series” thread...
---
I read that as urban wave too lol
---
I've been at queen fights where everyone's wailed on her and she only loses 25% health the duration of the fight. I've also seen her get downed in less than 8 minutes. Honestly I'm not sure if this shows that her health is bugged or that OP has a bad build.
---
I'm not getting upset, simply educating an ignorant individual on social etiquette. Though, I am upset about the buffing of enemies  in fallout 76, which is granted since I paid for the game.
---
So word on the street is the 20% bonus damage for explosive legendary is applied *per pellet* with shotguns, and there’s 8ish pellets. So if your shotgun does 100 damage, explosive will add 20x8, or 160 damage. Then adding Demo Expert should turn that into 160x1.6=256 bonus damage. 
---
Just imagine before when TSE and Demo Expert were full power. TS in shotguns only added one pellet, but with explosive at 100% bonus damage, you’re now looking at 9x100 explosive pellets. And then Demo Expert at 100% more explosives, you’re looking at 9x200 explosive pellets. So 1800 extra damage on a 100 base damage shotgun. 
---
Note that I never ran one, this is just what I heard reading Reddit during the TSE heyday. 
---
Might help you understand why TS, E, and Demo Expert got nerfed so hard
---
Most people just whine to whine about meaningless and pointless things. It’s about not getting their way. They want an easy trip, someone built a better mousetrap, and now they want to stifle the competition. It’s...liberal. Lol
---
What is wrong with you? The world does not revolve around you. Such a precious snowflake, I bet your parents are so proud!
---
Thank you for your input.  I shouldn't have used that term but I was just angry at the actions I had just seen.  By talk down to i just meant people saying "that's what the game is" when bringing up the griefing , not actual input.  
---
Well, I have no idea how to do that, cause I'm not a computer expert at all.
---
by trouble I mean having to expend more than 2 rounds.
---
Don't hold your breath.  LOWEST PRIORITY EVER
---
See how the model is ***completely*** motionless as the camera pans around her?  That's a huge bug.   it's not that 100% of everyone in the bog "has a bad build" that somehow only does 24% damage before it stops working, it's that this bug happens a log and she is completely frozen and not actually capable of interacting with anyone on the server.
---
It's kind of disturbing that people will suggest you self-censor than express your opinion here. There's a narrow set of opinions that are given room to breath on this subreddit and it's generally just a bad vibe. 
---
why did TSE need a nerf? Because it did alot of dmg. Why does melee need a nerf? Because it does TONS of dmg. 
---
That would be nice.
---
You mean like some kind of network of terminals? Oh wait you must mean like they would be a combined pool. But then what if two items listed on two players, have same price, or different even. How does the system know what you are trying to buy. Yeah that's doable, if they make a submenu into it, making it more like terminal where you first select a player, then check what he has.
---
But no, they will be just like current vending machines. They are placed in camp, the player who owns it, sets from his stash which items are on sale, and for what price.
---
Then other players visit and browse them.
---
The PLANS are super expensive because once learned you craft as many as you like as Long as you have mats. The MODS are the same price they’ve always been, and just as rare as they’ve always been, which is why the plans can be worthwhile. X-01 does not have any plans available, only mods, and jet pack and calibrated shocks are both super rare.
---
I’ve no idea if vendor list chances for any have changed in the last few patches, but I do know they’ve always been super rare.  
---
I love the click bait title haha “Top 5 weapons in FO76. Wait till you see #3” 
---
That's what I do, except I never defend.  I wait until it switches to reclaim, then only have to deal with 1 wave.
---
Are you the “guy that works with more positive than negative” game reviews? Give it a rest. Just because some youtubers saw the candle burning and decided to throw gas at it doesn’t mean they represent the majority. I’m only 1 of many who don’t write blogs or reviews about games I enjoy. Imagine how many million more there are out there like me. Hmm
---
Of course it doesn’t. And it doesn’t revolve around you or your whining about it being unfair someone had a better idea than you. Then having whines all day like a snowflake, scream “NO YOU!!!”
---
It’s pathetic haha. I’m doing this cause you amuse me with all your liberal tears. Soooo salty over one spot in a giant game.
---
And yeah they are. Thanks for asking. What about yours? Thanks for making me your god. Feelzgoodman
---
Because there is typically high level players there which pushes enemy level up
---
Can you please add Watoga Super Duper Mart into that list? I often see people build their base with a lot of turrets to get easy kills on those robots.
---
High level human NPCs with good gear would definitely spice things up a bit! 
---
A new enemy faction, called Vaulters or something.

Go to the menu of this sub reddit and click on the three white dots, then it should say “Change user flair”

sorry for the late response, they changed the file structure slightly, so i wasn't able to create an accurate list, unless they change the structure again next update, i shall post again then.

Smh. If you weren't upset you wouldn't be attacking me with every post. "Lacking perception and intelligence," " simply educating ignorant individual on social etiquette." I simply, as you said pointed out a factual mistake and called you bud. Seems like you're butt hurt. Oh by the way I paid for the game too.
---
Place it from Stored. Not the blueprint section
---
I think it has something to do with killing her inside the nuke zone? I could be wrong though, but when I killed her outside the nuke zone I haven't experienced the health bug like this video.
---
They heard meat was back on the menu.
---
Quick question: Going off of the store's name, Kum 'n go, is this some sort of sperm bank, or something? Just curious.
---
If you are doing stealth and/or VATS, Unyielding is great but requires low health. If you can get into low health builds, they have a TON of synergies (Adrenal reactions, Nerd Rage, bloodied weapons, dodgy or serendipity, emergency protocol torso if in Power armor) but also have a lot more risk (peak performance is sitting just below 20% health, which means you die easy if not in Emergency Protocol power armor!)
---
Other than Unyielding, probably Sentinel’s for a shotgun/sniper build. It’s great in PVP but also makes you very tanky in PVE, if you aren’t moving. 
---
A couple Life-saving pieces can make you quite the Phoenix and can pair well with revenant (actually, IDK if revenant requires another player to Rez you or if life-saving counts, I’m guessing). 
---
Chameleon is useful, Weightless helps with stealth a bit (armor weight affects stealth), also the secondary Radiation and Poison resists are nice to have 1-2 of; the mirelurk queen’s most dangerous attack is a poison attack I believe.  
---
Fallout 4 has the best legendary drops, especially in Far Harbor, but I agree 76 drops next to nothing after battles and quests. 
---
Also, please add a radio host. Maybe Grahm!
---
Dont I know it.  I'm constantly trying to stop bullying at my job so when I see it in other forums that should be an escape it's a bit jarring. Oh well have a good night.
---
They're just beaming with friendliness!

And ionizing radiation.
---
What I am asking for is more corroboration that this is a "frozen health" bug. What's OP's (u/robblatt) damage with their current gun and fire rate? If DPS is south of 650, chances are you aren't going to see chunks fall off the health bar. Even north of 650, most of that damage is probably energy damage, to which she has about 300 ER, so it'd be helpful to know the sheet damage when OP is specced for explosive damage and when they aren't.
---
Thanks!  That Mothman flair was tempting but I'll keep my faith and my work as a Responder separate.
---
If you are on later tonight like 9 or 10 est I can take you thru the silo.  Psn is hottkarls.

Oh man, that is so cool! Also, I love the lamp joke, that made me laugh my ass off. 
---
You’re welcome 
---
I'm glad I stopped playing. Stopped playing a couple weeks after launch (played BETA and all that shit), felt like I had done everything, and the various bugs and issues were starting to grind at me.  
---
I quit at a point where I can say "I'll return to this game when it gets better", instead of waiting till it gnaws at me enough to where I never touch it again. I'll probably be returning when the vaults open since that'll hopefully give some decent content, but that does depend on execution.  
---
Essentially, my thought is, I'll keep watch of the game and hope for the day it gets better, but for now there are simply better and more fun games (for me) to play.
---
Explain to me how OP got the damage down that far and then froze the SBQ in place while reducing damage output to zero all by himself?
---
Occam's Razor, it's harder to explain how this *isn't* a bug, plus we've all seen this bug.
---
Mythbusters never tried it with laser, plasma, or alien blaster pistols. Just sayin', not exactly through testing.
---
It's a tough and confusing life for a lot of people. I hope we can all try to understand each other a bit better.
---
When the weight glitch was still a thing I watched someone die from a nuke, proceeded to literally loot 200+ of each resource, the player followed me for like an hour while making angry emotes and shooting at me, I kept making the taunt emote, it was his punishment for making the servers lag even more.
---
Absolutely... I will be very careful now in the future, because if you just simply get something wrong, the downvote train is already on its way. Happened to me the other day, lost quite a bit of karma because at some point people find it amusing to downvote you, just because they can. I apologized and corrected myself for my misinformation, and EVEN THAT got downvoted. Iam nearly done with this subreddit seriously...

---
Melee did nowhere near the amount of damage that a TSE shotgun with max ranks of shotgun and explosives perks and other perks plus stacked bobbleheads.  Melee is a solid build but it has its restrictions.  Melee is supposed to do a lot of damage!  An anti armor axe up close is supposed to do a ton of damage.  A properly specced rifle build is supposed to tear up a melee build at range, a properly specced sniper/crits build is supposed to shit on everyone while smoking a cig and drinking a cup of coffee laughing from 5 kliks away.
---
Yes, you'll find the structure you built in stored. If you have a problem placing it, delete it from the stored tab, and it will break down the structure into walls and floors and workbenches and stuff and put all of that in your stored tab. 
---
Ugh! I soooooo want a red one to go with my hat and smiley doctor mask.
---
I'm not contesting that a frozen model isn't a bug. I'm contesting that frozen health is a bug. You're kind of making a straw man argument out of the frozen model assuming it's completely related to frozen health. I've also seen the SBQ model get frozen but still downed, both before patch 6 and after - so I am a bit skeptic that we're equating the two. We really need to have more information before we just take this to feed a narrative we want to believe. Understanding OP's DPS gives insight to that. Even then, we're looking at one player's damage when there could be upwards of 15 people there increasing her damage mitigation. 
---
And I don't think asking for a bit more corroboration of what we're actually watching is out of order here. It'd be great if we could get that from u/robblatt
---

Thanks. I even searched for an existing thread assuming there was one but didn’t see that one. 
---
Whay does blight soup do?  I still think pistols are underpowered when compared to rifles, especially since there are so many good agility perks that you miss out on in order to get maximum damage.
---
What could another review possibly say that hasn't already been said? At this point they're just cherry picking the criticisms of others and combining them into a video for views. Guarantee that nothing this YT'er says is any different than what we've all read

I would strongly disagree that all the problems have been fixed. It's better, sure, but there are still issues that need to be addressed. But I've had fun playing it since the beta.

---
Yeah! I would love a freezer or fridge for you CAMP! I rarely bother to cook any of the more complex recipes because getting all the ingredients together is such a pain, and often times things just go bad before you get the stuff needed to combine them with to make other things. Have food still degrade on your person, but halt that spoilage in refrigerated storage. Then you could get real use out of food, and even save complex food with good stat benefits for specific things like long expeditions or queen fights. And I could save Scorchbeast meat until I get a full set of parts for Scorchbeast Mixed Meat Stew and then save and USE the stew BEFORE a tough fight, not as just a meal for afterward you have to eat before it spoils...

Oh you mean in fallout...

Serums give you all the positive with no negative for 1 hour, but after that buff wears off it's the same as if you caught the mutations organically.

I watch for these things I swap to ghoulish instead if I run with one of them. Have a regular guy i team with who runs it. Good point tho!
---
Separate the two:  Explain how the health is reduced to 25% and then suddenly no damage can be done when she's on the ground (which is when she takes the most damage if you haven't fought her yet).  
---
I've seen these two at once, so I assume she's totally glitched from the server and that's why no players can interact with her and her playermodel can't interact with the server.  But if it's multiple simultaneous glitches, the question remains:  How is it possible to bring her down to the ground and then stop doing damage when she's most vulnerable?
---
Our benevolent gods can be inflicted with the plague? We must save them to preserve their infinite cosmic wisdom!

If you have the right peeks you can craft antibiotics that cure disease and give you +50% resistance for an hour (I think). Combined with the well fed/hydrated bonus and vaccinated perk, it makes you almost impervious to diseases.

Pre patch that was a viable argument now tho...... Ya almost have too pic a location and set up operations. The adds are too numerous.
---
How often do you say “oh shit, it’s dark that’s why I’m dying”?
---
Yes. This.  I had a Vengeful Mothman waiting fore me nearly every time I joined a server and spawned at my old CAMP.  Killed about 10 or so over the past week or so.  Not really enthused about meeting one it as it drops garbage and a mothman wing. Not worth the time to get rid of them.  Sometimes they just bail on their own and I don't have to kill them - which I don't really mind.
---
Well I don't make assumptions about people but by his ongoing back and forth with me, he definitely thinks his shit dont stink.
---
You could also go to that fountain in whitespring that cures disease.

That, or get lucky and find a legendary with 90% reduced weight.

There's a load of really good suggestions, ideas, and things to think about in his video.  It's very long, but very well thought out that is worth (in my opinion of course) to make its way to the to one of you or even the devs.

Youtubers obviously get a bad rap here and although some is definitely warranted, Jon/MATN is very respectable and generally knows what he's talking about.

If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
I didn’t „spread it“, I said „maybe“. As it was kinda a thing that old bugs reappeared. And don’t worry, I don’t need a safe space big guy. But some of you on here just need a reality check that this is not a cult, you’re allowed to get something wrong as long as you’re not implying over and over again that you are right. That wasn’t the case here and this wasn’t the case with me the other day. Bit** around somewhere else! 
---
Thanks for your time and detailed response, very helpful! I do tend to forget about vats for the most part, so I will have to do some perk arranging. Thanks again for the help 
---
This isn't for r/fo76. Try somewhere more general, like r/Fallout.
---
Auto correct 
---
I'll buy one!
---
Jon only stopped playing once he finished the main quests. And even then, I have seen him about in the game a couple of times. Although a lot of the time recently he's been in to record footage for this video.
---
i'm sure he'll do more come March when the new content starts hitting.
---
I low-key get SUPER paranoid about that when I gotta server hop to get away from griefers. So far I haven't seen that happen tho but if it got to that point I wonder if the griefers can be reported for harassment? Griefing someone on one server is one thing, but following them across multiple servers is freakin' malicious and uncalled for. That's not "part of the game" or whatever the jerks like to say in their "defense."
---
God I hated that mission!

Also, Man-bar was originally meant to be Batman’s new main villain, but I guess even comic book writers realized that was pretty stupid (no word yet on excuses for calendar man, condiment man, bat-dog, etc.)

Every time a game company tries to do something innovative or different, the community tries to push them into the same mold of the existing paradigm.
---
idk I won't have the ability to buy it until later in the week hopefully the listing is still available
---
This would be a great modification idea for the binoculars
---
Those are the only reasons I even get a bounty.  Otherwise, I would be a bounty-virgin.
---
I'm report u 2 toddy an he wil get u thee o re tick olly ban. I esposed u
---
Hopefully once they get their pvp bs server won’t have to deal much with that. But I call that lack of content and people are getting bored. Bored people have horrible ideas lol 
---
Do I lose my stuff
---
He's also known to some people at Bethesda for his challenge runs - Jon's definitely one of the "good" YTers.
---
Ranged guns have range.  Most games make melee so strong because of the risk/reward for having to wade into the thick of battle, or manage to sneak/climb up to other players sniping from the rooftops.  My heavy gunner can sit back and unload into a swarm of bloated ghouls without having to worry about getting hurt, let alone killed, while my buddy with the supersledge is popping stims and chems to stay afloat.  They slaughter for sure, but I comfortably survive.
---
Threads like these.
---
Uhh.. I grind it still.  It's relaxing, and (oddly enough), the materials I get sustain what I do.
---
Situation normal.
---
Just another bug.
---
Wow, that's nuts. Yeah sounds like they're def following y'all somehow. What platform y'all playing on?? Shoot, I usually hop too when I see high-levels coming toward my camp but I had like 3 workshops this time around and didn't wanna lose em. Sometimes you hope for friendlies and it just don't happen. :/
---
Exactly,  this is a low content product.
---
Yeah... so... cool... so...... you got anything? Or is a failed troll attempt all you got. 
---
It was two and a half hours long; I don't think there's enough ammo in Appalachia to make enough bullet points. But, basically, more emphasis on community, consequence, and construction.
---
I think its kinda funny that the idea that a majority of other people not liking what you like is so revolting to you that you can't comprehend it. No, i'm not that guy, how that matters is beyond me. He works for a website that literally tracks yelp user reviews. If anyone would know it would be that dude and according to him reviews are skewed more to the positive side then negative.
---
I find it so funny that a few people seem to think that the sole reason most of the reviews for this game are negative is because the big scary fake news youtubers decided to profit off of this game, I got a message for you buddy, they do that with everything, the only reason it worked with this was because people agreed with them.
---
And again, I don't know what gives you the idea that people who dislike something are more inclined than those who like it, evidence points to the opposite.
---
Think about how many millions of people don't right reviews or blogs about things they hate. Its okay to like things most people dislike buddy, it just means you have ~~shitty~~ unique tastes.
---
If you have an explosive weapon, they might be using the Fireproof perk card, which would negate a ton of damage from your recently needed weapon.
---
Also, there are some armor sets/builds that can make players ridiculously hard to kill, but only if they’ve managed to put together all the pieces and spec their cards right.
---
Pay no attention to smirkis, he is dead set on white knighting this game till his internet sword is rusted.
---
I'm Melee build and I can tell you right now most enemies that I hit do not go down on one swing.  Super mutants I have to hit two maybe three times.  I'm not sure where this hard-on against melee comes from but maybe you need to redo your build.  I had to make tweeks to my build on melee and I'm only lvl 86.  Really no need for name calling I get that you're a little pissy but christ on a pogo stick calm down it's just a game.
---
100% random. So the faster you can kill legendary enemy is the faster you’ll get your shotgun.
---
Everyone swears by white spring golf course. ￼
---
Have people still not learned to just stop playing this game? 
---
I wouldn’t care less either but as someone who is very active in the marketplace sub, this is sadly an indicator for some people if you’re good to trade with. Apart from that, they have no value for me either. Imaginary internet points hits the nail on the head lol 
---
Corpses does transform into meat pile, but usually not where to expect to find them (it happens to SBQ as well but you can find the meat pile if you're looking hard enough)
---
Listen to the flies sound and loot all meat piles, you'll eventually find the good one.
---
I see your claim, care to back it up with some facts?
---
This happened to me as well, anti-armor shotgun with all shotgun perks maxed.  After the heal it wasn’t doing any damage and neither were the melee builds with sledges.  I switched to a bloodied handmade with prime receiver and that started dropping the bar, but not very much... eventually after many many many clips, she went down.
---
I failed by two seconds the first time. Once I realized how fast you have to move, and how many bioluminescent fluids rad toads give, I finished with time to spare the second time. Focus melee on those creatures and hit all the fireflies in between. It really helps to not be overencumbered, as well. 
---
Back in the day, that would have taken half a magazine in my TSE Handmade to kill them all... maybe less.
---
Jesus mate you're insulting other people on the internet over a video game. You might want to take a break or something. Or play something else?
---
Are you telling me there is a way of skipping all of those damn transponders, and not feeling like your game is bugged by the quest forever resting? 
---
When I'm trying to get the responders vendor bot to spawn next to the Charleston railroad I sometimes get pissed at the people who build there blocking that event from spawning. Some of them do it on purpose because they completely encircle the spawn point with giant foundations. Those I like to tear apart if I get the chance.
---
Sorry this guy was a dick to you though.
---
Well that's awesome and glad you're having a great time.  However, a lot of people didn't and are not liking the game.   I don't think the game is the worst but in my opinion it's been disappointing.  
---
Just now I snuck into a fissure site with all ultra light and muffled heavy combat armor, harvested all the ultracite ore, and left without a scratch. Are you sure stealth is actually broken?
---
fallout 76 is llife
---
Well, I got some sperm if you're still accepting.
---
&gt; u think I might like anthem?
---
Short answer: no
---
Long answer: 
---
If you're getting Anthem for any sandbox/RPG aspect, you won't like it at all.
---
The best thing about Anthem is the combat/graphics and overall gameplay loop. The worst thing is it's lack of standard features that you'd expect from most games of the genre. Anthem almost has no RPG aspects, it's really not open world, and there's zero survival elements to it. 
---
Only if they take your bag.  Whenever you die, no matter the reason, you leave behind a bag containing all the Junk you were carrying.  If you go back to your bag, you can pick it up again.
---
Junk contains objects you find in the world (Desk Fans, Fuses, Typewriters, etc.) and various bulk and scrapped crafting components.  It does *not* include weapons, armor, ammo, Fusion Cores, etc.  This is only Junk you are carrying on your person too, not the Junk you put in the Stash.  Ideally, you make periodic trips to your Stash to drop off your Junk, so you aren't lugging around too much of it.
---
Yes, exactly what you people are doing. Thank you for proving my point.
---
I got almost all Workshops except a few. Did a eun on a sead server to get plans. 
---
Bar, no anyone can come in. Living area yes, if I'm gone.
---
Indeed, as cynical as it sounds.
---
Looking through my saved posts. How's this working out now? 
---
Most of those melee players pulling several K damage are one or two hits away from death themself, from what I’ve seen.  Perks like radicool, nerd rage and adrenaline combined with the adrenal mutation (and others) make them very much a glass cannon.
---
I’m not defending the use of Bobbleheads glitches, if that’s still a thing.  Exploits should always be fixed, and shouldn’t be justification for punishing normal gameplay/builds.
---
I saw him three times in one walk. I got a good look at him each time, but he disappeared pretty quickly after I got close. I didn’t even get a hit in.
---
U cannot stack singles.
---
Anytime you die you drop your junk items. If another player picks up your junk then you lose it. It’s usually not that bad as long as you store your junk regularly. 
---
You also lose some caps if other players kill you too, but I’m not entirely sure how that works since I rarely ever engage in PVP.
---
The ONLY time I destroy camps is when this happens. Lol. Any other time I don't mess with them. 
---
A guy puts hours of work to show he cares, and your response is to suggest he goes to play something else. Truly enlightened. Truly you are the 'real' fan.
---
Seriously though what is up with people like you on this sub who feel the need to needle at every bit of constructive critique? It's no better than the people who come on here simply to trash the game. Blind praise is just as steeped in ignorance. 
---
F076 isn't suffering due to too much innovation, it's that it is not effectively conveying ideas that made the franchise popular to begin with. However, as Jon points out, it can be made to do so and that can even improve the online experience. 
---
I know its a 300 IQ move to suggest that the game is just too good and people don't get it, but how can you at once say the game is innovative yet people by your admission just want F04 with friends? Which is it? Innovation or the same? 
---
I don't actually want an answer to that last bit. The point is that it's more complex than what you're even putting out. That even in your handful of sentences we have a paradox. 
---
He even suggests making it "Fallout 4 with friends" but with ways to also improve the online and social aspect. 
---
Thank u sir
---
Just watched the entire video. Well worth a watch in its entirety, as he offers his solutions in the video, but here are some of my big takeaways as far as the major problems go
---
* The game tries too hard to compromise between a singleplayer and multiplayer experience - there's too much abundance of goods for people to need to collaborate which causes people to solo too often to the detriment of the game
---
* There is too much compromise towards making the game "softcore" survival, which essentially makes survival feel a bit too much like babysitting the main character - allowing/forcing more character specialization in terms of crafting survival resources could help alleviate this
---
* The way that the carry weight/crafting system works shouldn't feel like accounting. Stuff like not wanting to fight scorchbeasts because they result in a net loss of junk is a ludicrous concept
---
* Essentially, a lot of these problems lead to his central suggestion, which is giving the world a greater sense of permanence by replacing the seamless multiplayer with servers tied to characters where one can have an impact and build towns that last. This would allow people to form organic communities that can allow for more meaningful player interaction
---
I'm definitely not doing the video justice by stating these, as he does a very detailed dive into each of the big problems he sees with the game and how they might be fixed, and in the end builds up to how permanence+scarcity could lead to very interesting RP opportunities such as those many of us probably imagined but were disappointed to not be able to do going into 76
---
For real! I recently moved to an iron deposit in the Savage Divide today. I wasn't there 20 mins before a couple lvl 100+ jerks come rolling through throwing grenades and shooting at my camp, trying to tear it down. I don't do PvP so I just server hopped. But for real, what the hell is the incentive? Workshop I understand but camp?? I didn't even have the resource extractor locked so it's not like I'm hogging everything. 
---
You,'re late, but i appreciate it. 
---
The ones who want melee nerfed should try to play with minimum health... if u use non low hp melee is no higher dmg than ranged
---
It's 17 seconds of footage. For all we know there's a lag spike and she's rubberbanded back into the world fully active just like you are when you when you enter a dense cell like the white springs resort or the enclave bunker. Likewise, there's really nothing saying that this is a server side or client side issue since even when controls are disabled the clock still counts down. Additionally, in the 17 seconds we see, we don't see other players. We have no idea who else is actually dealing damage, with what, or any indication that other players aren't able to interact with the model. There's really 100 explanations for how this could have happened and it shouldn't take you long to find at least one possible explanation if you're willing to be skeptical, especially given how little we're actually seeing in just 17 seconds. 
---
I've also experienced a queen fight where it really was just 15 bad builds wasting ammo hoping someone will pick up the slack. I didn't claim it was a bug. It was more than likely just 15 people that weren't specced to maximize damage. I've seen a friend switch from exclusively handling adds to fighting the queen within the last 5 minutes of scorched earth. What could easily be mistaken for a frozen health bug was just a matter of one OP build turning the tide.
---
The closest approximation I can think of would be like the grand exchange in OSRS.
---
I mean that from the player vending machine, you can be presented a choice to access the player shop or just a global market/"auction house".
---
Im talking about non PA
---
I use sturdy frame ans it ms really useful. I have heavy guns and its nice to not focus on heav armor. Pack rat is also nice, for junk. I run both, with Bandolier.
---
Nah I have to make a deposit first. Please dont go to your parents room if you hear a loud noise, I prefer a private deposit and your dads a little shy. 
---
Taz this is by far the best advice I have gotten. Basically when I am on sniper mode i will have sniper perks on for stealth and vats. I will also switch around to shotgunner perks when I'm in places like whitesprings. So In places like whitesprings I would be weiry of unyeilding but I also would like to run around with bloodied weapons and one shot everything lol. Also I still dont get how sentinels would help me at all I need more clarity on that. So far I've been thinking a mix of weightless chameleon and maybe the radiation and poison secondaries. Also is it better to get a whole set of one type of perk or should I mix them up (ie. Lifesaving with a chameleon with a unyielding type mix.)
---
Anytime 👍🏻
---
I use VATS to find any mines I dropped that the enemy missed. Sometimes I get them back. 
---
It's not about gaming. I think some gamers just have psych or personality issues, just like the general population. Same reason some people vandalise other people's cars and houses for no reason. 
---
Xbox.  I was honestly talking with them about how I hadn't seen any crap like this in weeks, and I play A LOT Haha,  and then this happens.   They were joking afterwards that I need to be more selective in what I conjure forth with my words 
---
Do your SPECIAL stats jump from 10+ to -10 or worse like mine do?  Or is that another, different bug involving class freak/stranger in numbers?
---
To get a bounty and entice other players to come after you. 
---
It is definetly. I run a no PA build and i have some good ressistances. 
---
 Thank you! 
---
Personally I really enjoy MATN's content. Watching it now and I know that the rest of the team will be doing so too. Thank you for the tag!
---
It's pretty up to date, and one doesn't talk for two and a half hours about something they don't care about. 
---
It's critique for sure, but very positively spun and the game does have some other things it could do better at to increase the population and make the game even better. I'd hardly compare him to people who picked the game up and then trashed it. 
---
He did a lot to make it work. Including doing long segments about building pretty cool camps. I didn't watch all of those but I think it's a bit silly to imply the only valid critique is from people who are in love with the game. 
---
Since we're on the topic of buying and selling, do you only deal in power armor and power armor mods? Because I have a few relics and legendary items that I'm willing to let go at a fair price.
---
suck my ass
---
Must be... I've considered that. :/
---
suck my butthole?
---
I feel like many of his ideas, particularly about grind, go against the team's base development philosophy. Great it's being looked at, but these thoughts need to be taken to heart.
---
Sums it up nicely. 
---
I'm beginning to agree with those who suggested that the servers are pretty wonderful following maintenance, but decay a couple weeks later.  I had a good two weeks of no disconnects, and now I've had two days with them.  And people aren't exactly launching nukes left-and-right either.
---
It's still, on the whole, better than it has ever been, IMO.
---
Anyone care to summarize? 2hrs20m exceeds my budget.
---
Does Jon lose privilege to his Bethesda women, now after this video. 🤣🤣
---
Nah, just make the whitesprings robots try to maintain the greens and raze the workshop. "keep off the green" isn't a suggestion. 
---
I'll go out on a limb and say you haven't watched much of Jon's Fallout 76 content. There was no real "hate machine" with his stuff, just constructive criticism. 
---
I mean he did an entire 30 part Let's Play series of the game. And viewership dropped off quite a lot towards the end probably BECAUSE he wasn't just hating on the game.
---
The game has fundamental design issues. I enjoy playing the game but I'm not gonna stick my head in the sand and pretend they don't exist and neither does Jon. 
---
You should check out his content, you might like what you see.
---
No.
---
The game does not offer a good method for pvp.  You can chase others around and hope they want to or you can smash some things, get a bounty and other interested players will come to you. 
---
Yes ran into unkillable queen once since last patch .
---
I'm sure I got the Chinese Sword Plans from taking Thunder Mt and defeating Liberator Bots. I got 4 COS Plans. Although I'm sure it's not specific to Thunder Mt. Just try different Workshops 
---
Happy Cake Day friend!
---
I want to hang out with MothMan, but my turrets keep shooting him and it bums me out. But he has spawned at my camp about 4 times this week because of the event. 
---
I think it's because Whitesprings might count as being in the Savage Divide, where higher-level players can skew the numbers significantly, unlike the rest of the Forest.
---
I am loving it so far. Since the newest patch, at least for me, the server performance is very much better! It runs stable now, no issues mostly. The one thing I want to see the most however is a global text chat
---
One of mine: back on my 2 Gb hard drive laptop in junior high, I played fallout 2 with the language filter on because I was sheltered and “a good kid”.  Couldn’t figure out what job I was being offered and took in New Reno, so I reloaded with the language filter off and was still puzzled why something called a “fluffer” was being filtered, let alone what it meant.
---
Ah, the innocence of youth...
---
It wouldn't surprise me if brats ignore the PvP server and still do the same on the other servers, just to grief and troll people. 
---
Jon's summary is exactly what you want, that compromises to the existing game to satisfy a single player game in a temporary world does not foster Co-Op play between players.
---
Maybe his ideas about how to create this may not be to your liking, but he is trying to come up with a solution which makes the game rely on player interactivity.
---
Honestly, it is 2.5 hours long, but it doesn't feel that long and I suspect that you will be nodding in agreement most of the way through.
---
Whelp time to go killing again.......
---
Did you ever blow up megaton in FO3 for a swanky penthouse apartment?
---
Been fine for me.
---
&gt;For all we know there's a lag spike 
---
So, this is indeed a glitch of no damage, like we've all experienced.  That's what I believe causes these invulnerable freezes.  
---
&gt;Additionally, in the 17 seconds we see, we don't see other players.
---
Or it's a solo, and we know that 17 seconds does 0.00% damage.  Assuming that at 17.001 seconds a 0.1% visible tick would appear that means that this solo took 11  hours 43 minutes and 22 seconds to reach the point where they finally downed the SBQ and recorded this glitch.
---

Occam's razor, skepticism shouldn't mean "I think this guy's bad build required him to carry thousands of pounds of ammo and spend half a day making this gif"
---
Considering how most negative comments get downvoted, I think that speaks for itself. What I find funny, is how devoted people are at trying to convince others to hate the game as much as they do. That alone is bad taste. 
---
I'm now more tempted to buy the game.
---
Should probably finish Fallout 4 first though.
---
And you're still here why?
---
Yeah assholes will always be assholes for sure 
---
It involves 76 though?
---
I've wondered if the way some people play reflect their real personalities.... 
---
Nah, not my style. They seemed harmless. Felt who was I to say if they live or die, let the wasteland sort it out. 
---
Did you spell out something ironic with the bodies?
---
enjoying the game for what is it.. is the reward. at least for me. i dont consider this game grindy because i simply dont grind. all my friends fast travel to all these farming locations and im just like.. im gonna go that way and i wonder off. the bog is actually quiet interesting if you go from one end to another. same goes for the mire. 
---
When I killed an Albino Deathclaw after I had used Animal Friend on it.  In my defense, I had no idea pacification actually wore off. 😂
---
I dunno if you've watched the video posted here from MATN, or if you've seen his FO76 series, but he stopped playing once he did all of the content as far as I know. So what you're saying doesn't really apply here.
---
Yeeeeeah I should've waited. Definitely finding my place now lol. Spent my day off yesterday putting like 8 hours in. Loving it. Been playing solo, done a couple events with a little assistance from some likeminded players. Honestly I feel like it being online and gameplay continuing regardless of map or Pip-Boy usage makes it feel much more like a survival game than it used to. Obviously took the scrounger/scavenger perks for more ammo and such but there have been a couple times when I've come very close to dying and had to switch to a weapon I didn't have favorited and definitely felt tension like I haven't experienced in previous games. 
---
We don't have time for a handjob!
---
I almost always played the good guy first run through, whereas my wife was usually a murder-happy thief, lol.  Same thing with Elder Scroll games.
---
Glad you like it!! 
---
Oh yes, no doubt a lot of what he's suggesting would be impossible to implement now that the game is out and has a large playerbase. But maybe they can take ideas from it and implement them in ways that won't completely change the game as a whole.
---
Happy cake day OP. Keep grinding m8
---
I wish they would just copy code from ESO like they do other fallout games /s (sorta)
---
Had to make it long so the bot would not ban me
---
Unfortunately to do what you want you'll have to spend 7-8 perk points unless you get lucky with perk packs
---
Weird, I’ve played about 7 hours yesterday, and 5 or so today, no issues.  
---
I've gotten pretty outstanding plans from locks before (Gauss Rifle, Tesla Rifle, Pianos/Instruments) so I try to pick most every lock
---
I'm a sneak/sniper with shrouded wood armor, never used power armor. In radiation zones I use Prototype Hazmat suite.
---
Haha my brother was always the thief. I am the goody two shoes. 
---
This happens a few hours after a nuke, I believe -- the orange sky and rads disappear before the bloated ones revert back to feral ghouls (and the nuked flora revert back to flowers).
---
&gt;So, this is indeed a glitch of no damage, like we've all experienced. That's what I believe causes these invulnerable freezes.
---
I've def had damage get rubberbanded and then see it all stack at once. There's really nothing to support either theory. They're both just possibilities at this point.
---
The simple answer here is we don't have enough information to know what's happening. But if you want to over-interpret what 17 seconds is showing us, go right ahead. I'll wait until there's more info from OP.
---
Thank you LoneVaultWanderer :)
---
For me, it's the server that loses connection. I thought it was just my spotty Internet, but YouTube runs fine, so... Not sure why it disconnects every 30 minutes to an hour.
---
My Suggestion for scrapping weapons is to make it controlled rng , what I mean is when you scrap a weapon 3 choices for weapon mods pop up and you choose from those.
---
LUCKY!!!!!
---
I destroyed a base for the first time today testing out my new artillery was good fun :)
---
They're sucky players who are so pathetic they can't even kill ghouls. Bunch of fucking losers yeah push the build zone way the fuck back.
---
Wear ritual mask for increased chance of awesomeness.
---
Are those typos, or are you using acronyms I don't know?
---
Sounds good.
---
Get gud and you won't need the turrets. Seems everyone except the people not good enough to kill some ghouls hates them
---
Im just really tired. 
---
Go back and look at what they said about mods. Mod support would come roughly the same time as private servers, around November of this year.
---
They said it would be at least a year. 
---
This is actually what adds up the closest to the numbers i got, Thanks for the input.
---
they changed it 2 or 3 updates ago and i dont think anyone is sure why.  but anytime you go after a drop that you didnt summon it gives you wanted.  
---
its slight but if you see "steal" after picking now instead of "take." its the only warning you get now
---
I love watching people's photos, so having 100 photos was nice treat.  
---
I think everyone who has time should post their album too.  
---
I'll post mine because why the fork not.  
---
[Beta to Today's memories](https://imgur.com/gallery/1BUvZY0)  
---
if it landed in someone's camp or workshop it could claim them as the camp owner's property. 
---
&gt;!just a guess.!&lt;
---
No one will be playing this game for that long.
---
That's a damn good point.
---
It's possible they might want to put their CAMP in the same location but can't, as yours is already there. Then again, they could just be bored and rude. Or it could be all of the above. Either way, it's a jerk thing to do. Wish they'd just find another spot or something else to do.
---
If you are sniping from a long enough distance from a place you can kill everything that's already spawned in then trigger the respawn yourself 
---
Run the 3 Ws, Whitesprings, West Tek, and Watogs
---
I got the Chinese Sword plan from a random desk or something while exploring. I can't remember the specific location but I'm pretty sure it's all randomized, whether by loot or vendor selection. 
---
A little late to the party but glad you all liked the road map. \^\_\^ 
---
Some good points in the video (admittedly didn't watch the whole thing though).
---
While l understand that catering for solo players impacts the fun for multi/co-op, l wonder if the team could leverage the different game modes by adding a Solo/Story mode for those of us that just want to wander appalachia and explore. That way that could experiment with changes targeting different sections of the player base.
---
I have recently come back to FO76 and l can notice a real difference in its current state as a solo player. Quests are achievable as the enemies feel much better balanced.
---
Tbh your just not doing enough damage. If she's being scaled to 24 players like i believe she is, she has a total 1,220,000 hp. Which would mean 1% of her hp is 122,000. Its pretty hard to tell shes even taking damage because of this. Its literally only you there trying to damage her. 
---
I've failed twice and killed her once after the recent patch. I'm almost positive its just her with max health and its not a  "immortal bug". When we killed her we had 4-6 min/max'd melee hitting her and it was still taking us till the 5 minute mark to kill her. The hp bar barely moves even with my min/max melee character. 
---
Nobodies clearing her like pre-patch doing 5-10% a swing. Its like 0.25% per swing now. 
---
I really only do PA but I know some gun merchants. 
---
We were tempted to do that, maybe next time \^\_\^ 
---
Bethesda can you decrease the amount of budget space the turrets take up please I want to make my camp well defended and also can you increase the camps budget too that's all I want everything else is perfect thanks in advance.
---
Chinese sword and electrified both can drop from liberators and also from random events and treasure maps. No idea about deathclaw gauntlet though. 
---
Indeed!
---
Why are you replying to 2 month old thread?
---
My wife’s always been the “Don’t tell me what my character can and cannot do!” kind of gamer.  In Bioshock infinite she picked “option 3” and killed the announcer person rather than picking a side, so basically everyone was aggro to her the whole game!  In Skyrim she managed to mountain climb, on her horse, on the back side of the Throat of the World!  As in, found the graybeards at the end of the Trials, screwing with a lot of the scripting on the first major part of the MAIN QUEST, lol.
---
I’ll do you one more.  Your only remaining ammo are plasma cores, so you have to run back to that shack with the weapons bench and repair every few cores.  Oh, and this place is in the zone so you are taking rads the whole time you are trying to repair.
---
Bonus:  the queen got away that time.  
---
Spot on. I'm set to pacifist, so why in the world would my aim snap to nearby players?
